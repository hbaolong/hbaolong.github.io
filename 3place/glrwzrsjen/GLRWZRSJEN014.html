<h4 id="why-service-institutions-do-not-perform">12 Why Service
Institutions Do Not Perform</h4>
<p>The Three Popular Explanations—They Are Not Businesslike—They Need
Better Men—Results Are Intangible—All Three Are Alibis Rather Than
Explanations—What Makes the Service Institution Different—Misdirection
by Budget—What Performance and Results Mean in the Budget-Based
Institution or Staff—Earning One’s Way versus Deserving It</p>
<p>There are three popular explanations for the common failure of
service institutions to perform:</p>
<p>• their managers aren’t businesslike;</p>
<p>• they need better men;</p>
<p>• their objectives and results are intangible.</p>
<p>All three are alibis rather than explanations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The service institution will perform, it is said again and again, if
only it is managed in a businesslike manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Colbert, the great minister of Louis XIV, first blamed the
performance difficulties of the non-business, the service institution,
on this lack of businesslike management. Colbert, who created the first
modern public service in the West, never ceased to exhort his officials
to be businesslike. The cry is still repeated every day—by chambers of
commerce, by presidential and royal commissions, by ministers in the
communist countries, and so on. If only, they all say, their
administrators were to behave like businessmen, service institutions
would perform. This belief underlies today’s management boom in the
service institutions. It is the wrong diagnosis, and being businesslike
is the wrong prescription for the ills of the service institution.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is need for efficiency in all institutions. Because
there is usually no competition in the service field, there is no
outward and imposed cost control on service institutions as there is for
business in a competitive (and even an oligopolistic) market. But the
basic problem of service institutions is not high cost but lack of
effectiveness. They may be very efficient—some are. But they tend not to
do the right things.</p>
<p>The belief that the service institution will perform if only it is
put on a businesslike basis underlies the many attempts to set up such
services as separate public corporations—again an attempt that dates
back to Colbert and his establishment of crown monopolies (the so-called
Régies). There may be beneficial side effects such as freedom</p>
<p>from petty civil-service regulation. But the intended main effect,
performance, is seldom achieved. Costs may go down (though not always;
setting up London Transport and the British Post Office as separate
businesslike corporations, and thereby highly vulnerable to labor-union
pressures, has, for instance, led to skyrocketing costs). Services
essential to the fulfillment of the institution’s purpose may be
slighted or lopped off in the name of efficiency.</p>
<p>The best and worst example of the businesslike approach in the
public-service institution may well be the Port of New York Authority,
set up in the twenties to manage automobile and truck traffic throughout
the two-state area (New York and New Jersey) of the Port of New York.
The Port Authority has from the beginning been businesslike with a will.
The engineering of its bridges, tunnels, docks, silos, and, later on,
airports, has been outstanding. Its construction costs have been low and
under control. Its financial standing is extremely high so that it could
always borrow at most advantageous rates of interest. Being
businesslike—as measured above all, by its standing with the banks—is
its goal and purpose. It did not concern itself with transportation
policy in the New York metropolitan area even though its bridges,
tunnels, and airports generate much of the traffic on New York’s
streets. It did not ask, “Who are our constituents?” Instead it resisted
any such question as political and unbusinesslike. In the end it has
come to be seen as the villain of the New York traffic and
transportation problem. When the Port Authority needed help, e.g., in
finding a place for New York’s badly needed fourth airport, it found
itself without a single supporter, except the bankers. Consequently, the
Port Authority may well become politicized—denuded of its efficiency
without gaining anything in effectiveness.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The cry for better people is probably even older than Colbert. It
can be found in the earliest Chinese texts on government. It has been
the constant demand of all American reformers, from Henry Adams, shortly
after the Civil War, to Ralph Nader today. They all have believed that
the one thing lacking in the government agency, is better people.</li>
</ol>
<p>Service institutions can no more than businesses depend on supermen
or lion tamers to staff their managerial and executive positions. There
are far too many institutions to be staffed. It is absurd to expect that
the administrator of every hospital in the world be a genius or even a
great man. If service institutions cannot be run and managed by men of
normal and fairly low endowment; if, in other words, we cannot organize
the task—so that it will be done adequately by men who only try hard; it
cannot be done at all.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the people who staff the
managerial and professional positions in our service institutions are
any less qualified, any less competent or honest, or any less
hard-working than the men who manage businesses. Conversely, there is no
reason to believe that business managers, put in control of service
institutions, would do better than the “bureaucrats.” Indeed, we know
that they immediately become bureaucrats themselves.</p>
<p>In World War II large numbers of American business executives who had
performed very well in their own companies moved into government
positions. Many rapidly became bureaucrats; the men did not change, but
whereas they had been capable of obtaining performance and results in a
business, in government they found themselves primarily producing
procedures and red tape—and deeply frustrated.</p>
<p>An even better proof that there is little to the argument that what
the service institutions need are better people is the French government
service. No other government service can draw on a similar elite for its
senior positions. Positions of influence and importance in the French
government service are reserved for the brilliant graduates of France’s
most prestigious school, the École Polytechnique. Yet few government
services are as ineffectual and as bureaucratic as the French, despite
the brilliant polytechniciens who run them. The fonctionnaire, the
government employee who runs his office to suit his convenience, is the
butt of the most bitter French jokes—and deservedly so, as anyone who
has ever tried to get a French government service to perform knows only
too well. Yet the polytechniciens themselves do not become bureaucrats.
Twenty years after they have entered government service, when they have
risen to the top, most of them traditionally</p>
<p>move over into the top positions in the major French companies and
prove themselves, as a rule, capable of high performance.</p>
<p>The polytechnicien may not be to everybody’s liking. He tends, in the
manner of scholastic elites, to be intellectually arrogant, somewhat
narrow, and rather smug. Yet, the problem of the French government
service is surely not the lack of good men, nor is anything likely to
happen by bringing in better men. The fault is in the system and not in
the men.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The most sophisticated and, at first glance, the most plausible
explanation for the nonperformance of service institutions is the last
one: the objectives of service institutions are “intangible” and so are
their results. This is at best a half-truth.</li>
</ol>
<p>The definition of what “our business is” is always intangible, for a
business as well as for a service institution. To say, as Sears, Roebuck
does, “Our business is to be the informed buyer for the American family”
is intangible. To say, as Marks andandandand Spencer did, “Our business
is to subvert the British class system” is surely not tangible. To say,
as Vail did at Bell Telephone, “Our business is service to the customer”
may sound like pious platitude. At first glance these statements would
seem to defy any attempt at translation into operational, let alone into
quantitative, terms. To say, “Our business is electronic information,”
as Sony of Japan does, is equally intangible, as is IBM’s definition of
its business as data processing. Yet as these businesses have shown, it
is not too difficult to derive from such intangible definitions concrete
and measurable goals and targets.</p>
<p>“Saving souls” as the definition of the objectives of a church is
intangible. At least the bookkeeping is not of this world. But church
attendance is measurable. And so is “getting the young people back into
the church.”</p>
<p>“The development of the whole personality” as the objective of the
school is, indeed, intangible. But “teaching a child to read by the time
he has finished third grade” is by no means intangible and can be
measured easily and with considerable precision.</p>
<p>“To abolish racial discrimination” is equally difficult of clear
operational definition, let alone of measurement. But to increase the
number of Black apprentices in the building trades is a quantifiable
goal, the attainment or non-attainment of which can be measured.</p>
<p>“Economic and social development of an underdeveloped nation” is
intangible. But, “creating 100,000 jobs in five years” or “building
40,000 housing units a year” is tangible indeed.</p>
<p>Achievement is never possible except against specific, limited,
clearly defined targets, in business as well as in a service
institution. Only if targets are defined can resources be allocated to
their attainment, priorities and, deadlines set, and somebody be held
accountable for results. But the starting point for effective work is a
definition of the purpose and mission of the institution, which is
almost always intangible.</p>
<p>“What is our business?” is as ambiguous and as controversial a
question for a business as it is for a service institution. As has been
said earlier, there has to be dissent and controversy before a viable
definition is found. Service institutions have a great many
constituents. The school is of vital concern not only to children and
their parents, but to teachers, to taxpayers, to the community at large.
Similarly the hospital has to satisfy the patient, but also the doctors,
the nurses, the technicians, the patient’s family—and again taxpayers
or, as in the United States, employers and labor unions who together
provide the bulk of the support of most hospitals through their
insurance contributions. But business also has a plurality of
constituencies. Every business, as said before, has at least two
different customers, and often a good many more. And employees,
investors, and the community at large—and management itself—are also
constituencies.</p>
<p>Misdirection by Budget</p>
<p>The one basic difference between a service institution and a business
is the way the service institution is paid.</p>
<p>Businesses (other than monopolies) are paid for satisfying the
customer. They are paid only when they produce what the customer wants
and what he is willing to exchange his</p>
<p>purchasing power for. Satisfaction of the customer is, therefore, the
basis for assuring performance and results in a business.</p>
<p>Service institutions, by contrast, are typically paid out of a budget
allocation. This means that they are not paid for what taxpayer and
customer mean by results and performance. Their revenues are allocated
from a general revenue stream which is not tied to what they are doing
but obtained by tax, levy, or tribute.</p>
<p>This is as true for the service institution within a business as it
is, for instance, for the public school. The typical staff department is
not being paid for its results. It is, as a rule, not even paid
according to the extent to which its customers, that is, the managers,
use it. It is being paid—in many cases inevitably so—out of an overhead
allocation, that is, out of a budget. The fact that the service
institution within a business tends to exhibit the same characteristics
and to indulge in the same behavior as service institutions in the
public sector indicates that it is not business that makes the
difference. It is the mode of payment.</p>
<p>The typical service institution—including most service staffs in
business—are furthermore endowed with monopoly powers. The intended
beneficiary has no choice. Most service institutions have power beyond
what the most monopolistic business enjoys.</p>
<p>If I am dissatisfied with the service of the local power company or
of the telephone company, I have no other place to go to for electric
power or telephone service. But if I choose to do without either power
or telephone, I do not have to pay for it; and one can still survive as
an individual without either—though this freedom is increasingly
theoretical rather than practical. This choice is not true, however, of
most service institutions. There the customer pays whether he wants to
use the service or not. Behind the service institution stands the police
power of the state, which exacts payment, not for services rendered but
for the support of a governmental agency.</p>
<p>Most service staffs in business have coercive monopoly power too.
Operating managers know that they are largely being judged by how well
they cooperate with the staff services; and only rarely are they
permitted to go elsewhere than their own company’s staff service for
advice or expertise in the staff service’s area.</p>
<p>The American household pays school taxes whether it has children of
School age or not. Parents may choose to send their children to a
private or a parochial school but they still pay taxes for the public
school, even though they do not use it and consider it inappropriate or
unsatisfactory for their own children.</p>
<p>Being paid out of a budget allocation changes what is meant by
performance, or results. Results in the budget-based institution mean a
larger budget. Performance is the ability to maintain or to increase
one’s budget. Results, as the term is commonly understood, that is,
contributions to the market or achievement toward goal and objectives,
are, in effect, secondary. The first test of a budget-based institution
and the first requirement for its survival is to obtain the budget. And
the budget is not, by definition, related to contribution but to good
intentions.</p>
<p>When Efficiency Is a Sin</p>
<p>Efficiency and cost control, however much they are being preached,
are not really considered virtues in the budget-based institution. The
importance of a budget-based institution is measured essentially by the
size of its budget and the size of its staff. To achieve results with a
smaller budget or a smaller staff is, therefore, not performance. It
might actually endanger the institution. Not to spend the budget to the
hilt will only convince the budget maker—whether legislature or the
budget committee of a company—that the budget for the next fiscal period
can, safely be cut.</p>
<p>Thirty or forty years ago it was considered characteristic of Russian
planning, and one of its major weaknesses, that Soviet managers, toward
the end of the plan period, engaged in a frantic effort to spend all the
money allocated to them, which usually resulted in total waste. Today
the disease has become universal as budget-based institutions have
become dominant everywhere. End-of-year pressure on the executive of a
budget-based institution</p>
<p>certainly accounts for a good deal of the waste in the American
defense effort. And “buying-in,” that is, getting approval for a new
program or project by grossly underestimating its total cost, is also
built into the budget-based institution.</p>
<p>“Parkinson’s Law” lampooned the British Admiralty and the British
Colonial Office for increasing their staffs and their budgets as fast as
their work and role were shrinking, that is, as fast as the British Navy
and the British Empire went down. Parkinson’s Law attributed this to
inborn human perversity. But it is perfectly natural behavior for
someone on a budget. It is the budget, after all, that measures
performance and importance.</p>
<p>It is not compatible with efficiency for the acid test of performance
to be obtaining the budget; that as a consequence, administrators are
subtly discouraged from trying to do the job cheaply and efficiently,
and are, indeed, likely to be penalized for doing so; and that they are
forever encouraged to “buy in.” Yet these are the consequences of being
budgetbased.</p>
<p>But effectiveness is even more endangered by reliance on the budget
allocation. It makes it dangerous to raise the question what the
business of the institution should be. The question is always
controversial; but controversy is likely to alienate support and will,
therefore, be shunned by the budget-based institution. At best the
institution will achieve effectiveness by deceiving the public and
itself.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, for instance, has never been
willing to ask whether its goal should be farm productivity or support
of the small family farm. It has known for decades that these two
objectives are not identical as had originally been assumed, and that
they are becoming increasingly incompatible. To admit this, however,
would have created controversy that might have endangered the
Department’s budget. As a result, American farm policy has frittered
away an enormous amount of money and human resources on what can only
(and charitably) be called a public relations campaign, that is, on a
show of support for the small family farmer. Its effective activities,
however—and they have been very effective indeed—have been directed
toward eliminating the small family farmer and replacing him by the far
more productive “agrobusinesses,” that is, large, highly capitalized and
highly mechanized farms, run as businesses and not as a “way of life.”
This emphasis may have been right, but it was not what the Department
was founded to do, nor what the legislators, in approving the
Departments budget, expected it to do.</p>
<p>The farm policy of the Common Market today faces the same
dilemma—and, again, tries to obscure it by substituting money for
policy, and public relations for performance.</p>
<p>The American community hospital is not governmental but private,
though nonprofit.</p>
<p>Yet, like hospitals everywhere, it presents the same confusion of
missions and objectives, with the resulting impairment of effectiveness
and performance.</p>
<p>Should a hospital be, in effect, a physician’s plant facility—as most
older American physicians maintain? Should it be a community health
center? Should it focus on the major health needs of a community or try
to do everything and be abreast of every medical advance, no matter how
costly and, how rarely used the facility will be? Should it focus on
preventive medicine and on health education for the community? Or should
it concentrate on the repair of health damage that has already been
done?</p>
<p>Every one of these definitions of the business of the hospital can be
defended. Every one deserves a hearing. The effective hospital will
certainly be a multipurpose institution and strike a balance between
various objectives. What most hospitals do, however, is pretend that
there are no basic questions to be decided. The result, predictably, is
confusion and impairment of the capacity of the hospital to serve any
function and to carry out any mission.</p>
<p>A service organization within a business has the same tendency to
avoid controversy over function, mission, and objectives.</p>
<p>Is it the first function of the personnel department to obtain the
most effective utilization of the company’s human resources? Or is the
personnel department a welfare department and babysitter? Is the purpose
of the personnel department to make employees accept the policies,
rules, and regulations of the company? Or is the purpose to help de-</p>
<p>velop the organization structure and job structure that make sense
for the employee and will enable him to develop and achieve? All these
are legitimate definitions of the personnel job. Each could be the
foundation for a truly effective personnel department. But practically
no personnel department I know will face up to these questions. They are
controversial. As a result, the personnel department says different
things to different constituents. It is likely to end up ineffectual and
frustrated.*</p>
<p>Being dependent on a budget allocation militates against setting
priorities and concentrating efforts, yet nothing is ever accomplished
unless scarce resources are concentrated on a small number of
priorities.</p>
<p>A shoe manufacturer who has 22 percent of the market for work shoes
may have a profitable business. If he succeeds in raising his market
share to 30 percent, especially if the market for his kind of footwear
is expanding, he is doing very well indeed. He need not concern himself
too much with the 70 percent of the users of work shoes who buy from
somebody else. And the customers for ladies’ fashion shoes are of no
concern to him at all.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the situation of an institution on a budget. To
obtain its budget, it needs the approval, or at least the acquiescence,
of practically everybody who remotely could be considered a constituent.
Where a market share of 22 percent might be perfectly satisfactory to a
business, a rejection by 78 percent of the constituents—or even a much
smaller proportion—would be absolutely fatal to a budget-based
institution. It might survive if 22 percent of its constituents do not
actively support it. But it certainly would consider itself in serious
danger if it could not get a larger base of support, or at least of
acquiescence. And this means that the service institution cannot
concentrate; it must instead try to placate everyone.</p>
<p>An extreme case is the police department in the large American city.
It knows what its priorities should be. In the residential neighborhood,
for instance, the first priority might be safety on the streets. This is
an attainable goal—what is needed primarily is an increase in the number
of policemen on patrol. In the slums of the inner city, the first
priority would probably be safety in the home, that is, protection
against rape, burglary, and theft. This is a much more difficult
objective to attain, especially in crowded tenements, with their large
numbers of drug addicts desperate for money, though measurable progress
toward the goal can be made. But there is the old lady who phones in
that a cat is caught in a tree outside her home. There is the
respectable householder who has locked himself out and wants the police
to open his door for him. There is the householder who complains about
the noisy party next door, and so on. Every desk sergeant who answers
such calls knows that he should say, “We are public servants, not
private servants,” but this answer is never given. The old lady, after
all, would immediately telephone her councilman and complain that she, a
taxpayer, does not even receive courteous treatment from the police. As
a result, every police force in the country, while it knows what the
priorities should be and where it should concentrate its slender
resources, splinters itself indeed, it may have no choice. This means,
however, that there is neither safety on the streets in the residential
suburb nor safety in the home in the slums.</p>
<p>Finally, being budget-based makes it even more difficult to abandon
the wrong things, the old, the obsolete. As a result, service
institutions are even more encrusted than businesses with the barnacles
of inherently unproductive efforts.</p>
<p>No institution likes to abandon anything it does. Business is no
exception. In an institution that is being paid for its performance and
results and that stands, therefore, under a performance test, the
unproductive, the obsolete, will sooner or later be killed off by the
customers. In a budget-based institution no such discipline is being
enforced. On the contrary, what such an institution does is always
virtuous and likely to be considered in the public interest.</p>
<p>The temptation is great, therefore, to respond to lack of results by
redoubling efforts.</p>
<p>The temptation is great to double the budget, precisely because there
is no performance.</p>
<p>*On this see Chapter 23.</p>
<p>The temptation, above all, is to blame the outside world for its
stupidity or its reactionary resistance, and to consider lack of results
a proof of one’s own righteousness and a reason in itself for keeping on
with the good work.</p>
<p>The tendency to perpetuate the unproductive is by no means confined
to service institutions in the public sector. It is just as common in
staff services within today’s large business enterprise. The
organization planner, the computer specialist, or the operations
researcher all tend to argue that the resistance of operating managers
to their wares is prima facie evidence of the need for their services
and reason for doubling the “missionary effort.” Sometimes this argument
is, of course, valid. But more often than not it makes impossible
concentration of efforts on the areas where performance and results are
both needed and attainable.</p>
<p>All service institutions are threatened by the tendencies to cling to
yesterday rather than to slough it off, and to put their best and ablest
people on defending what no longer makes sense or serves a purpose.
Government is particularly prone to this disease.*</p>
<p>Underlying traditional political theory is the axiom that the
functions of government are eternal. There is an implicit belief, held
almost with the strength of dogma, that whatever government does is for
all times. Yet government is a human activity. Everything human beings
do, except their biological and spiritual functions, obsoletes sooner or
later. The proper rule for government today as for all other
institutions, is not, “Whatever we do we’ll do forever”; the proper rule
is, “Whatever we do today will in all likelihood be a candidate for
abandonment within a fairly short period of years.”</p>
<p>Earned or Deserved Revenue</p>
<p>Human beings will behave as they are being rewarded—whether the
reward is money and promotion, a medal, the autographed picture of the
boss, or a pat on the back. This is the one lesson the behavioral
psychologist has taught us during the last fifty years (not that it was
unknown before). A business or any institution which is paid for its
results and performance in such a way that the dissatisfied or
disinterested customer need not pay has to earn its income. An
institution which is financed by a budget—or which enjoys a monopoly
which the customer cannot escape—is rewarded for what it deserves rather
than for what it earns. It is paid for good intentions and for
“programs.” It is paid for not alienating important constituents rather
than for satisfying any one group. It is misdirected by the way it is
being paid into defining performance and results as what will produce
the budget rather than as what will produce contribution.</p>
<p>This is an inherent characteristic of the budget-based institution.
Amazingly enough, it has escaped the attention of the economists—perhaps
because so few of them seem to be aware of the fact that upwards of 50
percent of the gross national product these days does not go to
businesses, that is, to institutions paid for performance but rather to
service institutions paid for promises or, at best, for efforts.</p>
<p>Being based on a budget is not necessarily bad or even undesirable.
Self-supporting armies, for instance, such as the armies of the
fifteenth century or the traditional armies of the Chinese warlords, had
forever to engage in warfare, terrorize the citizens of their own
nation, and depend on looting and raping for their support. Such armies
can never be instruments of policy. Civilian control and defense budgets
paid out of taxes were instituted precisely to stop free enterprise in
warfare.</p>
<p>Similarly, most service staffs in business will have to be on a
budget allocation. It is the only desirable basis for a research
laboratory. To pay a research laboratory for results, for instance, in
the form of a royalty on the sales of the new products and processes it
produces (as has been tried in several businesses) is almost certain to
misdirect the research laboratory even more than the budget allocation
does. It is likely to deflect resources from research into gadgetry. But
there is also no question that budget allocation induces research
directors to inflate the research staff, to come up with an impossible
list</p>
<p>*See on this my book, The Age of Discontinuity (1969), especially
Chapter 6, “The Sickness of Government.”</p>
<p>of projects, and to hang on to projects which are unlikely to produce
results or which have proven unproductive. However necessary or even
desirable, being paid out of a budget allocation misdirects. So does
being paid for efforts—as are hospitals or universities— that is, for
costs rather than for results.) In many, perhaps in most cases, this
cannot be eliminated. But it can be limited, counteracted, and, in large
measure, even offset.</p>
