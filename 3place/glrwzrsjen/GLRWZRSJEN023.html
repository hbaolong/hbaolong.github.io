<h4 id="the-responsible-worker">21 The Responsible Worker</h4>
<p>Focus on the Job—The Prerequisites of Responsibility—The Fallacy of
“Creativity” —Feedback Information for Self-Control—Continuous
Learning—Planning and Do- ing—The Worker as a “Resource” in “Planning”
—The Need for Clear Authority— Responsibility for Job and Work
Group—Assembly Line and Job Enrichment— Worker Responsibility and the
“New Breeds”—The “Rejected”—The “Pre- Industrials”—The Knowledge
Workers—Saving the Supervisor—Plant and Office as Communities—And as
Power Structures—The Needs and Limits of Governance—The Need for
Leadership Opportunities—Work-Community Activities—The Self- Governing
Work Community—From “My Workers” to “Fellow Employees” to “Fel- low
Managers”</p>
<p>What does the worker—unskilled or skilled, manual, clerical, or
knowledge worker— need to be able to take the burden of responsibility?
What tools does he require? What incentives? What security? And what do
manager and enterprise have to do to be able to ask the worker to take
responsibility and to expect him to respond to this demand?</p>
<p>The focus has to be on the job. The job has to make achievement
possible. The job is not everything; but it comes first. If other
aspects of working are unsatisfactory, they can spoil even the most
achieving job—just as a poor sauce can spoil the taste even of the best
meat. But if the job itself is not achieving, nothing else will provide
achievement.</p>
<p>This may be childishly obvious, but the major approaches to managing
the worker, throughout history, have focused on elements external to the
job.</p>
<p>Marxists, for example, focus on ownership but have, by and large,
left unchanged the structure of jobs and the traditional practices of
managing workers. Paternalism focuses on welfare, i.e., on things like
housing and health care—very important, to be sure, but not substitutes
for job achievement. More recent solutions such as the
“co-determination” which the German labor unions are pushing put union
representatives on the board of directors and into top management but do
not concern themselves with the worker’s job itself.</p>
<p>The fundamental reality for every worker, from sweeper to executive
vice president, is the eight hours or so he spends on the job. In our
society of organizations, it is the job through which the great majority
has access to achievement, to fulfillment, and to com- munity.</p>
<p>To enable the worker to achieve, he must therefore first be able to
take responsibility for his job.</p>
<p>This requires: (1) productive work; (2) feedback information; and (3)
continuous learning.</p>
<p>It is folly to ask workers to take responsibility for their job when
the work has not been studied, the process has not been synthesized, the
standards and controls have not been thought through, and the physical
information tools have not been designed. It is also managerial
incompetence.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of Creativity</p>
<p>This goes counter to the old—and continually revived—slogan of the
individual’s creativ- ity. “Free people from restraint and they will
come up with far better, far more advanced, far more productive answers
than the experts,” is an old belief. It was popular long before the
eighteenth century, though it was then given its classical formulation
by Rousseau. But there is no evidence to support it. Everything we know
indicates that creativity can become effective only if the basic tools
are given. Everything we know also indicates that the proper structure
of work of any work—is not intuitively obvious.</p>
<p>People have shoveled sand for untold centuries. Most of the time, one
can assume, nobody told them how to do it. If making work productive
depended on the creativity of people, they would undoubtedly have found
the best way of doing the job before the dawn of history. Yet when
Taylor first looked at the job in 1885, he found everything wrong. The
size and shape of the shovel were unsuited to the job. The length of the
handle was wrong. The amount of sand the shoveler lifted in the
operation was the wrong amount, was indeed the amount most calculated to
tire him and do him physical harm. The con- tainers were the wrong shape
the wrong size and in the wrong position and so on.</p>
<p>The same thing held for the work of the physician through the ages.
The nineteenth- century differential diagnosis, i.e., the systematic
analysis of the work of the physician, organized the work differently
from the way in which countless practitioners of high intel- ligence,
high skill, and considerable education had done it “intuitively” through
the ages.</p>
<p>The best proof that creativity is no substitute for analysis and
knowledge are the ex- periences of those enterprises which were
expropriated by governments with the profes- sionals either expelled or
leaving. Among them is the Mexican takeover of the petroleum industry in
the 1930s, the Iranian takeover of the big oil refinery in Abadan under
Premier Mossadegh, the expropriation of the Bolivian tin mines, and the
expropriation of the Chilean copper mines and copper smelters. Every one
of these moves was wildly popular among the workers of these
enterprises. Every one released a flood tide of enthusiasm. But as soon
as the managers, professionals, and technicians departed or were thrown
out, productivity collapsed and was not restored until managers and
professionals returned.</p>
<p>Feedback Information for Self-Control</p>
<p>The second prerequisite for worker responsibility is feedback
information on his own performance. Responsibility requires
self-control. That in turn requires continuous infor- mation on
performance against standards.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of interest lately in the application of
“behavior modifica- tion” to work. In particular there has been great
interest in the approach worked out by a major air freight forwarder,
Emery Air Freight, which found out that workers on all levels will
manage their own performance if only they are being informed immediately
what their performance actually is. Actually we have known this for many
years.</p>
<p>Zeiss, as has been said before, built in feedback information almost
a hundred years ago. IBM did so forty years ago. The Japanese continuous
learning session is a way to provide feedback information. Modern
medical practice was founded 150 years ago de- signing a feedback from
autopsy results to diagnosis.</p>
<p>We also know that people can control and correct performance if given
the informa- tion, even if neither they nor the supplier of information
truly understand what has to be done or how. This applies even to
processes that are, by definition, “uncontrollable,” such as a great
many processes in the human body, e.g., heartbeat, brain waves, or
asthma at- tacks. Visual feedback which enables an asthmatic child to
see on a control panel infor- mation on the constriction of blood
vessels and muscles in his throat does not tell the child what to do.
Indeed, no one knows. Yet if the child knows that the needle which de-
picts graphically the state of the blood vessels and muscles should stay
in the center of the panel, he can, in many cases, abort an asthma
attack.</p>
<p>Few work processes are as inaccessible to analysis as brain waves or
asthma attacks, yet in a good many we still cannot exactly know the
process. The worker himself, given the information, can control his own
work and output.</p>
<p>Emery Air Freight had conducted industrial engineering studies for
many years. Yet management did not really know what an individual truck
driver would have to do to make the largest possible number of calls on
his route. The drivers, however, without ana- lyzing driving time or
length of a call, could in practically every case control their own
schedule and raise the number of calls significantly once they knew how
many calls they actually made as against the numbers they had planned to
make.</p>
<p>This approach applies even to such advanced knowledge work as
research. Feedback in research does not mean a daily report as in the
case of truck drivers. Rather it means sitting down with the research
scientists several times a year and saying, “Here are the things of
significance this research group has contributed to the company during
the last six and twelve months. And here are the impacts earlier
research work has had on the company’s performance during the last six
and twelve months.”</p>
<p>The information the worker needs must satisfy the requirements of
effective informa- tion (see Chapter 18). It must be timely. It must be
relevant. It must be operational. It must focus on his job. Above all,
it must be his tool. Its purpose must be self-control rather than
control of others, let alone manipulation.</p>
<p>The real strength of feedback information—and the major reinforcer—is
clearly that the information is the tool of the worker for measuring and
directing himself. The worker does not need praise or reproach to know
how he is doing. He knows.</p>
<p>Continuous Learning</p>
<p>The third requirement for achievement in work and for a responsible
worker is continuous learning.</p>
<p>There is need for workers, whether unskilled, skilled, or knowledge
worker, to be trained for new skills. Continuous learning does not
replace training. It has different aims and satisfies different needs.
Above all, it satisfies the need of the employee to contribute what he
himself has learned to the improvement of his own performance, to the
improve- ment of his fellow worker’s performance, and to a better, more
efiective, but also more rational way of working.</p>
<p>It is also the one way to come to grips with two basic problems: the
resistance of workers to innovation, and the danger that workers will
become “obsolete.”</p>
<p>“Engineers become obsolete within ten years,” we are now being told.
If indeed true, it is a severe indictment of the employer. An engineer
who starts with the proper founda- tion of knowledge for his work has no
business becoming obsolete. The continuing im- provement of his own
skill and knowledge at his own job should be built into his daily
work.</p>
<p>Continuous learning need not be organized as a formal session the way
it is tradition- ally done in Japan. But it always needs to be
organized. There is need for the continuing challenge to the worker:
“What have you learned that can make your job and the job of all of us
more productive, more performing, and more achieving? What do you need
by way of knowledge, by way of tools, by way of information? And how do
we best prepare our- selves for new needs, new methods, new performance
capacities?”</p>
<p>Continuous training is as appropriate to clerical work as it is in
manual work. It is of particular importance in knowledge work. The very
fact that knowledge work, to be effec- tive, has to be specialized
creates a need for continuous exposure to the experiences, the problems,
the needs of others, and in turn, for continuous contribution of
knowledge and information to others. Whether the knowledge work be
accounting or market research, planning or chemical engineering, the
work group has to be seen and has to see itself as a learning group.</p>
<p>Planning and Doing</p>
<p>These three prerequisites, (1) productive work, (2) feedback
information, and (3) con- tinuous learning, are, so to speak, the
planning for worker responsibility for job, work group, and output. They
are therefore management responsibilities and management tasks. But they
are not “management prerogatives,” i.e., things management does alone,
by it- self, and unilaterally. Management does indeed have to do the
work and make the deci- sions. But in all these areas the worker
himself, from the beginning, needs to be integrated as a “resource” into
the planning process. From the beginning he has to share in thinking
through work and process, tools and information. His knowledge, his
experience, his needs are resource to the planning process. The worker
needs to be a partner in it. Every attempt should be made to make
accessible to the worker the necessary knowledge. He need not become an
industrial engineer or a process designer, but the fundamentals of
industrial engineering and their application to a man’s own job and work
can be grasped by almost anyone without great difficulty.</p>
<p>One of the first attempts—and one of the most successful ones—to make
workers a resource in making work productive was (as mentioned earlier)
“work simplification.” One of Taylor’s disciples, Allan Mogensen, ran
this program for many years, from the twenties to the forties, at Lake
Placid, New York. Mogensen’s thesis was that scientific management would
be successful if supervisors understood its principles, could apply them
themselves, and could teach them to their own workers. What was needed,
Mogen- sen argued, was for scientific management to become a simple,
everyday, comfortable tool of the working group itself. He showed that
unschooled people who, however, knew what working was, could obtain
results as good as those of the most highly trained indus- trial
engineer.</p>
<p>There is no reason why work simplification has to be taught at a
special institute and away from the work place. In Japanese industry,
beginning with the first application of scientific management in the
1920s by such companies as Sumitomo Electric and Mitsu- bishi Electric,
supervisors and workers have learned the principles of industrial
engineer- ing as a matter of course in the continuous-training
sessions.</p>
<p>Worker responsibility for job, work groups, and output cannot he
expected, let alone demanded, until the foundations of productive work,
feedback information, and continu- ous learning have been established.
Worker participation in assigning these foundations should be brought
into play from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Creativity, if by that is meant undirected, unstructured, untutored,
and uncontrolled guessing, is not likely to produce results. But a
system which does not tap and put to use the knowledge, experience,
resources, and imagination of the people who have to live with the
system and make it work is as unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>This is not seen generally, largely because of a confusion of
planning and doing with planner and doer. It was Taylor who first
enunciated as a principle that planning and do- ing are different.
Taylor saw that planning won’t get done if it is mixed in with doing.
Long before Taylor, however, the designers of the German General Staff
in the early nineteenth century had set up planning as a separate
task.</p>
<p>The two are separate activities, like reading and writing, and
require different methods and different approaches. But planner and
doer, like reader and writer, need to be united in the same person. They
cannot be divorced—or else the planning will cease to be effec- tive and
will indeed become a threat to performance.</p>
<p>The planner is needed to supply the doer with direction and
measurements, with the tools of analysis and synthesis, with
methodology, and with standards. He is needed also to make sure that the
planning of one group is compatible with the planning of the others. But
in turn, the planner needs the doer as his resource and as his feedback
control. And unless the planner knows what the doer does and needs, his
planning, while theoretically perfect, may never become execution.
Conversely, unless the doer understands what the planner tries to
accomplish, the doer will not perform or will try to resist performance
specifications that to him seem unreasonable, arbitrary, or just plain
silly.</p>
<p>And the less capable the planner is of analyzing the work and its
individual opera- tions, the more does he depend on the doer. In
knowledge work, above all, the doer has to take a responsible part in
the planning process for it to be etfective at all.</p>
<p>But still, the foundations for worker responsibility are planning and
are therefore managerial responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Need for Clear Authority</p>
<p>One more thing is needed to make responsibility acceptable to the
worker: he needs to have the security of a clear authority structure. He
has to know what areas and decisions are beyond his power and beyond his
purview and therefore reserved for a different or a higher authority.
Management has to work out what the task is, what the objectives are,
what the standards are. Again, the doers should be used as a source of
information. But the job is management’s.</p>
<p>Also, organization stands under the threat of the “common peril.”
There is always the chance of an emergency situation which has not been
anticipated and for which there are no rules. The common peril may be
physical—in business it will more often be economic. Whatever its
nature, one man has to make the decision in such a situation, and fast,
or everybody is endangered. Who this man is has to be known in advance,
or there is chaos. And this man has to be able to say, “This needs to be
done; you do it; this way.” The sur- vival of the group depends on his
unquestioned authority. Without it no one in the work group can feel
secure.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Job and Work Groups</p>
<p>The layout of individual jobs to do the work and to meet its
standards, and the design, structure, and relationship of the work group
in which these jobs are integrated into a community, are and should be
the responsibility of workers and work group. They need professional
help. They need knowledge, experience, and teaching from their
supervisor. They need advice and service from the industrial engineer
and from many other techni- cians and professionals. Management must
retain a veto power, and will often exercise it. But the responsibility
for job design and work-group design belongs to those who are
responsible for output and performance. And that is the worker and the
work group.</p>
<p>Worker responsibility for job and group will vary greatly with the
kind of work to be done, with the educational, skill, and knowledge
level of the work force, and with cultures and traditions. It will
certainly look very different when the workers are research scientists
rather than hard-core unemployables from the black ghetto or guest
workers in German industry from the hill farms of eastern Anatolia.</p>
<p>But the principles are the same: the worker and his group are
responsible for, their own jobs and for the relationships between
individual jobs. They are responsible for thinking through how the work
is to be done. They are responsible for meeting perform- ance goals and
for quality as well as for quantity. And they are responsible for
improving work, job, tools and processes, and their own skills.</p>
<p>These are exacting demands. Yet whenever we have made them, they have
been met—provided that the planning had been done. Indeed in most
cases—IBM is the typical example—workers will set higher performance
goals than the industrial engineer and will tend to outdo their own
goals.</p>
<p>The reason is not that work has become fun—nor should it. It is not
just motivation, though psychological factors undoubtedly play an
important part. In large measure, worker responsibility for job design
and work-group design are effective because they make use of the
worker’s knowledge and experience in the one area where he is the ex-
pert.</p>
<p>To expect worker creativity in making work productive is, as said
earlier, sentimental twaddle. But it is realistic to expect knowledge
and expertise with respect to the worker’s own job, that is, in putting
conceptual and physical tools into use and performance. Here the worker
is the only expert. For a job is a configuration. It defies analysis.
But it is eas-</p>
<p>ily accessible to perception. Particularly if feedback information is
provided, the individ- ual can normally work out his own optimal job
design fairly fast and fairly effectively.</p>
<p>For the design of the work group, responsibility on the part of the
members is even more important. We now know* that the work itself,
whether heat-treating, selling furni- ture, or probing the molecular
structure of a hormone, is a vital factor in job design and work-group
structure. But we do not know what job design and work-group structure
cor- respond to this or that task and work.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the way every one of the groups studied by Joan
Woodward organizes itself is obvious and right. But nothing can be
deduced from one such solution for the optimal structure and
organization of the next job. There are general rules. But they are so
general, e.g., “Work-group structure and organization will be
appropriate to the task to be performed, the personalities, skills and
values of the workers, the physical environment and the tools,” that no
“how-to-do-it” conclusions emerge.</p>
<p>Work-group structure is a configuration of great complexity even
though it is com- posed of a fairly small number of fairly simple
elements. It resembles a kaleidoscope. Fairly small shifts drastically
change the pattern. And the number of combinations and permutations is
so large as to approach infinity.</p>
<p>In such a situation the only way to arrive at the right, the optimal
solution is trial. The outsider, e.g., the industrial engineer, can
help. But he cannot analytically arrive at the answer. The group itself,
however, usually arrives at a right answer fairly fast and without much
trouble. It works things out.</p>
<p>Assembly Line and Job Enrichment</p>
<p>The pressure for changes in the traditional ways of managing worker
and working has been building up these last decades as the “new breed”
has come into the work force and as the old motivating drives of hunger
and fear have rapidly lost their power. The pressure has been greatest
on the traditional assembly line of manufacturing industry. The conven-
tional view has always been that the assembly line is, by its very
nature, incapabte of be- ing run any other way than from the top and by
command.</p>
<p>IBM and Zeiss, as mentioned before, disproved this long ago. So did
our World War II experience in defense production. Nothing that is now
being proposed, for instance, goes quite as far in demanding
responsibility from the worker as some of the U.S. defense plants of
World War II. There the worker had to take responsibility because of the
short- age of industrial engineers, supervisors, and managers.</p>
<p>An example† was one of the largest aircraft engine plants with a
product which, by the standards of the times, was exceedingly complex
and required high skill. Yet each team assembled one entire engine—a
product considerably more complex than any automobile. Each team
organized the job slightly differently, with different men doing
different opera- tions at different times. Each, however, started out
with a foundation in work study and was supplied with full information.
And each engaged in continuous learning. It met sev- eral times a week
with its foreman and with the engineering staff to discuss improvements
in work and jobs. Each team exceeded, by substantial margins, the output
standards which the engineers had suggested. These World War II
experiences—and they could be matched by similar experiences in all
major industrial countries—were forgotten again. They seemed to reflect
a temporary emergency rather than fundamentals. Now we are rediscovering
the same principles again. And wherever tried, the results are the
same.</p>
<p>Among the most significant changes are those of the most rigid and
most highly engi- neered line, the automobile assembly line.</p>
<p>*E.g., through the work of Joan Woodward and her group in England;
see especially her book, Industrial Or- ganization: Theory and Practice
(Oxford University Press, 1965). The intensive studies of work, work
group, and worker which Charles R. Walker of Yale University made in the
forties and fifties reported, for instance, in Charles R. Walker and
Robert H. Guest, The Man on the Assembly Line (Harvard University Press,
1952), had reached and documented the same conclusions earlier.</p>
<p>†Other examples are discussed in both my books, Concept of the
Corporation and The New Society.</p>
<p>In the United States, Chrysler is experimenting with responsibility
on the part of the workers for assembly line operations. In a Chrysler
plant in Detroit, employees were actu- ally asked to reevaluate the
entire manufacturing operation as a result of which the whole plant was
reorganized, resulting in higher output with fewer men.</p>
<p>The most systematic approaches to worker responsibility to automobile
assembly line jobs are those taken by the two Swedish automobile makers,
Saab and Volvo, both acting under the pressure of severe labor
shortages.*</p>
<p>In one Swedish plant, one work group will take responsibility for the
assembly of the total car. The output standard, that is, the number of
cars per hour, and the quality stan- dard will be set by the plant. The
process will have been worked out. But the structure of jobs, their
scope, their relationship, and the organization of the work group are
worked out by the men themselves with their supervisors and the
industrial engineer.</p>
<p>Other features of the Swedish experiment include the formation of
development groups which include production workers and which discuss
such matters as new tool and machine design before they are approved for
construction; temporary assignment of workers to a team of production
engineers to work on specific production problems, and the shifting of
responsibility for process inspection from a separate quality inspection
unit to the production worker. The quality inspection unit now
concentrates exclusively on the completed product (in line with the
principle stated in Chapter 18 that inspection is not quality control of
the product but is the quality control of the quality control process
it- self). Finally, workers’ tasks have been expanded by the workers
themselves to include maintenance of the equipment, which was previously
the responsibility of special mechan- ics—thus applying to the
automobile assembly line what Ernst Abbé did for the produc- tion of
precision optics in the 1890s and Thomas Watson for the production of
electronic equipment in the 1940s and 1950s. These examples could be
multiplied ad infinitum.</p>
<p>In a major American department-store chain responsibility for job
design was turned over to the salespeople. Salespeople in these stores
are on commission and competition among individuals is high. Yet the
salespeople immediately tackled job design as a group problem—with the
clear goal of optimizing every salesperson’s opportunity to earn the
maximum commission. They focused on the question “What changes in the
way the work is being done would help all of us?” They came up with a
demand for continuous train- ing—in merchandising, in selling methods,
in paper handling, and so on. What they wanted—and got—was a little time
each week to sit down together with an experienced expert from store
operations or sales training to discuss their experiences and to suggest
to each other whatever methods would work the best. But they also came
up with sugges- tions for changes in the way the selling floor was
organized. The idea of having a clerk who handles the paperwork for all
the salespeople in the department (mentioned in Chap- ter 18 above) was
one of their ideas, for instance, and first tried by them.</p>
<p>But outside of the assembly line there is also growing demand for
“job enrichment.”† In job enrichment the expert, e.g., the industrial
engineer, defines the “modules” of the work, the individual operations
that have to be performed. He establishes the standards and analyzes the
information the worker needs. But then the worker himself designs his or
her job, that is, the number of modules that constitute “my” job, their
sequence, speed, rhythm. The result is higher output, better quality,
and a sharp drop in employee turnover.</p>
<p>Job enrichment has so far been tried primarily in clerical
operations. It would seem, however, to be particularly applicable to
knowledge work.</p>
<p>Zeiss, IBM, and a good many Japanese companies have been practicing
job enrich- ment for decades. And the way claims settlement has been
done for decades in some</p>
<p>*For these experiments, see Jan-Peter Norstedt, Work Organization and
Job Design of Saab-Scandia in Söder- talje (Stockholm, Swedish Employers
Federation, 1970) and “How to Counter Alienation in the Plant,” by
Richard E. Walton (Harvard Business Review, November/December, 1972).
This article gives several more examples from other industries, mainly
the Uttited States.</p>
<p>†The best short description containing a wealth of examples is the
article, “Job Enrichment Lessons from ATandandandandT” by Robert N.
Ford, in the January/February 1973 issue of the Harvard Business
Review.</p>
<p>German and Japanese insurance companies (see Chapter 18) is job
enrichment pure and simple. Even the American automobile industry
practiced it—way beyond anything job enrichment now tries to do—during
World War II.* We have known what to do for a very long time. That it is
now being heralded as a discovery is somewhat ironic—but harmless as
long as it is being done.</p>
<p>But what is not so harmless is the belief that job enrichment is the
answer. It is only a first step. IBM, the Japanese, and Zeiss mobilized
the energies of the work group. Job enrichment confines the worker’s
responsibility to his own individual job. But he also should be expected
to assume responsibility for the work group, its relationship in and
through the work process, its structure and its cohesion.</p>
<p>Worker Responsibility and the “New Breeds”</p>
<p>Worker responsibility for job and work group is important for all
kinds of workers in to- day’s organizations. It is fundamental to a
civilization in which three out of every four people at work are
employees in organizations.</p>
<p>But worker responsibility is particularly important for the three
groups one might call “the new breeds” —though for different
reasons.</p>
<p>The first of these groups is the new breed of young manual workers.
These men and women (as said in Chapter 15) arrive at work already
rejected, already losers. Yet, though they are the rejects of the
educational system, they have had long years of schooling and have, by
any historical standard, a high degree of education. They are not the
wretched illiterates of the industrial slums of 1850. Their formal
knowledge may be limited. But their horizon is wide—if only because of
TV. And they are, by and large, not motivated by carrot and stick. They
are resentful—in many cases with good reason—because the lack of
scholastic success which has condemned them to inferior status does not
appear to them a genuine, a true, a valid criterion. At the same time,
they have doubts about their own ability to perform and to achieve,
about their own manhood, about their own dignity. These men (and women)
need achievement to overcome their habit of defeat. Otherwise, they will
forever be in a state of smoldering resentment and rebellion. They need
respon- sibility to overcome their feelings of inferiority. They need a
challenge in which they can succeed. They are suspicious—every earlier
contact with authority has conditioned them to be suspicious. Yet they
need self-assurance and security, more than any other group in the work
force.</p>
<p>This is, above all, the lesson of the widely publicized revolt of
General Motors work- ers at the new Lordstown assembly plant in Ohio.
That these young men resented the im- position of the rigid General
Motors assembly line discipline is not surprising and is noth- ing new.
At every major assembly plant General Motors had built during the last
thirty years, the workers reacted the same way. The newspaper account of
Lordstown read ex- actly like the interviews with, and reports on,
workers of the big assembly plant in New England which General Motors
built in the late forties.†</p>
<p>The real difference—and it is an important one—is that the young
white and Black workers at Lordstown felt almost to a man that they
could have done a better job design- ing their own work and the assembly
line than the General Motors industrial engineers did.</p>
<p>Lordstown got all the publicity. But not too far away, in the same
Midwestern indus- trial area, another company opened a major new plant
at about the same time GM opened Lordstown. It employs the same kind of
labor—perhaps an even larger proportion of Blacks than Lordstown—pays
the same wages, and has very similar assembly line work. It too is fully
unionized. Yet this plant had apparently very little trouble. And its
produc- tivity from the beginning was at least as high as the standards
the Lordstown workers de- cried as “speed-up” and rejected. The one
difference is that this other new plant studied</p>
<p>*See, for instance, the example of totally unskilled Negro women
workers producing high-precision parts and assembling them, in Chapter
22 of my Practice of Management.</p>
<p>†See Charles R. Walker and Robert H. Guest, The Man on the Assembly
Line (Harvard University Press, 1952).</p>
<p>and applied IBM’s policies. It engineered the work thoroughly. It
worked out the worker’s and the foreman’s information needs, by bringing
worker and foreman into the planning process as participants and a
resource. And then it demanded from the work group responsibility for
job design and work-group design—and obtained it.</p>
<p>The “Pre-Industrials”</p>
<p>The second group, an entirely different one whatever its outward
similarity, is the large number of recent immigrants from pre-industrial
civilizations into modern city and mod- ern organization: the Turks and
other guest workers in Germany, the Sicilians in Torino, the Blacks in
the United States, the sharecroppers from the drought-ridden sugar
planta- tions of Brazil’s Northeast in São Paulo, and Indians from the
pueblo in Mexico City.</p>
<p>In many ways these workers need paternalism. They need to be looked
after. They are not at home in modern society; they are frightened by
it, lost in it. But at the same time, they need to be integrated into
modern society for their own sake as well as for that of the society to
which they move. Otherwise they will become a disturbing, an unsettled,
a pathological influence. Again, what is needed is to inculcate in these
workers the habit of responsibility and the taste of achievement.</p>
<p>While Fiat in Torino has been largely unable to integrate Sicilian
immigrants and has at times been all but paralyzed by their despair,
anger, and resistance, Olivetti, in nearby Ivrea, has apparently had
little trouble with the same Sicilian immigrants. Olivetti went through
pretty rough times in the sixties after the death of its founder, when
the very sur- vival of the company was in jeopardy; Fiat had a boom with
steadily rising wages and high employment security. Both companies are
highly paternalistic. But at Olivetti there is a long tradition—somewhat
reminiscent of Zeiss—of worker responsibility for job and work
group.</p>
<p>The most dramatic demonstration I know of the need of this
pre-industrial group and of its willingness to assume responsibility is
the experience of a large textile mill on South America’s west coast.
The mill is almost entirely manned by Indians from the High Andes who
have only recently migrated to the coastal city and are strangers to
modern society and even to the Spanish spoken in the city. For years
management had depended on fear. Production and performance at the mill,
however, had been going down steadily. By the early 1950s the mill was
near collapse. Quality had become so bad that the output was almost
unsalable. Machines were antiquated and had not been maintained for
years. A new general manager brought in from Europe submitted to the
owners a comprehensive plan to rebuild the plant, buy new machinery,
train supervision, and so on. But the needed capital could not be
raised. Yet the mill could not be closed for political and legal rea-
sons. The new general manager thereupon decided to do the only thing
left: to lay out work as productively as could be done on the obsolete
machines; to set specific standards for department and section; to
supply the men in each department and section with feed- back on their
own performance; and to impose on them responsibility for the design of
jobs, the arrangement of tools and machines, and the structure of work
groups. Productiv- ity, within a year or so, almost tripled and in some
areas, such as the dye shed, almost quadrupled. Where production up to
minimum quality standards had been the exception, it became the rule.
And for the first time in many years, it became possible to introduce
new materials, new patterns, and new techniques.</p>
<p>The Knowledge Worker</p>
<p>Finally there is the knowledge worker, and especially the advanced
knowledge worker. He has to be a “knowledge professional” (on this see
Chapter 30, “What Makes a Man- ager?”). This means that no one can
motivate him. He has to motivate himself. No one can direct him. He has
to direct himself. Above all, no one can supervise him. He is the
guardian of his own standards, of his own performance, and of his own
objectives. He can be productive only if he is responsible for his own
job.</p>
<p>Saving the Supervisor</p>
<p>To make the worker responsible for his job and for that of the work
group is also the best—and may be the only—way to restore the supervisor
to health and function.</p>
<p>For a half century or more the first-line supervisor, especially in
manufacturing and clerical work, has seen his role shrinking in status,
in importance, and in esteem. Where a supervisor was “management” to the
employee only half a century ago, he has now, by and large, become a
buffer between management, union, and workers. And like all buff- ers,
his main function is to take the blows.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the modern industrial plant the supervisor is increasingly
becoming the “en- emy.” He is separated from the men he supervises by an
ever-higher wall of resentment, suspicion, and hostility. At the same
time, he is separated from management by his lack of technical and
managerial knowledge. Similarly ambivalent is the role of the supervisor
of knowledge workers. His subordinates consider him their spokesman and
expect him to protect them and their knowledge area against managerial
demands and managerial igno- rance. Management, on the other hand,
expects him to integrate the knowledge and exper- tise of the people in
his area with the mission, purpose, and objectives of the institution.
Increasingly he finds himself disavowed by both, by his subordinates
because he is no longer truly a scientist or an expert but has “sold
out” to management, and by manage- ment because he is parochial,
departmentalized, and one-sided.</p>
<p>Frederick Taylor seventy-five years ago saw clearly that the
traditional supervisor was losing function. His proposed solution was to
split the job into a number of functions, and to have different
supervisors for scheduling and training, for tool maintenance, and for
discipline, all of them acting together as a “planning committee” but
each with direct au- thority in his field over the men.</p>
<p>This did not prove to be feasible; there has to be one focal point
for the work group.</p>
<p>But the functional competences for which Taylor wanted to have
separate supervisors have nonetheless been taken over by an array of
specialists: personnel people and quality control men; maintenance
people and schedulers, coordinators and planners. As a result, the
supervisor has been left with the sole function of maintaining
discipline, that is, with the function of being feared.</p>
<p>The crisis of the supervisor has been studied the most in the United
States. But it is worldwide. It may have gone even further in Great
Britain, for instance, where the super- visor has been rendered impotent
by union militants who can and do negotiate directly with plant and
company management. The respected Meister of the German tradition is
fast becoming a thing of the past, as countless articles and speeches in
Germany assert. And when the Swedes went into the radical redesign of
the automobile assembly line, one of the main reasons given was the
plight of the supervisor and the difficulty of getting good men to
accept supervisory positions.</p>
<p>No organization can function well if its supervisory force does not
function. Supervi- sors are, so to speak, the ligaments, the tendons and
sinews, of an organization. They pro- vide the articulation. Without
them, no joint can move. It is the supervisor’s job to be in the middle.
Hence he must have responsibility, function, and respect in both his
relation- ships, upward to management and downward to the work group.
The crisis of the supervi- sor would by itself be reason enough to think
seriously about the organization of the worker and working. For making
the worker achieving, making him responsible, is the one way of making
the supervisor function again. In organizations—again, Zeiss and IBM are
the examples—where worker responsibility has been the guiding concept
for manag- ing worker and working, the supervisor is effective. Only he
is effective differently. He becomes resource for the worker and the
work group.</p>
<p>Worker and work group, in order to take responsibility, have to have
an organized source of knowledge, of information, of direction, of
arbitration, and a channel for contact and information flow to and from
the various experts. Worker and work group also need discipline—though
correctional discipline, which in today’s manufacturing plant tends to
be the supervisor’s main job, should rarely have to be exercised. But
the proper role of</p>
<p>the supervisor is not supervision. It is knowledge, information,
placing, training, teaching, standard-setting and guiding. It is not an
easy role—old supervisors find it difficult—but it is a tenable role. It
no longer imposes a conflict of loyalties—between the supervisor’s work
group and management; between the demands of personality and the demands
of work; between human relations and discipline. As the resource to the
achieving worker and his work group, the supervisor can again become
whole. He can serve, in one and the same act and in one and the same
role, both the objective needs of the enterprise (or per- formance and
the personal needs of workers for achievement.</p>
<p>Plant and Office as Communities</p>
<p>Plant and office are more than just geographic locations. They are
communities. We speak meaningfully of the prevailing atmosphere of an
office or of a mill. We study their “culture.” We speak of “patterns” of
“formal” or “informal” organization, of prevailing “values,” of “career
ladders.” And though there are great differences in degree between the
most paternalistic and the most impersonal plant and office, all are
expected to dis- charge community functions. There is, in other words, a
work community.</p>
<p>To make workers achieving they must also take substantial
responsibility for the work community.</p>
<p>Plant and office need governance. The power dimension is an inherent
and inescap- able dimension of organization.</p>
<p>But not all decisions within an organization are inherent in its
purpose and mission or directly related to its performance. There are
decisions which, while necessary, have their origin in the needs and
realities of the work community rather than in the mission, pur- pose,
and performance capacity of the organization itself. They are incidental
to the pur- pose of the organization rather than integral to it.</p>
<p>It is a law of governance that it restrict itself to the necessary
decisions. Any govern- ing body will be the more effective, and more
powerful, the more it eschews decisions it does not have to make.</p>
<p>An incidental decision which does not materially, add to the
performance capacity of the institution takes just as much time as a
basic and necessary one. Incidental decisions clog the governing
machinery, load down the governing and decision-making group, and
detract it from the important things. At the same time, authority over
such decisions is not in effect legitimate. Such decisions are not
grounded in the “purposes for which govern- ment was instituted among
men,” to use the old and elegant phrase. To be sure, they have to be
made. But the governing body of the institution is the wrong authority
for making them.</p>
<p>Work-community decisions are decisions that should be decentralized.
They are not, however, business decisions, i.e., the decisions which
federal decentralization of business enterprise lodges in lower,
operating decentralized managements (see Chapter 46). They are social
decisions, decisions regarding the affairs of the work community. They
there- fore need to be lodged in the work community—and the principle
behind this is not too different from the principle behind
decentralization of business decision-making.</p>
<p>If management makes work-community decisions, it loads itself down
with matters which appear petty to management, though they are of great
importance to the plant community itself. There are decisions on the
cafeteria, on vacation schedules, on running recreational activities,
and so on. In the typical enterprise management people deal with these
things. This is costly, inefficient, and a constant cause of friction
and dissatisfaction. These activities are run poorly and the decisions
are made badly because for management the areas are not important, do
not deserve a high priority and are not accorded respect.</p>
<p>These are, however, important matters of “hygiene” to the work
community and its members. If these things are run badly, they impede
morale. But running them superbly well adds little, if they are run from
above. The responsibility for these activities and de- cisions needs to
be placed squarely on the work community.</p>
<p>The Need for Leadership Opportunities</p>
<p>At the same time, these areas offer major opportunities for
leadership, for responsibility, for recognition, and for learning. The
men who head these activities are important people in the work
community. The people making the decisions in these areas are also
forced to learn what managing is and what managerial responsibility
means. They learn that choices have to be made, priorities have to be
set, and that the infinite number of things it would be nice to have
must be fitted to the available resources.</p>
<p>In the absence of such opportunities for leadership in the work
community, the abili- ties, energies, and ambitions within the work
force may be directed against management and against the work community.
They will be negative, destructive, demagogic. The one who can make the
most trouble for the bosses will be the leader rather than the one who
can perform the best for the plant community.</p>
<p>The shop steward who, as so many do in English and American plants,
defines his role as “harassment” and who is elected for revolutionary
rhetoric rather than for capacity and performance is the alternative to
leaders chosen to be responsible and to perform.</p>
<p>Responsibility is not by itself a guarantee of performance. But lack
of responsibility breeds the demagogue.</p>
<p>Work-Community Activities</p>
<p>The list of activities for which a work community might be asked to
take responsibility is almost endless.*</p>
<p>Richard E. Walton (in the Harvard Business Review article mentioned
earlier) de- scribes a plant built by a large food manufacturer in 1958
which systematically imposes responsibility for work-community decisions
on the work force. Among them are such tasks as the control of manning
assignments to cover for temporarily absent employees; selecting men
from the plant to serve on plant committees or task forces; screening
and selecting employees to fill vacancies; counseling workers who do not
meet standards with respect to absences or punctuality. Members of the
plant community also were put on the plant safety committee. Safety is,
after all, a concern of the people in the plant—and they also know more
about it than anybody else, as a rule, or at least know more about where
the safety problems are.</p>
<p>Another example of self-government in a work community is the nuclear
submarine.</p>
<p>Obviously, a submarine cannot be a permissive place. The captain has
to be the final au- thority whose word nobody dares dispute. Yet the
crew, regardless of rank, acts and works as one unit. No one can join
the crew unless he is accepted by it. And while the captain decides what
should be done, each man on his own station then has to decide how to do
a specific job and do it as if the life of everybody depended on him, as
indeed it does.</p>
<p>The Self-Governing Work Community</p>
<p>A self-governing work community is not “participatory democracy.”</p>
<p>Neither at Zeiss nor in the food company mentioned earlier, nor in a
submarine, are there elections or mass meetings. The working teams are
organized by management for specific operations and specific jobs.</p>
<p>Work-community self-government may not be—and maybe should not—
“democ- racy” altogether. Authority and assignments may go by
seniority—as they do in Japanese plants, but as they also largely did at
Zeiss. What matters is that self-government of plant- community tasks be
local self-government and that it put responsibility where the conse-
quences of the decisions have to be lived with.</p>
<p>*Many of them are mentioned in my earlier books; especially Concept
of the Corporation and The New Soci- ety.</p>
<p>We do not have all the answers to managing worker and working. The
society of or- ganizations is new—only seventy years ago employees were
a small minority in every society. The attenuation of carrot and stick
as driving forces is new. The emergence of a highly schooled work force
is new. The new breed of manual workers is new. And the emergence of the
knowledge worker is also new.</p>
<p>But we know what the questions are. We know the approaches. And we
know the goals—though we may never attain them.</p>
<p>The attenuation of carrot and stick was heralded around 1900 by a
semantic change.</p>
<p>In the old days the “boss” issued a proclamation or order “to my
workers.” After 1900 he increasingly addressed himself “to our fellow
employees.” At about the same time the German Unternehmer began to talk
of Mitarbeiter (literally “fellow employee”)—a term that had first been
coined by the civil service a century earlier. Often enough, of course,
the new term was only a semantic mask for tyranny. But it reflected the
passing of the “master” and the arrival of modern organization in which
even the top man is another hired hand, another employee who derives
whatever authority he has from responsibility and performance rather
than from birth, rank, title, or wealth.</p>
<p>No one yet addresses workers as “fellow managers”—I hope no one ever
will. Yet this is the goal. There will be—and there has to be—the
reality of management power and authority, of command and of
decision-making, of higher and lower incomes, of superior and
subordinate. But there also is the task of building and leading
organizations in which every man sees himself as a “manager” and accepts
for himself the full burden of what is basically managerial
responsibility: responsibility for his own job and work group, for his
contribution to the performance and results of the entire organization,
and for the social tasks of the work community.</p>
