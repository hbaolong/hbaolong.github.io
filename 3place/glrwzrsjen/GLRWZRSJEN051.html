<h4 id="georg-siemens-and-the-deutsche-bank">49 Georg Siemens and the
Deutsche Bank</h4>
<p>Top Management: Rank or Function—Georg Siemens and the “Universal
Bank”— Top-Management Tasks—Top-Management Team—The “Secretariat”—The
Lessons</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>OP MANAGEMENT IS A simply another term for the</p>
<p>FACT. But is its essence power? Is “top management” “bosses”? Or is
there a specific top-management func-</p>
<p>tion? And if so, what is it and how should it be structured?</p>
<p>Management theory is generally silent on the function and structure
of top manage- ment. But in management practice this was the very first
area tackled systematically— long before Frederick W. Taylor tackled the
organization of work, and long before Henri Fayol developed the first
systematic organization design in his functional structure. Top
management as a function and as a structure was first developed by Georg
Siemens (1839-1901) in Germany between 1870 and 1880, when he designed
and built the Deutsche Bank and made it, within a very few years, into
continental Europe’s leading and most dynamic financial institution. (On
Siemens, see also Chapters 1 and 29.)</p>
<p>The management books usually mention that the emergence of the
transcontinental railroad in the U.S. during the 1870s first created
need for, and awareness of, manage- ment. The books fail to mention—and
their authors usually do not know—that at the same time there emerged on
the continent of Europe an institution, the “universal bank,” which,
while totally different from the large railroad, equally posed a problem
of managing a large and geographically dispersed organization. The
railroads problem was organization and coordination of operations; the
universal bank’s problem was organization aud coor- dination of top
management.</p>
<p>The universal bank grew out of the banque d’affaires, the
entrepreneurial bank which was intended, in accordance with the
doctrines of the French economists and sociologists from J.B. Say to
Saint-Simon, to be the motor of economic and social development by
directing the capital resources of the economy into tomorrow’s
productive growth indus- tries. The first banque d’affaires, the Crédit
Mobilier, which the Pereire Brothers founded in Paris in 1850, proved
the theory.* But as a bank it was a failure. It lacked the deposit base
and the commercial banking business to sustain itself while its
industrial investments matured and therefore had to go into “growth
situations” and “go-go stocks,” that is, into speculation rather than
industrial development.</p>
<p>The lesson was heeded across the Rhine, in Germany, where economic
development was just starting in the 1860s. The Germans proceeded to
start banks which would be industrial-development banks (that is,
banques d’affairs) but which would, like the older English “commercial”
banks, also have a broad deposit base and a commercial-banking
business—hence the name universal bank.</p>
<p>*On the Pereire Brothers and the Crédit Mobilier, see my books,
Managing for Results and The Age of Discon- tinuity.</p>
<p>Of the many such banks started in Germany at that time, Deutsche Bank
had the most pretentious title. Actually there was as yet no Deutschland
when it was founded early in 1870; Bismarck’s unification of Germany was
still a year in the future. But despite its grandiose title and its
avowed intention of becoming the first truly “national” bank in Europe,
the new Deutsche Bank was the smallest, the most poorly capitalized, and
the most precariously backed of the new German banking ventures. It was
indeed so unprom- ising that no experienced and established banker could
be found to head it. The founders had to turn for the leadership of
their new business to a thirty-year-old and virtually un- known
government lawyer without banking or business experience: Georg
Siemens.</p>
<p>Within ten years Siemens had built the Deutsche Bank into Germany’s
leading finan- cial institution. Within another five years, by the
mid-eighties, the Deutsche Bank had become the giant among the credit
institutions of the European continent.</p>
<p>Building a Top-Management Team</p>
<p>What Siemens did was to build a top management—the first such organ
in economic and business history. Siemens himself, many years later,
summed up his approach in an epi- gram: “A bank without an effective
top-management is so much office furniture, fit only to be auctioned
off.”</p>
<p>The old merchant firms of Hamburg and Bremen, which were the “modern”
busi- nesses of a still predominantly pre-industrial Germany, were, of
course, family partner- ships as a rule, with a team of brothers or of
father and son at the head. Siemens trans- formed this partnership of
co-owners into a top-management team of professionals.</p>
<p>He analyzed the key activities of the bank and made sure that each of
them was an as- signed responsibility of one member of the team. He
analyzed the key relations of the bank, with major investments and major
customers, or with such major outside factors as governments, and again
made sure that one member of the top-management team was responsible for
each of them. There was, of course, a captain of the management team—
Siemens himself for many years filled that position. But whichever
member of the team had designated responsibility for a key activity
(e.g., underwriting) or for a key relation- ship (e.g., with one of the
major industrial investments) was in charge, was directly and primarily
responsible, and made the decisions. Even Siemens, while chairman of the
“board of management” and clearly first man on the team, was, in many
areas, the number two man who served as alternate to the colleague in
charge.</p>
<p>Who did what, and who was responsible for what, was decided on the
basis of a man’s personality, his interests, his qualifications, and his
load. The job had to fit the man. At the same time, great care was taken
to have every key activity and every key relationship “covered,” that
is, assigned as a primary responsibility to one of the team members.</p>
<p>So far Siemens may be said to have done little but define the
functions of the board of management of German company law. But Siemens
soon went far beyond this and organ- ized a top-management team grounded
in function rather than in law.</p>
<p>Unlike France, where the banque d’affaires had its origin, Germany
did not have then, and does not have today, one major city in which
governmental and economic activities are centralized. Even in the 1920s,
when Berlin was at its peak, most of the large German industrial
companies did not have their headquarters there. Only the electrical
industry was dominated by Berlin-based companies.</p>
<p>Such centers as Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Munich were much older than
Berlin. They had been capital cities when Berlin was still a fishing
village. Their citizens, and espe- cially their leading businessmen, had
intense civic pride and were not at all willing to be controlled from
Berlin. Yet the Deutsche Bank, if it wanted to carry out its function as
the German entrepreneur, had to become a national rather than remain a
regional or a local bank. Also the new industrial business of the
rapidly growing German economy soon be- gan to be national, with plants,
branches, and customers throughout the country.</p>
<p>Hence Siemens had to work out a national top-management team of which
the bank’s leading executives in major centers outside of Berlin could
be members. These men were</p>
<p>not legally members of the top management, that is, of the board of
management (Vor- stand). But internally they were members of the
top-management teams. They were re- sponsible for the bank’s relations
with the major businesses in their area. With industry largely outside
of Berlin these men often carried the responsibility for the bank’s
major industrial investments and major business relationships. As late
as 1926, when the Ger- man chemical industry merged into the I.G.
Farben, and established its corporate head- quarters in Frankfurt, the
Deutsche Bank’s top man in Frankfurt assumed, for instance, primary
responsibility for the relationship with what then was Germany’s largest
and most</p>
<p>important industrial corporation.</p>
<p>As a result, outstanding men in the various communities were willing
to serve the bank in local leadership positions when they would neither
have moved to Berlin nor have been content with subordinate jobs. And
strong local banks were willing to merge with</p>
<p>the Deutsche Bank for the same reason.</p>
<p>The “Secretariat”</p>
<p>Such a large, widely dispersed, and dynamic team created at once a
major communica- tions problem. How to keep all the members informed
(their number may have reached twenty-five or thirty-five at times)? How
to keep control of the business of the bank once it had grown beyond
financing a few companies and had actually become the national
entrepreneur its founders had expected it to be? How to keep control of
the allocation of the bank’s resources of capital and key people? How
altogether to prevent under this top- management system a breakup of a
unified bank into a series of semi-independent fief- doms? Georg
Siemens’s answer to this was the creation of the executive secretariat
(Di- rektions-Sekretariat).*</p>
<p>Siemens assembled a small professional staff and charged it with the
responsibility for keeping all members of the top-management teams
informed of each other’s activitses and decisions, for thinking ahead
for the bank as a whole, and for staying in close touch with every major
investment and commitment.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens’s Lessons</p>
<p>This example teaches, first, that there is a top-management function.
There are a number of tasks which are top-management tasks, not because
top management is the “top”—that is, because it has the legal authority
or the power—but because they are tasks that can be discharged only by
people who are capable of seeing the whole business and of making
decisions with respect to the whole business.</p>
<p>Secondly, the story of the Deutsche Bank under Georg Siemens
demonstrates that top management requires a specific structure. It is a
different organ from any other organ of management and has to have a
different design.</p>
<p>Finally, the story shows that top management requires its own organ
of input, its own organ for the supply of stimulation, information, and
thought.</p>
<p>*Without any knowledge of Siemens’s work the National Aeronautics and
Space Agency (NASA) almost a hundred years later, in the 1960s, arrived
at the same solution of an executive secretariat to maintain communi-
cation, information, and cohesion in a systems structure. On this see
Sayles and Chandler, op. cit.</p>
