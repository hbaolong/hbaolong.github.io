<p>A Crucial Social Responsibilities Area—The Need for New Political

Dirigisme—Constitutionalism—Models and Re- ality—The New
Problems—Guidelines—Autonomy and Accountability of Business and
Managers—The Open-Ended Economy—A Healthy and Functioning Govern-

Social Re- sponsibility</p>
<p>A</p>
<pre><code>CRUCIAL SOCIAL business manager, is</code></pre>
<p>RESPONSIBILITY for the manager, and especially for the the
relationship of business and government. Yet it is rarely</p>
<p>even mentioned when the social responsibilities of management are
being discussed.</p>
<p>Few relationships are as critical to the business enterprise itself
as the relationship to government. The manager has responsibility for
this relationship as part of his responsi- bility to the enterprise
itself. It is an area of social impact of the business. To a large ex-
tent the relationship to government results from what businesses do or
fail to do.</p>
<p>The business-government relationship is also a social problem, for
the relationship be- tween business and government in every major
country is in disrepair. It urgently needs rethinking, reappraisal, and
restructuring. In every developed country—and in most de- veloping
ones—there are no clear rules, little common understanding, and at best
a con- fused patchwork of laws and prejudices, regulations, traditions,
and ad hoc improvisation, ranging from guerrilla warfare to the closest
partnership. At the same time, there are new major problems which cannot
be fitted into the existing relationships. The environment is one. And
so is the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>The increasing confusion threatens government even more than
business. It under- mines its capacity for making policy and giving
direction, that is, its basic institutional integrity. It tempts
governments to tackle far more than they are competent to do. But it
also makes them hesitant and timid in areas where political leadership
is needed (e.g., in the international economy). Yet a competent, clearly
defined, and functioning government is a first need for our complex and
interdependent society.</p>
<p>Ultimately we will need new political theories appropriate to the
realities and needs of the society of organizations. In the meantime,
business and government will have to go on with their respective jobs.
They will have to know which of these jobs have to be tackled together
and which have to be kept apart. It is far too early to think of
solutions. But ap- proaches and specifications will have to be designed,
if only on a case-by-case basis. And great care will have to be taken
lest these interim solutions commit us to the wrong long- term pattern,
foreclose valuable options, and commit society by default to patently
unde- sirable relationships.</p>
<p>To work out these interim solutions and to watch over them will be
primarily the job of the manager. He cannot wait for the political
philosopher. Too much is at stake, for his enterprise, for the economy,
and for society.</p>
<p>To discharge this responsibility the manager needs, above all, to
understand the his- torical background to the government-business
relationship. Political and administrative traditions with respect to
this relationship differ greatly in different countries. They largely
determine what is considered “right” and “appropriate” in individual
countries— by politicians, civil servants, political scientists, but
also by the public and by the busi- nessman himself. These traditions
also explain in large part why the government-business relationship is
in disarray and crisis these days. Yet, few books—whether on government
or on business—have paid much attention to the historical setting and to
the administra- tive and political theories that underlie the
government-business relationship in the devel- oped countries.</p>
<p>The Historical Models</p>
<p>The textbooks still talk of laissez-faire as the model for the
business-government relation- ship in capitalist (i.e., “market”)
economies. But in the first place laissez-faire was a model of economic
theory rather than of political theory and governmental practice. Ex-
cept for Bentham and the young John Stuart Mill, no political writer of
any importance or influence in the last two hundred years paid even lip
service to it. Second, even as an eco- nomic theory laissez-faire was
being practiced in only one country, Great Britain, and only for a
fairly short period in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The two political models that have set the norm for the
business-government relation- ship were very different ones. They might
be called, respectively, mercantilism (or, with the French, dirigisme)
and constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Of the two, the mercantilist (or “dirigiste”) model is the older. It
goes back to the sev- enteenth and, especially, the eighteenth century.
It is essentially still the prevailing model for most of continental
Europe, and especially for France. It is the model for the Japanese
relationship between business and government. It has set the pattern in
India, both under the British and since independence. And the
business-government relationship of Com- munist Russia is dirigisme—far
more a continuation of Czarist bureaucratic administra- tion than
revolutionary, and far closer to mercantilism than to Marx.</p>
<p>In the mercantilist model the economy is seen as the foundation of
political sover- eignty and especially of the military strength of the
nation. National economy and national sovereignty are seen as
co-extensive. Both essentially are organized against an outside world.
It is the main function of the economy to provide the means of survival
to the na- tion-state against the threats from the outside. Within the
nation-state there may be fric- tion, conflict, competition, dispute.
But, as in a beleaguered fortress, all disputes and dis- agreements stop
at the wall.</p>
<p>In the original crude concept of mercantilism, as it was developed in
the late seven- teenth century, business was seen as the provider of
specie, i.e., gold and silver, with which to pay the soldiers, who in
turn protected national independence and survival. Adam Smith demolished
the respectability of this line of reasoning. But still, the mercan-
tilist model sees the economic foundation of political sovereignty in
competitive perform- ance abroad. Exports are the objective—and the
test.</p>
<p>It has become fashionable these last few years to speak of “Japan,
Inc.”—that is, of a Japanese system in which government and business are
one in promoting Japanese ex- ports throughout the world. One could have
spoken thus of a “Germany, Inc.” in 1880 or 1900, or of a “France, Inc.”
under De Gaulle.</p>
<p>In the mercantilist model the businessman is considered socially
inferior to the civil servant in government administration. This was as
true in the France of Louis XIV as in Bismarck’s Germany or in Japan
before World War II. Still, the task of the government administrator is
to support, to strengthen, to encourage business, and especially to
support and encourage exports. As the inferiority of businessmen
attenuated—especially with the rise of technology and of the
professional manager—business became, so to speak, a part of the
national establishment. But it is still junior to, though a partner and
in symbiosis with, government.</p>
<p>Symptomatic of this is the position which associations and
organizations of business have in a mercantilist system. In France—and
to a considerable extent; in, Germany— membership in the trade or
industry association is compulsory. In Japan these associations are
quasi-governmental bodies. The trade association official, the executive
secretary for instance, is often a former civil servant of high rank. He
often enjoys more status and power than any but the very biggest and
strongest members of the industry themselves. Labor union agreements are
typically negotiated by the industry association and are then binding on
member companies. But the government also handles its relations with
indus- try and business through trade and industry associations, as it
did, for instance, in the planning process of De Gaulle’s France.</p>
<p>The constitutionalist model developed in the nineteenth century—above
all, in the United States—sees government as standing, essentially, in
an adversary relationship to business. The relationship is governed by
laws rather than administered. It is conducted at arm’s length.</p>
<p>Constitutionalism no more than mercantilism believes in
laissez-faire. It accepts that government cannot stay out of economy and
business. “Business,” both concepts say, “is too important to be left to
the businessmen.” But where the mercantilist guides and directs and pays
subsidies, the constitutionalist says “thou shalt not” and uses
antitrust laws, regu- latory agencies, and criminal indictments. The
mercantilist tries to encourage business, provided it moves in the
direction he deems conducive to national political and military
strength. The constitutionalist is determined to keep business out of
government; it taints. And he sets limits of political morality to
business activity.</p>
<p>While continental Europe is the birthplace of mercantilism, the U.S.
developed consti- tutionalism. Jefferson may be said to have been the
first constitutionalist—deeply suspi- cious of business and convinced
that the business interest had to be kept out of govern- ment. But it
was not until Andrew Jackson, twenty years later, i.e., around 1830,
that con- stitutionalism became the prevailing intellectual model for
business-government relation- ship in the U.S.</p>
<p>It was also during the Jackson Administration that constitutionalism
fixed the social position of the businessman in American life. Since
then businessmen have been socially equal to any group in American
society.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the
United States, the businessman was perhaps the socially dominant figure.
His competitors for social rank were not, as in mercantilist countries,
the civil servants, but the clergy and, later on, the university
professor. In the constitutionalist model, since Jackson’s days, the
businessman is also supposed to be a patriot and available, especially
in times of crisis, to serve the nation and to assume political
leadership positions. And yet, when Franklin D. Roosevelt, a hundred
years after Jackson, called businessmen “malefactors of great wealth,”
he spoke in the purest constitutionalist vein.</p>
<p>Symptomatic for the constitutionalist approach is, again, the
treatment and position of trade and industry associations. In the
constitutionalist tradition they are looked upon with great suspicion
and are rarely used as a conduit for the relations between government
and the business community. They are not compulsory and have no coercive
powers or offi- cial standing, no matter how influential they might be
behind the scenes, e.g., as lobbying groups in Congress.</p>
<p>Symptomatic also is the fact that in the country where
constitutionalism has been most influential, that is the U.S., the
Department of Commerce, i.e., the ministry supposed to represent
business in government and to watch out for the interests of business,
was not set up as a cabinet office until 1913—a hundred to a hundred and
fifty years later than the ministries of commerce in continental
Europe.</p>
<p>Equally symptomatic is the fact that until World War II, the United
States refused to have a defense industry. It relied, instead, on
government-owned arsenals. To build a con- tractual partnership with
outside independent businesses would have run counter to the
constitutionalist tradition. Since the work had to be performed,
however, it had to be per- formed by government itself.</p>
<p>Models and Reality</p>
<p>Both dirigisme and constitutionalism are intellectual models of
political—or administra- tive—theory. They are norms of what ought to
be. And reality always falls far short of such an ideal.</p>
<p>This applies particularly to constitutionalism. Even in the United
States the doctrine of adversary, arm’s-length relationship between
business and government had, from the be- ginning, to contend with a
powerful American version of mercantilism. It began with Jef- ferson’s
great adversary, Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804). A generation later
Henry Clay (1777-1852) in his “American System” adapted mercantilism to
American conditions. The “enemy” was not outside. It was the trackless
wilderness beyond the frontier. Instead of exports, Clay advocated
“internal improvements,” that is, canals, railroads, farming, and
industries for the domestic market. And from the beginning the adversary
relationship to business went hand in hand with subsidies, especially to
canals and railways. And few countries have been as consistently
protectionist with respect to trade as the U.S.</p>
<p>Indeed, many critics, American and especially European, have called
the official U.S.</p>
<p>constitutionalist policy position mere hypocrisy and a complete sham.
But this misses the powerful impact constitutionalism has actually had
and still has. It largely informs Amer- ica’s traditional opposition to
the “system,” the Populist Crusade. It explains why the American radical
traditionally has opposed business as such whereas the European Leftist
has traditionally been “for” business and wants only to replace the
“wicked capitalist” with his own “good guys”—that is, government
administrators. (In this respect, the recent surge of a New Left in
Europe with a demand for “changing the system” actually repre- sents
ideological Americanization of a particularly ironic kind. It is no
accident that its main enemy is the traditional, that is, mercantilist
Left of the European tradition such as the old-line communists.)
Constitutionalism also explains the peculiar forms of U.S. eco- nomic
and business legislation and regulation. But there is considerable
substance to the old remark that, in her attitude to business and
economy, the U.S. has been Jeffersonian (i.e., constitutionalist) in
theory and Hamiltonian (i.e., mercantilist) in practice.</p>
<p>Mercantilism has been undoubtedly far more widely practiced. And when
the one country that had actually done what economic theory advocated
and had kept government out of the economy—that is, Great
Britain—shifted, in the late 1800s, to a political ap- proach to
business and economy, it shifted toward dirigisme (of the German rather
than the French model) rather than toward constitutionalism.</p>
<p>But even the mercantilist model was never fully realized in practice.
From the begin- ning there were tensions in it. Business again and again
slipped out of administrative con- trol. Even in Japan, government and
the business community see themselves as adversar- ies as much as
partners.</p>
<p>And constitutionalism made substantial inroads. The most influential
school of politi- cal economy on the continent of Europe in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centu- ries, that is, in the days when
the government-business alliance on the continent was at its peak, were
the German academic socialists (Katheder-Socialisten). These powerful
and influential professors wanted to separate business and government
and to replace the mer- cantilist alliance with something much closer to
the constitutionalist model. After World War II the Germans actually
committed themselves to constitutionalism. The “social mar- ket
economy,” which both major German parties adopted in the Adenauer years,
was not laissez-faire, it was constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Yet these two models have, for well over a century, been the guides
and set the norms.</p>
<p>They told governments and politicians what should be. They
established the criteria for right and wrong in the public mind. They
did not perhaps determine the business- government relationship, but
they set the limits within which speciflc relationship prob- lems could
be worked out on a case-by-case, issue-by-issue, “scandal-by-scandal”
basis.</p>
<p>The New Problems</p>
<p>By now, however, both models are obsolescent. Neither model offers
much guidance anymore, either to government or to business. Neither
model can cope with the new rela- tionship problems which, however,
demand solutions. The most important—or at least the most visible—of
these new problems have been caused by:</p>
<p>1 the “mixed economy”;</p>
<p>2 the multinational corporation;</p>
<p>3 government’s loss of its position as the institution; and</p>
<p>4 the emergence of the professional manager.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first of these realities is today’s “mixed economy.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of the models were developed for a capitalist economy. Both
could also function in a socialist economy (for the adaptation of
constitutionalism to socialist competition see Chapter 14). But neither
model can handle a mixed economy in which government activi- ties and
business activities intertwine and compete at the same time.</p>
<p>Every developed economy is a complex mixture of regulations,
governmental controls subsidies and penalties, business autonomy in
areas formerly considered government (e.g., autonomous postal services),
and direct government operations of business. There are institutions
that, while incorporated as private companies, are publicly owned and
discharge public functions. There are also institutions which while
government owned operate in fairly, competitive markets and discharge
“private-sector” functions. And there is a welter of the most complex
partnerships. Defense procurement is but one example; for in every
noncommunist country today defense procurement is done in a contractual
relationship, half partnership, half duel, between government and
autonomously managed and largely privately owned contractors.</p>
<p>Defense procurement may be considered a special case in the U.S., for
instance, the mixed economy in defense is still being explained away as
a “temporary emergency” al- most thirty years after the end of World War
II, which first created it. Everyone con- cerned knows that there is
nothing temporary about it and that the fiction of “temporary emergency”
is a major cause of the serious problems in defense procurement. Yet
every- one concerned also knows that any attempt to think through and
restructure the relation- ship would immediately run head on into
philosophical contradictions, fundamental po- litical convictions and
traditions, and irreconcilable differences between “what ought to be”
and what is needed. As one high Defense Department official once put it,
“We know it’s chaos; but that’s still better than paralysis.”</p>
<p>But even in areas other than defense, what is “public” and what is
“private,” what is “government” and what is “business” can no longer be
separated.</p>
<p>NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which put a
man on the moon in the 1960s, is an even “fuzzier” area than defense
procurement. (On NASA and its structure see Chapter 47.) NASA is a
government agency. And yet the American space effort was a cooperative
enterprise in which a large number of independent and autono- mous
organizations—government agencies, universities, individuals and, above
all, busi- ness—worked together on a common task. The legal structure
for this was a contractual relationship. The actual work was done in a
partnership in which at many times private businesses took the
leadership, made public policy, and set goals and standards. “In de-
fense procurement,” a NASA executive explained, “it’s always the
government that has an inspector in the contractor’s plant to control
his work. In NASA it is not at all uncommon for a contractor who is a
private business to have an inspector in a government installation who
controls the work the government is doing.”</p>
<p>There are going to be more and more joint tasks in which government
and business will have to be in a team, with leadership taken by one or
the other as the situation de- mands. There are the tasks of the
environment. There is the enormous task of husbanding</p>
<p>the resources of the world. There are the problems of the big city.
There is research— technological as well as social—and many others.
Quality-of-life tasks are perhaps by definition joint tasks in which
non-governmental institutions have to take social responsi- bility for
doing while governments may have to provide the money.</p>
<p>This is difficult enough to fit in with dirigisme. The civil servant
no longer guides and shapes a separate business community. In some
relationships he will have to be a partner, and not necessarily the
senior partner. In some relationships, e.g., in many areas of bank- ing
and insurance, he has to become the spokesman for business—some of it
private, some, especially in Europe, government-owned—against public
policy. In others, espe- cially in relations with “multinationals,”
private businesses represent the “public policy” of their own
government, for instance in European unification or in developing
underde- veloped economies while the civil servant defends “private
interests” of domestic indus- try. But, dirigisme can still accept
this—though the strain is great.</p>
<p>But the mixed economy is quite incompatible with the
constitutionalist model, which explains the extreme difficulty American
political parties, American political rhetoric, and American political
commentators have in explaining the way government and economy actually
work.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The second factor which cannot be made to jibe with the traditional
models is the multinational corporation. As will be explained later (in
Chapter 59) the multinational corporation is a response to the
divorce—or at least estrangement—of economy and sov- ereignty after
three hundred years of marriage. The economy can no longer be defined as
a national economy even in the biggest and most powerful countries such
as the United States. Yet sovereignty is still exclusively national.
There is no sign of anything to take the place of the nation-state as
the political sovereign. Yet there is a genuine world econ- omy which
carries the economic dynamics and actually determines economic-
developments worldwide, with direct impact on economic behavior,
activity, and results within the national economies, and yet is largely
impervious to political sovereignty.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mercantilist model is most directly challenged by the development
of which the multinational corporation is both carrier and effect. To
mercantilism this divorce is un- thinkable; yet it is happening. This
was clearly understood by General De Gaulle. His decision not to permit
French businesses to go multinational was completely rational. It was
also completely futile.</p>
<p>The constitutionalist model, too, can hardly cope with the
multinational corporation.</p>
<p>It is no accident that latter-day U.S. populism is attacking the
multinational corpora- tion. For the mercantilist tradition the crime of
the multinational corporation is that it is not an instrument of
political sovereignty and cannot be one. For the populist of the
American constitutionalist tradition the crime of the multinational
corporation is that it is not an instrument of American morality and
cannot be one. On the contrary, it must fit itself in every country to
the prevailing legal and moral beliefs of the political sovereignty in
the country where it operates.</p>
<p>And neither model could cope with the logical corollary to an
autonomous world economy, separate from, and outside of the political
sovereignty of any and all nation- states: a supranational currency and
credit mechanism with its own autonomous non- national “central bank.”
Yet this is clearly the direction ahead; indeed, the acceptance of
International Drawing Rights (IDR) issued by the International Monetary
Fund, as a “su- per-currency” in the Smithsonian Agreement in December
1971, was a decisive step. If development continues along this line,
neither the mercantilist nor the constitutionalist model could be
maintained, even as intellectual abstractions.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In the society of organizations government becomes one
special-purpose institution rather than the institution. Such a society
creates social responsibility for the non- government leadership groups,
and especially for the business manager. It thereby under- mines the
uniqueness of government’s position and role. The other institutions can
no longer be seen, as they were in the mercantilist model, as
“handmaidens” of the Grand Design of national policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>What made De Gaulle so impressive a figure was his refusal to accept
this. De Gaulle instead insisted on the unchallenged primacy of La
Grande Politique—not only over the economy but equally over arts and
education. This made De Gaulle consistent and clear. But it also made
his policy appear old-fashioned and in the end almost absurd, even to
fervent admirers of a great man.</p>
<p>But the constitutionalist too has difficulty with a society in which
business is expected to assume social responsibility. His position all
along; and the basis for his insistence on an adversary relationship to
business, has been that business has to be restrained, policed,
regulated, limited—and if need be, punished—lest it behave irresponsibly
and antiso- cially. Hence the ambivalence approaching schizophrenia, of
the traditional American liberal who demands in the same breath that GM
or IBM be split up and that they mobi- lize their resources to solve
major social problems.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, there is the emergence of the professional manager as
against the owner- entrepreneur. The traditional model speak of the
businessman. But the reality of today is the manager. This means that
the managers of business have emerged as a group which in origin,
education, background, and values closely resembles the civil servant.
(The one exception to this—changing fast though—is still Great Britain.)
At the same time the civil servant (as well as the leadership groups in
other institutions) are in the process of becom- ing managers.</li>
</ol>
<p>This development creates a danger of making business bureaucratic.
But it also abol- ishes the old demarcation lines. It thereby undermines
the distinction on which both the mercantilist model and the
constitutionalist model have been built.</p>
<p>The emergence of the manager as a leading group is particularly
incompatible with the mercantilist model. But equally incompatible for
the constitutionalist tradition is the growing trend forward considering
business management as the model for public admini- stration.</p>
<p>It may be argued that these are problems for government rather than
for business. But too much is at stake for business and management to
disregard the fact that the traditional, inherited relationship models
cannot adequately organize and structure relationship reali-</p>
<p>ties any more.</p>
<p>Solutions, as said before, are not within sight.</p>
<p>The orthodox Marxist would dispute that. But the reality in communist
countries is fully as much one of patchwork, increasing strain,
ineffectual compromise, and malper- formance. The struggle in the
communist countries between the “conservatives,” who want to maintain
complete dirigisme, and the “realists” or “liberals,” who argue for
“autonomy” of enterprise and markets, as the result of the growing gap
between the dirig- iste model and reality. And the Russian fear of any
deviation from the model, whether in Yugoslavia, in Czechoslovakia, or
in China, is a fear of political rather than of economic
consequences.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Specific problems will have to be dealt with even though there are no
known solutions, no new political theory, no new and more adequate
model. What is needed are “specifica- tions.” What is needed are
criteria by which specific answers to specific problems—ad hoc,
pragmatic, temporary—can be tested and judged. What is needed—and is
attain- able—are guidelines that strengthen, or at least protect, in the
ad hoc treatment of specific problems fundamental long-range needs and
requirements of the body-politic, of govern- ment, and of economy and
business enterprise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first such specification is that the economic organizations of
society, i.e., busi- ness and their managers, require autonomy and
accountability:</li>
</ol>
<p>• in the interest of the economy;</p>
<p>• for the sake of strong and effective government; and</p>
<p>• in the interest of society.</p>
<p>“Accountable Enterprise” might be a better slogan than the by now
hackneyed “Free Enterprise.”*</p>
<p>To be accountable for performance, economic institutions and their
managers have to have autonomy. One cannot be accountable for what one
has no authority over and cannot control. Business enterprises and
managements have to be under the performance test or they cease to
perform. They have to be able to allocate society’s and economy’s
resources in a rational manner and against objective criteria. Or
resources will at once be misallo- cated.†</p>
<p>This is not a matter of ownership. It requires market test and market
decision, in the three economic dimensions—the market for goods and
services, the market for capital and investment, and the market for jobs
and careers.</p>
<p>Of the three, the capital market may be most crucial. It is in the
capital market that re- sources for the future are allocated on the
basis of performance expectation. And it is the capital market which,
therefore, while in need of regulation, also needs self-
determination.</p>
<p>But there is need also for an open-ended economy, an economy in which
businesses can be born, but one in which businesses can also die. It is
a basic weakness of a state- owned or state-controlled economic system
that businesses are not allowed to go bankrupt and can only rarely be
liquidated. Yet clearly the welfare of society and economy de- mands a
healthy business metabolism.</p>
<p>This will be particularly true in the decades ahead. They are going
to be decades of change. Unless businesses, even big and apparently
important businesses, are allowed to go out of existence, the
body-economic will increasingly age, become sclerotic, ossify. This will
not prevent change. It will rather make change into a catastrophic
threat instead o£ a gradual adjustment.</p>
<p>There is need for a cushioning of the social impact of such changes.
How this might be done has been discussed earlier (in Chapter 21 in
connection with Sweden’s Rehn Plan.) But the strength of the Rehn Plan
is precisely that it converts what otherwise might be individual
catastrophe into an “insurable risk” through full use of the market
mecha- nism.</p>
<p>The performance capacity of government also rests on autonomy for
business and management. A political process at best makes allocation
decisions poorly and painfully. They clog government and overload it to
the point where it cannot move at all, cannot make decisions, cannot
devote itself to the governmental tasks properly.‡</p>
<p>Society too requires management autonomy. Managers of the major
organizations are collectively the leadership groups of the society of
organizations. But a healthy society requires a pluralism of leadership
groups with different values, different priorities, differ- ent
“styles.” It requires alternatives—in careers and career ladders, in
points of view, in life-styles. Otherwise it degenerates into
conformity, and loses its capacity for change. If the need for change
arises—and it always does—no one can even imagine a behavior different
from what everyone in the leadership group is accustomed to and
considers “right” if not immutable “law of nature.” At the same time,
those among the able and am- bitious who do not fit easily into the one
norm of the one leadership group are alienated.</p>
<p>A healthy society is a complex of “countercultures.” They need not be
in conflict— indeed, in a healthy society they mutually respect each
other. But they must exist in com-</p>
<p>*If only because the word “free” has a different connotation in most
other languages and is read as implying license rather than
responsibility.</p>
<p>†On this, Ota Sik, the Czech communist theoretician and architect of
the economic liberalization of Czechoslo- vakia in 1967 and 1968—now
living in exile in Basel, Switzerland—has some profound things to say in
his little book, Czechoslovakia: The Bureaucratic Economy (International
Arts and Sciences Press, 1972). The book, containing lectures he gave to
his compatriots in the critical week before the Russian invasion, is a
graphic description of the self-destruction of a once highly productive
economy resulting from the loss of busi- ness and managerial
autonomy.</p>
<p>‡On this too, Sik (op. cit.) is most instructive.</p>
<p>petitive coexistence. In a society in which the cultures and
life-styles are increasingly those of the key organizations, social
health requires autonomy for major leadership groups. It requires
autonomous business with autonomous managements.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>But society also needs a healthy and functioning government,
especially in a com- plex and interdependent a society as ours has
become.</li>
</ol>
<p>Government is needed as the political decision-maker, more than ever
before perhaps.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the capacity of government to be the political
decision maker is increasingly jeopardized by its weight, size, and
bureaucratization. It is increasingly jeop- ardized by government
tendency to take on too many things, to promise too much, and to “do”
too much. The fatter government becomes, the flabbier and weaker it
actually is.*</p>
<p>Business and business management cannot restore government to health.
This is a po- litical job. But they can at least be conscious of the
need and avoid, in working out the business-government relationship,
whatever might weaken the performance capacity of government as the
central political decision-maker. In this area their responsibility is
“Primum non nocere”—”not knowingly to do damage.” (See the next
chapter.)</p>
<p>The Multinational Corporation</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The twin needs, for economic autonomy and effective government, come
together in one major problem of the business-government
relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p>The multinational corporation (again see Chapter 59) is a central
economic achieve- ment of the period since World War II and perhaps the
most fruitful social innovation of the century. It is also a hard
problem. What is needed is to work out a relationship which safeguards
both a true world economy and the political sovereignty of national
govern- ments in peaceful coexistence. Otherwise we will impair or
destroy altogether that most promising development, the multinational
business, and undermine the capacity for politi- cal vision and action
and for political community.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The need to think through the business-government relationship is
not, in the main, the result of a crisis of business. It is the result
of a serious crisis of government. Yet business managers will have to
look upon the relationship to government and society as their task. They
cannot wait for the political scientist or the theoretical economist. A
purely negative attitude which fights every “encroachment of government”
is not going to be effective. All it can do is delay. Positive,
affirmative action is needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>We do not need more laws. No country suffers from a shortage of laws
these days. We need a new model. Yet all we can expect are temporary ad
hoc answers to specific prob- lems. These answers should, however, be
compatible with minimum specifications: they should preserve the
autonomy and accountability of business enterprise and business
management; they should safeguard a free and flexible society capable of
change; they should harmonize the world economy of the multinational and
the sovereignty of the na- tion-states; and they should encourage strong
and performing government.</p>

10, “The Sickness of Government.”</p>
