<p>T</p>
<p>HE SEARS STORY SHOWS that a business enterprise is created and
managed by people and not by forces. Economic forces set limits to what
management can do. They create opportunities for management’s action.
But they do not by themselves determine what a business is or what it
does. Nothing could be sillier than the oft-repeated assertion that
“management only adapts the business to the forces of the market.” Man-
agement not only has to find these forces, it has to create them. It
took a Julius Rosenwald seventy-five years ago to make Sears into a
business enterprise, and a General Wood twenty-five years later to
change its basic nature and thus insure its growth and success during
the Depression and World War II. Now another management generation will
have to make new decisions that will determine whether Sears is going to
continue to prosper or to decline, to survive or eventually to perish.
And that is true of every business.</p>
<p>Another conclusion is that a business cannot be defined or explained
in terms of profit. Asked what a business is, the typical businessman is
likely to answer, “An organi- zation to make a profit.” The typical
economist is likely to give the same answer. This answer is not only
false, it is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The prevailing economic theory of business enterprise and behavior,
the maximization of profit—which is simply a complicated way of phrasing
the old saw of buying cheap and selling dear—may adequately explain how
Richard Sears operated. But it cannot ex- plain how Sears, Roebuck or
any other business enterprise operates, nor how it should operate. The
concept of profit maximization is, in fact, meaningless.</p>
<p>Contemporary economists realize this; but they try to salvage the
theorem. Joel Dean, one of the most brilliant and fruitful of
contemporary business economists, still maintains the theorem as such.
But this is how he defines it:</p>
<p>Economic theory makes a fundamental assumption that maximizing
profits is the basic objective of every firm. But in recent years,
profit maximization has been ex- tensively qualified by theorists to
refer to the long run; to refer to management’s</p>
<p>rather than to owners’ income; to include non-financial income such
as increased leisure for high-strung executives and more congenial
relations between executive levels within the firm; and to make
allowance for special considerations such as restraining competition,
maintaining management control, warding off wage de- mands, and
forestalling anti-trust suits. The concept has become so general and
hazy that it seems to encompass most of men’s aims in life.</p>
<p>This trend reflects a growing realization by theorists that many
firms, and par- ticularly the big ones, do not operate on the principle
of profit maximizing in terms of marginal costs and revenues. . . .*</p>
<p>A concept that has “become so general and hazy that it seems to
encompass most of men’s aims in life” is not a concept. It is another
way of saying, “I don’t know and I don’t understand.” A theorem that can
be maintained only when qualified out of existence has surely ceased to
have meaning or usefulness.</p>
<p>The danger in the concept of profit maximization is that it makes
profitability appear a myth. Anyone observing the discrepancy between
the theory of profit maximization and the reality, as portrayed by Joel
Dean, would be justified in concluding that profitability does not
matter—the conclusion actually reached by John Kenneth Galbraith in The
New Industrial State.†</p>
<p>Profit and profitability are, however, crucial—for society even more
than for the indi- vidual business. Yet profitability is not the purpose
of but a limiting factor on business enterprise and business activity.
Profit is not the explanation, cause, or rationale of busi- ness
behavior and business decisions, but the test of their validity. If
archangels instead of businessmen sat in directors’ chairs, they would
still have to be concerned with profitabil- ity, despite their total
lack of personal interest in making profits. This applies with equal
force to those far from angelic individuals, the commissars who run
Soviet Russia’s busi- ness enterprises, and who have to run their
businesses on a higher profit margin than the wicked capitalists of the
West.</p>
<p>The first test of any business is not the maximization of profit but
the achievement of sufficient profit to cover the risks of economic
activity and thus to avoid loss.</p>
<p>The root of the confusion is the mistaken belief that the motive of a
person—the so- called profit motive of the businessman—is an explanation
of his behavior or his guide to right action. Whether there is such a
thing as a profit motive at all is highly doubtful. It was invented by
the classical economists to explain the economic reality which their
the- ory of static equilibrium could not explain. There has never been
any evidence for the existence of the profit motive. We have long since
found the true explanation of the phe- nomena of economic change and
growth which the profit motive was first put forth to explain.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant for an understanding of business behavior, profit,
and profitability whether there is a profit motive or not. That Jim
Smith is in business to make a profit concerns only him and the
Recording Angel. It does not tell us what Jim Smith does and how he
performs. We do not learn anything about the work of a prospector
hunting for uranium in the Nevada desert by being told that he is trying
to make his fortune. We do not learn anything about the work of a heart
specialist by being told that he is trying to make a livelihood, or even
that he is trying to benefit humanity. The profit motive and its
offspring maximization of profits are just as irrelevant to the function
of a business, the purpose of a business, and the job of managing a
business.</p>
<p>In fact, the concept is worse than irrelevant: it does harm. It is a
major cause for the misunderstanding of the nature of profit in our
society and for the deep-seated hostility to profit which are among the
most dangerous diseases of an industrial society. It is largely
responsible for the worst mistakes of public policy—in this country as
well as in Western Europe—which are squarely based on the failure to
understand the nature, function, and</p>
<p>*Joel Dean, Managerial Economics (Prentice-Hall, 1951), p. 28.
†Houghton Mifflin, 1967.</p>
<p>purpose of business enterprise. And it is in large part responsible
for the prevailing belief that there is an inherent contradiction
between profit and a company’s ability to make a social contribution.
Actually, a company can make a social contribution only if it is highly
profitable. To put it crudely, a bankrupt company is not likely to be a
good company to work for, or likely to be a good neighbor and a
desirable member of the community—no matter what some sociologists of
today seem to believe to the contrary.</p>
<p>The Purpose of a Business</p>
<p>To know what a business is we have to start with its purpose. Its
purpose must lie outside of the business itself. In fact, it must be in
society since business enterprise is an organ of society. There is only
one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer.</p>
<p>Markets are not created by God, nature, or economic forces but by
businessmen. The want a business satisfies may have been felt by the
customer before he was offered the means of satisfying it. Like food in
a famine, it may have dominated the customer’s life and filled all his
waking moments, but it remained a potential want until the action of
businessmen converted it into effective demand. Only then is there a
customer and a mar- ket. The want may have been unfelt by the potential
customer; no one knew that he wanted a Xerox machine or a computer until
these became available. There may have been no want at all until
business action created it—by innovation, by credit, by advertis- ing,
or by salesmanship. In every case, it is business action that creates
the customer.</p>
<p>It is the customer who determines what a business is. It is the
customer alone whose, willingness to pay for a good or for a service
converts economic resources into wealth, things into goods. What the
business thinks it produces is not of first importance— especially not
to the future of the business and to its success. The typical
engineering definition of quality is something that is hard to do, is
complicated, and costs a lot of money! But that isn’t quality; it’s
incompetence. What the customer thinks he is buying, what he considers
value, is decisive—it determines what a business is, what it produces,
and whether it will prosper. And what the customer buys and considers
value is never a product. It is always utility, that is, what a product
or service does for him. And what is value for the customer is, as we
shall see (in Chapter 7), anything but obvious.</p>
<p>The customer is the foundation of a business and keeps it in
existence. He alone gives employment. To supply the wants and needs of a
consumer, society entrusts wealth- producing resources to the business
enterprise.</p>
<p>The Two Entrepreneurial Functions</p>
<p>Because its purpose is to create a customer, the business enterprise
has two—and only these two—basic functions: marketing and innovation.
Marketing and innovation produce results all the rest are “costs.”</p>
<p>Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business. A
business is set apart from all other human organizations by the fact
that it markets a product or a service. Neither church, nor army, nor
school, nor state does that. Any organization that fulfills itself
through marketing a product or a service is a business. Any organization
in which marketing is either absent, or incidental is not a business and
should never be managed as if it were one.</p>
<p>The first man in the West to see marketing clearly as the unique and
central function of the business enterprise, and the creation of a
customer as the specific job of manage- ment, was Cyrus H. McCormick
(1809-1884). The history books mention only that he invented a
mechanical harvester. But he also invented the basic tools of modern
market- ing: market research and market analysis, the concept of market
standing, pricing policies, the service salesman, parts and service
supply to the customer, and installment credit. He had done all this by
1850, but not till fifty years later was he first widely imitated even
in his own country.</p>
<p>In the Far East marketing arose even earlier—also without finding
imitators for a very long time. Marketing was invented in Japan around
1650 by the first member of the Mit-</p>
<p>sui family to settle in Tokyo as a merchant and to open what might be
called the first de- partment store. He anticipated by a full 250 years
basic Sears, Roebuck policies: to be the buyer for his customers; to
design the right products for them, and to develop sources for their
production; the principle of your money back and no questions asked; and
the idea of offering a large assortment of products to his customers
rather than focusing on a craft, a product category, or a process. He
also saw that the social changes in his country at that time had created
a new class of potential customers, an urbanized new gentry and a new
bourgeoisie. On these foundations he and his successors not only built
what is to this day Japan’s largest retail business, the Mitsukoshi
chain of department stores. They also built one of the largest of
Japan’s manufacturing, trading, and financial combines, the Mitsui
Zaibatsu.</p>
<p>The economic revolution of the American economy since 1900 has in
large part been a marketing revolution. Creative, aggressive, pioneering
marketing is still far too rare in American business—few businesses are
even abreast of the Sears of 1925, let alone of the Sears of 1970. Yet
fifty years ago the typical attitude of the American businessman to-
ward marketing was “the sales department will sel1 whatever the plant
produces.” Today it is increasingly, “It is our job to produce what the
market needs.” However deficient in execution, the attitude has by
itself changed our economy as much as any of the technical innovations
of this century.</p>
<p>In Europe selling was not really accepted as a core function of
business until well after World War II. Export sales were highly
valued—a holdover from eighteenth-century mercantilism which considered
domestic consumption to be antisocial but selling abroad highly
patriotic and meritorious (a good bit of this belief still lingers on in
Japan and un- derlies Japanese government attitudes and policies).</p>
<p>But selling was undignified. Before 1914 an export sales manager
could get an offi- cer’s commission in the Prussian Army; he was a
“gentleman.” But a domestic sales man- ager was unacceptable and
despised. As late as 1950 there were big Italian companies whose export
sales managers sat on the board of directors as members of top
management while no one, literally, was responsible for domestic
sales—even though the domestic market accounted for 70 percent of the
company’s business.</p>
<p>This traditional European social prejudice against market, customer,
and selling was, by the way, an important reason for the popularity of
cartels in Europe. No one needs to worry about markets and sales—at
least not in the short run—if an industry divides up the business
through a tidy, tight cartel.</p>
<p>The shift from this attitude to one which considered marketing as a
central business function—though perhaps not yet as the central function
of business—is one of the main reasons for Europe’s explosive recovery
since 1950.</p>
<p>The marketing approach was first introduced into Europe in the
twenties by an English retail chain, Marks andandandand Spencer. Despite
Marks andandandand Spencer’s success—in less than fifteen years, from
1920 to 1935, the firm became Europe’s largest, fastest-growing, and
most profitable retailer—few followed it until well after World War II.
Since then the market- ing revolution has swept Europe—leading
practitioners are such companies as Philips in Holland, Unilever, and
Fiat.</p>
<p>In Japan, similarly, few imitated Mitsui. The marketing revolution in
Japan perhaps did not start until Sony, a brash newcomer, began to
market in the 1950s, first in Japan, then worldwide. Until then most
Japanese businesses were product-oriented rather than market-oriented,
but they learned amazingly fast. The economic success of Japan in the
world markets since the fifties, and with it the Japanese economic
miracle, rests squarely on an acceptance of marketing as the first
function of business and its crucial task.</p>
<p>Marketing, is so basic that it cannot be considered a separate
function (i.e., a separate skill or work) within the business, on a par
with others such as manufacturing or person- nel. Marketing requires
separate work, and a distinct group of activities. But it is, first, a
central dimension of the entire business. It is the whole business seen
from the point of view of its final result, that is, from the customer’s
point of view. Concern and responsi- bility for marketing must,
therefore, permeate all areas of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Among American manufacturing companies the outstanding practitioner
of the mar- keting approach may well be IBM; and IBM is also the best
example of the power of marketing. (See the discussion of IBM’s
near-miss in Chapter 60.) IBM does not owe its meteoric rise to
technological innovation or product leadership. It was a Johnny-come-
lately when it entered the computer field, without technological
expertise or scientific knowledge. But while the technological leaders
in the early computer days, Univac, GE, and RCA, were product-focused
and technology-focused, the punch-card salesmen who ran IBM asked: “Who
is the customer? What is value for him? How does he buy? And, what does
he need?” As a result, IBM took over the market.</p>
<p>From Selling to Marketing</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on marketing and the marketing approach,
marketing is still rhetoric rather than reality in far too many
businesses. “Consumerism” proves this. For what con- sumerism demands of
business is that it actually market. It demands that business start out
with the needs, the realities, the values of the customer. It demands
that business define its goal as the satisfaction of customer needs. It
demands that business base its reward on its contribution to the
customer. That after twenty years of marketing rhetoric consumerism
could become a powerful popular movement proves that not much marketing
has been practiced. Consumerism is the “shame of marketing.”</p>
<p>But consumerism is also the opportunity of marketing. It will force
businesses to be- come market-focused in their actions as well as in
their pronouncements.</p>
<p>Above all, consumerism should dispel the confusion which largely
explains why there has been so little real marketing. When managers
speak of marketing, they usually mean the organized performance of all
selling functions. This is still selling. It still starts out with “our
products.” It still looks for “our market.” True marketing starts out
the way Sears starts out—with the customer, his demographics, his
realities, his needs, his values. It does not ask, “What do we want to
sell?” It asks, “What does the customer want to buy?” It does not say,
“This is what our product or service does.” It says, “These are the
satisfactions the customer looks for, values, and needs.”</p>
<p>Indeed, selling and marketing are antithetical rather than synonymous
or even com- plementary.</p>
<p>There will always, one can assume, be need for some selling. But the
aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of marketing is
to know and understand the cus- tomer so well that the product or
service fits him and sells itself.</p>
<p>Ideally, marketing should result in a customer who is ready to buy.
All that should be needed then is to make the product or service
available, i.e., logistics rather than sales- manship, and statistical
distribution rather than promotion. We may be a long way from this
ideal. But consumerism is a clear indication that the right motto for
business man- agement should increasingly be, “from selling to
marketing.”</p>
<p>The Enterprise as the Organ of Economic Growth and Development</p>
<p>Marketing alone does not make a business enterprise. In a static
economy there are no business enterprises. There are not even
businessmen. The middleman of a static society is a broker who receives
his compensation in the form of a fee, or a speculator who cre- ates no
value.</p>
<p>A business enterprise can exist only in an expanding economy, or at
least in one which considers change both natural and acceptable. And
business is, the specific organ of growth, expansion, and change.</p>
<p>The second function of a business is: therefore, innovation—the
provision of different economic satisfactions. It is not enough for the
business to provide just any economic goods and services; it must
provide better and more economic ones. It is not necessary for a
business to grow bigger; but it is necessary—that it constantly grow
better.</p>
<p>Innovation may result in a lower price—the datum with which the
economist has been most concerned, for the simple reason that it is the
only one that can be handled by quan-</p>
<p>titative tools. But the result may also be a new and better product,
a new convenience, or the definition of a new want.</p>
<p>The most productive innovation is a different product or service
creating a new poten- tial of satisfaction, rather than an improvement.
Typically this new and different product costs more—yet its overall
effect is to make the economy more productive.</p>
<p>The antibiotic drug costs far more than the cold compress which is
all yesterday’s physician had to fight pneumonia. The computer costs far
more than an adding machine or a punch-card sorter, the typewriter far
more than a quill pen, the Xerox duplicator far more than a copy press
or even a mimeograph copier. And, if and when we get a cancer cure, it
will cost more than even a first-class funeral.</p>
<p>The price of the product is thus only one measurement of the value of
an innovation, or of economic process altogether. We may relate price to
unit output, i.e., price of a drug to the saving it produces in days of
hospital stay and in added years of working life. But even that is
hardly adequate. We really need a value measurement. What economic value
does innovation give the customer? The customer is the only judge; he or
she alone knows his (or her) economic reality.</p>
<p>Innovation may be finding new uses for old products. A salesman who
succeeds in selling refrigerators to Eskimos to prevent food, from
freezing would be as much of an innovator as if he had developed
brand-new processes or invented a new product. To sell Eskimos a
refrigerator to keep food cold is finding a new market; to sell a
refrigerator to keep food from getting too cold is actually creating a
new product. Technologically there is, of course, only the same old
product; but economically there is innovation.</p>
<p>Above all, innovation, is not invention. It is a term of economics
rather than of tech- nology. Non-technological innovations—social or
economic innovations—are at least as important as technological ones.
(On this see Chapter 61, “The Innovative Organiza- tion.”)</p>
<p>However important the steam engine was as an invention, two
non-technological in- novations have had as much to do with the rise of
modern economy: the mobilization of purchasing power through bank
credit, and the application of probability mathematics to the physical
risks of economic activity, that is, insurance. The innovation of
limited liabil- ity and the subsequent development of the publicly owned
limited-liability company were of equal importance. And installment
credit (or as the British call it more accurately, hire purchase) has
equal impact. It makes it possible to pay for the means to increase
produc- tion out of the future fruits of the investment. It thus enabled
the American farmer in the nineteenth century to buy the implements that
made him productive and to pay for them after he had obtained the larger
crop at lower cost. And this also makes installment credit a powerful
dynamo of economic development in today’s poor, underdeveloped
countries.</p>
<p>In the organization of the business enterprise innovation can no more
be considered a separate function than marketing. It is not confined to
engineering or research but extends across all parts of the business,
all functions, all activities. It cannot be confined to manu- facturing
business. Innovation in distribution has been as important as innovation
in manufacturing; and so has been innovation in an insurance company or
in a bank.</p>
<p>The leadership in innovation with respect to product and service has
traditionally been focused in one functional activity which is
responsible for nothing else. This has been particularly true for
businesses with heavy engineering or chemical technology. In an in-
surance company, too, a special department charged with leadership
responsibility for the development of new kinds of coverage may be in
order; and there might well be other such departments charged with
innovation in the organization of sales, the administration of policies,
and the settling of claims. Yet another group might work on innovation
in investing the company’s funds. All these are the insurance company’s
business.</p>
<p>But—as discussed in more detail in Chapter 61—the best way to
organize for system- atic, purposeful innovation is as a business
activity rather than as functional work. At the same time, every
managerial unit of a business should have responsibility for innovation
and definite innovation goals. It should be responsible for contributing
to innovation in the company’s product or service; in addition, it
should strive consciously to advance the</p>
<p>art in the particular area in which it is engaged: selling or
accounting, quality control or personnel management.</p>
<p>Innovation can be defined as the task of endowing human and material
resources with new and greater wealth-producing capacity. Innovation is
particularly important for de- veloping countries. These countries have
the resources. They are poor because they lack the capacity to make
these resources wealth-producing. They can import technology. But they
have to produce their own social innovations to make imported technology
work.</p>
<p>To have realized this was the great strength of the founders of
modern Japan a century ago. They deliberately kept their country
dependent on the West’s technology—a de- pendence that remained until
very recently. But they channeled their energies and those of their
people into social innovations that would enable their country to become
a strong modern society and economy and yet retain its distinct Japanese
character and culture.</p>
<p>Innovation is thus crucial to economic development. Indeed, economic
development is, above all, an entrepreneurial task.*</p>
<p>Managers must convert society’s needs into opportunities for
profitable business.</p>
<p>That, too, is a definition of innovation. It needs to be stressed
today, when we are so con- scious of the needs of society, schools,
health-care systems, cities, and environment. These needs are not too
different in kind from those which the nineteenth-century entre- preneur
converted into growth industries—the urban newspaper and the streetcar;
the steel-frame skyscraper and the school textbook; the telephone and
pharmaceuticals. The new needs similarly demand the innovating
business.</p>
<p>The Productive Utilization of Wealth-Producing Resources</p>
<p>The enterprise must utilize wealth-producing resources to discharge
its purpose of creat- ing a customer. It is, therefore, charged with
productive utilization of these resources. This is the administrative
function of business. In its economic aspect it is called produc-
tivity.</p>
<p>Everybody these last few years has been talking productivity. That
greater productiv- ity—better utilization of resources—is both the key
to a high standard of living and the result of business activity is not
news. And everyone knows by now that the scourge of modern economies,
uncontrolled inflation, is a deficiency disease caused by inadequate
productivity. But we actually know very little about productivity; we
are, indeed, not yet able to measure it.</p>
<p>Productivity means that balance between all factors of production
that will give the greatest output for the smallest effort. This is
quite different from productivity per worker or per hour of work; it is
at best distantly and vaguely reflected in such traditional stan-
dards.</p>
<p>These standards are still based on the eighteenth-century tenet that
manual labor is, in the last resort, the only productive resource;
manual work the only real effort. The stan- dards still express the
mechanistic fallacy—of which Marx, to the permanent disability of
Marxian economics, was the last important dupe—that all human
achievement could eventually be measured in units of muscle effort.
Increased productivity in a modern economy is never achieved by muscle
effort. It is always the result of doing away with muscle effort, of
substituting something else for the laborer. One of these substitutes
is, of course, capital equipment, that is, mechanical energy.†</p>
<p>At least as important, though unnoticed until very recently, is the
increase in produc- tivity achieved by replacing manual labor, whether
skilled or unskilled, by knowledge,</p>
<p>*On this see the essay by a South American educator and businessman
Reinaldo Scarpetta, “Management Education as a Key to Social
Development,” in Preparing Tomorrow’s Business Leaders Today, edited by
Peter F. Drucker (Prentice-Hall, 1969).</p>
<p>†Here we now have available the careful studies of Simon Kuznets (of
the University of Pennsylvania and of Harvard) to show the direct
relationship in United States industry between investment in capital
equipment and increases in productivity.</p>
<p>resulting in a shift from laborers to knowledge workers, such as
managers, technicians, and professionals.</p>
<p>A little reflection will show that the rate of capital formation, to
which economists give so much attention, is a secondary factor. Someone
must plan and design the equip- ment—a conceptual, theoretical, and
analytical task—before it can be installed and used. The basic factor in
an economy’s development must be the rate of “brain formation,” the rate
at which a country produces people with imagination and vision,
education, and theo- retical and analytical skills.</p>
<p>However, the planning, design, and installation of capital equipment
is only a part of the increase in productivity through the substitution
of brain for brawn. At least as impor- tant is the contribution made
through the direct change of the character of work from one requiring
the manual labor, skilled and unskilled, of many people, to one
requiring theo- retical analysis and conceptual planning without any
investment in capital equipment.</p>
<p>This contribution first became evident in the 1950s in the analysis
of the productivity gap between American and European industry.
Studies—e.g., by the Stanford Research Institute and by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation (OEC)—showed clearly that the productivity
differential between Western Europe and the United States was not a
matter of capital investment. In many European industries productivity
was as much as two-thirds below that of the corresponding American
industry, even though capital in- vestment and equipment were equal. The
only explanation was the lower proportion of managers and technicians
and the poor organization structure of European industry with its
reliance on manual skill.</p>
<p>In 1900 the typical manufacturing company in the United States spent
probably no more than or on managerial, technical, and professional
personnel for every 00 in direct-labor wages. Today there are many
manufacturing industries where the two items of expenditure are
equal—even though direct-labor wage rates have risen proportionately
much faster. Outside of manufacturing, transportation, and mining, e.g.,
in distribution, finance, insurance, and the service industries (that
is, in two-thirds of the American econ- omy), the increase in
productivity has been caused primarily by the replacement of labor by
planning, brawn by brain, sweat by knowledge.</p>
<p>The greatest opportunities for increasing productivity are surely to
be found in knowl- edge work itself, and especially in management. The
vocabulary of business—especially of accounting—in relation to
productivity has become so obsolete as to be misleading. What the
accountant calls productive labor is manual workers tending machines,
who are actually the least productive labor. What he calls nonproductive
labor—all the people who contribute to production without tending a
machine—is a hodgepodge. It includes pre-industrial, low-productivity
brawn labor like sweepers; some traditional high-skill,
high-productivity labor like toolmakers; new industrial high-skill labor
like maintenance electricians; and industrial high-knowledge personnel
like firemen, industrial engineers, and quality control men. Finally,
what the accountant lumps together as overhead—the very term reeks of
moral disapproval—contains what should be the most productive re-
source, the managers, researchers, planners, designers, innovators. It
may also, however, contain purely parasitical, if not destructive,
elements in the form of high-priced person- nel needed only because of
mal-organization, poor spirit, or confused objectives, that is, because
of mismanagement.</p>
<p>We need a concept of productivity that considers together all the
efforts that go into output and expresses them in relation to their
result, rather than one that assumes that la- bor is the only productive
effort. But even such a concept—though a big step forward— would still
be inadequate if its definition of effort were confined to the
activities measur- able as visible and direct costs, that is, according
to the accountant’s definition of, and symbol for, effort. There are
factors of substantial if not decisive impact on productivity that never
become visible cost figures.</p>
<p>First there is knowledge—man’s most productive resource if properly
applied, but also the most expensive one and totally unproductive, if
misapplied. The knowledge</p>
<p>worker is, of necessity, a high-cost worker. Having spent many years
in school, he also represents a very high social investment</p>
<p>Then there is time—man’s most perishable resource. Whether men and
machines are utilized steadily or only half the time will make a
difference in their productivity. There is nothing less productive than
idle time of expensive capital equipment or wasted time of high1y paid
and able people. Equally unproductive may be cramming more productive
effort into time than it will comfortably hold—for instance, the attempt
to run three shifts in a congested plant or on old or delicate
equipment.</p>
<p>The most productive—or least productive—time is that of the manager
himself. Yet it is usually the least known, least analyzed, least
managed of all factors of productivity.*</p>
<p>Productivity is also a function or the product mix, the balance
between various combi- nations of the same resources. As every manager
should know, differentials in the market values of various combinations
are rarely proportional to the efforts that go into making up the
combinations. Often there is barely any discernible relationship between
the two. A company turning out a constant volume of goods with
unchanging materials and skills requirements and a constant amount of
direct and indirect labor may reap fortunes or go bankrupt, depending on
the product mix. Obviously this represents a considerable differ- ence
in the productivity of the same resources—but not one that shows in
costs or can be detected by cost analysis.</p>
<p>There is also an important factor which I would call “process mix.”
Is it more produc- tive for a company to buy a part or to make it, to
assemble its product or to contract out the assembly process, to market
under its own brand name through its own distributive organization or to
sell to independent wholesalers using their own brands? What is the
company good at? What is the most productive utilization of its specific
knowledge, abil- ity, experience, reputation?</p>
<p>Not every management can do everything, nor should any business
necessarily go into those activities which seem objectively to be most
profitable. Every management has spe- cific abilities and limitations.
Whenever it attempts to go beyond these, it is likely to fail, no matter
how inherently profitable the venture.</p>
<p>People who are good at running a highly stable business will not be
able to adjust to a mercurial or a rapidly growing business. People who
have grown up in a rapidly expand- ing company will, as everyday
experience shows, be in danger of destroying the business should it
enter upon a period of consolidation. People good at running a business
with a foundation in long-range research are not likely to do well in
high-pressure selling of novelties or fashion goods. Utilization of the
specific abilities of the company and its management and observance of
these specific limitations is an important productivity factor.
Conglomerates may optimize the productivity of capital, but they will
have rather low productivity—and inherently poor results—in other
equally important areas.</p>
<p>Finally, productivity is vitally affected by organization structure
and by the balance among the various activities within the business. If
a lack of clear organization causes managers to waste their time trying
to find out what they are supposed to do rather than doing it, the
company’s scarcest resource is being wasted. If top management is
interested only in engineering (perhaps because that’s where all the top
men came from) while the company needs major attention to marketing, it
lacks productivity; the resulting damage will be greater than could be
caused by a drop in output per man-hour. These factors are additional to
the factors accountants and economists usually consider, namely,
productiv- ity of labor, capital, and materials. They are, however,
fully as important.</p>
<p>We therefore not only need to define productivity so as to embrace
all these factors af- fecting it, but also need to set objectives that
take all these factors into account. We must develop yardsticks to
measure the impact on productivity of the substitution of capital for
labor, and of knowledge for both—and means to distinguish between
creative and para- sitical overhead, and to assess the impact on
productivity of time utilization, product mix, process mix, organization
structure, and the balance of activities.</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The Effective Executive (1966), especially
Chapter l.</p>
<p>Not only does individual management need adequate concepts and
measurements for productivity, the economy needs them. Their lack is the
biggest gap in our economic sta- tistics and seriously weakens all
economic policy. It frustrates our attempts to fight de- pression and
inflation alike.</p>
<p>The Functions of Profit</p>
<p>Profit is not a cause but a result—the result of the performance of
the business in market- ing, innovation, and productivity. It is a
needed result, serving essential economic func- tions. Profit is, first,
the test of performance—the only effective test, as the communists in
Russia soon found out when they tried to abolish it in the early
twenties (though they coyly called it the capital fund and avoided the
bad word profit until well into the 1950s). Indeed, profit is a
beautiful example of what engineers mean when they talk of the feed-
back such as underlies all systems of automated production: the
self-regulation of a proc- ess by its own results.</p>
<p>Profit has a second function which is equally important. It is the
premium for the risk of uncertainty. Economic activity, because it is
activity, focuses on the future; and the one thing that is certain about
the future is its uncertainty, its risks. The word “risk” itself is said
to mean “earning one’s daily bread” in the original Arabic. It is
through risk-taking that any businessman earns his daily bread. Because
business activity is economic it al- ways attempts to bring about
change. It always saws off the limb on which it sits; it makes existing
risks riskier or creates new ones.</p>
<p>As the Sears story showed, the future of economic activity is a long
one; it took fifteen or twenty years for basic Sears decisions to become
fully effective, and for major invest- ments to pay off. “Lengthening
the economic detour” has been known for a hundred years to be a
prerequisite to economic advance. Yet while we know nothing about the
future, we know that its risk increase in geometric progression the
farther ahead we commit our- selves to it.</p>
<p>Profit and profit alone can supply the capital for tomorrow’s jobs,
both for more jobs and for better jobs. Again it is a definition of
economic progress that the investment needed to create new and
additional jobs increases.</p>
<p>Today’s accountant or engineer does not make a better living than his
grandfather on the farm because he works harder. He works far less hard.
Nor does he deserve a better living because he is a better man. He is
the same kind of human being as grandfather was, and grandfather’s
grandfather before him. He can be paid so much more and yet work so much
less hard because the capital investment in him and his job is
infinitely greater than that which financed his grandfather’s job. In
1900, when grandfather started, capital in- vestment per American farmer
was at most ,000. To create the accountant’s or engi- neer’s job,
society first invests at least 0,000 in capital and expenses for school
and education. And then the employer invests another 5,000 to 0,000 per
job. All of this investment that makes possible both additional and
better jobs has to come out of the sur- plus of economic activity, that
is, out of profits.</p>
<p>And finally profit pays for the economic satisfactions and services
of a society, from health care to defense, and from education to the
opera. They all have to be paid for out of the surplus of economic
production, that is, out of the difference between the value produced by
economic activity and its cost.</p>
<p>Businessmen these days tend to be apologetic about profit. This is a
measure of the dismal job they have done explaining profit—above all to
themselves. For there is no justification and no rationale for profit as
long as one talks the nonsense of profit motive and profit
maximization.</p>
<p>No apology is needed for profit as a necessity of economy and
society. On the con- trary, what a businessman should feel guilty about,
what he should feel the need to apolo- gize for, is failure to produce a
profit appropriate to the economic and social functions which profit,
and only profit, can develop.</p>
<p>Walter Rathenau (1867-1922), the German executive, statesman, and
social philoso- pher, who thought more deeply than any other Westerner
of his time about the social re- sponsibility of business, proposed
replacing the word profit with responsibility. Profit, to be sure, is
not the whole of business responsibility; but it is the first
responsibility. The business that fails to produce an adequate profit
imperils both the integrity of the re- sources entrusted in its care and
the economy’s capacity to grow. It is untrue to its trust.</p>
<p>At the very least, business enterprise needs a minimum of profit: the
profit required to cover its own future risks, the profit required to
enable it to stay in business and to main- tain intact the
wealth-producing capacity of its resources. This required minimum profit
affects business behavior and business decision—both by setting limits
and by testing their validity. Management, in order to manage, needs a
profit objective at least equal to the required minimum profit, and
yardsticks to measure its profit performance against this requirement.
(For further discussion see Chapters 8 and 9.)</p>
<p>What, then, is managing a business? It follows from the analysis of
business activity as the creation of a customer through marketing and
innovation that managing a business must always be entrepreneurial in
character. There is need for administrative perform- ance. But it
follows the entrepreneurial objectives. Structure, follows strategy.</p>
<p>It also follows that managing a business must be a creative rather
than an adaptive task. The more a management creates economic conditions
or changes them rather than passively adapts to them, the more it
manages the business.</p>
<p>But an analysis of the nature of a business also shows that
management, while ulti- mately tested by performance alone, is a
rational activity. Concretely this means that a business must set
objectives that express what is desirable of attainment rather than (as
the maximization-of-profit theorem implies) aim at accommodation to the
possible. Once objectives have been set by fixing one’s sights on the
desirable, the question can be raised what concessions to the possible
have to be made. This requires management to decide what business the
enterprise is engaged in, and what business it should be engaged in.</p>
