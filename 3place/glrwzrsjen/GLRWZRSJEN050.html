<h4 id="organization-conclusions">48 Organization Conclusions</h4>
<p>“Ideal Organization” or “Pragmatism”?—The Need to Test
Assumptions—The Need for Simplicity—Focus on Key Results and Key
Activities—The Test: The Performance of People</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>RGANIZATION THEORISTS HAVE ARGUED for design should start out with an
“ideal organization” or</p>
<p>years whether organization whether it should be “prag-</p>
<p>matic.” Should “principles” come first? Or should the first
consideration be “fit” to the special needs, the exceptional situations,
the habits and traditions of an organization?</p>
<p>Our discussion of organizational building blocks, of design
specifications, and of de- sign principles leads to the conclusion that
the argument is pointless. Both approaches are needed and have to be
used in parallel. Organization design has to be grounded in an “ideal
organization,” that is, a conceptual framework. There has to be careful
work on defining and delineating the structural principles. This work,
in turn, must be grounded in the mission and purpose of the business,
its objectives, its strategies, its priorities, its key activities. But
there is no universal design principle. There is not even a best design
prin- ciple. Each principle makes stringent demands and has severe
limitations. Each has only limited scope; none embrace operating work,
top-management work, and innovation work in one design.</p>
<p>Reality, in all its complexity, therefore has to be probed in
designing organization. It has to be understood. The assumptions that
are being made, and especially the assump- tions that underlie the
“ideal organization design” have to be tested and validated. These
assumptions are always eminently plausible to the people within a
company. They are often held subconsciously—but their hold is all the
stronger for that. As long as one could assume that organization design
meant one basic principle or a combination of two (i.e., functional and
federal structures), development of an ideal organization could be
consid- ered the logical first step. Everybody knew of course that no
ideal organization could ever be achieved in reality; reality always
demands concessions, compromises, and exceptions. But one could hope to
come close to the ideal—with exceptions truly “exceptional,” that is,
infrequent and confined to purely local situations.</p>
<p>One can no longer assume this. The testing of basic assumptions
regarding organiza- tional reality has to proceed parallel to the
conceptual thinking about organization. Oth- erwise one ends up with an
ideal organization that, while “conceptually pure,” is inap- propeiate
and stultifies.</p>
<p>Two examples, both from the same major organizing task, illustrate
this:</p>
<p>In the GE organization of the early fifties, it was “obvious” to
everyone that any unit charged with “product responsibility” was
actually a “manufacturing business.” Yet as said before, there were
quite a few units that manufactured nothing but had been set up to
develop a new process or a new product line. These units had a
“customer”; they had “revenue” usually a governmental research and
development contract~ they had “per- formance responsibility.” But they
were not manufacturing businesses but innovative or-</p>
<p>ganizations. To set them up on the functional design of the typical
manufacturing business stifled them. This would have been clear to
everyone had the ideal design been tested. But it was far too obvious
for that.</p>
<p>The other GE assumption was that the general manager of a product
business would be an operating manager, as are the heads of the
automotive divisions of General Motors on which GE modeled its design.
But all GM automotive divisions are alike. GM, while a multi-market
business, is, in effect, a single-product business. GE, however, is one
of the most diversified companies in the world, in its technologies, its
processes, its products, and its markets. And most of GE’s product
businesses are the leaders in separate, distinct, large industries. The
GE general manager, therefore, is top management rather than oper- ating
management (on this see Chapter 51). Again, testing the assumptions
would have shown this at once. But without such a test GE set up general
managers, who did not have the team they needed to do their
top-management work, and autonomous businesses far too small in volume
and scope to support the top management they needed. That GE has been
constantly reorganizing its supposedly “definitive” organization
structure—in sharp contrast to the stability of Alfred Sloan’s design
for GM—is in large measure the result of failure to test plausible
assumptions.*</p>
<p>The approach to organization design through the ideal organization
structure, i.e., through a conceptual model, is not “theory.” It is
eminently practical. But the pragmatic approach through explicit
definition of assumptions and their testing in the reality of the
organization is not “muddling through” or “patchwork.” It is
theoretically sound in a situation in which there are conceptual
alternatives. Organization design is both concept and experimental
validation—or it is faulty design.</p>
<p>The Need for Simplicity</p>
<p>The simplest organization structure that will do the job is the best
one. What makes an organization structure “good” are the problems it
does not create. The simpler the struc- ture, the less that can go
wrong.</p>
<p>But there is neither a perfect nor a universal design principle. All
of them have limita- tions. Even the simplest business—a small- to
medium-sized company with one major product line for one major
market—will use at least two design principles: functional de- sign and
teams, the latter for top-management and innovative work and as a
complement to functionally organized work.</p>
<p>And to use, for the sake of simplicity or symmetry, a design
principle beyond its in- herent limits is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>To use functional structure for tasks for which team structure is
needed, in knowledge work or for genuine innovation, for instance, makes
for a “clean” structure. But it also makes for nonperformance.
Conversely, to use teams as the structural units for unchang- ing,
large-scale functional work causes only confusion. Jobs, in such work,
can then be— and often should be done in teams; but the work itself
always has to be specific and spe- cialized. And to set up a federally
decentralized unit that is not a genuine business will only confuse; for
all its limitations simulated decentralization will have to be used.</p>
<p>Some design principles are more difficult and problematical than
others. But none is without difficulties and problems. None is primarily
people-focused rather than task- focused; none is more “creative,”
“free,” or “more democratic.” Design principles are tools; and tools are
neither good nor bad in themselves. They can be used properly or
improperly; and that is all. To obtain both the greatest possible
simplicity and the greatest “fit,” organization design has to start out
with a clear focus on key activities needed to produce key results. They
have to be structured and positioned in the simplest possible design.
Above all, the architect of organization needs to keep in mind the
purpose of the structure he is designing. Organization is a means to an
end rather than an end itself. Sound structure is a prerequisite to
organizational health; but it is not health itself. The</p>
<p>*Since these remarks may be read as criticism of the work at GE, it
needs to be said that the author was closely connected with it; and what
seems so obvious now had yet to be learned in the early fifties.</p>
<p>test of a healthy business is not the beauty, clarity, or perfection
of its organization struc- ture. It is the performance of people.</p>
