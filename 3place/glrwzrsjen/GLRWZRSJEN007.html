Sears Story</h4>
<p>What Is a Business and How Is It Managed?—How Sears, Roebuck Became a
Busi- ness—Rosenwald’s Innovation—Inventing the Mail-Order Plant—General
Wood and Sears’s Second Phase—Merchandise Planning and Manager
Development—Sears’s Third Phase: From Selling to Buying to
Procurement—Class Markets and Mass Mar- kets—The Challenges Ahead</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>here are hundreds, if not thousands, of books on the management of
the various func- tions of a business—production, marketing, finance,
engineering, purchasing, per- sonnel, public relations, and so forth.
But what it is to manage a business, what man- agement is supposed to do
and how it should be doing it, are subjects which are rarely
discussed.</p>
<p>This oversight is no accident. It reflects the absence of both a
tenable theory of busi- ness enterprise and an adequate discipline of
management. Therefore, rather than theoriz- ing, we shall first look at
the conduct and behavior of an actual business enterprise. There is no
better illustration of what a business is and what managing it means
than one of America’s most successful enterprises: Sears, Roebuck and
Company.</p>
<p>With sales in excess of 0 billion, Sears is the largest retailer in
the world. It is by far the most profitable retail business anywhere and
altogether one of the most profitable companies in the American economy,
by any yardstick. Only Marks andandandand Spencer in Great Britain can
compare with Sears in terms, of success (see Chapter 8). But, Marks
andandandand Spencer is not only much smaller—barely one-tenth of Sears;
it also admittedly owes much of its success, especially in its earlier
years, to imitating Sears.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck has also been a major growth company, even though its
industry, the retail business, is, of course, old and well established,
and totally lacking in the glamour of high technology or scientific
innovation. No other business in America, not even Gen- eral Motors, has
shown such a consistent and sustained growth pattern since before the
turn of this century.</p>
<p>Sears is also a political phenomenon that deserves study. In an age
of consumerism, Sears would seem to be a prime target for consumer
attacks. Yet there has been no or lit- tle criticism. Sears controls,
through majority ownership, or through ownership of a sub- stantial
minority of the stock, the manufacturers of 60 percent of the
merchandise it sells. It would seem a prime target for antitrusters and
a glaring example of concentration of economic power. Yet there has
never been mention of an antitrust investigation of Sears, let alone an
antitrust suit.</p>
<p>The typical case studied in business schools is a case of failure, or
at least of prob- lems. But one can learn more from successes. It is far
more important to know the right thing to do than to know what to avoid
doing.</p>
<p>Sears became a business around the turn of the century with the
realization that the American farmer represented a separate and distinct
market. Separate because of his iso-</p>
<p>lation, which made existing channels of distribution virtually
inaccessible to him; distinct because of his specific needs, which, in
important respects, were different from those of the city consumer.
While the farmer’s purchasing power was individually low, it repre-
sented a tremendous, almost untapped, buying potential in the
aggregate.</p>
<p>To reach the farmer, a new distribution channel had to be created.
Merchandise had to be produced to answer his needs and wants. It had to
be brought to him at low price and with a guarantee of regular supply.
He had to be given a warranty of reliability and hon- esty on the part
of the supplier, since his physical isolation made it impossible for him
to inspect merchandise before delivery or to obtain redress if
cheated.</p>
<p>To create Sears, Roebuck as a business required analysis of customer
and market, and especially of what the farmer considered “value.”
Furthermore, it required major innova- tion in a number of distinct
areas.</p>
<p>First, it demanded systematic “merchandising,” that is, the finding
and developing of sources of supply for the particular goods the farmer
needed in the quality and quantity he needed and at a price he could
pay. Second, it required a mail-order catalog capable of serving as
adequate substitute for the shopping trips to the big city the farmer
could not make. For this reason, the catalog had to become a regular
publication, rather than an announcement of spectacular bargains at
irregular intervals. It had to break with the entire tradition of
selling by mail and learn not to high-pressure the farmer into buying by
exag- gerated claims, but to give him a factual description of the goods
offered. The aim had to be to create a permanent customer by convincing
him of the reliability of the catalog and of the company behind it; the
catalog had to become the “wish book” for the farmer.</p>
<p>Third, the age-old concept of caveat emptor had to be changed to
caveat vendor—the meaning of the famous Sears policy of “your money back
and no questions asked.”* Fourth, a way had to be found to fill large
quantities of customer orders cheaply and quickly. Without the
mail-order plant, conduct of the business would have been physically
impossible.</p>
<p>Finally, a human organization had to be built—and when Sears, Roebuck
started to become a business, most of the necessary human skills were
not available. There were, for instance, no buyers for this kind of
operation, no accountants versed in the new require- ments of inventory
control, no artists to illustrate the catalogs, no clerks experienced in
the handling of a huge volume of customer orders.</p>
<p>Richard Sears gave the company his name. He understood the needs of
the customer; and he brilliantly improvised to satisfy these needs. But
it was not he who made Sears, Roebuck into a business enterprise. In
fact, Richard Sears’s own operations could hardly be called a business.
He was a shrewd speculator, buying up distress-merchandise and offering
it, one batch at a time, through mail advertising. Every one of his
deals was a complete transaction in itself which, when finished,
liquidated itself and the business with it. Sears might have made a lot
of money for himself. But his way of operating could never have founded
a business, let alone perpetuate it. Indeed his success almost bank-
rupted him as it pushed his company far beyond the limit of his
managerial capacity. His company was about to go under when he sold it
to a total outsider, the Chicago clothing merchant Julius Rosenwald
(1862-1932).</p>
<p>Between 1895, when he took control, and 1905, when the Chicago
mail-order plant was opened, Rosenwald made a business enterprise out of
Sears. He analyzed the market, began the systematic development of
merchandise sources, and invented the regular, fac- tual mail-order
catalog and the policy of “satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.”
He built the productive human organization, and gave management people a
maximum of authority and full responsibility for results. Later he gave
every employee an ownership stake in the company, bought for him out of
profits. Rosenwald is the father not only of Sears, Roebuck but of the
distribution revolution which has changed the world economy in the
twentieth century and which is so vital a factor in economic growth.</p>
<p>*Customers, I am given to understand, actually return less
merchandise to Sears than to most of the large American department
stores—it’s the basic policy and what it expresses that makes the
difference.</p>
<p>Only one basic contribution to the early history of Sears was not
made by Rosenwald.</p>
<p>The Chicago mail-order plant was designed by Otto Doering in 1903.
Five years before Henry Ford’s it was the first modern mass-production
plant, complete with the breakdown of all work into simple repetitive
operations, with an assembly line, conveyor belt, stan- dardized,
interchangeable parts—and, above all, with planned plant-wide
scheduling.*</p>
<p>On these foundations, Sears had grown by the end of World War I into
a national in- stitution; its “wish book” was the only literature,
besides the Bible, to be found in many farm homes.</p>
<p>The next phase of the Sears story begins in the mid-twenties. Just as
the first chapter was dominated by one man, Julius Rosenwald, the second
chapter was dominated by an- other, General Robert E. Wood (1879-1969).
When Wood joined Sears, the original Sears market was changing rapidly.
The farmer was no longer isolated; the automobile had enabled him to go
to town and to shop there. He no longer formed a distinct market but
was, largely thanks to Sears, rapidly modifying his way of life and his
standard of living to conform to those of the urban middle class.</p>
<p>At the same time a vast urban market had come into being that was, in
its way, as iso- lated and as badly supplied as the farmer had been
twenty-five years earlier. The low- income groups in the cities had
outgrown both their subsistence standards and their dis- tinct
lower-class habits. They were acquiring the money and the desire to buy
the same goods as the middle and upper classes. The country was rapidly
becoming one big homo- geneous market—but the distribution system was
still one of separate and distinct class markets.</p>
<p>Wood had made this analysis even before he joined Sears. Out of it
came the decision to switch Sears’s emphasis to retail stores—equipped
to serve both the motorized farmer and the city population.</p>
<p>A whole series of innovations had to be undertaken to make this
decision viable. To the finding of sources of supply and to the purchase
of goods from them, merchandising had to add two new major functions:
the design of products and the development of manufacturers capable of
producing these products in large quantity. Class-market prod- ucts—for
instance, refrigerators in the twenties—had to be redesigned for a mass
market with limited purchasing power. Suppliers had to be created—often
with Sears money and Sears-trained management—to produce these goods.
This also required another important innovation: a basic policy for the
relations between Sears and its suppliers, especially those who depended
on the company’s purchases for the bulk of their business. Merchan- dise
planning and research and the systematic building of hundreds of small
suppliers capable of producing for a mass market had to be invented.
They are as basic to mass distribution in Sears’s second phase as mail
order and catalogs were in its first, and they were as distinct a
contribution to the American economy.</p>
<p>Retail selling also meant getting store managers. Mail-order selling
did not prepare a man for the management of a retail store. The greatest
bottleneck for the first ten or fif- teen years of Sears’s retail
operation—almost until World War II—was the shortage of managers. The
most systematic innovations had to be in the field of manager develop-
ment; and the Sears policies of the thirties became the starting point
for all the work in manager development now going on in industry.</p>
<p>Expansion into retail selling also meant radical innovations in
organization structure.</p>
<p>Mail-order selling is highly centralized; retail stores cannot be run
from headquarters two thousand miles away. They must be managed locally.
Only a few mail-order plants were needed to supply the country; Sears
today has over a thousand stores, each with its own market in its own
locality. A decentralized organization structure, methods of managing a
decentralized company, measuring the performance of store managers, and
maintaining corporate unity with maximum local autonomy—all these had to
be devised to make retail</p>
<p>*There is a persistent legend at Sears that Henry Ford before he
built his own first plant visited and carefully studied the then
brand-new Sears mail-order plant.</p>
<p>selling possible. And new compensation policies had to be found to
reward store manag- ers for performance.</p>
<p>Finally, Sears had to innovate in store location, architecture, and
physical arrange- ment. The traditional retail store was unsuited for
the Sears market. It was not just a mat- ter of putting the Sears store
on the outskirts of the city and of providing it with an ade- quate
parking lot. The whole concept of the retail store had to be changed. In
fact, few people even at Sears realize how far this innovation has gone
and how deeply it has influ- enced the shopping habits of the American
people as well as the physical appearance of our towns. The suburban
shopping center which appeared in the fifties as a radical inno- vation
in retail selling is but a logical extension of the concepts and methods
developed by Sears during the thirties.</p>
<p>The basic decisions underlying the expansion into retail stores were
taken in the mid- twenties; the basic innovations had been made by the
early thirties. This explains why Sears’s volume of business and its
profits grew right through the Depression and World War II.</p>
<p>In 1954 General Wood retired, though he retained influence in the
company for an- other ten years. No other long-term dominant chief
executive has emerged to replace him. Since Wood’s retirement Sears has
been run by a small team of men, a chairman, a presi- dent, and an
executive vice-president. Without exception, these members of the top
team retire after five to seven years in office rather than, like
Rosenwald or Wood, holding power for twenty or thirty years.</p>
<p>The changes these successor managements brought about are almost as
profound as those wrought by Rosenwald and Wood. They also redefined
Sears’s business. Under General Wood, Sears was moving from being a
seller to being a buyer. Under his succes- sors, Sears has redefined
itself as a maker for the American family. Increasingly the em- phasis
is on Sears as the informed, responsible producer who designs for the
American family the things it needs and wants. Today Sears’s capital
investment probably centers in the manufacturing plants it owns and
controls—even though retail-store expansion has been pursued
vigorously.</p>
<p>Sears again and again changed the definition of its market in line
with the shifting pat- terns of the American population. Rosenwald made
available mass goods to a new, emerging mass market. Wood made available
to this mass market what earlier had been class-market goods, e.g.,
kitchen appliances. In the last twenty years Sears has shifted to a view
of the American market in which there is no class market any more; it
now operates on the assumption that the American middle class is, in its
economic behavior, actually upper class. Sears has thus greatly widened
its product scope. Of course, Sears still carries appliances in its
stores—and they probably are still the largest-selling product category.
Sears has, however, also become the world’s biggest diamond merchant,
one of the coun- try’s biggest booksellers, and a large buyer and seller
of original art objects, such as draw- ings, prints, and paintings.</p>
<p>General Wood had taken Sears into automobile insurance, which he
rightly considered just as much an automobile accessory as brake lining
or windshield wipers. His succes- sors have added property insurance of
all kinds. They have added a mutual fund to serve the new mass-capital
market. They have gone into the travel business, and so on. In other
words, Sears no longer defines its business as goods. It is defined as
the needs, wants, and satisfactions of the American middle-class
family.</p>
<p>Julius Rosenwald and, far more aggressively, General Wood had moved
into control- ling key manufacturers as the only way to make sure of the
quality Sears needed, of the quantities its tremendous distribution
system required, and of the lowest possible price for the customers.
This is still the rationale given at Sears for ownership or control of
manu- facturing sources. But it would probably be more correct to
describe the source relation- ship of Sears, Roebuck of today as
procurement rather than as buying. The emphasis has steadily shifted
toward a long-range strategy which anticipates what tomorrow’s Ameri-
can family will be and what it will require, and then designs and
develops the appropriate products or services. Sears today may be the
first truly marketing-focused manufacturing</p>
<p>business in the U.S:, practicing what most manufacturing businesses
so far only preach, that is, the total marketing approach. To this
marketing strategy, focused on creating the sources of supply rather
than on selling products to the public, Sears owes both its tre- mendous
growth in sales and its profitability.</p>
<p>Yet Sears today faces new challenges which will require innovation
and strategic thinking fully as much as the developments of the
past.</p>
<p>From the beginning Sears has been keenly aware of basic population
trends in the United States. Wood’s favorite management tool was a
“little black book” full of popula- tion statistics and population
projections. Julius Rosenwald, too, had built his business on population
analysis and population trends. The Sears policy, all along, has been to
find the majority market and to convert it into a true mass market.</p>
<p>There may be a market shift ahead in America, and Sears may not be
strategically po- sitioned for it. By the mid-1970s the young educated
families, whose breadwinners make their living as knowledge workers,
will dominate the American market. Even if Sears can transfer to them
the special relationship it has had with their parents, the blue-collar
workers of the big industrial cities, Sears does not make, buy, or sell
in the areas in which their needs may be greatest and their spending
likely to go up the fastest. Sears is still primarily thing-focused,
primarily a maker, buyer, and seller of manufactured goods. The young
educated families have a healthy appetite for goods; but in their
spending behavior and values, they are upper-upper rather than upper
class, even if their incomes are only average. This means that the major
growth areas in their budgets may not be goods but information and
education, health care, travel and leisure, reliable financial advice
and services, and guidance on job and career choices. These, too, are
wants and needs of the American family; these, too, are areas in which
the American family needs an informed and responsible buyer. But these,
by and large, are not areas in which Sears has estab- lished itself as
the responsible maker and buyer.</p>
<p>Sears, further, has always looked upon its market as homogeneous.
Sears has not been bothered by the fact that minority segments of the
market were not its customers. Neither the very poor nor the very rich
shop at Sears. But it has taken for granted that the bulk of the
population buys the same . merchandise, considers the same things of
value, and alto- gether shares a common economic profile and a common
economic psychology. This may no longer be true. There are signs that
the American market is fragmenting into a number of big segments with
significant differences in buying behavior and economic values be- tween
them. For such a development, Sears would seem to be quite
unprepared.</p>
<p>Sears began in the forties to expand beyond the American frontier,
into Canada, then into Latin America. In the sixties it went into Spain.
It has acquired minority interests in retail stores in other European
countries. There are persistent rumors that it plans to ex- pand into
Japan. But so far, Sears is still an American rather than a
multinational business. It will have to face up to a difficult and risky
decision. If it stays American, it faces the serious possibility of a
steady slowdown in its growth and profitability as non-goods be- come
increasingly important in the family budget of the American middle
class. If it de- cides to become truly multinational, Sears would have
to choose in what countries and markets the Sears mass-marketing
approach can make the greatest contribution. It would then have to think
through what policies—from store design to merchandising to the
structure of the relationship to foreign countries, their governments,
their manufacturers, their investors—this would require. And Sears would
undoubtedly have to learn to apply the same basic approaches and
principles quite differently in different markets and differ- ent
cultures.</p>
<p>If Sears wants to maintain its leadership position and its capacity
to grow, it faces ma- jor new challenges and may have to redefine what
its business is, where its markets are, and where innovations are
needed.</p>
<p>The right answers are always obvious in retrospect. The basic lesson
of the Sears story is that the right answers are likely to be anything
but obvious before they have proven themselves. “Everybody knew” around
1900 that to promise “satisfaction guaranteed or your money back” could
bring only financial disaster to a retailer. “Everybody knew”</p>
<p>around 1925 that the American market was sharply segmented into
distinct income groups, each buying different things in different
places. “Everybody knew”—as late as 1950—that the American consumer
wanted to shop downtown, and so on.</p>
<p>Even more important as a lesson from the Sears story is the knowledge
that the right answers are not the result of brilliance or of
“intuition.” Richard Sears had both—and failed. The right answers are
the result of asking the right questions. And this in turn re- quires
hard, systematic work to understand what a business is and what “our”
business is.</p>
