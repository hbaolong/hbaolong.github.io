<h4 id="the-emergence-of-management">1 The Emergence of Management</h4>
<p>The Society of Institutions—From 1900 to 1970—The Employee
Society—The Need for New Social and Political Theory—Management: The
Organ of Institutions— Responsibility the Essence—From Business Society
to Pluralist Society—Why Busi- ness Management Has to Be the
Focus—Business Management the Exemplar— Business Management the Success
Story—The Emergence of Management a Pivotal Event</p>
<p>DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, society in every developed country has
be- come a society of institutions. Every major social task, whether
economic perform- ance or health care, education or the protection of
the environment, the pursuit of new knowledge or defense, is today being
entrusted to big organizations, designed for perpetuity and managed by
their own managements. On the performance of these institu- tions, the
performance of modern society—if not the survival of each individual—
increasingly depends.</p>
<p>Only seventy-five years ago such a society would have been
inconceivable. In the so- ciety of 1900 the family still served in every
single country as the agent of, and organ for, most social tasks.
Institutions were few and small. The society of 1900, even in the most
highly institutionalized country (e.g., Imperial Germany), still
resembled the Kansas prai- rie. There was one eminence, the central
government. It loomed very large on the hori- zon—not because it was
large but because there was nothing else around it. The rest of society
was diffused in countless molecules: small workshops, small schools, the
individ- ual professional—whether doctor or lawyer practicing by
himself, the farmer, the crafts- man, the neighborhood retail store, and
so on. There were the beginnings of big busi- ness—but only the
beginnings. And what was then considered a giant business would strike
us today as very small indeed.</p>
<p>The octopus which so frightened the grandparents of today’s
Americans, Rockefeller’s giant Standard Oil Trust, was split into
fourteen parts by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, on the eve of America’s entry into World War II,
every single one of these fourteen Standard Oil daughters had become at
least four times as large as the octo- pus when the Supreme Court
divided it—in employment, in capital, in sales, and in every other
aspect. Yet, among these fourteen there were only three major oil
companies— Jersey Standard, Mobil, and Standard of California. The other
seven were small to fair- sized, playing little or no role in the world
economy and only a limited role in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>While business has grown in these seventy years, other institutions
have grown much faster. There was no university in the world before 1914
that had much more than 6,000 students—and only a handful that had more
than 5,000. Today the university of 6,000 students is a pygmy; there are
even some who doubt that it is viable. The hospital, simi- larly, has
grown from a marginal institution to which the poor went to die into the
center of health care and a giant in its own right—and also into one of
the most complex social</p>
<p>institutions around. Labor unions, research institutes, and many
others have similarly grown to giant size and complexity.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s the citizens of Zurich built themselves a splendid
City Hall, which they confidently believed would serve the needs of the
city for all time to come. Indeed, it was bitterly attacked by
conservatives as gross extravagance, if not as megalomania. Gov- ernment
in Switzerland has grown far less than in any other country in the
world. Yet the Zurich City Hall long ago ceased to be adequate to house
all the offices of the city ad- ministration. By now, these offices
occupy ten times or more the space that seventy-five years ago seemed so
splendid—if not extravagant.</p>
<p>The Employee Society</p>
<p>The citizen of today in every developed country is typically an
employee. He works for one of the institutions. He looks to them for his
livelihood. He looks to them for his op- portunities. He looks to them
for access to status and function in society, as well as for personal
fulfillment and achievement.</p>
<p>The citizen of 1900 if employed worked for a small family-type
operation; the small pop-and-mom store employing a helper or two; the
family household; and so on. And of course, the great majority of people
in those days, except in the most highly industrialized countries—such
as Britain or Belgium—worked on the farm.</p>
<p>Our society has become an employee society. In the early 1900s people
asked, “What do you do?” Today they tend to ask, “Whom do you work
for?”</p>
<p>We have neither political nor social theory for the society of
institutions and its new pluralism. It is, indeed, incompatible with the
political and social theories which still dominate our view of society
and our approach to political and social issues. We still use as
political and social model what the great thinkers of the late sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, Bodin, Locke, Hume, and Harrington, codified:
the society which knows no power centers and no autonomous institution,
save only one central government. Reality has long outgrown this
model—but it is still the only one we have.</p>
<p>A new theory to fit the new reality will be a long time coming. For
new theory, to be more than idle speculation and vague dreaming, must
come after the event. It codifies what we have already learned, have
already achieved, have already done. But we cannot wait till we have the
theory we need. We have to act. We have to use the little we know. And
there is one thing we do know: management is the specific organ of the
new institu- tion whether business enterprise or university, hospital or
armed service, research lab or government agency. If institutions are to
function, managements must perform.</p>
<p>The word “management” is a singularly difficult one. It is, in the
first place, specifi- cally American and can hardly be translated into
any other language, not even into British English. It denotes a function
but also the people who discharge it. It denotes a social position and
rank but also a discipline and field of study.</p>
<p>But even within the American usage, management is not adequate as a
term, for insti- tutions other than business do not speak of management
or managers, as a rule. Universi- ties or government agencies have
administrators, as have hospitals. Armed services have commanders. Other
institutions speak of executives, and so on.</p>
<p>Yet all these institutions have in common the management function,
the management task, and the management work. All of them require
management. And in all of them, management is the executive, the active
organ.</p>
<p>The institution itself is, in effect, a fiction. It is an accounting
reality, but not a social reality. When this or that government agency
makes this ruling or this decision, we know perfectly well that it is
some people within the agency who make the ruling or the deci- sion and
who act for the agency and as the effective organ of the agency. When we
speak of General Electric closing a plant, it is not, of course, General
Electric that is deciding and acting, it is a group of managers within
the company.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens, who built the Deutsche Bank into the European
continent’s leading financial institution in the decade between 1870 and
1880 (see Chapter 49, “Georg Sie-</p>
<p>mens and the Deutsche Bank”), once said, “Without management, a bank
is so much scrap, fit only to be liquidated.” Without institution there
is no management. But without management there is no institution.
Management is the specific organ of the modern insti- tution. It is the
organ on the performance of which the performance and the survival of
the institution depend.</p>
<p>Management Is Professional</p>
<p>We further know that management is independent of ownership, rank, or
power. It is ob- jective function and ought to be grounded in the
responsibility for performance. It is pro- fessional—management is a
function, a discipline, a task to be done; and managers are the
professionals who practice this discipline, carry out the functions, and
discharge these tasks. It is no longer relevant whether the manager is
also an owner; if he is, it is inciden- tal to his main function, which
is to be a manager. Eiichi Shibusawa’s Confucian ideal of the
“professional manager” in the early days of modern Japan (see Chapter 2)
has become reality. And so has Shibusawa’s basic insight that the
essence of the manager is neither wealth nor rank, but
responsibility.</p>
<p>From Business Society to Pluralism</p>
<p>The rhetoric of the New Left talks of our society as being a
big-business society. But this is as outdated as the rhetoric of the New
Left is altogether. Society in the West was a business
society—seventy-five years ago. Then business was, indeed, the most
powerful of all institutions—more powerful even than some governments.
Since the turn of the cen- tury, however, the importance of business has
gone down steadily—not because business has become smaller or weaker,
but because the other institutions have grown so much faster. Society
has become pluralist.</p>
<p>In the United States in the 1970s, no businessman compares in power
or visibility with the tycoons of 1900, such as J. P. Morgan, John J.
Rockefeller, or—a little later—Henry Ford. Few people today even know
the names of the chief executive officers of America’s biggest
corporations; the names of the tycoons were household words. Not even
the larg- est corporation today can compare in power and even in
relative wealth with those ty- coons who could hold the U.S. government
for ransom.</p>
<p>It makes little sense to speak of the “military-industrial complex.”
The high level of defense spending in the United States has for many
years been an economic depressant. It would make more sense to speak of
the “military-university complex.” No business to- day—in fact, no
business in American history—has a fraction of the power that today’s
big university has. By granting or denying admission or the college
degree, the university grants or denies access to jobs and livelihoods.
Such power no business—and no other institution—ever had before in
American history. Indeed, no earlier institution would ever have been
permitted such power.</p>
<p>In Europe things are only slightly different. Business career, have
become respectable to a degree unknown in 1900. They have gained
equality with careers in government, in academic life, or in the
military—all of which ranked socially much higher seventy-five years
ago. But still there is no one in French business today whose influence
and power can compare with that of the DeWendel family of steelmakers in
the France of the Third Republic, or with the power which a few families
of the Haute Banque exercised through their control of the Banque de
France and of French money and credit policy. There is no businessman
and no business enterprise in Germany today that can compare in power
and influence with the Krupps and other steel barons of 1900, or with I.
G. Farben in the 1920s. There is no business executive in today’s
England who can compare in power and influence with the merchant banking
families who, almost down to the 1930s, ran the Bank of England and,
through it, the British Treasury, as family fiefs.</p>
<p>Of all contemporary societies, Japan can most nearly be described as
a business soci- ety. Business management has greater influence in Japan
than in any other developed country. But even in Japan, there is no
business manager today and no business enterprise</p>
<p>whose power and influence stand comparison with the power and
influence which the great Zaibatsu concerns of 1900 or 1920—Mitsubishi,
Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Yasuda— exerted on economy and society alike.</p>
<p>In the United States of 1900, almost the only career opportunity open
to the young and ambitious was business. Today there are untold others,
each promising as much (or more) income, and advancement as rapid as a
career in business.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century, whatever of the gross national
product did not go to the farmer went in and through the private
business economy. The non-business service institutions, beginning with
government, accounted probably for no more than 10 percent of the
non-farm gross national product of the United States at the turn of the
century and up till World War I. Today, while farming has largely become
a business, more than half of the gross national product goes to or
through service institutions which are not busi- nesses and which are
not held accountable for economic performance nor subject to mar- ket
test.</p>
<p>Well over a third of the gross national product in the United States
today goes directly to governments, federal, state, and local. Another 3
to 5 percent goes to nongovernmental schools, that is, private and
parochial, including the nongovernmental colleges and uni- versities.
Another 5 percent of GNP, that is, two-thirds of the total health-care
bill, is also nongovernmental, but also non-business. On top of this,
there is a great variety of not-for- profit activities, accounting maybe
for another 2 to 5 percent of gross national product. This adds up to 50
or perhaps as much as 60 percent of the GNP which does not go to the
business sector but to, or through, public-service institutions.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the New Left talks of the big-business society, its
actions show a keen awareness that business is not the dominant
institution. Every period of public unrest since the end of the
Napoleonic Wars began with uprisings against business. But the re- volt
against authority that swept the developed countries in the sixties
centered in the in- stitutions—especially the university—which were most
esteemed by yesterday’s radicals and which were, so to speak, the good
guys of organization thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>The non-business, public-service institutions do not need management
less than busi- ness. They may need it more.</p>
<p>There is growing concern with management in non-business
institutions. Among the best clients of the large American management
consulting firms these last ten or fifteen years have been government
agencies such as the Department of Defense, the city of New York, or the
Bank of England. When Canada in the late sixties first created a unified
mili- tary service, with army, navy, and air force all combined, the
first conference of Canadian generals and admirals was not on strategy;
it was on “management by objectives.” The venerable orders of the
Catholic Church are engaged in organization studies and in man- agement
development, with the Jesuits in the lead.</p>
<p>A generation or two ago, the German civil service knew that it had
the answers. But now, the city of Hamburg—long known for its excellence
in public administration—has created a management center for its civil
service and has made management the responsi- bility of one of the
senior members of the city’s government. Even the British civil service
has been reorganized with the objective of introducing “management.”</p>
<p>An increasing number of students in advanced management courses are
not business executives but executives from hospitals, from the armed
services, from city and state governments, and from school
administrations. The Harvard Business School even runs an increasingly
popular advanced management course for university presidents.</p>
<p>The management of the non-business institutions will indeed be a
growing concern from now on. Their management may well become the
central management problem— simply because the lack of management of the
public-service institution is such a glaring weakness, whether municipal
water department or graduate university.</p>
<p>And yet, business management is the exemplar. And any book on
management, such as this one, has to put business management in the
center.</p>
<p>Why Business Management Has to Be the Focus</p>
<p>One reason is history. Business enterprise was the first of the
modern institutions to emerge. From the beginning, that is, from the
emergence of the railroads and the “univer- sal banks” as large
businesses in the late nineteenth century, business enterprise was un-
mistakably a new and different institution rather than an outgrowth of
older ones, as were apparently government agency, university, hospital,
and armed service. There was, of course, concern about management in
other institutions.* But until recently it was spo- radic and undertaken
usually in connection with an acute problem and confined to it. But the
work on management in business and industry was from the beginning meant
to be generic and continuous.</p>
<p>Another reason why the study of management to this day has primarily
been a study of business management is that so far the economic sphere
alone has measurements both for the allocation of resources and for the
results of decisions. Profitability is not a perfect measurement; no one
has even been able to define it, and yet it is a measurement, despite
all its imperfections. None of the other institutions has measurements
so far. All they have are opinions—which are hardly an adequate
foundation for a discipline.</p>
<p>The most important reason for focusing on business management is that
it is the suc- cess story of this century. It has performed within its
own sphere. It has provided eco- nomic goods and services to an extent
that would have been unimaginable to the genera- tion of 1900. And it
has performed despite world wars, depressions, and dictatorships.</p>
<p>The achievement of business management enables us today to
promise—perhaps pre- maturely (and certainly rashly)—the abolition of
the grinding poverty that has been man- kind’s lot through the ages. It
is largely the achievement of business management that advanced
societies today can afford mass higher education. Business both produces
the economic means to support this expensive undertaking and offers the
jobs in which knowledge can become productive and can be paid for. That
we today consider it a social flaw and an imperfection of society for
people to be fixed in their opportunities and jobs by class and
birth—where only yesterday this was the natural and apparently
inescapable condition of mankind—is a result of our economic
performance, that is, of the perform- ance of business management. In a
world that is politically increasingly fragmented and obsessed by
nationalism, business management is one of the very few institutions
capable of transcending national boundaries.</p>
<p>The multinational corporation brings together in a common venture
management peo- ple from a great many countries with different
languages, cultures, traditions, and values, and unites them in a common
purpose. It is one of the very few institutions of our world that is not
nationalistic in its world view, its values, and its decisions; but
truly a common organ of a world economy that, so far, lacks a world
polity.</p>
<p>It is also business management to which our society increasingly
looks for leadership in respect to the quality of life. Indeed, what
sounds like harsh criticism of business man- agement tends often to be
the result of high, perhaps unrealistically high, expectations based on
the past performance of business management. “If you can do so well, why
don’t you do better?” is the underlying note.</p>
<p>This book will discuss performance in the non-business service
institution at consider- able length—a whole section of four chapters is
devoted to it. I will stress again and again that managing the service
institution is likely to be the frontier of management for the rest of
this century. But the foundation of any work on management has to be
business man- agement.</p>
<p>The emergence of management may be the pivotal event of our time, far
more impor- tant than all the events that make the headlines. Rarely, if
ever, has a new basic institution, a new leading group, a new central
function, emerged as fast as has management since the turn of the
century. Rarely in human history has a new institution proven
indispensable so</p>
<p>The work of Elihu Root as Secretary of War on the organizalion of the
General Staff of the U.S. Army is an American example; the work of
Adickes and Micquel as big-city mayors and ministers of the Crown on
local government in Germany is another; both were done between 1900 and
1910.</p>
<p>quickly. Even less often has a new institution arrived with so little
opposition, so little disturbance, so little controversy. And never
before has a new institution encompassed the globe as management has,
sweeping across boundaries of race and creed, language and traditions,
within the lifetime of many men still living and at work.</p>
<p>Today’s developed society, sans aristocracy, sans large landowners,
even sans capital- ists and tycoons, depends for leadership on the
managers of its major institutions. It de- pends on their knowledge, on
their vision, and on their responsibility. In this society,
management—its tasks, its responsibilities, its practices—is central: as
a need, as an es- sential contribution, and as a subject of study and
knowledge.</p>
