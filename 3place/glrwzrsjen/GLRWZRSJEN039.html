<p>The Japanese Way—The Essentials—Facts or Opinions?—What is the
Appropriate Measurement?—The Need for Dissent and Alternatives—The Trap
of “Being Right” —Is a Decision Necessary?—Who Has to Do the Work?—The
Right and the Wrong Compromise—The Feedback—Decision-making Is Effective
Action</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>XECUTIVES DO MANY THINGS in addition to making decisions. But only
execu- tives make decisions. The first managerial skill is, therefore,
the making of effective decisions.</p>
<p>There are countless books on the techniques of decision-making.
Complex logical and mathematical tools have been developed for the
decision-making process. But there is little concern with the essential
process itself. What is a “decision”? What are the impor- tant elements
in it?</p>
<p>The only people who have developed a systematic and standardized
approach to deci- sion-making are the Japanese. Their decisions are
highly effective. Yet their approach violates every, rule in the books
on decision-making. Indeed, according to the books, the Japanese should
never be able to arrive at a decision, let alone an effective one. It
might., therefore, be fruitful to take a look at the Japanese way of
decision-making in order to find out what the elements of the process
are.</p>
<p>How the Japanese Make Decisions</p>
<p>If there is one point on which all authorities on Japan are in
agreement, it is that Japanese institutions, whether business or
government agencies, make decisions by consensus. The Japanese, we are
told, debate a proposed decision throughout the organization until there
is agreement on it. And only then do they make the decision.</p>
<p>This, every experienced Western manager will say with a shudder, is
not for us, how- ever well it might work for the Japanese. This approach
can lead only to indecision or politicking, or at best to an innocuous
compromise which offends no one but also solves nothing. And if proof of
this were needed, the American might add, the history of Presi- dent
Lyndon B. Johnson’s attempt to obtain a consensus would supply it.</p>
<p>But what stands out in Japanese history, as well as in today’s
Japanese management behavior, is the capacity for making 180-degree
turns—that is, for reaching radical and highly controversial decisions.
Let me illustrate:</p>
<p>No country was more receptive to Christianity than sixteenth-century
Japan. Indeed, the hope of the Portuguese missionaries that Japan would
become the first Christian coun- try outside of Europe was by no means
just wishful thinking. Yet the same Japan made a 180-degree turn in the
early seventeenth century. Within a few years it completely sup- pressed
Christianity and shut itself off from all foreign influences—indeed,
from all con-</p>
<p>*This chapter draws heavily on my earlier book, The Effective
Executive.</p>
<p>tact with the outside world—and stayed that way for 250 years. Then,
in the Meiji Resto- ration of 1867, Japan executed another 180-degree
turn and opened itself to the West— something no other non-European
country managed to do.</p>
<p>Toyo Rayon (Toray), the largest Japanese manufacturer of man-made
fibers, made nothing but rayon as late as the mid-1950s. Then it decided
to switch to synthetic fibers. But it did not phase out rayon making, as
every Western company in a similar situation has done. Instead, it
closed its rayon mills overnight, even though, under the Japanese system
of employment, it could not lay off a single man.</p>
<p>As late as 1966, when I discussed this matter with its officials, the
Ministry of Interna- tional Trade and Industry was adamantly opposed to
any Japanese companies going mul- tinational and making investments in
manufacturing affiliates abroad. But three years later, the same
ministry officials, working for the same conservative government, had
turned around completely and were pushing Japanese manufacturing
investments abroad.</p>
<p>The key to this apparent contradiction is that the Westerner and the
Japanese mean something different when they talk of “making a decision.”
In the West, all the emphasis is on the answer to the question. Indeed,
our books on decision-making try to develop systematic approaches to
giving an answer. To the Japanese, however, the important ele- ment in
decision-making is defining the question. The important and crucial
steps are to decide whether there is a need for a decision and what the
decision is about. And it is in this step that the Japanese aim at
attaining consensus. Indeed, it is this step that, to the Japanese, is
the essence of the decision. The answer to the question (what the West
con- siders the decision) follows from its definition.</p>
<p>During the process that precedes the decision, no mention is made of
what the answer might be. This is done so that people will not be forced
to take sides; once they have taken sides, a decision would be a victory
for one side and a defeat for the other. Thus the whole process is
focused on finding out what the decision is really about, not what the
decision should be. Its result is a meeting of the minds that there is
(or is not) a need for a change in behavior.</p>
<p>All of this takes a long time, of course. The Westerner dealing with
the Japanese is thoroughly frustrated during the process. He does not
understand what is going on. He has the feeling that he is being given
the runaround.</p>
<p>To take a specific example, it is very hard for a U.S. executive to
understand why the Japanese with whom he is negotiating on, say, a
license agreement, keep on sending new groups of people every few months
who start what the Westerner thinks are “negotia- tions” as if they had
never heard of the subject. One delegation takes copious notes and goes
back home, only to be succeeded six weeks later by another team of
people from different areas of the company who again act as if they had
never heard of the matter un- der discussion, take copious notes, and go
home.</p>
<p>Actually—though few of my Western friends believe it—this is a sign
that the Japa- nese take the matter seriously. They are trying to
involve the people who will have to carry out an eventual agreement in
the process of obtaining consensus that a license is indeed needed. Only
when all of the people who will have to carry out the agreement have
come together on the need to make a decision will the decision be made
to go ahead. Only then do negotiations really start—and then the
Japanese usually move with great speed.</p>
<p>There is a complete account of this process at work—though it does
not concern a business decision. The account deals with the decision to
go to war against the United States in 1941.*</p>
<p>When the Japanese reach the point we call a decision, they say they
are in the action stage. Now top management refers the decision to what
the Japanese call the “appropriate people.” Determination of who these
people are is a top-management decision. On that decision depends the
specific answer to the problem that is to be worked out. For, during the
course of the discussions leading up to the consensus, it has become
quite clear what</p>
<p>*See Japan’s Decision for War, Records of the 1941 Policy
Conferences, translated and edited by Nobutaka Ike (Stanford University
Press, 1967).</p>
<p>basic approaches certain people or certain groups would take to the
problem. Top man- agement, by referring the question to one group or the
other, in effect picks the answer— but an answer which by now will
surprise no one.</p>
<p>This referral to the appropriate people is as crucial as the parallel
decision in the U.S.</p>
<p>political process which baffles any foreign observer of American
government—the deci- sion to which committee or subcommittee of the
Congress a certain bill is to be assigned. This decision is not to be
found in any of the books on U.S. government and politics. Yet, as every
American politician knows, it is the crucial step which decides whether
the bill is to become law and what form it will take. For each
committee—the one on Agriculture, for instance, or the one on Banking
and Finance—has its own well-known point of view, its own “constituents”
to whom it is willing to listen, and its own preferences, taboos, and
sacred cows.</p>
<p>What are the advantages of this process? And what can we learn from
it?</p>
<p>In the first place, it makes for very effective decisions. While it
takes much longer in Japan to reach a decision than it takes in the
West, from that point on they do better than we do. After making a
decision, we in the West spend much time “selling” it and getting people
to act on it. Only too often either the decision is sabotaged by the
organization or, what may be worse, it takes so long to make the
decision truly effective that it becomes obsolete, if not outright
wrong, by the time the people in the organization actually make it
operational.</p>
<p>The Japanese, by contrast, need to spend absolutely no time on
selling a decision.</p>
<p>Everybody has been pre-sold. Also, their process makes it clear where
in the organization a certain answer to a question will be welcomed and
where it will be resisted. Therefore, there is plenty of time to work on
persuading the dissenters, or on making small conces- sions to them
which will win them over without destroying the integrity of the
decision.</p>
<p>Every Westerner who has done business with the Japanese has learned
that the appar- ent inertia of the negotiating stage, with its endless
delays and endless discussion of the same points, is followed by a speed
of action that leaves him hanging on the ropes.</p>
<p>It may take three years before a licensing agreement can be reached,
during which time there is no discussion of terms, no discussion of what
products the Japanese plan to make, no discussion of what knowledge and
help they might need. And then, within four weeks, the Japanese are
ready to go into production and make demands on their Western partner
for information and people which he is totalty unprepared to meet. Now
it is the Japanese who complain, and bitterly, about the “endless delay
and procrastination” of the Westerner. For they understand our way of
making a decision and acting on it no better than we understand their
way of considering a decision and acting on it.</p>
<p>The Japanese process is focused on understanding the problem. The
desired end result is action and behavior on the part of people. This
almost guarantees that all the alterna- tives will be considered. It
rivets management attention to essentials. It does not permit commitment
until management has decided what the decision is all about. Japanese
man- agers may come up with the wrong answer to the problem (as was the
decision to go to war against the United States in 1941), but they
rarely come up with the right answer to the wrong problem. And that, as
all decision-makers learn, is the most dangerous course, the
irretrievably wrong decision.</p>
<p>Above all, their system forces the Japanese to make big decisions. It
is much too cum- bersome to be put to work on minor matters. It takes
far too many people far too long to be wasted on anything but truly
important matters leading to real changes in policies and behavior.
Small decisions, even obviously needed, are very often not being made at
all in Japan for that reason.</p>
<p>With us it is the small decisions which are easy to make—decisions
about things that do not greatly matter. Anyone who knows Western
businesses, government agencies, or educational institutions knows that
their managers make far too many small decisions as a rule. And nothing
causes as much trouble in an organization as a lot of small decisions.
Whether the decision concerns moving the water cooler from one end of
the hall to the</p>
<p>other or the phasing out of one’s oldest business makes little
emotional difference. One decision takes as much time and generates as
much heat as the other.</p>
<p>To contrast the Japanese approach and the Western approach, let me
illustrate: I once watched a Japanese company work through a proposal
for a joint venture received from a well-known American company, with
whom the Japanese had done business for many years. The Orientals did
not even discuss the joint venture at the outset. They started out with
the question “Do we have to change the basic directions of our
business?” As a re- sult, a consensus emerged that change was desirable;
management decided to go out of a number of old businesses and start in
a number of new technologies and markets; the joint venture was to be
one element of a major new strategy. Until the Japanese understood that
the decision was really about the direction of the business, and that
there was need for a decision on that, they did not once, among
themselves, discuss the desirability of the joint venture or the terms
on which it might be set up.</p>
<p>In the West we are moving in the Japanese direction. At least, this
is what the many task forces, long range plans, strategies, and other
approaches are trying to accomplish. But we do not build into the
development of these projects the selling which the Japanese process
achieves before the decision. This explains in large measure why so many
bril- liant reports of task forces and planners never get beyond the
planning stage.</p>
<p>U.S. executives expect task forces and long-range planning groups to
come up with recommendations—that is, to commit themselves to one
alternative. The groups decide on an answer and then document it. To the
Japanese, however, the most important step is understanding the
alternatives available. They are as opinionated as we are. But they dis-
cipline themselves not to commit themselves to a recommendation until
they have fully defined the question and used the process of obtaining
consensus to bring out the full range of alternatives. As a result, they
are far less likely to become prisoners of their pre- conceived answers
than we are.</p>
<p>What are the essentials of the Japanese method of decision-making?
First the focus is on deciding what the decision is all about. The
Japanese do not focus on giving an an-</p>
<p>swer; they focus on defining the question.</p>
<p>The Japanese, second, bring out dissenting opinions; because there is
no discussion of the answer till there is consensus, a wide variety of
opinions and approaches is being ex-</p>
<p>plored.</p>
<p>Third, the focus is on alternatives rather than on the “right
solution.” The process fur- ther brings out at what level and by whom a
certain decision should be made. And finally, it eliminates selling a
decision. It builds effective execution into the decision-making</p>
<p>The specific Japanese system is, indeed, sui generis. It could not be
used elsewhere but presupposes the unique social organization of Japan
and of Japanese institutions. But the principles which the Japanese put
to work in their decision-making process are gener- ally applicable.
They are the essentials of effective decision-making.</p>
<p>Facts or Opinions?</p>
<p>A decision is a judgment. It is a choice between alternatives. It is
rarely a choice between right and wrong. It is at best a choice between
“almost right” and “probably wrong”—but much more often a choice between
two courses of action neither of which is provably more nearly right
than the other.</p>
<p>Most books on decision-making tell the reader: “First find the
facts.” But managers who make effective decisions know that one does not
start with facts. One starts with opinions. These are, of course,
nothing but untested hypotheses and, as such, worthless unless tested
against reality. To determine what is a fact requires first a decision
on the criteria of relevance, especially on the appropriate measurement.
This is the hinge of the effective decision, and usually its most
controversial aspect. But also, the effective deci- sion does not, as so
many tests on decision-making proclaim, flow from a “consensus on the
facts.” The understanding that underlies the right decision grows out of
the clash and</p>
<p>conflict of divergent opinions and out of the serious consideration
of competing alterna- tives.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are few things as futile—and as damaging—as the
right answer to the wrong question.</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker also knows that he starts out with
opinions anyhow. The only choice he has is between using opinions as a
productive factor in the decision- making process and deceiving himself
into false objectivity. People do not start out with the search for
facts. They start out with an opinion. There is nothing wrong with this.
People experienced in an area should be expected to have an opinion. Not
to have an opinion after having been exposed to an area for a good long
time would argue an unob- servant eye and a sluggish mind.</p>
<p>People inevitably start out with an opinion; to ask them to search
for the facts first is even undesirable. They will simply do what
everyone is far too prone to do anyhow: look for the facts that fit the
conclusion they have already reached. And no one has ever failed to find
the facts he is looking for. The good statistician knows this and
distrusts all fig- ures—he either knows the fellow who found them or he
does not know him; in either case he is suspicious.</p>
<p>The only rigorous method, the only one that enables us to test an
opinion against real- ity, is based on the clear recognition that
opinions come first—and that is the way it should be. Then no one can
fail to see that we start out with untested hypotheses—in de-
cision-making, as in science, the only starting point. We know what to
do with hypothe- ses. One does not argue them; one tests them. One finds
out which hypotheses are tenable, and therefore worthy of serious
consideration, and which are eliminated by the first test against
observable experience.</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker therefore encourages opinions. But he
insists that the people who voice them also think through what it is
that the “experiment”—that is, the testing of the opinion against
reality—would have to show. The effective executive, there- fore, asks,
“What do we have to know to test the validity of this hypothesis?” “What
would the facts have to be to make this opinion tenable?” And he makes
it a habit—in himself and in the people with whom he works—to think
through and spell out what needs to be looked at, studied, and tested.
He insists that people who voice an opinion also take responsibility for
defining what factual findings can be expected and should be looked
for.</p>
<p>Perhaps the crucial question here is “What is the measurement
appropriate to the mat- ter under discussion and to the decision to be
reached?” Whenever one analyzes the way a truly effective, a truly
right, decision has been reached, one finds that a great deal of work
and thought went into finding the appropriate measurement.</p>
<p>The Need for Dissent and Alternatives</p>
<p>Unless one has considered alternatives, one has a closed mind. This,
above all, explains why the Japanese deliberately disregard the second
major command of the textbooks on decision-making and create discussion
and dissent as a means to consensus. Decisions of the kind the executive
has to make are not made well by acclamation. They are made well only if
based on the clash of conflicting views, the dialogue between different
points of view, the choice between different judgments. The first rule
in decision-making is that one does not make a decision unless there is
disagreement.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., is reported to have said at a meeting of one of
the GM top com- mittees, “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete
agreement on the decision here.” Everyone around the table nodded
assent. “Then,” continued Mr. Sloan, “I propose we postpone further
discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time
to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the
decision is all about.”</p>
<p>Sloan was anything but an “intuitive” decision-maker. He always
emphasized the need to test opinions against facts and the need to make
absolutely sure that one did not start out with the conclusion and then
look for the facts that would support it. But he knew that the right
decision demands adequate disagreement.</p>
<p>Every one of the effective presidents in American history had his own
method of pro- ducing the disagreement he needed in order to make an
effective decision. Washington, we know, hated conflicts and quarrels
and wanted a united Cabinet. Yet he made quite sure of the necessary
differences of opinion on important matters by asking both Hamilton and
Jefferson for their opinions.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why dissent is needed. It first safeguards
the decision-maker against becoming the prisoner of the organization.
Everybody always wants something from the decision-maker. Everybody is a
special pleader, trying—often in perfectly good faith—to obtain the
decision he favors. This is true whether the decision-maker is the
president of the United States or the most junior engineer working on a
design modifica- tion.</p>
<p>The only way to break out of the prison of special pleading and
preconceived notions is to make sure of argued, documented,
thought-through disagreements.</p>
<p>Second, disagreement alone can provide alternatives to a decision.
And a decision without an alternative is a desperate gambler’s throw, no
matter how carefully thought through it might be. There is always a high
possibility that the decision will prove wrong—either because it was
wrong to begin with or because a change in circumstances makes it wrong.
If one has thought through alternatives during the decision-making proc-
ess, one has something to fall back on, something that has already been
thought through, studied, understood. Without such an alternative, one
is likely to flounder dismally when reality proves a decision to be
inoperative.</p>
<p>Both the Schlieffen Plan of the German Army in 1914 and President
Franklin D. Roo- sevelt’s original economic program in 1933 were
disproved by events at the very moment when they should have taken
effect.</p>
<p>The German Army never recovered. It never formulated another
strategic concept. It went from one ill-conceived improvisation to the
next. But this was inevitable. For twenty-fire years no alternatives to
the Schlieffen Plan had been considered by the Gen- eral Staff. All its
skills had gone into working out the details of this master plan. When
the plan fell to pieces, no one had an alternative to fall back on. All
the German generals could do, therefore, was gamble—with the odds
against them.</p>
<p>By contrast, President Roosevelt, who, in the months before he took
office, had based his whole campaign on the slogan of economic
orthodoxy, had a team of able people, the later “Brains Trust,” working
on an alternative—a radical policy based on the proposals of the
old-time Progressives, and aimed at economic and social reform on a
grand scale. When the collapse of the banking system made it clear that
economic orthodoxy had be- come political suicide. Roosevelt had his
alternative ready. He therefore had a policy.</p>
<p>Above all, disagreement is needed to stimulate the imagination. One
may not need imagination to find the one right solution to a problem.
But then this is of value only in mathematics. In all matters of true
uncertainty such as the executive deals with—whether his sphere be
political, economic, social, or military—one needs creative solutions
which create a new situation. And this means that one needs
imagination—a new and different way of perceiving and understanding.</p>
<p>Imagination of the first order is, I admit, not in abundant supply.
But neither is it as scarce as is commonly believed. Imagination needs
to be challenged and stimulated, how-</p>
<p>The Trap of “Being Right”</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker does not start out with the assumption
that one proposed course of action is right and that all others must be
wrong. Nor does he start out with the assumption “I am right and he is
wrong.” He starts out with the commitment to find out why people
disagree.</p>
<p>Effective executives know, of course, that there are fools around and
that there are mischief-makers. But they do not assume that the man who
disagrees with what they themselves see as clear and obvious is,
therefore, either a fool or a knave. They know that unless proven
otherwise, the dissenter has to be assumed to be reasonably intelligent
and reasonably fair-minded. Therefore, it has to be assumed that he has
reached his so obvi- ously wrong conclusion because he sees a different
reality and is concerned with a differ- ent problem. The effective
executive, therefore, always asks, “What does this fellow have to see if
his position were, after all, tenable, rational, intelligent?” The
effective executive is concerned first with understanding. Only then
does he even think about who is right and who is wrong.*</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is not done by a great many people, whether
executives or not.</p>
<p>Most people start out with the certainty that how they see is the
only way to see at all. As a result, they never understand what the
decision—and indeed the whole argument—is really all about.</p>
<p>The American steel executives have never asked the question “Why do
these union people get so terribly upset every time we mention the word
‘featherbedding’?” The union people in turn have never asked themselves
why steel managements make such a fuss over featherbedding when every
single instance thereof they have ever produced has proved to be petty,
and irrelevant to boot. Instead, both sides have worked mightily to
prove each other wrong. If either side had tried to understand what the
other one sees and why, both would be a great deal stranger, and labor
relations in the steel industry, if not in U.S. in- dustry, might be a
good deal healthier.</p>
<p>No matter how high his emotions run, no matter how certain he is that
the other side is completely wrong and has no case at all, the executive
who wants to make the right deci- sion forces himself to see opposition
as his means to think through the alternatives. He uses conflict of
opinion as his tool to make sure all major aspects of an important
matter are looked at carefully.</p>
<p>Is a Decision Necessary?</p>
<p>There is one question the effective decision-maker asks: “Is a
decision really necessary?” One alternative is always the alternative of
doing nothing.</p>
<p>One has to make a decision when a condition is likely to degenerate
if nothing is done.</p>
<p>This also applies with respect to opportunity. If the opportunity is
important and is likely to vanish unless one acts with dispatch, one
acts—and one makes a radical change.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail’s contemporaries agreed with him as to the degenerative
danger of government ownership; but they wanted to fight it by fighting
symptoms—fighting this or</p>
<p>*This, of course, is nothing new. It is indeed only a rephrasing of
Mary Parker Follett (see her Dynamic Ad- ministration, ed. by Henry C.
Metcalf and L. Urwick [Harper andandandand Row, 1941]); who in turn only
extended Plato’s arguments in his great dialogue on rhetoric, the
Phaedo.</p>
<p>that bill in the legislature, opposing this or that candidate and
supporting another, and so on. Vail alone understood that this is the
ineffectual way to fight a degenerative condition. Even if one wins
every battle, one can never win the war. He saw that drastic action was
needed to create a new situation. He alone saw that private business had
to make public regulation into an effective alternative to
nationalization.*</p>
<p>It is a rare executive who understands this. The controller who in a
financial crisis preaches cost reduction is seldom capable of leaving
alone minor blemishes, elimination of which will achieve nothing. He may
know, for instance, that the significant costs are in the sales
organization and in physical distribution. And he will work hard and
brilliantly at getting them under control. But then he will discredit
himself and the whole effort by making a big fuss about the
“unnecessary” employment of two or three old men in an oth- erwise
efficient and well-run plant. And he will dismiss as immoral the
argument that eliminating these few semi-pensioners will not make any
difference anyhow. “Other peo- ple are making sacrifices,” he will
argue. “Why should the plant people get away with inefficiency?”</p>
<p>When it is all over, the organization will forget that he saved the
business. They will remember, though, his vendetta against the two or
three poor devils in the plant—and rightly so. De minimis non curat
praetor (The magistrate does not consider trifles) said the Roman law
almost two thousand years ago—but many decision-makers still need to
learn it.</p>
<p>The great majority of decisions will lie between these extremes. The
problem is not going to take care of itself; but it is unlikely to turn
into degenerative malignancy either. The opportunity is only for
improvement rather than for real change and innovation; but it is still
quite considerable. If we do not act, in other words, we will in all
probability sur- vive. But if we do act, we may be better off.</p>
<p>In this situation the effective decision-maker compares effort and
risk of action to risk of inaction. There is no formula for the right
decision here. But the guidelines are so clear that decision in the
concrete case is rarely difficult. They are:</p>
<p>• act if on balance the benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk;
and</p>
<p>• act or do not act; but do not “hedge” or compromise.</p>
<p>The surgeon who takes out only half the tonsils or half the appendix
risks as much in- fection and shock as if he did the whole job. And he
has not cured the condition, has in- deed made it worse. He either
operates or he doesn’t. Similarly, the effective decision- maker either
acts or he doesn’t act. He does not take half-action. This is the one
thing that is always wrong.</p>
<p>Who Has to Do the Work?</p>
<p>When they reach this point, most decision-makers in the West think
they can make an effective decision. But, as the Japanese example shows,
one essential element is still miss- ing. An effective decision is a
commitment to action and results. If it has to be “sold” af- ter it has
been made, there will be no action and no results—and, in effect, no
decision. At the least, there may be so much delay as to obsolete the
decision before it has become truly effective.</p>
<p>*See also Chapter 13.</p>
<p>The first rule is to make sure that everyone who will have to do
something to make the decision effective—or who could sabotage it—has
been forced to participate responsibly</p>
<p>in the discussion. This is not “democracy.” It is salesmanship.</p>
<p>But it is equally important to build the action commitments into the
decision from the start. In fact, no decision has been made unless
carrying it out in specific steps has be- come someone’s work assignment
and responsibility. Until then, there are only good in- tentions.</p>
<p>This is the trouble with so many policy statements, especially of
business: they contain no action commitment. To carry them out is no
one’s specific work and responsibility. No wonder that the people in the
organization tend to view these statements cynically if not as
declarations of what top management is really not going to do.</p>
<p>Converting a decision into action requires answering several distinct
questions: “Who has to know of this decision?” “What action has to be
taken?” “Who is to take it?” “And what does the action have to be so
that the people who have to do it can do it?” The first and the last of
these are too often overlooked—with dire results.</p>
<p>A story that has become a legend among management scientists
illustrates the impor- tance of the question “Who has to know?” A major
manufacturer of industrial equipment decided to discontinue one model.
For years it had been standard equipment on a line of machine tools,
many of which were still in use. It was decided, therefore, to sell the
model to present owners of the old equipment for another three years as
a replacement, and then to stop making and selling it. Orders for this
particular model had been going down for a good many years. But they
shot up temporarily as former customers reordered against the day when
the model would no longer be available. No one had, however, asked, “Who
needs to know of this decision?” Therefore nobody informed the clerk in
the purchasing department who was in charge of buying the parts from
which the model itself was being assembled. His instructions were to buy
parts in a given ratio to current sales—and the instructions remained
unchanged. When the time came to discontinue further production of the
model, the company had in its warehouse enough parts for another eight
to ten years of production, parts that had to be written off at a
considerable loss.</p>
<p>Above all, the action must be appropriate to the capacities of the
people who have to carry it out.</p>
<p>A chemical company found itself, in the early sixties, with fairly
large amounts of blocked currency in two West African countries. To
protect this money, it decided to in- vest in local businesses which
would contribute to the local economy, would not require imports from
abroad, and would if successful, be the kind that could be sold to local
in- vestors if and when a currency remittances became possible again. To
establish these businesses, the company developed a simple chemical
process to preserve a tropical fruit which is a staple crop in both
countries and which, up until then, had suffered serious spoilage in
transit to its markets.</p>
<p>The business was a success in both countries. But in one country the
local manager set the business up in such a manner that it required
highly skilled and, above all, technically trained management of the
kind not easily available in West Africa. In the other country the local
manager thought through the capacities of the people who would
eventually have to run the business and worked hard at making both
process and business simple and at staffing from the start with
nationals of the country right up to the top.</p>
<p>A few years later it became possible again to transfer currency from
these two coun- tries. But though the business flourished, no buyer
could be found for it in the first coun- try. No one available locally
had the necessary managerial and technical skills. The busi- ness had to
be liquidated at a loss. In the other country so many local
entrepreneurs were eager to buy the business that the company
repatriated its original investment with a sub- stantial profit.</p>
<p>The process and the business built on it were essentially the same in
both places. But in the first country no one had asked, “What kind of
people do we have available to make this decision effective? And what
can they do?” As a result, the decision itself became frustrated.</p>
<p>All this becomes doubly important when people have to change
behavior, habits, or attitudes if a decision is to become effective
action. Here one has to make sure not only that responsibility for the
action is clearly assigned and that the people responsible are capable
of doing the needful. One has to make sure that their measurements,
their stan- dards for accomplishment, and their incentives are changed
simultaneously. Otherwise, the people will get caught in a paralyzing
internal emotional conflict.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail’s decision that the business of the Bell System was
service might have remained dead letter but for the yardsticks of
service performance which he designed to measure managerial performance.
Bell managers were used to being measured by the profitability of their
units, or at the least, by cost. The new yardsticks made them accept
rapidly the new objectives.</p>
<p>If the greatest rewards are given for behavior contrary to that which
the few course of action requires, then everyone will conclude that this
contrary behavior is what the people at the top really want and are
going to reward.</p>
<p>Not everyone can do what Vail did and build the execution of his
decisions into the decision itself. But everyone can think through what
action commitments a specific deci- sion requires, what work assignment
follows from it, and what people are available to carry it out.</p>
<p>The Right and the Wrong Compromise</p>
<p>The decision is now ready to be made. The specifications have been
thought through, the alternatives explored, the risks and gains weighed.
Who will have to do what is under- stood. At this point it is indeed
reasonably clear what course of action should be taken. At this point
the decision does indeed almost “make itself.”</p>
<p>And it is at this point that most decisions are lost. It becomes
suddenly quite obvious that the decision is not going to be pleasant, is
not going to be popular, is not going to be easy. It becomes clear that
a decision requires courage as much as it requires judgment. There is no
inherent reason why medicines should taste horrible—but effective ones
usu- ally do. Similarly, there is no inherent reason why decisions
should be distasteful—but most effective ones are.</p>
<p>The reason is always the same: there is no “perfect” decision. One
always has to pay a price. One has always to subordinate one set of
desiderata. One always has to balance conflicting objectives,
conflicting opinions, and conflicting priorities. The best decision is
only an approximation—and a risk. And there is always the pressure to
compromise to gain acceptance, to placate strong opponents of the
proposed course of action or to hedge risks.</p>
<p>For there are two different kinds of compromise. One kind is
expressed in the old proverb “Half a loaf is better than no bread.” The
other kind is expressed in the story of the judgment of Solomon, which
was clearly based on the realization that “half a baby is worse than no
baby at all.” In the first instance, objective requirements are still
being sat- isfied. The purpose of bread is to provide food, and half a
loaf is still food. Half a baby, however, is not half of a living and
growing child. It is a corpse in two pieces.</p>
<p>It is, above all, fruitless and a waste of time to worry about what
is acceptable and what one had better not say so as not to evoke
resistance. The things one worries about never happen. And objections
and difficulties no one thought about suddenly turn out to be almost
insurmountable obstacles. One gains nothing, in other words, by starting
out with the question “What is acceptable?” And in the process of
answering it, one loses any chance to come up with an effective, let
alone with the right, answer.</p>
<p>The Feedback</p>
<p>A feedback has to be built into the decision to provide continuous
testing; against actual events, of the expectations that underlie the
decision. Few decisions work out the way they are intended to. Even the
best decision usually runs into snags, unexpected obstacles, and all
kinds of surprises. Even the most effective decision eventually becomes
obsolete. Unless there is feedback from the results of a decision, it is
unlikely to produce the de- sired results.</p>
<p>This requires first that the expectations be spelled out clearly—and
in writing. Second, it requires an organized effort to follow up. And
this feedback is part of the decision and</p>
<p>has to be worked out in the decision process.</p>
<p>When General Eisenhower was elected president, his predecessor, Harry
Truman, said: “Poor Ike; when he was a general, he gave an order and it
was carried out. Now he is going to sit in that big office and he’ll
give an order and not a damn thing is going to hap- pen.”</p>
<p>The reason why “not a damn thing is going to happen” is, however, not
that generals have more authority than presidents. It is that military
organizations learned long ago that futility is the lot of most orders
and organized the feedback to check on the execution of the order. They
learned long ago that to go oneself and look is the only reliable
feedback.* Reports—all an American president is normally able to
mobilize—are not much help. All military services have long ago learned
that the officer who has given an order goes out and sees for himself
whether it has been carried out. At the least he sends one of his own
aides—he never relies on what he is told by the subordinate to whom the
order was given. Not that he distrusts the subordinate; he has learned
from experience to distrust communi- cations.</p>
<p>One needs organized information for the feedback. One needs reports
and figures. But unless one builds one’s feedback around direct exposure
to reality—unless one disciplines oneself to go out and look—one
condemns oneself to sterile dogmatism and with it to
ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>In sum: decision-making is not a mechanical job. It is risk-taking
and a challenge to judgment. The “right answer” (which usually cannot be
found anyway) is not central. Central is understanding of the problem.
Decision-making, further, is not an intellectual exercise. It mobilizes
the vision, energies, and resources of the organization for effective
action.</p>
<p>*This was certainly established military practice in very ancient
times—Thucydides and Xenophon both take it for ganted, as do the
earliest Chinese texts on war we have—and so did Caeser.</p>
