<p>M</p>
<p>ARKETING AND INNOVATION is in these two areas that a business</p>
<p>are the foundation areas in objective setting. It obtains its
results. It is performance and contri-</p>
<p>bution in these areas for which a customer pays. All objectives must
be performance objectives, aimed at doing rather than at good
intentions. In all other objective areas the purpose of doing is to make
possible the attainment of the objectives in the areas of marketing and
innovation.</p>
<p>It is somewhat misleading to speak of a marketing objective.
Marketing performance requires a number of objectives:</p>
<p>• for existing products and services in existing and present
markets;</p>
<p>• for abandonment of “yesterday” in product, services, and
markets;</p>
<p>• for new products and services for existing markets;</p>
<p>• for new markets;</p>
<p>• for the distributive organization;</p>
<p>• for service standards and service performance;</p>
<p>• for credit standards and credit performance, and so on.</p>
<p>Many books have been written on every one of these areas. But it is
almost never stressed that objectives in these areas can be set only
after two key decisions have been made: the decision on concentration,
and the decision on market standing.</p>
<p>The Concentration Decision</p>
<p>Whereas objectives are “strategy,” the concentration decision is
“policy.” It is, so to speak, the decision in what theater to fight a
war. Without such a policy decision, there can be rules of warfare but
no strategy, that is, no purposeful action.</p>
<p>At about the same time at which Marks andandandand Spencer chose
concentration on wearing apparel and textiles, Sears, Roebuck faced up
to the concentration decision. The area of concentration it decided on
was household appliances. This was a very different decision from that
of Marks andandandand Spencer but it was the right decision considering
both Sears’s basically different theory of its business and the
conditions prevailing in the American market in the late twenties. Sears
did not drop textiles from its stores. But until World War II it paid
little attention to them and did not aggressively compete in the apparel
market. The Sears concentration decision led the company into different
directions from those Marks andandandand Spencer took, e.g., into very
large stores; into heavy emphasis on a service organization, which
eventually led into the automotive field as a second concentration area;
and into heavy investment in the ownership of appliance makers.</p>
<p>Archimedes, one of the great scientists of antiquity, is reported to
have said: “Give me a place to stand on, and I can lift the universe of
its hinges.” The place to stand on is the area of concentration. It is
the area which gives a business the leverage that lifts the universe off
its hinges. The concentration decision is, therefore, a crucial
decision. It converts in large measure, the definition of “what our
business is” into meaningful operational commitment. It makes possible
work on one’s mission and purpose. It is the foundation for effective
strategy.</p>
<p>Wherever we find a business that is outstandingly successful, we will
find that it has thought through the concentration alternatives and has
made a concentration decision.</p>
<p>During the first fifteen years of the computer, that is, until the
mid-sixties, only two companies out of fifty or so who had entered the
field worldwide managed to make any profit on computers and obtain any
kind of market position: IBM and the much smaller Control Data
Corporation. Both owed their success largely to facing up to the
concentration decision. IBM, in the very infancy of computers, decided
to concentrate on the business market and to offer the computer
essentially as an accounting machine for large-scale repetitive handling
of conventional data such as accounting and payroll. Control Data, at
almost the same time, made the radically opposite decision to
concentrate on large-scale scientific applications. Both companies did
very well. The other computer companies all tried to “cover the market”;
none succeeded.</p>
<p>This is big-company stuff, many might say. But neither IBM nor
Control Data was a big company when it made its concentration decision
(see Chapter 60)—nor, incidentally, was Marks andandandand Spencer way
back in the 1920s. Actually, a small company needs the concentration
decision even more than a big one. Its resources are limited and will
produce no results unless concentrated.</p>
<p>The concentration decision is highly risky. It is a genuine decision.
It has to be tested again and again against the market; its dynamics,
its trends, and its changes. Without concentration, marketing
objectives—but also innovation objectives—are promises and good
intentions rather than true goals. Without them, the resources of the
business will not be allocated to performance.</p>
<p>The Market-Standing Decision</p>
<p>The other major decision underlying marketing objectives is that on
market standing. One common approach is to say, “We want to be the
leader.” The other one is to say, “We don’t care what share of the
market we have as long as sales go up.” Both sound plausible, but both
are wrong.</p>
<p>Obviously, not everybody can be the leader. One has to decide in
which segment of the market, with what product, what services, what
values, one should be the leader. It does not do much good for a
company’s sales to go up if it loses market share, that is, if the
market expands much faster than the company’s sales do.</p>
<p>A company with a small share of the market will eventually become
marginal in the marketplace, and thereby exceedingly vulnerable. In the
slightest economic setback its customers are likely to concentrate their
buying—and then they will concentrate on suppliers that have a
substantial share; distributors and retailers will try to cut inventory
by eliminating the marginal supplier. The sales volume of the marginal
supplier may become too small to give the needed service—one of the main
reasons why marginal appliance manufacturers, no matter how good their
product, or how well known their brand name, do not usually survive
long.</p>
<p>Market standing, regardless of the sales curve, is therefore
essential. The point at which the supplier becomes marginal varies from
industry to industry. But to be a marginal producer is dangerous for
long-term survival. And this is just as true for a department store, for
a bank, for an airline, or for an insurance company as it is for a
manufacturer. (On this, see Chapter 55, “On Being the Wrong Size.”)</p>
<p>There is also a maximum market standing above which it may be unwise
to go—even if there were no antitrust laws. Market domination tends to
lull the leader to sleep; monopolists flounder on their own complacency
rather than on public opposition. Market domination produces tremendous
internal resistance against any innovation and thus makes adaptation to
change dangerously difficult. Also, it usually means that the enterprise
has too many of its eggs in one basket and is too vulnerable to economic
fluctuations.</p>
<p>There is also well-founded resistance in the marketplace to
dependence on one dominant supplier. Whether it is the purchasing agent
of a manufacturing company, the procurement officer in the Air Force, or
the housewife, no one likes to be at the mercy of the monopoly
supplier.</p>
<p>Finally, the dominant supplier in a rapidly expanding, especially a
new, market is likely to do less well than if he shared that market with
one or two other major and competing suppliers. This may seem
paradoxical—and most businessmen find it difficult to accept. But the
fact is that a new market, especially a new major market, tends to
expand much more rapidly when there are several suppliers rather than
only one. It may be very flattering to a supplier’s ego to have 80
percent of a market. But if as a result of domination by a single
source, the market does not expand as it otherwise might, the supplier’s
revenues and profits are likely to be considerably lower than they would
be if two suppliers shared a fast-expanding market. Eighty percent of
100 is considerably less than 50 percent of 250. A new market which has
only one supplier is likely to become static at 100. It will be limited
by the imagination of the one supplier who always knows what his product
or service cannot or should not be used for. If there are several
suppliers, they are likely to uncover and promote markets and end uses
the single supplier never dreams of. And the market might grow rapidly
to 250.</p>
<p>Du Pont seems to have grasped this. In its most successful
innovations Du Pont retains a sole-supplier position only until the new
product has paid for the original investment. Then Du Pont licenses the
innovation and launches competitors deliberately. As a result, a number
of aggressive companies start developing new markets and new uses for
the product. Nylon would surely have grown much more slowly without Du
Pont-sponsored competition. Its markets are still growing, but without
competition it would probably have begun to decline in the early
fifties, when newer synthetic fibers were brought on the market by
Monsanto and Union Carbide in the U.S., Imperial Chemicals in Great
Britain, and AKU in Holland.</p>
<p>The market standing to aim at is not the maximum but the optimum.
This requires careful analysis of customers, of products or services, of
market segments, and distribution channels. It requires a market
strategy, and it requires a decision of high risk.</p>
<p>Innovation Objective</p>
<p>The innovation objective is the objective through which a company
makes operational its definition of “what our business should be.”</p>
<p>The problem in setting innovation objectives is the difficulty of
measuring the relative impact and importance of various innovations.
Technological leadership is clearly desirable, especially if the term
technology is used in its rightful sense as applying to the art, craft,
or science of any organized human activity. But how are we to determine
what weighs more: a hundred minor but immediately applicable
improvements in packaging a product, or one fundamental chemical
discovery which after ten more years of hard work may change the
character of the business altogether? A department store and a
pharmaceutical company will answer this question differently; but so may
two different pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>While innovating objectives will not be as unequivocal as marketing
objectives, they need to be specific and quantified—usually they can be
quantified, if only roughly.*</p>
<p>Deliberate emphasis on innovation may be needed most where
technological changes are least spectacular. No one in a pharmaceutical
company or in a company making synthetic organic chemicals needs to be
told that survival depends on the ability to replace three-quarters of
the company’s products by entirely new ones every ten years. But how
many people in an insurance company realize that the company’s
growth—perhaps even its survival—depends on the development of new forms
of insurance, the modification of existing policies, and the constant
search for new, better, and cheaper ways of selling policies and of
settling claims? The less visible or prominent technological change is
in a business, the greater is the danger that the whole organization
will ossify; hence the emphasis on innovation is doubly important.</p>
<p>It may be argued once more that such goals are big-company stuff,
suitable for General Electric or for General Motors but unnecessary for
a small business. But the small company’s need for innovation is as
great as that of the large company. And, as the managements of several
small companies I know assert, the comparative simplicity of planning
for innovation may be one of the main advantages of small size. As the
president of one of them puts it, “When you are small, you are
sufficiently close to the market to know fairly fast which new products
are needed. And your engineering staff is too small to become ingrown.
They know they can’t do everything themselves and, therefore, they keep
their eyes and ears wide open for any new development on the outside
that they could possibly use.”</p>
<p>*For methods to do this, see my book Managing for Results and the
very different but penetrating approach of Michael J. Kami, in “Business
Planning as Business Opportunity” in Preparing Tomorrow’s Business
Leaders Today, edited by Peter F. Drucker. There is also a list of
innovation goals in my book The Practice of Management (1954).</p>
<p>Resources, Their Supply, Utilization, and Productivity</p>
<p>A group of objectives deals with the resources a business needs to be
able to perform, with their supply, their utilization, and their
productivity.</p>
<p>All economic activity, economists have told us for two hundred years,
requires three kinds of resources: (1) land, that is, products of
nature; (2) labor, that is, human resources, and (3) capital, that is,
the means to invest in tomorrow. The business must be able to attract
all three and to put them to productive use. In these three areas,
therefore, every business needs objectives: in addition, it needs an
objective for the productivity of these resources. Again, each of these
areas will require a plurality of objectives rather than a single
one.</p>
<p>In respect to human resources, for instance, it is highly desirable
to have specific objectives for manager supply, development, and
performance, but also specific objectives for major groups within the
non-managerial work force, and for relations with labor unions. There is
need for objectives—on employee attitudes as well as on employee
skills.</p>
<p>Similarly a business needs physical facilities, and if a
manufacturer, raw-materials resources. Retail chains, such as Sears,
Roebuck and Marks andandandand Spencer, need an objective for the
development of stores and the utilization of shelf space, but also for
the development of sources of supply for the merchandise they plan to
sell.</p>
<p>The capital area is equally crucial—and very few businesses have yet
tackled it.</p>
<p>Again, objectives are needed for the supply of capital, as well as
for its utilization.</p>
<p>Each of these areas, but especially the areas of human resources, and
of capital, are “marketing areas.” A business markets its job
opportunities, and a business markets its financial investment. The job
and career markets and the capital market are genuine “outside” markets
in which there are true “customers” who have expectations, values, and
needs. A business that cannot attract the people and the capital it
needs will not last long.</p>
<p>The first sign of decline of an industry is loss of appeal to
qualified, able, and ambitious people. The American railroads, for
instance, did not begin their decline after World War II—it only became
obvious and irreversible then. The decline actually set in around the
time of World War I. Before World War I, able graduates of American
engineering schools looked for a railroad career. From the end of World
War I on—for whatever reason—the railroad no longer appealed to young
engineering graduates, or to any educated young people. As a result
there was nobody in management capable and competent to cope with new
problems when the railroads ran into heavy weather twenty years later,
around the time of World War II.</p>
<p>In the two areas of people and capital supply, genuine marketing
objectives are therefore required. “What do our jobs have to be to
attract and hold the kind of people we need and want? What is the supply
available on the job market? And, what do we have to do to attract it?”
Similarly, “What does the investment in our business have to be, in the
form of bank loans, long-term debts or equity, to attract and hold the
capital we need?” (On the career market, see Chapter 33, “Developing
Management and Managers.”)</p>
<p>One American company that systematically and for many years has
applied market planning to the supply of capital is ATandandandandT, the
Bell Telephone System. A telephone business is highly capital-intensive;
it depends on continuing heavy investment. The customer is, in effect,
pre-financed to the tune of three years of future revenues from him. As
one of his last contributions—and one of his most important
ones—Theodore Vail thought through the problem. He realized, at the end
of World War I, that the American capital market, was changing and that
Bell no longer could expect to obtain its capital from the traditional
sources, such as the estates of wealthy Bostonians. Instead, a
mass-capital market was coming into being. As a result of his analysis,
Vail designed a brand-new security, unknown up to this time, and
unparalleled ever since: an ATandandandandT common share with an
almost-guaranteed dividend, which was both an equity investment with a
promise of long-term capital gains and, in large measure, a
fixed-income-producing investment. It thus appealed to a new middle
class which could not afford to risk much, but still had some savings
available for investment after paying for life insurance or home
mortgage.</p>
<p>Forty years later, in the early 1960s, the Bell System’s top
management realized that this investment instrument had ceased to be
appropriate. It drastically changed the nature of the ATandandandandT
common share to make it attractive to the new capitalists, the large
investment institutions, such as pension funds and investment
trusts.</p>
<p>Setting marketing objectives for careers and for investment requires
also objectives for the structure, basic policies, jobs, and directions
of the business itself. They are not selling objectives; they are
genuine marketing objectives, and as such have to be built into the way
the business itself is set up, directed, structured, and run.</p>
<p>Setting objectives also applies to objectives concerning union
relations or workers’ attitudes. Union relations, most executives will
argue, are beyond their control. For short periods of time this is
indeed true. Circumstances beyond any management’s control, e.g.,
governmental policies or inflation, strongly mold union attitudes and
demands, as well as union strength. But this is al1 the more reason for
setting long-range objectives for the relationship with the labor
union.</p>
<p>One may criticize the labor relations policies of General Motors and
General Electric.</p>
<p>But these two companies, alone perhaps among major American
businesses, thought through their union relations, developed objectives
for them, and based their policies on them. The policies, while
basically different in strategy and in tactics, are both very “tough”
ones. Both aim at maintenance of the company’s initiative in labor
relations and of the company’s control of worker assignment and worker
productivity. Both companies are willing to take a strike over matters
of principle and refuse to buy short-term union concessions on money
issues by yielding on long-term fundamentals. Both policies have been
remarkably successful in maintaining productivity and competitive
positions for the two companies. Though labor bitterly criticizes the
two companies and has never ceased to attack their policies, their labor
negotiators are among the few, in major companies, whom labor respects.
Indeed, GM and GE lose fewer man-hours to strikes and slowdowns than
companies enjoying much “better” relationship but relying on short-term
expediency.</p>
<p>Resource objectives have to be set in a double process. One starting
point is the anticipated needs of the business, which then have to be
projected on the outside, that is, on the market for land, labor, and
capital. But the other starting points are these “markets” themselves,
which then have to be projected onto the structure, the direction, the
plans of the business. It is no longer adequate, as most managers still
seem to think, to say, “’This is what we need; how much do we have to
pay for it?” One also has to say, “This is what is available; what do we
have to be, how do we have to behave, to get the fullest benefit?”</p>
<p>Productivity: The First Test of Management’s Competence</p>
<p>Attracting resources and getting them to work is only the beginning.
The task of a business is to make resources productive. Every business,
therefore, needs productivity objectives with respect to each of the
three major resources, land, labor, and capital; and with respect to
overall productivity itself.</p>
<p>A productivity measurement is the best yardstick for comparing
managements of different units within an enterprise, and for comparing
managements of different enterprises. For productivity includes all the
efforts the enterprise contributes; it excludes everything it does not
control. Productivity—is the first test of management’s competence.</p>
<p>All businesses have access to pretty much the same resources. Except
for the rare monopoly situation, the only thing that differentiates one
business from another in any given field is the quality of its
management on all levels. The first measurement of this crucial factor
is productivity, that is, the degree to which resources are utilized and
their yield.</p>
<p>The continuous improvement of productivity is one of management’s
most important jobs. It is also one of the most difficult; for
productivity is a balance between a diversity of factors, few of which
are easily definable or clearly measurable.</p>
<p>The goal is not to try to find the one perfect productivity
measurement, but to use a number of measurements—at least one gains
insights that way. Output per man-hour, for instance, is by itself
almost meaningless, even though governmental statistics in most</p>
<p>countries are based on it. It does not even measure labor
productivity. It becomes meaningful only if the figures show output in
dollars per man-hour, as well as in units, but also profit per man-hour.
In addition, we need figures that show output in units, output in
dollars, that is, sales, profits per dollar of wages, and so on.</p>
<p>Similarly, we need to measure productivity in other areas by a number
of yardsticks to gain insight and judgment. Labor is only one of the
three factors of production. And if productivity of labor is
accomplished by making the other resources less productive, there is
actually loss of productivity.</p>
<p>A telling example is the paper industry worldwide. Very few
industries have enjoyed as much of a rise in demand and sales. Few
industries can match the technical advances of the paper industry, for
instance, the stepup in the speed of paper machines. Since World War II
the industry has been enjoying a boom in sales and output. Yet it has
been unable, in most years, to produce any but marginal profits—well
below what money earns in a savings bank. The break-even point of most
up-to-date paper mills is just barely below 100 percent of capacity
operations. The explanation for this puzzling phenomenon is a long
secular decline in the productivity of capital in the industry. Paper
prices have risen faster than the prices for papermaking equipment. Yet,
where it took 80 cents of capital investment to build productive
capacity for a dollar of paper sales forty years ago, it takes today two
to three dollars of capital investment to produce one dollar’s worth of
paper sales. Labor productivity in the paper industry has gone up much
faster than in most other industries. The paper industry, in other
words, has substituted capital for labor on a massive scale. But the
trade-off was a thoroughly uneconomical one. In fact, the paper industry
represents a massive triumph of engineering over economics and common
sense.</p>
<p>A century ago, Karl Marx based his confident prediction of the
imminent demise of capitalism on the premise that the productivity of
capital is bound to go down. This decline was to Marx the basic
“contradiction of capitalism.” That the prophecy has not been fulfilled
so far is the result of our ability to innovate, that is, to develop new
processes and new industries with higher productivity of capital. But
Marx was right in his basic premise: the key to the survival of a
business, a company, or an economy is, in the last analysis,
productivity of capital. Productivity of capital is the area most
companies pay least attention to—if only because so many people
mistakenly think that profitability by itself measures it.</p>
<p>But, as the Marks andandandand Spencer example shows, the
productivity of physical resources needs to be measured fully as much,
and objectives for each category need to be set. For productivity
includes all three factors of production. The wrong trade-off, that is,
an increase in the productivity of one factor of production paid for by
a disproportionate drop in another factor results, as the paper industry
shows, in a loss of overall productivity.</p>
<p>We do not have one single yardstick. But at least we have a basic
concept that enables us to define productivity for the whole
business—the economist calls it “contributed value.”</p>
<p>Contributed value is the difference between the gross revenue
received by a company from the sale of its products or services and the
amount paid out for the purchase of raw materials and for services
rendered by outside suppliers. Contributed value, in other words,
includes all the costs of all the efforts of the business and the entire
reward received for these efforts. It accounts for all the resources the
business itself contributes to the final product and the appraisal of
their efforts by the market.</p>
<p>Contributed value can be used to analyze productivity only if the
allocation of costs is economically meaningful. The movement in
accounting during the last twenty years from financial accounting and
tax accounting to management accounting, while still only in its early
stages, is thus a major step toward making business manageable and
managed. Contributed value will not measure productivity resulting from
qualitative, rather than quantitative, factors. Contributed value is
strictly a quantitative tool. Yet qualitative factors have major impact
on productivity. Organization structure, for instance, the utilization
of knowledge in the business, or the quality of tomorrow’s management
are fundamental factors in productivity, over the short or the long
range. However, they elude our existing</p>
<p>measurements. Finally, contributed value can be used, by and large,
only in businesses that make something, that is in manufacturing
businesses.</p>
<p>Within these limitations contributed value makes possible the
rational analysis of productivity and the setting of goals for its
improvement. In particular, it makes it possible to apply such tools as
Operations Research to the systematic study of productivity. For these
tools aim at working out alternative courses of action and their
predictable consequences. The productivity problem is always one of
seeing the range of alternative combinations of the various resources,
and of finding the combination that gives the optimal ratio of output to
cost effort and risk. (On this point see Chapter 40, “The Manager and
the Management Sciences.”)</p>
<p>Productivity is a difficult concept, but it is central. Without
productivity objectives, a business does not have direction. Without
productivity measurements, it does not have control.</p>
<p>The Social Dimension</p>
<p>Only a few years ago managers as well as economists considered the
social dimension so intangible that performance objectives could not be
set. We have now learned that the intangible can become very tangible
indeed. Such lessons as consumerism, or the attacks on industry for the
destruction of the environment, are expensive ways to learn that
business needs to think through its impacts and its responsibilities and
to set objectives for both.</p>
<p>The social dimension is a survival dimension. The enterprise exists
in society and economy. Within an institution one always tends to assume
that the institution exists by itself in a vacuum. And managers
inevitably look at their business from the inside. But the business
enterprise is a creature of society and economy. Society or the economy
can put any business out of existence overnight. The enterprise exists
on sufferance and exists only as long as society and economy believe
that it does a job, and a necessary, useful, and productive one.</p>
<p>Again, many managers will say, “This is big-company stuff.” But the
small company is also an employer, also exists in a community, and also
depends on support or at least on sufferance by community and society.
It needs social objectives fully as much as the big business—though it
may need very different ones.</p>
<p>What such objectives might be will be discussed further on (in the
section titled “Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities” beginning
Chapter 24). But that such objectives need to be built into the strategy
of a business, rather than be statements of good intentions, needs to be
stressed here. These are not objectives that are needed because the
manager has a responsibility to society. They are needed because the
manager has a responsibility to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Profit as a Need and a Limitation</p>
<p>Only after the objectives in the above seven key areas have been
thought through and established can a business tackle the question “How
much profitability do we need?” To attain any of the objectives entails
high risks. It requires effort, and that means cost. Profit is,
therefore, needed to pay for attainment of the objectives of the
business. Profit is a condition of survival. It is the cost of the
future, the cost of staying in business.</p>
<p>A business that obtains enough profit to satisfy its objectives in
the key areas is a business that has the means of survival. A business
that falls short of the profitability demands made by its key objectives
is a marginal and endangered business.</p>
<p>The profitability needed to support the objectives of the business in
the seven key areas discussed so far is also the quantitative expression
of the profitability needed to fulfill the social and economic function
of profit:</p>
<p>• as the “risk premium” covering the costs of staying in
business;</p>
<p>• as the source of capital to finance the jobs of’ tomorrow;</p>
<p>• as the source of capital for innovation and for growth of the
economy.</p>
<p>Profit planning is necessary. But it is planning for a needed minimum
profitability rather than for that meaningless shibboleth “profit
maximization.” The minimum needed may well turn out to be a good deal
higher than the profit goals of many companies, let</p>
<p>alone their actual profit results.</p>
<p>The Japanese Example</p>
<p>By historical accident the only economy which understands that profit
is a minimum rather than a maximum concept is the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>There has been heated discussion whether Japan has a lower cost of
capital or a higher cost of capital than the West—the Westerners
contending that Japan’s cost of capital is lower, the Japanese that it
is higher. Both are wrong. The cost of capital of a Japanese business is
pretty much the same as that of a Western business. Only the method of
computation differs.</p>
<p>Japan finances its businesses mostly by bank loans. Legally these are
short-term credits. Economically, they are permanent equity investments
by the bank. The reason for this is that Japan in the nineteenth century
did not have a capital market; the banks were created largely by the
industrial groups to be their suppliers of capital. In the West the
situation is the reverse, the result of the fact that a capital market
existed in England and America when industry started to grow. (The
continental European situation is somewhat in between, as discussed in
Chapter 49, “Georg Siemens and the Deutsche Bank.”)</p>
<p>A Japanese company typically carries 70 percent debt capital and 30
percent equity capital whereas the typical American company in the same
industry has the reverse ratio. The costs of capital for the two are
then as follows: on the 70 percent debt capital, the Japanese company
has to pay at least 10 percent interest, or 7 percent on its total
capital; on the 30 percent equity, it is expected to earn after taxes
about 8 percent, or 2.4 percent on its total capital, making a 9.4
percent rate of return on total capital employed. The American company
has to earn 7 percent (the average for interest rates in the twenty-five
years after World War II) on its 30 percent debt, amounting to 2.1
percent on its total invested capital. It has to earn 10 percent after
taxes on its equity capital, which, at a rate of equity capital of 70
percent of the total, amounts to 7 percent.</p>
<p>Both come out, in other words, at the same overall cost of capital.
(The Japanese carry a much lower tax burden, since interest on loans in
Japan is considered, as in the West, a deductible business expense. The
tax burden is much higher in the West—but whether this is to be
considered as being borne by the business, by the consumer, or by the
investor is a moot point on which economists cannot agree.)</p>
<p>The profitability needed by a Japanese company is what the bank needs
to attract deposits to pay its own operating expense and to cover its
risks. It is the margin between the cost of capital to the bank—maybe 6
percent—and the interest income the bank charges for what, in effect,
are equity investments in the businesses it finances. For the Japanese
business manager the central fact of life is that he has to earn at
least enough to carry the interest on the money he owes to the banks
with a margin adequate to maintain his credit</p>
<p>standing.</p>
<p>The Japanese manager, therefore, starts out with the clear aim to
minimize the capital he needs to operate. He sees profit as a need,
rather than as something desirable and nice to have. He knows that he
will go out of, business if he does not produce the minimum profit
needed to obtain the capital required. He is no less profit-conscious
than the Westerner, but, by historical accident, he is in a position
where he understands the function of profit, and where, therefore, he
tends to plan more rationally and more purposefully to obtain the
profitability on which the survival and growth of his business
depend.</p>
<p>The Japanese illustration shows clearly that the minimum rate of
profitability adequate to the needs of a business is the cost of
capital.* The minimum rate is the capital market rate needed to obtain
the financial resources the business needs to attain its objectives.</p>
<p>In the case of self-financing, which at certain times (e.g., in the
U.S. in the fifties) plays an important part in the supply of capital to
existing businesses, there must be enough profit both to yield the
capital market rate of return on money already in the business and to
produce the additional capital needed. Otherwise the minimum rate of
profitability the business requires will not be produced. As Childs
points out, the fact that the American chemical industry, in the fifties
and sixties, when its cash flow was high, reinvested retained earnings
in ventures yielding less than the cost of capital on the market was a
major reason for its sharp drop in growth in earnings and in ability to
attract capital in the years after 1965.</p>
<p>The cost of capital is never higher than the minimum profitability
needed—at least not when there is a capital market rather than
government allocation of capital. But it might well be lower than the
minimum. It is, however, the best starting point for profit
planning.</p>
<p>Whether the business is large or small, complex or simple,
profitability should be computed as an average of the profits of both
good and bad years. Let us assume that a business needs a profitability
of 20 percent before taxes on its invested capital. If the 20 percent is
being earned in a good year, it is unlikely to be earned over the
lifetime of the investment. We may need a 40 percent return in good
years to average 20 percent over a dozen years. And we have to calculate
how much we actually need to get the desired average.</p>
<p>How to Measure Profitability</p>
<p>How to measure profitability is a much debated question. No one
yardstick will do. Profit on sales, that is, the profit margin, is
clearly not adequate by itself. For profit is profit margin multiplied
by the rate of turnover of capital. Profit margin is a meaningful
figure, if only because it shows where the opportunities for profit
improvement lie. Return on invested capital makes sense; but in practice
it is the worst of all yardsticks—rubber of almost infinite elasticity.
What is “invested capital”? Is a dollar invested in 1950 the same thing
as a dollar invested in 1970? Is capital to be defined by the accountant
as original cash put in less subsequent depreciation? Or is it to be
defined by the economist as future wealth-producing capacity, discounted
at capital-market interest rates to current cash value? The search for a
perfect yardstick for measuring profitability is likely to be
frustrating and futile. It is far sounder to use a number of yardsticks
simultaneously and look at them for what they tell us about the
business, particularly as no one has been able to make a convincing case
for including depreciation in measuring capital investment or, for that
matter, for excluding it.</p>
<p>Profitability as a Limitation</p>
<p>Profitability is not only a need, it is also a limitation. The
objectives of a business must not exceed the profitability with which it
can expect to operate. The minimum profitability must not be so high
that one cannot prudently expect to attain it. The profitability need,
therefore, has to be projected back on the objectives. If profitability
is inadequate to the objectives, the objectives have to be pruned. The
company’s eyes ought not be bigger than its stomach.</p>
<p>Almost any business, in setting objectives in key areas, will come up
with greater efforts and higher risks than it is likely to be able to
support in terms of profitability. Any business, therefore, will have to
balance objectives.</p>
<p>**On this see the excellent though highly technical discussion in
John F. Childs, Earnings per Share and Management Decisions
(Prentice-Hall, 1971). It is perhaps the best treatment of financial
structure and financial policy for the large business written so
far.</p>
<p>Balancing Objectives</p>
<p>There are three kinds of balance needed in setting objectives.
Objectives have to be balanced against attainable profitability.
Objectives have to be balanced as to the demands of the immediate and
the distant future. They have to be balanced against each other, and
trade-offs have to be established between desired performance in one
area and desired performance in others.</p>
<p>In setting objectives, management always has to balance the immediate
future against the long range. If it does not provide for the immediate
future, there will be no long-range future. But if it sacrifices the
long-range needs of “what our business will be” and “what our business
should be” to immediate results, there will also be no business fairly
soon.</p>
<p>Setting objectives always requires a decision on where to take the
risks, a decision as to how much immediate results should be sacrificed
for the sake of long-range growth or how much long-range growth should
be jeopardized for the sake of short-run performance. There is no
formula for these decisions. They are risky, entrepreneurial, uncertain—
but they must be made.</p>
<p>Management has to balance objectives. What is more important, an
expansion in markets and sales volume, or a higher rate of return? How
much time, effort, and energy should be expended on improving
manufacturing productivity? Would the amount of effort or money bring
greater returns if invested in new-product design?</p>
<p>The growth companies of the fifties and sixties promised both more
sales and higher profits indefinitely. This alone was reason to distrust
them. Every experienced manager should have known that these two
objectives are not normally compatible. To produce more sales almost
always means to sacrifice immediate profit. To produce higher profit
almost always means to sacrifice long-range sales. In almost every case,
this irrational promise and the resulting refusal to make balancing
decisions between growth and profitability objectives was the direct
cause of the large losses and the equally large write-offs of the growth
companies in the late sixties and early seventies.</p>
<p>There are few things that distinguish competent from incompetent
management quite as sharply as performance in balancing objectives.
There is no formula for doing the job. Each business requires its own
balance—and it may require a different balance at different times.
Balancing is not a mechanical job. It is risk-taking decision. (For
further discussion of these strategic decisions, see Chapter 10,
“Strategic Planning.”)</p>
<p>The Role of Budgeting</p>
<p>Setting and balancing objectives does require a mechanical
expression. The budget is the instrument, and especially the budget for
managed and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Budgeting is commonly conceived as a financial process. But only the
notation is financial the decisions are entrepreneurial. Today the
so-called managed expenditures and the capital expenditures are usually
considered quite separate. But the distinction is an accounting (and
tax) fiction and misleading; both expenditures commit scarce resources
to an uncertain future; both are, economically speaking, expenditures of
capital that are investments in the future. To be viable, the
expenditures have to express the same basic decisions on survival
objectives. Finally, today most of our attention in budgets is given, as
a rule, to other than the managed expenses, especially to the so-called
variable expenses, e.g., wages; historically that is where the most
money was being spent. But no matter how large or small the sums,
decisions on the managed expenses determine the future of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>We have little control over what the accountant calls variable
expenses, those which relate directly to units of production and are
fixed by a certain way of doing things. We can change them, but slowly.
We can change a relationship between units of production and labor costs
(which we, with a certain irony, still consider variable expenses
despite the fringe benefits). But within any time period these expenses
can only be kept at a norm and cannot be changed. This is, of course,
even more true for expenses with respect to past decisions, the fixed
expenses. We cannot undo them at all, whether they are the cost</p>
<p>of past capital investment, local taxes, or insurance premiums to
protect assets. They are beyond management’s control.</p>
<p>Setting Priorities</p>
<p>The two budgets regarding the future, capital expenditures and
managed expenditures, also express the priorities which management
sets.</p>
<p>No business can do everything. Even if it has the money, it will
never have enough good people. It has to set priorities. The worst thing
is to try to do a little bit of everything. This makes sure that nothing
is being accomplished. It is better to pick the wrong priority than none
at all.</p>
<p>Setting priorities is risky. For whatever does not receive priority
is, in effect, abandoned.† There is no formula for making the decision,
but it has to be made, and the mechanism far making it is the budgets
far capital and managed expenditures.</p>
<p>From Objectives to Doing</p>
<p>One final step remains: to convert objectives into doing. Action
rather than knowledge is the purpose of asking, “What is our business,
what will it be, what should it be?” and of thinking through objectives.
The aim is to focus the energies and resources of the organization on
the right results. The end product of business analysis, therefore, is a
work program and specific and concrete work assignments with defined
goals, with deadlines, and with clear accountability. Unless objectives
are converted into action, they are not objectives; they are dreams.</p>
<p>Note on Inflation. One additional aspect of profitability should be
mentioned: the impact of inflation on profits. Traditionally it has been
held that productive assets are a hedge against inflation; they are in a
sense. A steel mill will still be standing, capable of producing steel,
even when the currency has gone to rack and ruin. The original cost of
the mill will have become zero or negligible so that a larger share of
its revenue becomes available to the equity owners. Yet this is a
simplistic view: inflation also destroys assets. It creates spurious
profits, profits which in effect represent destruction of capital. In an
inflation, even in very rapid inflations at the rate of 40 or 60 percent
a year, such as many South American countries have been experiencing,
asset values are, as a rule, not adjusted in the books. In fact, in most
countries this, is forbidden (no longer in Brazil, by the way).
Depreciation charges are, therefore, based on yesterday’s currency
value; and, with a shrinking currency, depreciation rapidly becomes
inadequate. Sooner or later, the asset will have to be replaced, and
then the costs in depreciated currency will be many times greater than
the book value. If this loss is not recognized—and few managements are
even aware of it—profits will be shown which, in effect, are
under-depreciation, and dividends will be paid out which are in effect
distributions of capital. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
in the United States long ago recognized this with respect to the
investments of American companies overseas. It demands that the asset
value of such investments—in a subsidiary in Brazil, for instance—be
adjusted each year to reflect the hidden loss. (Paradoxically, the
American tax authorities refuse to accept this adjustment</p>
<p>*The best work in this area, and in microeconomics is still that of
the German Betriebswissenschaft, to which far too little attention has
been paid outside of Germany.</p>
<p>†For a discussion of priority setting, see my book, The Effective
Executive.</p>
<p>and make a business pay taxes on a profit which the SEC has forced it
to show as a loss in its published accounts.)</p>
<p>In an inflationary situation—and that means in most countries at the
present time— inflation should be considered a genuine cost. There is
good reason to adopt, at least for internal purposes, a method of
accounting in “constant dollars” or “constant yen” or “constant marks.”
At least it forces management to realize that inflation rather than its
own performance underlies a good profit showing.</p>
<p>If American companies had used accounting in constant dollars during
the late sixties, most of them would have realized that they produced no
profits, let alone the profit records of these inflation years. Few of
them showed after-tax profits of more than 8 percent on their assets—yet
the U.S. then had an annual 8 percent inflation rate. Had managers
realized this, they would not have been so surprised at the collapse of
the stock market price of the growth companies in 1969-70.</p>
