That Is Too Big for Its Environment—Why General Motors Should Have Split
Itself—The Company That Is Too Big for Its Economy— Wrong Size Requires
Top-Management Action</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>EING THE WRONG SIZE is a chronic, debilitating, wasting—and a very
com- mon—disease. Being the wrong size is curable in the majority of
cases. But the cure is neither easy nor pleasant. Managements of
companies afflicted with the disease usually resist taking the right
medicine. The cures most managements prefer instead are quackery and
almost certain to aggravate the disease and to make it permanent.</p>
<p>There are many causes for being the wrong size. In certain industries
the minimum vi- able size for a business is very large. It is almost as
impossible, under conditions of pre- sent-day technology, to be a “small
steel company” as it is to be a “small army.” It is al- most impossible
to be a “small petroleum company,” or to be a small company and suc-
cessful in petrochemistry. In fields like those, a small or even a
fair-sized business can survive only if it occupies a distinct
ecological niche that removes it from competition with the industry’s
giants.</p>
<p>In some industries it is the big business that is apparently not
viable. One example may be trade book publishing in the United States.
Publishing houses which publish books for the general reader, whether
fiction or nonfiction (which are known as “trade books” in the
publishing industry), apparently are not likely to be successful unless
small or fair-sized. Trade book publishers that exceed fair size rapidly
build up such overhead expenses, require so much administration, so much
promotion expense, and so large a selling staff as to become marginal.
No such restriction on size seems to apply to publish- ers of textbooks,
technical books, or of “near-books,” such as encyclopedias and refer-
ence books.</p>
<p>There are industries in which a big business and a small business can
prosper. But the in-between businesses, the fair-sized business, is the
“wrong size.” One such industry seems to be the domestic airlines in the
U.S. The trunk lines, that is, the very big airlines such as American
Airlines and TWA, are viable. And so are some “feeder” or commuter
lines, such as PSA on the Pacific West Coast, which give frequent
service to a local, or at least a narrowly circumscribed, territory. The
regional carriers, a Western Airlines or Northeastern, apparently are
not viable. They are too small to have the revenues of the large trunk
carriers, and too large to have the economics of the small local
lines.</p>
<p>What is the right or the wrong size may well change from one period
of time to an- other. Since the end of World War II the size needed to
be an effective competitor in the world economy has changed, for
instance. The middle size is becoming the wrong size. What was a
respectably large international business of perfectly adequate size
thirty or even twenty-five years earlier had, by the early 1970s, become
the wrong size. At the same time, many businesses that are small or, at
best, fair-sized have shown themselves capable of establishing a
distinct leadership position in a distinct ecological niche in the world
economy. The successful multinational company apparently is either very
big or fairly small.</p>
<p>But many more companies are the wrong size because of something that
they them- selves do or fail to do. Typical of the company that is the
wrong size is the fair-sized business, perhaps with 0 to 0 million in
sales, of which about three-quarters are in products and in markets in
which the company has a leadership position while 25 percent of total
sales are in marginal products or in marginal markets in which the
company has, in effect, no business to be. At the same time,
three-quarters or more of the efforts and resources of the company go
toward these marginal products and markets. The company, because of its
earlier achievements, still has a strong position in its main market.
But whatever profit it derives therefrom is swallowed up by the marginal
25 percent, and so are the company’s resources, especially strong
people. As a result, the company’s leader- ship position in its original
market and product line is being steadily eroded and will not last very
long.</p>
<p>Or, typically, there is the company which, in order to obtain orders
for its main prod- uct, has to give away, as “market promotion,” efforts
or products which far exceed in value what the customer pays.</p>
<p>The school furniture division of a well-known American company in the
1950s and 1960s was recognized throughout the industry as the quality
“leader.” It had almost 60 percent of the school furniture market, at
least for new school buildings; and its products commanded a substantial
premium over the products of its competitors. Yet the company lost money
year after year, and the more it increased its sales and market
position, the bigger were its losses. In order to get the contract for
supplying the furniture for a new million school—a contract worth,
maybe, 0,000 or 0,000—the company’s sales peo- ple had to work with the
school board, the architectural firm, or the state engineers, from the
moment the plans for the school first emerged until the school was
finished, four or five years later. The 0,000 contract on furnishing a
new school produces at best a gross profit of 5,000. In order to obtain
it, however, the company had to give free consulting services which,
however conservatively priced, cost more than any profit it could
possibly realize from getting the final sale.</p>
<p>But even what looks at first sight like a problem of industry or
market structure may well be one of managerial mistake or managerial
failure to understand what the “right size” implies for a given
business. American Motors, for instance, is clearly the wrong size in
the American automobile market with an annual sales volume of 300,000
passen- ger cars. But at the very time at which American Motors with a
billion dollars in sales and a sales volume of 300,000 cars a year was
declared a small business and deserving of special financial subsidies,
Volkswagen had become perfectly viable, indeed a highly successful
competitor in the American automobile market with then still
substantially lower volume.</p>
<p>While the causes of being the wrong size may be obscure, the
diagnosis is simple. The symptoms are clear and are always the same. In
a business that is the wrong size, there is always one area, activity,
function, or effort—or at most a very few—which is out of all proportion
and hypertrophied. This area has to be so big, requires so much effort,
and imposes so much cost on the business as to make economic performance
and results im- possible. No matter how much revenue the business can
produce, the hypertrophied area will always absorb more. It is of a
magnitude, weight, or complexity out of all proportion to any achievable
results. And yet it is needed, is indeed still too small, in the
typical</p>
<p>business of the wrong size to satisfy the demands and to support the
volume, the product line, or the market standing of the company.</p>
<p>American Motors’s basic problem is its weak distribution system. It
simply does not have enough dealers. And outside of a few regions where
American Motors is firmly en- trenched such as the Northeast and
California, the dealers are too small and do not do a good enough job,
whether in sales or in service. Yet it is the cost burden of its
distribution system which cripples American Motors. Being in direct
competition with the Big Three—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—and
offering essentially the same lines of automobiles in the lower and
middle price ranges, American Motors is forced, by the structure of the
distribution system for automobiles in the United States, to maintain a
nationwide selling and servicing network. This requires costs which
could be borne only if American Motors had twice the sales volume. To
maintain its competitive position, it has to change its models as often
as the Big Three do and has then to furnish its dealers with all the
parts for all the models on the market so as to give a minimum of
service. Yet the dealers do not have enough volume to build strong
service departments in many areas. Hence, American Motors does not
attract or hold dealers with sufficient capital and suffi- cient selling
ability to build leadership positions in their communities. American
Motors, in other words, is caught in a vicious circle. To obtain the
sales volume which would make it viable, it has to incur distribution
expenses way out of proportion to revenues and has actually to increase
its distribution expenses disproportionately just to stay in its mar-
ket. But at the same time, it does not generate the revenue that would
make such distribu- tion costs economically bearable.</p>
<p>Another example is a company which is in serious trouble even though
it has leader- ship position in its field and adequate sales volume. But
all its sales are concentrated in a very small period of time each year,
either a few weeks or, at most, a few months. Yet to obtain this sales
volume, the company needs substantial research and development work and,
above all, continuous high-quality technical service in the field. These
technical ser- vices have to be maintained at a level adequate to
support the peak sales volume. They have to be maintained and paid
twelve months in the year to obtain six weeks of sales. The company is
justly proud of its technical excellence. But it cannot afford the cost
bur- den this imposes. The disproportion between income obtainable in
six weeks and the cost of maintaining service excellence all year round
is simply too great.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the basic problem of the business that is
the wrong size. The expenses of such a business are always proportionate
to the sale of the hypertrophied ac- tivity or function. Efforts and
costs are always, and in any structure, whether biological or social,
determined by the largest part or the largest organ. But the revenue is,
of course, determined by the actual performance, the actual results. It
is therefore never adequate to support the business of the wrong size.
The hypertrophied function, while absolutely nec- essary—or so it always
seems—constitutes a permanent drain on the business. It saps its
energies and deprives it of resources. And, like a cancer, it is
insatiable and always de- mands “more.” This makes being the wrong size
a degenerative disease. Radical action is needed to cure it and to
re-create a business that is of the right size, a business in which
attainable revenues can support the needed activities.</p>
<p>What Works and What Doesn’t</p>
<p>The normal response of management in a business of the wrong size is
to try to bring the sales of the business up to the size required to
support the hypertrophied function. It is to plan for “growth” which, it
is hoped, will bring about balance.</p>
<p>Again American Motors furnishes the example. Since the late fifties,
the company has tried several times to raise its sales volume. In the
spring of 1972 American Motors an- nounced once more a plan aggressively
to recruit new and strong dealers and to push its sales up to 600,000
cars a year, almost twice its then current volume. It again decided to
increase its distribution expenses to produce the needed volume. Such a
strategy might conceivably work, but the odds are against it. In order
to obtain the sales volume that</p>
<p>would give the business a viable size, the expenses which make the
business nonviable have to be increased—as the American Motors example
shows. And this is precisely what the business cannot afford. The great
probability is that such a strategy will have to be abandoned, and often
just when it is beginning to bear results.</p>
<p>A company may have no choice but to attempt such a strategy. But it
is a strategy of despair. It should be considered only as a last resort.
Unfortunately most managements consider it the only available strategy
and the one to use, and to use again, whether it shows results or
not.</p>
<p>A comparison between American Motors and Volkswagen shows the
difference be- tween being the wrong size as a result of lack of
distinction, and being the right size by occupying a distinct ecological
niche. In sales volume in the American market American Motors still had
a substantial edge in the mid-sixties. But American Motors, offering the
same cars as the Big Three to the same American buyer, engaged in
direct, head-on com- petition with the products of General Motors, Ford,
and Chrysler, and had to bear the same costs of an annual model change.
Volkswagen, however, at that time offered only the “Beetle” and the
Minibus. Neither was in competition with Detroit. Neither was aimed at
the choice customers for new cars. The Beetle was bought by people who
otherwise would have bought a second-hand car. And there was then no car
on the American market in competition with the Minibus. Volkswagen did
not offer an annual model change but rather emphasized that its models
remained the same year after year—which enabled Volkswagen to offer
excellent service to its American customers with a minimum of parts
inventory and therefore of dealer capital.</p>
<p>But how does one turn oneself from being an “American Motors” into a
“Volks- wagen”?</p>
<p>Two lessons, both from the same industry, but each of a different
strategy, are con- tained in the conversion of the “artificial silk”
companies into different businesses when the petrochemical textile
fibers, beginning with nylon, made them the “wrong size” after World War
II.</p>
<p>Unti1 then the “artificial silks,” such as rayon, had enjoyed
distinction. The major chemical companies, by and large, lacked
scientific and technical knowledge to enter the field; the artificial
silks were based on wood pulp, which is a material the chemical com-
panies know nothing about. And the petroleum companies had no incentive
before the late 1940s to enter a field which did not utilize any of
their products. With the advent of the petrochemical fibers this changed
drastically. The chemical companies now suddenly had the technical
expertise, and they had also the means to mount massive research
etforts. For the petroleum companies, petrochemical fibers became a
highly attractive way to bring their product, crude oil, to the market.
They also had the cash flow to support mas- sive investments. The old
artificial silk companies could not compete with the much lar- ger
chemica1 companies in massive research. Nor could they compete with the
cash flow of the large oil companies. Yet, the artificial silk companies
had to become producers of the new petrochemical fibers or perish.</p>
<p>The two leading artificial silk companies in Great Britain and the
United States, re- spectively, Courtaulds and Celanese Corporation of
America, reestablished themselves as viable businesses within distinct
ecological niches in which they again had leadership positions. Both
restored themselves to the right size. But they followed different
strate- gies.</p>
<p>Courtaulds integrated forward, mainly through the acquisition of
major customers for textile fibers, that is, fabric producers. It
thereby assured itself of a market for its own petrochemical fibers, but
also of the ability to use other producers’ fibers and to make a profit
on them.</p>
<p>Celanese Corporation of America remained essentially a producer of
textile fibers rather than a producer of textile fabrics (even though it
too made some acquisitions among textile converters). But it developed a
strategy of becoming the preferred channel through which other—and
particularly non-American—companies would bring their syn- thetic
petrochemical fibers into the American market. Celanese, in other words,
built its strategy on its marketing strength, which then offered such
non-American giants as Impe- rial Chemicals of Great Britain a vehicle
for obtaining market position and leadership in the U.S. for their
research results, which otherwise would have been very expensive to
obtain.</p>
<p>Both companies essentially exploited their knowledge of the market in
a manner suited to their economy. The Courtaulds strategy would not have
worked in the United States, where the textile industry is too big and
too diversified for any one outside sup- plier to obtain by acquisition
a dominant position. In Great Britain, on the other hand, the Celanese
strategy would not have worked. For the major non-British producers of
petro- chemical fibers, especially the Americans, prefer marketing their
own products worldwide and would not have been receptive to the
licensing strategy which Celanese developed and exploited
successfully.</p>
<p>These two examples show that the strategy of changing the economic
characteristics of one’s business to overcome the problem of the wrong
size is an exceedingly difficult one. It is highly risky. Not only is
failure of the effort risky. There is an even greater risk, that of
making a successful effort only to find out that it has not really
changed anything. It is most difficult indeed to say in advance what
strategy will produce a business that has different economic
characteristics and what strategy will work only in the short run, no
matter how successful, and might, in the long run, make things even
worse.</p>
<p>American Motors again supplies a clear illustration. The first
attempt to cure its size problem was the design of the “compact” in the
early fifties. The compact car was a smaller version of what up till
then had been the Detroit “standard” car; cheaper, but also more adapted
to heavy traffic and to parking in congested cities, and yet a
full-service car, giving the American family the space to which it had
become accustomed. It was an in- stantaneous success and produced
substantial results for American Motors for a few years. But it was a
pyrrhic victory and in the end made American Motors’ position worse than
it had been before. For there was nothing to the compact which the Big
Three could not easily do just as well. It fitted their dealer system,
their design and engineering exper- tise, and their production
facilities far better than it did American Motors’s. And so American
Motors, in effect, achieved little except to create a market for the Big
Three, a market in which again it found itself to be the wrong size.</p>
<p>In retrospect it is easy to see that the compact was the wrong
strategy for American Motors. But it is also easy to see why, in the
1950s, the compact appeared to be the solu- tion to American Motors’s
management and the means for transforming the business into the right
size.</p>
<p>Merger and Acquisition</p>
<p>The second strategy, and one that is much less risky, is to try to
cure the size problem by merger or acquisition. Indeed, being the wrong
size is one of the few cases where serious thought about merger or
acquisition is a must. The problem cannot, to repeat, be cured by growth
from within as a rule. It requires a “quantum jump.” And this, of
course, merger and acquisition can provide.</p>
<p>The aim of such a merger or acquisition must not, however, be volume,
as such. To pile additional volume on the wrong foundation is asking for
trouble. The aim is to try to find the missing piece that, put together
with what one has, will result in a genuine whole.</p>
<p>The aim is to find a business that also suffers from being the wrong
size—but for the op- posite reasons. If a company needs to have an
oversized distribution system or an over- sized research effort to stay
in business, it needs to look for a business which has too large a
product line for its distribution system or its research capacities. At
the same time, to make it the right fit, the product lines of the two
businesses should be compatible; that is, should be able to use the same
distribution system or the same research capacity.</p>
<p>The merger and acquisition strategy therefore requires understanding
of the reasons why one’s business is the wrong size. But if they are
clearly understood and if the proper match can be arranged, the cure is
likely to be rapid and complete.</p>
<p>Sale and Divestment</p>
<p>The final strategy for the business that is the wrong size is sale,
divestment, or systematic shrinkage. It is a strategy managements as a
rule find so distasteful that they rarely even consider it. Yet it is by
all odds the one most likely to succeed. Wherever applicable, it should
be adopted.</p>
<p>It should always be followed if the wrong size is the result of
expanding from the strong and secure foundation of leadership into a lot
of marginal areas. The fair-sized business which dilutes its strength by
building a lot of “beachheads” without ever securing a beach should
withdraw its forces and cut back on its efforts. It should admit that it
has made a mistake. This is not just a strategy for the small and
fair-sized business. It is equally important to the big business which,
for whatever reason, finds itself in a marginal area in which it is the
wrong size.</p>
<p>In the early seventies, General Electric sold off its computer
business to Honeywell. It had proven to be the wrong size. It was much
too big to do anything but compete head-on in the major computer
markets. Yet it was much too small to be a serious challenger to IBM.
Combined with Honeywell, which by that time had already established
itself as a successful computer manufacturer of small to medium-sized
computers, the new company had enough business to support the massive
research effort, the tremendous sales effort needed in the computer
business, and the capital investment. Had General Electric not acted
when there was still someone to sell its computer business to but waited
only a year or two longer, it would, like its closest competitor in the
computer market, RCA, have had to close out the computer business and
take a tremendous loss.</p>
<p>In his essay “On Being the Right Size,” J.B.S. Haldane in 1928
concluded that “small” and “large” were meaningless terms for biological
organisms. The right size mat- tered, whether that was being small like
the termite, or large like the elephant, both being highly successful
species. The same can be said for a business. Absolute size by itself is
no indicator of success and achievement, let alone of managerial
competence. Being the</p>
<p>right size is.</p>
<p>Can a Company Be Too Big?</p>
<p>Whether a company can be too big to be manageable is an old question.
There can be little doubt that a company can become too complex. Indeed
some of today’s multina- tional conglomerates are clearly at the very
bounds of manageability. But mere bigness by itself seems so far not to
have reached proportions which exceed manageability. Our ca- pacity to
structure and to organize the management job has so far kept pace with
bigness in business.</p>
<p>This does not, however, mean that there is no limit beyond which size
will become unmanageable. It only means that the typical business,
whether manufacturing or service business, has not yet reached it. Other
institutions, however, clearly have.</p>
<p>The Unmanageable Service Institution</p>
<p>One example is today’s defense establishment of a major power such as
that of the United States. It was right in the late forties to unify the
American armed services, or at least to put them under unified command.
There was essentially no alternative. But the resulting</p>
<p>monster is so big that it defies control. Indeed, what the first
Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, is reported to have said of the
unified armed services of the United States in the late forties, only
half in jest, has been proven to be true: “The peacetime mission of the
armed services of the United States is to destroy the Secretary of
Defense.”</p>
<p>We know that a hospital becomes increasingly less manageable when it
exceeds 1,000 beds or so. And the very large hospitals—for instance,
those monsters among New York City, hospitals, Bellevue and Kings County
with 3,000 to 4,000 beds apiece—are clearly too big for effective
management and decent patient care.</p>
<p>But there are also businesses which are too big, or at least so big
as to bump clearly against a limitation on their manageability. They are
to be found among the business ser- vice businesses, such as consulting,
auditing, and advertising.</p>
<p>The large multinational auditing firm with 5,000 or 6,000
professionals spread over 120 offices in thirty or forty countries is
not manageable. More and more of the top peo- ple spend more and more of
their time trying to coordinate, administer, and hold together this vast
mess of professionals, each of whom supposedly has to do his own work in
his own way and yet to exacting professional standards. The same may be
true of the very large management-consulting firms or of the advertising
agencies with offices in thirty or forty countries serving multinational
as well as local clients.</p>
<p>Business services depend on the ability of the top people to give
personal example and at the same time to know what goes on. But one
cannot give personal example to 6,000 professional people spread out
over many countries. One cannot have direct knowledge of 400 to 500
consulting assignments or “assignment teams,” each of which has to be
able to do its own work without much supervision and yet with high
professional standards of quality.</p>
<p>In business service firms, therefore, the question of the absolute
limit should be taken most seriously. And long before this limit is
being approached the business service firm is well advised to split
itself into a number of independent and competing firms. Each of these
“daughters” is likely to do better than the overweight parent.</p>
<p>Service staffs within a business or within a public-service
institution can also—and easily—become too large to be manageable and to
function. Like the business service firm, they depend on the competence,
knowledge, and attention of a limited number of high-grade
professionals. A service staff that gets big either dilutes this
personal quality or it becomes so busy running itself, worrying about
its own internal machinery and its own “inside” concerns, that it ceases
to give service.</p>
<p>An example is the big service staffs which some of the conglomerates
have built up to supply expertise and leadership in specific
areas—manufacturing, for instance— “across the board” to a multitude of
subsidiaries and affiliates each engaged in a different busi- ness and
supplying a different market. One such conglomerate has, for instance,
around 300 different “businesses,” ranging from quite small to very
large, from near-commodity businesses (e.g., bakeries making bread) to
highly technological businesses and to busi- nesses engaged entirely in
such service operations as shipping or hotels. The manufactur- ing
services staff of the company has 900 members—far too many for each of
them to be a truly first-rate man, capable of directing and managing
himself. Indeed, of the 900 al- most one-third do not do any “services”
work but administer the staff itself. Yet, the staff is too big to be
manageable—there is endless confusion, constant friction, and’ ceaseless
meetings to debate what work to do, when, where, and how—and very little
time for the work. Yet the staff is too small to serve a client
effectively. In such work one has first to know a fair amount about the
specific manufacturing process the client uses—and no one can master 300
processes. But also to serve a client with any impact one has to be able
to give a few days a year exclusively to his problems. There are 300
clients. Manufacturing, as the company understands the term, is broken
down into almost twenty “sub- disciplines” from assembly operations to
production scheduling. To be able to give five days a year to one of the
client businesses—probably the minimum needed—would there- fore require
a staff at least three times its present size—and an overhead burden to
match. As it is, the staff can only grind out memoranda, make “formal
presentations,” and write</p>
<p>theoretical treatises on the “principles of production scheduling”
which duplicate what is available in the management literature at a tiny
fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Institutions, in other words, can well be too big. But as far as
individual businesses are concerned there has, so far, been no example
of a company that outgrew its manageabil- ity—the way the U.S.
Department of Defense, the giant hospital, the multinational audit- ing
firm, and the service staff in the conglomerate have outgrown manageable
size. Espe- cially where federal decentralization (see Chapter 46) can
be applied, even very large businesses are apparently still within the
limits of manageability.</p>
<p>The Optimum Point</p>
<p>There is, however, also an optimum point—and it may well have been
reached by some of the giants—beyond which additional size no longer
improves performance capacity but begins to impede it. The optimum size
may, in other words, be well below maximum size. And such a business
would be well advised to consider splitting itself.</p>
<p>The prime example has for three-quarters of a century been U.S.
Steel, the giant of the American steel industry. Consistently it has
done far worse than its smaller competitors. The optimum size in the
American steel industry, judging by performance—whether this be defined
as profitability or as leadership in innovation—seems to be that of
companies such as Armco, Republic, or Inland Steel which, while very big
businesses indeed, are no more than a third the size of “Big Steel.”</p>
<p>Very big companies should test themselves to find the point beyond
which further size no longer produces economies of scale but on the
contrary produces dis-economies. Where in terms of size is the point of
diminishing returns for a given business? At that point the management
owes it to its trust—it owes it to employees, shareholders, the
community—not to grow but rather to think through how to give birth to
new independent businesses that then have the capacity for growth and
can benefit again from the econo- mies of scale.</p>
<p>One public-service institution has done this successfully. The
University of Toronto in Canada decided around 1960 that it would not
grow beyond 15,000 students. At the same time, it also realized that
there was need for university growth in the province of Ontario. It
therefore embarked on a systematic program of starting new universities,
supplying them with faculty and staff for the first few years,
subsidizing and guiding them for a short time, but cutting them loose as
soon as they were graduating their first class. The new institutions,
such as York University (also in Toronto though in a different part of
the city), have shown remarkable vigor. They very rapidly developed into
institutions with their own profile, their own personality, and their
own educational philosophy, thus offer- ing students in Ontario a choice
between different approaches to higher education.</p>
<p>In business, however, such strategies are so far very rare.</p>
<p>The closest is the strategy of Johnson andandandand Johnson in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. This manufacturer of medical and sanitary
supplies has long had a policy of starting a “new company” as soon as
any new product or new market reaches appreciable size. By this method
it has kept businesses reasonably small and highly manageable. And yet
Johnson andandandand Johnson itself has been able to grow into a truly
big multinational company, and one of the most productive and profitable
ones.</p>
<p>Too Big for the Environment</p>
<p>But the major problem of bigness in business is not internal. It is
not manageability. It is the company that is too big in relation to its
environment.</p>
<p>Any company is too big when it no longer can make business and
management deci- sions in the interest of the company, its stockholders,
and employees, because its size im- pairs its freedom of action. It is
too big if, out of concern for the community, or for fear of the
reaction of the community, it is forced into doing the wrong things, the
things that management itself knows will damage the business.</p>
<p>One example is General Motors. Internally GM is clearly eminently
manageable. But since the mid-twenties or so, that is, since it became
the leader of the American automo- bile industry and acquired a market
share of 50 percent or more of the total U.S. market, GM management has
known that the company cannot get a larger market share without running
into antitrust problems. This is largely the reason why GM, though fully
cogni- zant, one assumes, of the risk it ran, decided not to compete
against the small foreign im- ported automobile when it first appeared
in the 1950s and 1960s. There was no point for GM in trying to expand
its market share. In fact, there was every reason for keeping mar- ket
share where it was, that is, well below 60 percent (and this was already
a good deal higher than earlier GM managements would have considered
prudent). As a result, GM abandoned the “lower end” of the market to the
foreign imports. It concentrated on the middle and upper ends which, of
course, are the far more profitable segments of the mar- ket. But this
also meant that there was no leadership to keep the American-made
automo- bile truly competitive even in its own domestic market. By the
early seventies, when the imports had become a challenge to Detroit, and
a threat to the American balance of pay- ments and therefore to the
American position in the world economy, so much of the mar- ket had been
ceded to the imports—first the Germans with Volkswagen and then the
Japanese—that the counteroffensive had become a formidable
undertaking.</p>
<p>This is not just hindsight. A good many people, even within GM, saw
clearly in the forties that GM, with 50 percent or more of the market,
had become too big for its own good. Some of the younger staff men in GM
headquarters seriously discussed spinning off Chevrolet and setting it
up as a separate company. And Chevrolet, by itself, would have been a
very big company with something like 25 percent of the American market;
that is, larger than Ford or Chrysler.</p>
<p>Yet GM top management considered even the mere mention of a Chevrolet
spin-off to be outright treason. In the company that is too big pride
always gets in the way of man- agement vision.</p>
<p>There are quite a few companies of far smaller size than GM which are
still too big for their community. There are many companies which cannot
do the things they and their own management know to be the right things
to do for the business because they are re- strained by their size in
relation to their community.</p>
<p>The typical example is the company, perhaps even a fairly small one,
which is the dominant employer in an area. Any company which is the
mainstay of its community is too big. It can no longer move with
freedom. It has only two choices: either to become “father and mother”
to the community and to take over control of its welfare, its cultural
life, and its community organization; or, it can become the “ugly,” the
tyrant, the autocrat, the bully. And the line between the two is
blurred. Yesterday’s benefactor becomes to- day’s bully very fast. It is
indeed debatable whether the “benefactor” is harmed more by being too
big than the bully. Neither has freedom of action any more.</p>
<p>Any company which finds itself arguing, “We cannot do this no matter
how badly we need it because of the impact on the community,” is too
big. If it persists in expanding in the community, it sacrifices the
best interests of the business, but also the best interests of the
community, to the vanity and lust for power of its management. And this
is betrayal of management trust. The company may be quite small; what
matters is its relative size. The one-company, one-employer community is
healthy neither for the company nor for the community.</p>
<p>The least such a company needs to do is not to expand any further in
its community.</p>
<p>The least it needs to do is not to aggravate the situation. This is
not “social responsibil- ity.” This is business responsibility.</p>
<p>A company exploiting a natural resource, such as copper or petroleum,
has little choice. It has to establish itself where the resource is. If
this then means that it will be too big, the question is only how to
mitigate the impact. The situation itself cannot be reme- died. Anaconda
has little choice but to be “too big” in Butte, Montana. This is where
the copper is. The petroleum companies have little choice but to be “too
big” in the Arab countries along the Persian Gulf. This is where the oil
is. But companies in other indus-</p>
<p>tries, in manufacturing, in distribution, in financial and other
services, have no such ex- cuse. As soon as such a company finds that
its community has become so dependent on it that the company’s freedom
of business action and business decision is seriously im- paired, it
owes it to itself, but also to the community, to stop getting bigger and
to try to reduce, if only gradually, the mutual dependence between
business and community. It has to take effective action to reduce itself
to a size which is manageable. For being too big for one’s environment
is, in effect, to be unmanageable.</p>
<p>A company can also be too big for a particular economy. Both the
Japanese and the French governments have been forcing companies within
their own countries—in steel, for instance, and in chemicals—to merge to
be able to compete in the world economy and to hold their own against
the multinationals. The results are companies that are still not big
enough to compete on even terms in the world economy. Yet these
companies are too big for their own national economies. So many jobs
depend on them that no government could afford to see them disappear or
even to allow them to become smaller and to reduce their employment. Yet
if there is one thing predictable in business life, it is that every
business goes through a period of trouble sooner or later. If and when
this happens, the French and Japanese governments will have no choice
but to subsidize and eventually to take over these creatures of their
own policies. This, needless to say, will not improve their position or
save the companies. It will only convert an economic problem into a ma-
jor political problem. Again the villain is pride, though governmental
rather than manage- rial pride.</p>
<p>The business that is the wrong size—whether too small for its market
or for key activi- ties needed; or too big for environment, community,
or economy—is one of the toughest problems a top management can face.
But it is not a problem that will cure itself. It re- quires courage,
integrity, hard thinking, and purposeful action.</p>
