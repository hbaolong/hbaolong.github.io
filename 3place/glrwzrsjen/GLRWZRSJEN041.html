<h4 id="controls-control-and-management">39 Controls, Control, and
Management</h4>
<p>Controls and Control—The Characteristics of Controls—Controls Are
Goal-Setting and Value-Setting—Controls Needed for Measurable and for
Nonmeasurable Events—The Specification for
Controls—Economy—Meaning—Controls Follow
Strategy—Appropriateness—Congruence—Timeliness—Simplicity—Controls Must
Be Operational—The Ultimate Control of Organizations—Controls and the
Spirit of an Organization</p>
<p>trol, the two words, in the context of social institutions, have
different meanings alto- gether. The synonyms for controls are
measurement and information. The synonym for control is direction.
Controls pertain to means, control to an end. Controls deal with facts,
that is, with events of the past. Control deals with expectations, that
is, with the future. Controls are analytical, concerned with what was
and is. Control is normative and con- cerned with what ought to be.</p>
<p>We are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business and in other so- cial institutions, based on a great
improvement in techniques, especially in the application of logical and
mathematical tools to events in a social institution, and in the ability
to process and analyze large masses of data very fast. What does this
mean for control? Spe- cifically, what are the requirements for these
greatly improved controls to give better con- trol to management? For,
in the task of a manager, controls are purely a means to an end; the end
is control.</p>
<p>Ordinary language and its use make abundantly clear that here is a
problem. The man in a business who is charged with producing the
controls is the controller. But most, if not all executives, including
most controllers themselves, would consider it gross misuse and abuse of
controllership were this controller to use his controls to exercise
control in the business. This, they would argue, would actually make the
business be “out of control” altogether.</p>
<p>The reasons for this apparent paradox lie in the complexity both of
human beings and of the social task.</p>
<p>If we deal with a human being in a social institution, controls must
become personal motivation that leads to control. Instead of a
mechanical system, the control system in a human-social situation is a
volitional system. That we know very little about the will is not even
the central point. A translation is required before the information
yielded by the controls can become grounds for action—the translation of
one kind of information into another, which we call perception.</p>
<p>In the social institution there is a second complexity, a second
“uncertainty principle.”</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to prefigure the responses appropriate to a
certain event in a social situation.</p>
<p>We can, and do, build controls into a machine which slow down the
turning speed whenever it exceeds a certain figure. And we can do this
either by mechanical means or by instrumentation which shows a human
operator what the turning speed is, and which gives him the specific,
unambiguous instruction to turn the speed down when the indicator
reaches a certain point. But a control-reading “profits are falling”
does not indicate, with any degree of probability, the response “raise
prices,” let alone by how much; the control- reading “sales are falling”
does not indicate the response “cut prices,” and so on. There is not
only a large number of other equally probable responses—so large that it
is usually not even possible to identify them in advance—there is also
no indication in the event itself which of these responses is even
possible, let alone appropriate, not to mention its being right. The
event itself may not even be meaningful. But even if it is, it is by no
means certain what it means. And the probability of its being meaningful
is a much more important datum than the event itself and one which is
almost never to be discerned by analyzing the event.</p>
<p>Social situations require a decision based on assumptions—and
essentially assump- tions not with respect to the recorded event but to
the future, that is, expectations which know no probability but can only
be judged according to plausibility. For there are no “facts” regarding
the future in a social universe in which periodicity—at least on our
min- uscule time scale—cannot be assumed, must indeed be considered
quite unlikely.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Controls</p>
<p>There are three major characteristics of controls in business
enterprise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Controls can be neither objective nor neutral. When we measure the
rate of fall of a stone, we are totally outside the event itself. By
measuring we do not change the event; and measuring the event does not
change us, the observers. Measuring physical phenom- ena is both
objective and neutral.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everybody who ever watched the introduction of a budget system has
seen this hap- pen. For a long time—in some companies forever—realizing
the budget figures becomes more important than what the budget is
supposed to measure, namely economic perform- ance. Managers, upon first
being exposed to a budget system, often deliberately hold back sales and
cut back profits rather than be guilty of “not making the budget.” It
takes years of experience and a very intelligent budget director to
restore the balance. And there are any number of otherwise perfectly
normal research directors who act on the conviction that it is a greater
crime to get research results for less than the budgeted amount than not
getting any research results at all while spending all the “proper”
budget money.</p>
<p>Controls in a social institution such as a business are goal-setting
and value-setting.</p>
<p>They are not “objective.” They are of necessity moral. The only way
to avoid this is to flood the executive with so many controls that the
entire system becomes meaningless, becomes mere “noise.”</p>
<p>From that point of view maybe the gross abuse of our new
data-processing capacity, namely as a tool for grinding out huge
quantities of totally meaningless data—an abuse of which every early
computer user is guilty—may be a blessing after all.</p>
<p>But to render controls harmless by rendering them meaningless is
hardly the right way to use our capacity to provide controls. This must
start out with the realization that con- trols create vision. They
change both the events measured and the observer. They endow</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Controls need to focus on results. Business (and every other social
institution) ex- ists to contribute to society, economy, and individual.
In consequence results in business exist only on the outside—in economy,
in society, and with the customer. It is the cus- tomer only who creates
a “profit.” Everything inside a business—manufacturing, market- ing,
research, and so on—creates only costs, is only a “cost center.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, the managerial area is concerned with costs alone.
But results are en- trepreneurial.</p>
<p>Yet we do not have adequate, let alone reliable, information
regarding the “outside.” It is not only by far the hardest to get—to the
point where no organization for the acquisi- tion and collection of
meaningful outside information could really be set up—the job is much
too big. Above all we still lack necessary entrepreneurial concepts. The
job itself has never been thought through—at least not so far. And the
century of patient analysis of managerial, inside phenomena, events and
data, the century of patient, skillful work on the individual operations
and tasks within the business, has no counterpart with respect to the
entrepreneurial job.</p>
<p>We can easily record and therefore quantify efficiency, that is,
efforts. We have very few instruments to record and quantify effects,
that is, the outside. But even the most effi- cient buggy-whip
manufacturer would no longer be in business. It is of little value to
have the most efficient engineering department if it designs the wrong
product. The Cuban sub- sidiaries of U.S. companies were by far the best
run and, apparently, the most profit- able—let alone the least
“troublesome”—of all U.S. operations in Latin America. This was,
however, irrelevant to their expropriation. And it mattered little, I
daresay, during the period of IBM’s great expansion in the fifties and
sixties how “efficient” its operations were; its basic entrepreneurial
idea was the right, the effective one.</p>
<p>The outside, the area of results, is much less accessible than the
inside. The central problem of the executive in the large organization
is his—necessary—insulation from the outside. This applies to the
president of the United States as well as to the president of United
States Steel. What today’s organization therefore needs are synthetic
sense organs for the outside. If modern controls are to make a
contribution, it would be, above all, here.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Controls are needed for measurable and non-measurable events.
Business, like any other institution, has important results that are
incapable of being measured. Any experi- enced executive knows companies
or industries which are bound for extinction because they cannot attract
or hold able people. This, every experienced executive also knows, is a
more important fact about a company or an industry than last year’s
profit statement. Any logical positivist who were to tell an executive
that this statement, being incapable of un- ambiguous definition, is a
“non-statement” dealing with a “non-problem,” would be quickly—and
correctly—dismissed as an ass. Yet the statement cannot be defined
clearly let alone “quantified.” It is anything but “intangible”; it is
very “tangible” indeed (as any- one ever having to do with such a
business quickly finds out). It is just non-measurable. And measurable
results will not show up for a decade.</li>
</ol>
<p>But business also has measurable and quantifiable results of true
meaning and signifi- cance. These are all those that have to do with
past economic performance. For these can be expressed in terms of the
very peculiar measurement of the economic sphere, money.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these are “tangibles.” Indeed most of the
things we can meas- ure by money are so totally “intangible”—take
depreciation for instance—that they outdo any Platonic Idea in that
nothing corresponds to them in any reality whatever. But they are
measurable.</p>
<p>To this comes the fact that the measurable results are things that
happened; they are in the past. There are no facts about the future. To
this comes, second, the fact that the measurable events are primarily
inside events rather than outside events. The important developments on
the outside, the things which determine that the buggy-whip industry</p>
<p>disappears and that IBM becomes a big business—let alone that Cuban
subsidiaries of American companies are confiscated—are not measurable
until it is too late to have con- trol.</p>
<p>A balance between the measurable and the non-measurable is therefore
a central and constant problem of management and a true decision
area.</p>
<p>Measurements which do not spell out the assumptions with respect to
the non- measurable statements that are being made—at least as
parameters or as restraints— misdirect therefore. They actually
misinform. Yet the more we can quantify the truly measurable areas, the
greater the temptation to put all-out emphasis on those—the greater,
therefore, the danger that what looks like better controls will actually
mean less control if not a business out of control altogether.</p>
<p>Specifications for Controls</p>
<p>To give the manager control, controls must satisfy seven
specifications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Control is a principle of economy. The less effort needed to gain
control, the better the control design. The fewer controls needed, the
more effective they will be. Indeed, adding more controls does not give
better control. All it does is create confusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first question the manager therefore needs to ask in designing or
in using a system of controls is “What is the minimum information I need
to know to have control?”</p>
<p>The answer may vary for different managers. The company’s treasurer
needs only to know the total amount invested in inventories and whether
it is going up or down. The sales manager needs to know the half a dozen
products and product lines which together account for 70 percent of
inventory, and those in considerable detail. But total inventory amount
is not of primary importance to him. And both the treasurer and the
sales manager do not, as a rule, need complete inventory figures except
once or twice a year; a fairly small sample should give them all the
information they need in between. But the ware- house clerk needs daily
figures—and in detail.</p>
<p>The capacity of the computer to spew out huge masses of data does not
make for bet- ter controls. On the contrary, what gives control is first
the question “What is the smallest number of reports and statistics
needed to understand a phenomenon and to be able to anticipate it?” And
then one asks, “And what is the minimum of data regarding this phe-
nomenon that gives a reasonably reliable picture?”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Controls must be meaningful. That means that the events to be
measured must be significant either in themselves, e.g., market
standing, or they must be symptoms of at least potentially significant
developments, e.g., a sudden sharp rise in labor turnover or
absenteeism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Trivia should never be measured. One has control by controlling a few
developments which can have significant impact on performance and
results. One loses control by trying to control the infinity of events
which are marginal to performance and results.</p>
<p>Controls should always be related to the key objectives and to the
priorities within them, to “key activities” and to “conscience areas”
(see Chapter 42). Controls should, in other words, be based on a
company’s definition of what our business is, what it will be, and what
it should be.</p>
<p>Controls Follow Strategy</p>
<p>Whatever is not essential to the attainment of a company’s objectives
should be measured infrequently and only to prevent deterioration. It
should be strictly controlled by “excep- tion,” that is, a standard
should be set, measurement should be periodical and on a sample basis;
and only significant shortfalls below the established standard should
even be re- ported, let alone paid attention to.</p>
<p>That we can quantify something is no reason for measuring it. The
question is “Is this what a manager should consider important?” “Is this
what a manager’s attention should be focused on?” “Is this a true
statement of the basic realities of the enterprise?” “Is this the proper
focus for control, that is, for effective direction with maximum economy
of ef- fort?”</p>
<p>If these questions are not being asked in designing controls, we will
end up by making business essentially uncontrolled—for then we will
simply have no remedy except to pro- liferate control information to the
point where it does not register at all.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Controls have to be appropriate to the character and nature of the
phenomena measured. This may well be the most important specification;
yet it is least observed in the actual design of controls.</li>
</ol>
<p>Formal complaints, that is, grievances, coming out of a work force
are commonly re- ported as “five grievances per thousand employees per
month.” This is formally valid. But is it structurally valid? Or is it
misdirection? The impression this report conveys is, first, that
grievances are distributed throughout the work force in a random manner.
They follow, the report seems to say, a U-shaped Gaussian distribution.
And second—a conclu- sion from the first impression—they are a minor
problem, especially if we deal with five grievances per thousand
employees per month. This, while formally valid, completely
misrepresents and misinforms, let alone misdirects.</p>
<p>Grievances are a social event. Physical nature knows no such
phenomena. And social events are almost never distributed in the “normal
distribution” we find in the physical world. The normal distribution of
social events is almost always exponential—with the hyperbola the
typical curve. In other words, the great majority of departments in the
plant, employing 95 percent of the work force, normally does not have
even a single grievance during one year. But in one department,
employing only a handful of men, we have a heavy incidence of
grievances—so that the “five per thousand” may well mean (and in the
actual example from which I took these figures, did mean) a major
grievance per man per year. If this department is then the final
assembly through which all the production has to pass, and if the
workers in this department go out on strike when their grievances are
be- ing neglected by a management which has been misled by its own
controls, the impact can be shattering. It bankrupted the company, which
is no longer in existence.</p>
<p>Similarly, 90 percent of the volume of a business is usually
represented by 2 to 5 per cent of the number of its products. But 90
percent of the orders by number cover, typi- cally, only 4 or 5 percent
of the volume—but account for 90 percent and more of the costs. A modern
strategic bomber may have a million parts. But 90 percent of its cost is
represented by a very small number of parts, maybe fifty or so—and so is
90 percent of the upkeep it needs, though, unfortunately, the 90 percent
of the dollars and the 90 per- cent of the upkeep needs rarely comprise
the same parts.</p>
<p>Practically all the innovations in a research laboratory, no matter
how large, come out of the work of a very small percentage of the
research people. And invariably, 80 percent of a company’s distributors
move, at best, 20 percent of its output, while 10 percent or fewer of
the distributors move two-thirds to three-quarters of total sales.</p>
<p>Most measurements of sales performance, whether of the entire sales
force or of the individual salesman, report sales in total dollars. But
in many businesses this is an inap- propriate figure. The same dollar
volume of sales may mean a substantial profit, no profit at all, or a
sizable loss—dependent on the product mix sold. An absolute sales figure
not related to product mix, therefore, gives no control whatever—neither
to the individual salesman, nor to the sales manager, nor to top
management.</p>
<p>These are elementary things. Yet few managers seem to know them. The
traditional information systems, especially accounting, conceal
appropriateness rather than highlight it. (In particular the allocation
of overhead tends to obscure the true distribution of eco- nomic and
social phenomena.)</p>
<p>Without controls that bring out clearly what the real structure of
events is, the manager not only lacks knowledge. He will tend to do the
wrong things. For all the weight of the daily work pushes him toward
allocating energies and resources in proportion to the num- ber of
events. There is a constant drift toward putting energies and resources
where they can have the least results, that is, on the vast number of
phenomena which, together, ac- count for practically no effects.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Measurements have to be congruent with the events measured. Alfred
North Whitehead (1851-1947), the distinguished logician and philosopher,
used to warn against the “danger of the false concreteness.” A
measurement does not become more “accurate” by being worked out to the
sixth decimal when the phenomenon measured is at best capa- ble of being
verified within a range of, say, 50 to 70 percent (and that, presumably,
with an error of plus or minus 20 percent). This is “false
concreteness,” gross inaccuracy in reality, and misleading.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is an important piece of information that this or that phenomenon
cannot be meas- ured with precision but can be described only within a
range or as a magnitude. To say “we have 26 percent of the market”
sounds reassuringly precise. But it is usually so inac- curate a
statement as to be virtually meaningless. What it really means, as a
rule, is “we are not the dominant factor in the market, but we are not
marginal either.” And even then the statement is no more reliable than
the definition of the market which underlies it.</p>
<p>It is up to the manager to think through what kind of measurement is
congruent to the phenomenon it is meant to measure. He has to know when
“approximate” is more accu- rate than a firm-looking figure worked out
in great detai1. He has to know when a range is more accurate than even
an approximate single figure. He has to know that “larger” and
“smaller,” “earlier” and “later,” “up” and “down” are quantitative terms
and often more accurate, indeed more rigorous, than any specific figures
or range of figures.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Controls have to be timely. The time dimension of controls is very
similar to their congruence. Again frequent measurements and very rapid
“reporting back” do not neces- sarily give better control. Indeed they
may frustrate control. The time dimension of con- trols has to
correspond to the time span of the event measured.</li>
</ol>
<p>It has lately become fashionable to talk of “real time” controls,
that is, of controls that inform instantaneously and continuously. There
are events where “real time” controls are highly desirable. If a batch
of antibiotics in the fermentation tank spoils as soon as tem- perature
or pressure deviate from a very narrow range for more than a moment or
two, “real time” monitoring on a continuous basis is obviously needed.
But few events need such controls. And most cannot be controlled at all
by them. “Real time” is the wrong time span for real control.</p>
<p>Children planting a garden are so impatient, it is said, that they
tend to pull out the radishes as soon as their leaves show, to see
whether the root is forming. This is “real time” control—misapplied.</p>
<p>When a new product is being first introduced, the product manager may
want and need daily reports from the test markets, and as close to “real
time” as possible. Six months later, when he has worked out his
promotion and selling strategy, daily reports in “real time” can only
lead him into “pulling up the radish to see whether the root is
form-</p>
<p>ing.” He then needs to think through at what periods of time and in
what areas he has to attain what results to be able to achieve his
objectives. And then he has to pay the greatest attention to the
measurement of results at their crucial moments in time. If he, however,
worries about “real time” daily measurements, he is almost bound to
confuse himself and his associates and to muddle even the best strategy.
Similarly, the attempt to measure re- search progress all the time is
likely to confound research results. The proper time span for research
is a fairly long one. Once every two or three years research progress
and re- search results should be rigorously appraised. In between an
experienced manager keeps in touch. He watches for any indication of
major unexpected trouble, and, even more, for any sign of unexpected
breakthroughs. But to monitor research in “real time”—as some research
labs have been trying to do—is pulling up the radishes.</p>
<p>However, there is also the opposite danger—that of not measuring
often enough. It is particularly great with developments that (a) take a
fairly long time to have results, and (b) have to come together at a
point in the future to produce the desired end result.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Controls need to be simple. Every major New York commercial bank
worked in the sixties on developing internal controls, especially of
costs and of allocation of efforts. Everyone spent a great deal of time
and money on the task and came up with voluminous control manuals. In
only one of the banks are the manuals being used, to the best of my
knowledge. When the executive in that bank was asked how he explained
this, he did not (as his interviewer expected him to) credit a massive
training program or talk about his “philosophy.” He said instead, “I
have two teen-age daughters. They know nothing about banking and are not
terribly good at figures. But they are bright. Whenever I had worked out
an approach to controlling an activity, I took my intended procedure
home in draft form and asked my girls to let me explain it to them. And
only when I had it so simple that they could explain back to me what the
procedure intended to accomplish and how, did I go ahead. Only then was
it simple enough.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Complicated controls do not work. They confuse. They misdirect from
what is to be controlled toward attention on the mechanics and
methodology of the control. But if the user has to know how the control
works before he can apply it, he has no control at all. And if he has to
sit down and figure out what a measurement means, he has no control
either.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bank executive’s method is a pretty good one. Training
sessions in using a new control rarely accomplish much. Ask the intended
user to explain its purpose and its use. And when he stumbles over
complexities, ambiguities, or subtleties, redesign for simplicity.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Finally, controls must be operational. They must be focused on
action. Action rather than information is their purpose. The action may
be only study and analysis. In other words, a measurement may say, “What
goes on we don’t understand; but something goes on that needs to be
understood.” But it should never just say, “Here is something you might
find interesting.”</li>
</ol>
<p>This then means that controls—whether reports, studies, or
figures—must always reach the person who is capable of taking
controlling action. Whether they should reach anyone else—and especially
someone higher up—is debatable. But their prime addressee is the manager
or professional who can take action by virtue of his position in the
flow of work and in the decision structure. And this further means that
the measurement must be in a form that is suitable for the recipient and
tailored to his needs.</p>
<p>Workers and first-line supervisors should, as said earlier (Chapter
18) receive meas- urements and control information that enable them to
direct their own immediate efforts toward results they can control.
Instead, typically, the first-line supervisor receives each month a
statement of the quality control results for the entire plant—and the
worker re- ceives nothing.</p>
<p>And top management usually receives the information and measurements
operating middle managers need and can use, and little or nothing of
pertinence to their own top-</p>
<p>management job.</p>
<p>The reason for this is largely a confusion between control as
domination of others and control as rational behavior. Unless controls
are means toward the latter, and this means toward self-control, they
lead to wrong action. They are “mis-control.”</p>
<p>The Ultimate Control of Organizations</p>
<p>There is one more important thing to be said. There is a fundamental,
incurable, basic limitation to controls in a social institution. This
lies in the fact that a social institution is both a true entity and a
fiction. As an entity it has purposes of its own, a performance of its
own, results of its own—and survival and death of its own. These are the
areas of which we have been speaking so far. But a social institution is
comprised of persons, each with his own purpose, his own ambitions, his
own ideas, his own needs. No matter how authoritarian the institution,
it has to satisfy the ambitions and needs of its members, and do so in
their capacity as individuals but through institutional rewards and
punishments, incentives, and deterrents. The expression of this may be
quantifiable—such as a raise in salary. But the system itself is not
quantitative in character and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>Yet here is the real control of the institution, that is, the ground
of behavior and the cause of action. People act as they are being
rewarded or punished. For this, to them, rightly (as said earlier in
Chapter 36), is the true expression of the values of the institution and
of its true, as against its professed, purpose and role.</p>
<p>A system of controls which is not in conformity with this true, this
only effective, this ultimate control of the organization which lies in
its people decisions will therefore at best be ineffectual. At worst it
will cause never-ending conflict and will push the organization out of
control.</p>
<p>In designing controls for an organization one has to understand and
analyze the actual control of the business, its people decisions.
Otherwise one designs a system of controls which does not lead to
control. One has to realize that even the most powerful “instrument
board” complete with computers, operations research, and simulation, is
secondary to the invisible, qualitative control of any human
organization, its systems of rewards and pun- ishments, of values and
taboos.</p>
