<p>“ F THE MAKING OF ORGANIZATION STUDIES there is no end”; this
might</p>
<p>ganizing companies, divisions, and functions has been one of the more
spectacular “growth industries” of the last few decades. Everybody,
whether government department or armed service, research laboratory,
Catholic diocese, university administration, or hos- pital—in addition
to countless businesses—seems forever to be engaged in reorganizing and
being reorganized. Management consultants, thirty or forty years ago,
concerned themselves mainly with work study, production flow, and sales
training. In the sixties they got the bulk of their assignments and
revenues from organization studies, especially of large companies and
government departments.</p>
<p>Even the Bank of England, which had admitted no outsiders through its
doors for al- most three hundred years, was finally reorganized by one
of the large American consult- ing firms; and to add insult to injury,
it was a Labour government that, violating the pri- vacy of the “Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street,” forced an organization study on it.</p>
<p>There are reasons for this interest in organization and for the
underlying conviction that inherited organization structures or
structures that “just grew” are unlikely to be ap- propriate to the
needs of the enterprise. Above all, we have learned the danger of the
wrong organization structure. The best structure will not guarantee
results and perform- ance. But the wrong structure is a guarantee of
nonperformance. All it produces are fric- tion and frustration. The
wrong organization puts the spotlight on the wrong issues, ag- gravates
irrelevant disputes, and makes a mountain out of trivia. It accents
weaknesses and defects instead of strengths. The right organization
structure is thus a prerequisite of performance.</p>
<p>The small enterprise needs right structure just as badly as the big
one—and may find it more difficult to work it out.</p>
<p>Only a few short decades ago, such interest as there was in
organization was to be found only in very large businesses. The earlier
examples, e.g., the example of Alfred P. Sloan’s organization structure
for General Motors in the early twenties, were all examples of large
businesses.</p>
<p>Today, we know that organization becomes critical, above all, when a
small business grows into a medium-sized one, and a simple business into
a complicated one. (See Chap- ter 53.) The small business that wants to
grow, even into only a medium-sized business, therefore has to think
through and work out the right organization which enables it at one and
the same time to function as a small business and to be able to grow
into something bigger. Similarly, the simple one-product, one-market
business faces crucial organization problems the moment it adds even a
little diversity or complexity.</p>
<p>As recently as the early or middle fifties, managers still had to be
convinced that they need to pay attention to the organization of work
and the design of organization structure.</p>
<p>The most stubborn opposition to the reorganization of the General
Electric Company in the early fifties did not come from those who
objected to the seemingly radical propos- als. It came from GE managers
who did not see the need for doing anything about organi- zation. They
admitted that the inherited structure was a crazy, shapeless jumble
which the business had long outgrown. “But why waste time on
organization?” they asked. “We make and sell turbines, so why bother
about who does what?” Ten years later this was still the reaction of
many managers when Paul Chambers, as new chief executive of England’s
Imperial Chemical Industries, tackled the organization structure of
another giant that had “just grown.”</p>
<p>Today one often needs, on the contrary, to convince managements not
to rush into or- ganization studies and not to become enamored of
reorganization as an end in itself—or as a substitute for strategic
planning and business decisions.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s Final Answers</p>
<p>But while we have accepted that organization and management structure
are crucial, we are outgrowing yesterday’s “final answers.”</p>
<p>Twice in the short history of management did we have the “final
answer” to organiza- tion. The first time was around 1910 after Henri
Fayol, the French industrialist, had thought through what, to this day,
are the functions of a manufacturing company. At that time the
manufacturing business was, of course, the truly important
organizational prob- lem.</p>
<p>A generation later one could again say that we “knew.” Fayol had
given “the answer”</p>
<p>for the single-product manufacturing business. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.,
in organizing General Motors in the early twenties, made the next step.
He found “the answer” for organizing the complex and large manufacturing
company.* The Sloan approach, which used Fayol’s functional organization
for the subunits, the individual “divisions,” but organized the business
itself on the basis of “federal decentralization,” that is, on the basis
of decentral- ized authority and centralized control, became after World
War II the organization model worldwide, especially for larger
organizations.</p>
<p>Another generation later, that is, by the early seventies, it had
become clear that the General Motors model was no more adequate to the
realities, or at least to the most im- portant challenges in
organization, than Fayol’s model was adequate to the realities of a very
big business which Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., faced when he tackled the task
of making General Motors manageable and managed.</p>
<p>Where they fit the realities that confront designer and architect of
organization struc- ture, Fayol’s and Sloan’s models are still
unsurpassed. Fayol’s functional organization is still the best way to
structure a small business, especially a small manufacturing business.
Sloan’s federal decentralization is still the best structure for the big
multi-product com- pany. Indeed (see Chapters 45 through 48) none of the
new design structures that have emerged in the decades since World War
II are nearly as close to fulfilling the design specifications of
organization structure as are functional organization and federal decen-
tralization if and when they fit. But more and more of the institutional
reality that has to be structured and organized does not fit. Indeed,
the very assumptions that underlay</p>
<p>*Sloan drew heavily on Pierre du Pont’s slightly earlier work at the
Du Pont Company. On this see the two books by Alfred D. Chandler listed
in the Bibliography.</p>
<p>Sloan’s work—and that of Fayol—are not applicable to major
organization needs and challenges.</p>
<p>Traditional Assumptions and Current Needs</p>
<p>The best way, perhaps, to bring out the current needs of organization
structure is to con- trast the basic characteristics of the General
Motors Company which Sloan so success- fully structured with current
needs and realities of organization and structure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>General Motors is a manufacturing business, producing and selling
highly engi- neered goods. And Fayol too was concerned with a business
producing physical goods; his model was a fair-sized coal-mining
company. Today we face the challenge of organiz- ing the large business
that is not exclusively or even primarily a manufacturing business.
There are not only the large financial institutions and the large
retailers. There are world- wide transportation companies,
communications companies, companies which, while they manufacture, have
their center of gravity in customer service (such as most computer
businesses). Then there are, of course, all the non-business service
institutions with which Chapters 11 through 14 dealt. These
non-manufacturing institutions are increasingly the true center of
gravity of any developed economy. They employ the most people. They both
contribute and take the largest share of gross national product. They
are the funda- mental organization problems today.</p></li>
<li><p>General Motors is essentially a single-product,
single-technology, single-market business. More than four-fifths of its
sales are automotive. The cars which General Mo- tors sells differ in
details, such as size, horsepower, and price, but they are essentially
one and the same product. Indeed, most U.S. “made by GM” cars,
regardless of nameplate, are now assembled in the same plants and under
one assembly manager. A man who came up the line in, say, the Pontiac
Division, will hardly find Chevrolet totally alien—and even Opel in
Germany will not hold a great many surprises for him.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, the typical businesses of today are multi-product,
multi-technology, and multi-market businesses. They may not be
“conglomerates.” But they are “diversified.” And their central problem
is a problem General Motors did not have: the organization of complexity
and diversity.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>General Motors is still primarily a U.S. company. It looms very
large on the inter- national automobile market. But the foreign markets
do not loom very large for GM (though perhaps they should). In America
General Motors dominates the automobile in- dustry. But only in
Australia—a secondary market—does General Motors dominate any non-U. S.
market. In Europe it is at best number four. Organizationally the world
outside the United States is still, for GM, “separate” and “outside.”
Organizationally GM is still an American company, and its top management
is primarily concerned with the American market, the American economy,
the American labor movement, the American govern- ment, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, the most rapid growth in the last twenty-five years has
been the multina- tional company, that is, the company for which a great
many countries and a great many markets are of equal importance, or at
least are of major importance.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Because GM is a one-product and one-country company, information is
not a major organizational problem and need not be a major
organizational concern. Everyone in GM speaks the same language, whether
by that we mean the language of the automotive indus- try or American
English. Everyone fully understands what the other one is doing or
should be doing, if only because, in all likelihood, he has done a
similar job himself. GM can therefore be organized according to the
logic of the marketplace, and the logic of au- thority and decision. It
need not, in its organization, concern itself a great deal with the
logic and the flow of information.</li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, multi-product, multi-technology, and multinational
companies will have to concern themselves in their organizational design
and structure with organization ac- cording to the flow of information.
At the very least they will have to make sure that their organization
structure does not violate the logic of information. And for this GM
offers no guidance—GM did not have to tackle the problem.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Four out of every five GM employees are production workers, either
manual work- ers or clerks on routine tasks. GM, in other words, employs
yesterday’s, rather than to- day’s, labor force.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the basic organization problem today is knowledge work and
knowledge workers.</p>
<p>They are the fastest-growing element in every business. In the
service institutions, they are the core employment.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Finally, General Motors has been a “managerial” rather than an
“entrepreneurial”</li>
</ol>
<p>business. The strength of Sloan’s approach lay in its ability to
manage, and manage su- perbly, what was already there and known. General
Motors has not been innovative— altogether the automobile industry has
not been innovative since the days before World War I. (There was
innovation at General Motors. But it was essentially the contribution of
one man, Charles Kettering, who was indeed an innovative genius of the
first order. But GM itself did not have to organize for entrepreneurship
and innovation.)</p>
<p>But the challenge is going increasingly to be entrepreneurship and
innovation. What we need is the innovative organization—in addition to
the managerial one. And for this, the General Motors model offers no
guidance.</p>
<p>The need for new approaches is therefore again as great in the field
of organization as it was when Fayol and Sloan each did his pioneering
work. The period when federal de- centralization could be considered the
universal model—as it largely was in the quarter century of the
management boom—is at an end.</p>
<p>But of course we have learned a great deal in the three-quarters of a
century since Fayol’s generation first tackled organization. We know
what the job is. We know the ma- jor approaches. We know what comes
first. We know what will not work—though not always what will. We know
what organization structure aims at and therefore what the test of
successful organization design is.</p>
<p>What We Have Learned</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first thing we have learned is that Fayol and Sloan were right:
organization struc- ture will not just “evolve.” The only things that
evolve in an organization are disorder, friction, malperformance. Nor is
the right—or even the livable-structure “intuitive”—any more than Greek
temples or Gothic cathedrals were. Traditions may indicate where the
problems and malfunctions are but are no help in finding solutions to
them. Organization design and structure require thinking. analysis, and
a systematic approach.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is, of course, what Fayol did in his functions. But the trouble
is not only that these functions fit only a manufacturing company. Above
all, Fayol tried to design his functions according to the work they
did.</p>
<p>We now know that building blocks are determined by the kind of
contribution they make. And we know that the traditional classification
of the contributions—e.g., the “staff and line” concept of conventional
American organization theory—is more of a hindrance to understanding
than a help.</p>
<p>Designing the building blocks is, so to speak, the “engineering
phase” of organization design. It provides the basic “materials.” And
like all materials, these building blocks</p>
<p>have their specific characteristics. They belong in different places
and fit together in dif- ferent ways.</p>
<p>strategy.*</p>
<p>Structure is a means for attaining the objectives and goals of an
institution. Any work on structure must therefore start with objectives
and strategy. This is perhaps the most fruitful new insight we have in
the field of organization. It may sound obvious, and it is. But some of
the worst mistakes in organization building have been made by imposing a
mechanistic model of an “ideal” or “universal” organization on a living
business.</p>
<p>Strategy, i.e., the answers to the questions “What is our business,
what should it be, what will it be?”, determines the purpose of
structure. It thereby determines what the key activities are in a given
business or service institution. Effective structure is the design that
makes these key activities capable of functioning and of performance.
And in turn the key activities are the “Load-bearing elements” of a
functioning structure. Organization design is, or should be, primarily
concerned with the key activities; the rest are secondary.</p>
<p>The Three Kinds of Work</p>
<p>It was a misunderstanding to define the building blocks as different
kinds of work. But there are different kinds of work in every
organization, however small and simple.</p>
<p>There is, first, operating work, that is, the work of managing what
is already in exis- tence and known, building it, exploiting its
potential, taking care of its problems.</p>
<p>There is always top-management work. And (as will be discussed in
Chapers 49 through 52) it is different work, with its own tasks and
requirements.</p>
<p>Finally, there is innovative work—and it too (see Chapter 61) is
different work, re- quiring different things with respect to both
operations and top management.</p>
<p>As will be seen in the subsequent chapters of this section, no one of
the available de- sign principles can be used for organizing all three
different kinds of work. Yet they need to be organized. They need to be
integrated into one overall organization,</p>
<p>What We Need to Unlearn</p>
<p>There are also a few things we need to unlearn. Some of the noisiest
and most time- consuming battles in organization theory and practice are
pure sham. They pose an “ei- ther/or “; yet the right answer is “both—in
varying proportions.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first of these sham battles which better be forgotten fast is
that between task- focus and person-focus in job design and organization
structure. To repeat what has been said already (Chapter 32), structure
and job design have to be task-focused. But assign- ments have to fit
both the person and the needs of the situation. There is no point in
con- fusing the two as the old and tiresome discussion of the
non-problem insists on doing. Work, to say it once more, is objective
and impersonal; the job itself is done by a person.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhat connected with this old controversy is the discussion of
hierarchical ver- sus free-form organization. Traditional organization
theory knows only one kind of struc- ture applicable alike to building
blocks and whole buildings: the so-called scalar organi- zation, that
is, the hierarchical pyramid of superior and subordinates. Traditional
organi- zation theory considers this structure suitable for all
tasks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>*The fundamental work on this was done by Alfred D. Chandler in his
book, Strategy and Structure (M.I.T. Press, 1962), a depth study of the
design of modern organization in pioneering American companies, such as
Du Pont, General Motors, and Sears.</p>
<p>Today another—equally doctrinaire—organization theory is becoming
fashionable. It maintains that shape and structure are what we want them
to be—they are, or should be, “free-form.” Everything—shape, size, and
apparently tasks—derive from interpersonal relations. Indeed the purpose
of the structure is to make it possible for each person to “do his
thing.”</p>
<p>The first thing to say about this controversy is that it is simply
not true that one of these forms is regimentation and the other freedom,
the amount of discipline required in both is the same; they only
distribute it differently.</p>
<p>A hierarchy does not, as the critics allege, make the superior more
powerful. On the contrary, the first effect of hierarchical organization
is the protection of the subordinate against arbitrary authority from
above. A scalar or hierarchical organization does this by defining
carefully the sphere within which the subordinate has the authority, the
sphere within which the superior cannot interfere. It protects the
subordinate by making it possi- ble for him to say, “This is my assigned
job.” Protection of the subordinate underlies also the scalar
principle’s insistence that a man have only one superior. Otherwise the
subordi- nate is likely to find himself caught between conflicting
demands, conflicting commands, and conflicts of interest as well as of
loyalty. “Better one had master than two good ones,” says an old peasant
proverb.</p>
<p>The first organization structure of the modern West was laid down in
the canon law of the Catholic Church eight hundred years ago. It set up
a strictly scalar organization. But most of the provisions in the canon
law that deal with the structure and organization of the Catholic Church
define those things which only the parish priest, i.e., the bottom man
in the pyramid, can do in his parish. The bishop appoints him; and,
within clear procedural limits, the bishop can remove him. But within
his parish only the parish priest can dis- charge the parish priest’s
canonical functions, e.g., dispense the sacraments of baptism and
matrimony or hear confession. Even the Pope has to be formally invited
by the indi- vidual priest before he can officiate in a priest’s
parish.</p>
<p>At the same time, the hierarchical organization gives the most
individual freedom. As long as the incumbent does whatever the assigned
duties of his position are, he has done his job. He has no
responsibility beyond it.</p>
<p>There is much talk these days about the individual’s “doing his
thing.” But the only organization structure in which this is remotely
possible is a hierarchical one. It makes the least demands on the
individual to subordinate himself to the goals of the organization or to
gear his activities into the needs and demands of others. Altogether,
the more clearly a structure defines work, authority, and relationships,
the fewer demands does it make on the individual for self-discipline and
self-subordination.</p>
<p>Free-form organization is, of course, a misnomer. What is meant is
organization de- sign for specific tasks rather than for supposedly
“eternal” purposes. In particular, what is meant is organization of work
in small groups and teams.</p>
<p>This (as will be discussed in some detail in later chapters of this
section) demands, above all, very great self-discipline from each member
of the team. Everybody has to do “the team’s thing.” Everybody has to
take responsibility for the work of the entire team and for its
performance. Indeed, Abraham Maslow’s criticism* of Theory Y as making
inhuman demands on that large proportion of people who are weak,
vulnerable, timid, impaired, applies with even greater force to
free-form organization. The more flexible an organization is, the
stronger do the individual members have to be and the more of the load
do they have to carry.</p>
<p>But also, hierarchy is needed in any structure by both individual
members and the en- tire organization. There has to be someone who can
make a decision; or else the organiza- tion deteriorates into a
never-ending bull session. The knowledge organization in particu- lar
needs extreme clarity with respect to decision authority and specific,
designated “channels” (see Chapter 35). Every organization will find

<p>peril once in a while. And then all perish unless there is clear,
unambiguous, designated command authority vested in one person.</p>
<p>The hierarchy versus free-form argument is simply another version of
the oldest and stalest argument in political theory: the argument
between the constitutional lawyer who—rightly—insists that there have to
be good and clear laws, and the educator who— equally rightly—insists
that the best constitution fails unless there are upright rulers.</p>
<p>And just as statesmen learned long ago that both good laws and good
rulers are needed, so organization builders (and even organization
theorists) will have to learn that sound organization structure needs
both a hierarchical structure of authority, decision- making, and
pyramid, and the capacity to organize task forces, teams, and
individuals for work both on a permanent and a temporary basis.</p>
<p>Both the advocates of hierarchical and those of free-form
organization assume, if only</p>
<p>unconsciously, that an organization must have one axis. It must be
either hierarchical or “free-form.” But this is a mechanistic
assumption—and organization is a social phenome- non.</p>
<p>The classical organization structure was, indeed, presumed to have
only one axis: that of formal authority downward and “reporting” upward.
But the first studies of actual or- ganization in the early work of the
“human relations school” in the twenties* brought out immediately a
second structure present in every work group studied. The human
relations people called it—misleadingly— “informal” organization
(“unwritten” organization would have been better; there is nothing
informal about an informal organization which, being based on custom
rather than explicit rules, tends to be more formal and, above all, to
be far less flexible than the written rules of the formal organization
chart). Still, the belief persists that organization structure should be
“single-axis” structure.</p>
<p>But every system higher than the simplest mechanical assemblage of
inanimate matter is a “multi-axis” system. An animal body such as that
of man has a skeletal-muscular sys- tem, a number of nervous systems, an
ingestive-digestive-eliminating system, a respira- tory system, sense
organs each a system, a procreative system, and so on. Each is
autonomous. Yet all interact. Each is an “axis of organization.”</p>
<p>No business could or should be as complex as a biological organism.
Yet the organi- zations we need to design and to structure—the
organizations of business enterprise and public-service institution—have
a number of axes: decision-authority but also informa- tion; the logic
of the task but also the dynamics of knowledge. That individual jobs
have to be designed and positioned in contemplation of a number of
axes—task and assign- ments; decision-responsibility; information and
relations—has been discussed earlier (in Chapter 32).</p>
<p>The same applies to organization design and structure.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>At bottom these sham battles—between task-focus and person-focus and
between scalar and free-form organization—reflect the belief of
traditional organization theory that there must be “one best principle”
which alone is “right” but which is also always “right.” There must be
one final answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps; but if so, we do not know it. Instead of the “one right”
principle, three new major design principles have emerged in the
twenty-five years since World War II ended, to join Fayol’s functions
and Sloan’s federal decentralization. These three—the team, simulated
decentralization, and systems management—do not supersede the older de-
signs. None of them could lay claim to being a “universal” principle;
indeed, all three have both serious structural weaknesses and limited
applicability. But they are the best answers available for certain kinds
of work, the best structures available for certain tasks, the best
approaches to such major organization problems as top management,
innovation, the structure of comparison in the materials; transportation
and financial industries or the multinational corporation.</p>

<p>The final tradition we will have to unlearn therefore is that “there
must be one final</p>
