<h4 id="preface">Preface:</h4>
<p>The Alternative to Tyranny</p>
<p>It is fashionable today to talk of a revolt against authority and to
proclaim that everybody should “do his own thing.” This, then, I have to
admit, is a most unfashionable book. It does not talk about rights. It
stresses responsibility. Its focus is not on doing one’s own thing but
on performance.</p>
<p>Our society has become, within an incredibly short fifty years, a
society of institutions.</p>
<p>It has become a pluralist society in which every major social task
has been entrusted to large organizations—from producing economic goods
and services to health care, from social security and welfare to
education, from, the search for new knowledge to the pro- tection of the
natural environment.</p>
<p>It is understandable that the sudden realization of this change in
the crystal structure of society has evoked an angry response, “Down
with organization!” But it is the wrong re- sponse. The alternative to
autonomous institutions that function and perform is not free- dom. It
is totalitarian tyranny.</p>
<p>Our society is neither willing nor able to do without the services
that only the institu- tions can provide. And the most vocal among our
modern Luddites, the would-be institu- tion wreckers, the highly
educated young people, are even less able to do without the large
organizations than the rest of us. For it is only in the large
organizations that there exist plentiful opportunities to make a living
through knowledge, to make a contribution through knowledge, and to
achieve through knowledge.</p>
<p>If the institutions of our pluralist society of institutions do not
perform in responsible autonomy, we will not have individualism and a
society in which there is a chance for people to fulfill themselves. We
will instead impose on ourselves complete regimentation in which no one
will be allowed autonomy. We will have Stalinism rather than participa-
tory democracy, let alone the joyful spontaneity of doing one’s own
thing. Tyranny is the only alternative to strong, performing autonomous
institutions. Tyranny substitutes one absolute boss for the pluralism of
competing institutions. It substitutes terror for responsi- bility. It
does indeed do away with the institutions, but only by submerging all of
them in the one all-embracing bureaucracy of the apparat. It does
produce goods and services, though only fitfully, wastefully, at a low
level, and at an enormous cost in suffering, hu- miliation, and
frustration. To make our institutions perform responsibly, autonomously,
and on a high level of achievement is thus the only safeguard of freedom
and dignity in the pluralist society of institutions.</p>
<p>But it is managers and management that make institutions perform.
Performing, re- sponsible management is the alternative to tyranny and
our only protection against it.</p>
<p>Management is work, and as such it has its own skills, its own tools,
its own techniques. A good many skills, tools, and techniques are
discussed in this book, a few in some detail. But the stress is not on
skills, tools, and techniques. It is not even on the work of man-
agement. It is on the tasks.</p>
<p>For management is the organ, the life-giving, acting, dynamic organ
of the institution it manages. Without the institution, e.g., the
business enterprise, there would be no man- agement. But without
management there would also be only a mob rather than an institu- tion.
The institution, in turn, is itself an organ of society and exists only
to contribute a needed result to society, the economy, and the
individual. Organs, however, are never</p>
<p>defined by what they do, let alone by how they do it. They are
defined by their contribu- tion.</p>
<p>Most books on management are books on the work of management. They
look at management from the inside. This book starts with the tasks. It
looks at management first from the outside and studies the dimensions of
the tasks and the requirements in respect to each of them (Part One).
Only then (in Part Two) does it turn to the work of the organiza- tion
and the skills of management, and (in Part Three) to top management, its
tasks, its structures, and its strategies.</p>
<p>I myself have for many years been deeply interested in the management
sciences, that is, in the manager’s logical and analytical tools. But
there are no equations in this book, no graphs, no mathematical
formulas, not even a table. The stress throughout the book is not on how
to do, let alone on how to make the tools to do it. Even when discussing
skills, even when discussing the management sciences themselves, the
stress is on accomplish- ments and results. This book is task-focused
throughout.</p>
<p>This book is also manager-focused. The starting point was the
question, What does the manager have to know, or at least to understand,
to be equal to his task?</p>
<p>The many, many books on management are skill-focused,
discipline-focused, or func- tion-focused. They deal with one aspect of
a manager’s task. They may deal with manag- ing a business or a hospital
or with managing people, with tools, e.g., controls, or with specific
problems. They deal with the author’s particular area of concern or
expertise, rather than with the tasks of the manager.</p>
<p>This book was designed to be different. It was designed to take as
starting point and as principle that informs the entire work the
manager’s needs rather than the author’s own knowledge or special areas
of interest. This explains what is included and what is left-out.</p>
<p>This is a long book—though I dislike long books. And yet it is not a
comprehensive book, but highly selective. A good many readers, I am
sure, will complain that this or that important topic is not even
mentioned; many more will undoubtedly criticize the author’s decision to
stress one topic while playing down another.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the author’s own judgment and his own preferences played
a part. But I have at least tried to decide what belongs in this book
and how much importance to give to it by an objective set of criteria,
developed as the result of years of working closely with managers on all
levels, with managers in large and small businesses, and with man- agers
in business and in non-business service institutions. What every manager
needs to know has been included in this book. What not every manager
needs to know, however important or interesting, has been excluded, or
at least given only cursory treatment. This explains why such topics as
“Managing Money in the Business” or “From Selling to Mar- keting”—to
name two chapters I had in my first draft—are not to be found in the
book, or why, to give another example, the management sciences are
treated in one short chapter only. It explains, however, why a good deal
of space has been devoted to top management and to the relationships
between structure and strategy—topics that are not commonly considered
in a book on management.</p>
<p>It was not my intention to include every problem any manager might
conceivably have to face. But it was my intention to include those areas
of concern with which all managers can expect to deal and in which all
managers have to be literate regardless of their func- tional
background, the mission and purpose of their institution, or the size of
their organi- zation. And this, then, meant a big book, since the
manager’s job is big, and the manage- ment tasks demanding.</p>
<p>Management, the book maintains throughout, is a discipline, or at
least is capable of be- coming one. It is not just common sense. It is
not just codified experience. It is at least potentially an organized
body of knowledge. This book tries to present the little we know so far.
But it also tries to present the much larger body of our organized
ignorance, that is, the areas in which we know that we need new
knowledge, in which we can define what we need—but in which we do not as
yet possess the knowledge.</p>
<p>Indeed, these areas of organized ignorance are perhaps the core of
this book. For in management we have clearly outgrown the knowledge that
had been painfully amassed in what one might call the Heroic Age of
Management—the fifty years before World War II—by a few men and women
working mostly in isolation and sustained by vision and faith rather
than by public acclaim. It was this knowledge that the management boom
of the twenty-five years between World Was II and 1970 popularized,
disseminated, and made effective over most of the world.</p>
<p>Now we know that even in the areas in which we have a little
knowledge, we do not know enough. There are new tasks in these areas for
which we are not yet equipped with tested, proven approaches and tools.
New areas of challenge and new management prob- lems have arisen, where
we have done little work so far and where we have so far only ignorance
rather than even a modicum of knowledge.</p>
<p>This book attempts to identify and define these areas. But it also
attempts to develop at least first approaches to these areas, to think
through policies, principles and practices to accomplish the new tasks
and to satisfy the new challenges. This book tries to equip the manager
with the understanding, the thinking, the knowledge, and the skills for
today’s and also for tomorrow’s job.</p>
<p>While management is a discipline—that is, an organized body of
knowledge and as such applicable everywhere—it is also “culture.” It is
not value-free science. Management is a social function and embedded in
a culture—a society—a tradition of values, customs, and beliefs, and in
governmental and political systems. Management is—and should be—
culture-conditioned; but, in turn, management and managers shape culture
and society.</p>
<p>From the beginning management was polycentric. Management as a
discipline and management as a practice were tackled from the beginning
by men of many nationalities and races. It was a temporary aberration in
the years of the management boom to forget this and to believe
instead—against all evidence—that management was an American specialty,
if not an American invention. Today it is obvious again that management
is polycentric. The management boom has not Americanized management. It
has left un- touched fundamental national characteristics throughout the
world, such important areas, for instance, as the relationship between
government and business management, the fun- damentals of managing
people, or the structure of top management. There surely is no
“management gap” today between Western Europe or Japan, and the United
States (if there ever was one).</p>
<p>This book is based on my experience, especially as a consultant, and
mainly in Amer- ica, or at least with American businesses and
public-service institutions. I have con- sciously attempted during the
last fifteen years to expand my horizon and to work with managements
outside the United States (especially in Great Britain, Western Europe,
Ja- pan, and Latin America). I have tried to study management outside
the United States as well as inside. While the book still has a strong
American flavor—inevitably so—I have tried to relate managerial tasks,
managerial work, managerial organization, and manage- rial approaches to
culture and society and to present, especially in the examples and
illus- trations, management as worldwide rather than as confined to this
or that country.</p>
<p>I have particularly stressed the Japanese experience—not only because
far too few man- agers in the West understand Japanese management and
organization, but also because an understanding of the often very
different ways in which Japan, the only non-Western de- veloped country,
tackles a common task (e.g., the determination of profitability, the or-
ganization of work and workers, or the making of decisions) may help the
Western man- ager to understand better what he himself is trying to do.*
The basic conviction of this book throughout is that each country’s
managers can and need to learn from the best oth- ers have to offer.</p>
<p>*For this reason I have also included a separate listing of books on
Japanese management in the Bibliography.</p>
<p>Management is tasks. Management is a discipline. But management is
also people. Every achievement of management is the achievement of a
manager. Every failure is a failure of a manager. People manage rather
than “forces” or “facts.” The vision, dedication, and integrity of
managers determine whether there is management or mismanagement.</p>
<p>There are no anecdotes in this book; every illustration or example is
intended to drive home an essential point. But in presenting cases and
examples, I have also tried to make the reader aware of the men, and
especially of the practicing managers, who first tackled major
management jobs: Georg Siemens of the Deutsche Bank, for instance, first
working out a century ago the function and structure of top management;
Theodore N. Vail of the American Telephone Company, a little later,
first thinking through “What is our busi- ness?”; or Thomas Watson, Sr.,
trying—and at the same time not trying—to make his little IBM become
capable of growing into a big company.</p>
<p>But the book always tries to integrate man and task. It tries to deal
with objective and impersonal tasks but also with the human
requirements, skills, and basic attitudes needed to perform these tasks.
“Le style c’est l’homme” may apply to a writer. But in other pur- suits
style tends to be manner rather than substance. There is not much talk
of style in this book. But there is stress on character.</p>
<p>In the last analysis management is practice. Its essence is not
knowing but doing. Its test is not logic but results. Its only authority
is performance. This is therefore not a philosophi- cal book even though
it deals with fundamentals. It grew out of practice. And it centers on
practice.</p>
<p>“From Management Boom to Management Performance” is the title of the
introduc- tory section of this book. It could have been the title of the
book itself. In the next decade managers will have to meet far greater
performance demands than most of them can en- visage, and in all areas.
A great deal more will depend on their performance than the prosperity
or even the survival of their own company or institution. For, to
repeat, per- forming management of our institutions is the only
alternative to tyranny in our pluralistic society of institutions.</p>
<p>And the aim, the motive, and the purpose of this book are to prepare
today’s and to- morrow’s managers for performance.</p>
<p>In its aim, its scope, and its approach this book differs from my
earlier management books: Concept of the Corporation (New York, John
Day, 1946; new edition 1972; Brit- ish edition, London, Heinemann, 1946
under the title Big Business); The Practice of Management (New York,
Harper andandandand Row, 1954; London, Heinemann, 1953, and in Mer- cury
and Pan paperbacks); Managing for Results (New York, Harper andandandand
Row, 1964; Lon- don, Heinsmann, 1966, and in Pan paperback); and The
Effective Executive (New York, Harper andandandand Row, 1966; London,
Heinemann, 1966, and in Pan paperback). But Manage- ment, while in every
respect a new book, did, of course, evolve out of my earlier work. And I
have not hesitated to draw on my earlier work where appropriate.</p>
<p>The heaviest debt is owed to The Practice of Management. Direct
borrowings from this earlier book are confined to a few pages in
Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 34, and 36. But Chap- ters 20, 29, 31, and 50 also
develop ideas that were first presented in The Practice of Management.
At the most, however, such material accounts for one-twentieth or so of
the text of this new volume—and primarily for basic concepts such as the
question “What is our business?”; Business Objectives; Management by
Objectives and Self-Control; and the elements in the work of the
manager, which were first introduced in The Practice of Management
twenty years ago and have since become fundamental tenets of management
and key concepts.</p>
<p>A word might be said about the use of cases and examples in this
book. Wherever a company (or a public-service agency) is identified by
name in the book, everything in the example or illustration is taken
from published and universally accessible sources, whether the company’s
own statements and reports or reports on it in the public press. The
interpretation in every case is, of course, mine; but the facts are in
the public domain. Wherever a company—or an industry—is not specifically
identified by name I have</p>
<p>used—always with the company’s knowledge and consent—private
information, whether obtained in the course of consulting work or, more
often, through personal acquaintance, discussions in management meetings
and seminars, or private correspondence. In every such case the company
(or industry) has been so carefully camouflaged that even people in the
company itself will probably not recognize it. The one thing the reader
can be sure of if he reads of a “hardware manufacturer in the American
Midwest” is that the company is not a hardware company and is not
located in the Midwest. The facts given in the illus- tration are
reported faithfully and accurately; the specific company where they
occurred is carefully concealed.</p>
