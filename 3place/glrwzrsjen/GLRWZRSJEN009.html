<p>VERY Medici</p>
<p>ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESS BUILDERS WE KNOW OF—from the and the
founders of the Bank of England down to IBM’s Thomas Watson in</p>
<p>our day—had a definite idea, had, indeed, a clear theory of the
business which in- formed his actions and decisions. A clear, simple,
and penetrating theory of the business rather than intuition
characterizes the truly successful entrepreneur, the man who not just
amasses a large fortune but builds an organization that can endure and
grow long after he is gone.</p>
<p>The individual entrepreneur does not need to analyze his concepts and
explain his theory of the business to others, let alone spell out the
details. He is in one person thinker, analyst, and executor. Business
enterprise, however, requires that the theory of the busi- ness be
thought through and spelled out. It demands a clear definition of
business purpose and business mission. It demands asking, “What is our
business and what should it be?”</p>
<p>Unlike the single entrepreneur, business enterprise requires
continuity beyond the life span of a man or of any one generation. It
cannot, like the merchant-adventurer of old, engage in one venture at a
time which is fully liquidated before the next venture is begun. It has
to commit resources to an ever-longer future; it is in itself the result
of commit- ments of the past and has, therefore, commitments to the past
and to the future—an estab- lished organization, established policies,
past decisions, investments, facilities, products, markets, and above
all, people. Unless grounded in a theory of the business, these com-
mitments cannot be made rationally. They are bound to splinter
resources. And unless grounded in a theory of the business, these
commitments cannot be reviewed and revised rationally. There is no way
to determine that a change is needed unless results can be held against
expectations derived from such a theory of the business.</p>
<p>Today’s theory of the business always becomes obsolete—and usually
pretty fast.</p>
<p>Unless the basic concepts on which a business has been built are,
therefore, visible,</p>
<p>clearly understood, and explicitly expressed, the business enterprise
is at the mercy of events. Not understanding what it is, what it
represents, and what its basic concepts, val- ues, policies, and beliefs
are, it cannot rationally change itself. How rapidly even the most
brilliant entrepreneurial idea can obsolesce the history of Henry Ford
shows—with only fifteen years between an entrepreneurial idea that
literally transformed economy and soci- ety and its obsolescence. (See
Chapter 29, “Why Managers?”)</p>
<p>Only a clear definition of the mission and purpose of the business
makes possible clear and realistic business objectives. It is the
foundation for priorities, strategies, plans, and work assignments. It
is the starting point for the design of managerial jobs and, above all,
for the design of managerial structures. Structure follows strategy.
Strategy determines what the key activities are in a given business. And
strategy requires knowing “what our business is and what it should
be.”</p>
<p>The Fallacy of the Unternehmer</p>
<p>Insofar as the literature of management and economics has paid
attention to the theory of the business, it has dealt with it as a need
of the man at the top—or at most of a small top- management group.</p>
<p>The German tradition is most explicit on this point. The Unternehmer,
that is, the top man and especially the owner-manager, alone knows what
the business is all about and alone makes entrepreneurial decisions.
Everybody else is essentially a technician who carries out prescribed
tasks. No one but the Unternehmer needs to understand the mission and
purpose of the business. Indeed, no one really should know and
understand; Unternehmertum—entrepreneurship—is a mystique that better be
kept hidden from the uninitiated, i.e., ordinary managers and
professionals.</p>
<p>While only the Germans have formalized the traditional concept, it is
subconsciously assumed by top-management people everywhere in the West
(though not in Japan). This may have been adequate in the nineteenth
century business in which there were a few men at the top who alone made
decisions, with all the rest manual workers or low-level clerks. It is a
dangerous misconception of today’s business enterprise.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the organizations of the past, today’s business
enterprise (but also today’s hospital or government agency) brings
together a great many men of high knowl- edge and skill, at practically
every level of the organization. But high knowledge and skill also mean
decision-impact on how the work is to be done and on what work is
actually being tackled. They make, by necessity, risk-taking decisions,
that is, business decisions, whatever the official form of organization.
And the computer does not alter this fact. In fact, it makes the
decisions of top management even more dependent on the decision input
from lower levels—which is what then becomes the data of the
computer.</p>
<p>When the computer first came in, in the early fifties, we heard a
good deal about the imminent disappearance of the middle manager.
Instead, the fifties and sixties brought in all developed countries a
tremendous growth of middle managers. And, unlike traditional middle
managers, the new middle people are largely decision-makers rather than
execu- tors of decisions made on high. (On this see Chapter 35, “From
Middle Management to Knowledge Organization.”)</p>
<p>As a result, decisions affecting the entire business and its capacity
to perform are made at all levels of the organization, even fairly low
ones. Risk-taking decisions—what to do and what not to do; what to
continue work on and what to abandon; what products, markets, or
technologies to pursue with energy and what markets, products and
technolo- gies to ignore—are in the reality of today’s business
enterprise (especially the large one) made every day by a host of people
of subordinate rank, very often by people without traditional managerial
title or position, e:g., research scientists, design engineers, product
planners, and tax accountants.</p>
<p>Every one of these men bases his decisions on some, if only vague,
theory of the busi- ness. Every one makes assumptions regarding reality,
both inside and outside the busi- ness. Every one assumes that certain
kinds of results are wanted and that other kinds are</p>
<p>not particularly desirable. Every one knows, e.g., that “lowering the
price of our product does not create new demand,” or that “we do this”
but “do not do that.” Every one, in other words, has his answer to the
question “What is our business and what should it be?” Unless,
therefore, the business itself—and that means its top management—has
thought through the question and formulated the answer—or answers—to it,
the decision-makers in the business, all the way up and down, will
decide and act on the basis of different, incompatible, and conflicting
theories of the business. They will pull in different direc- tions
without even being aware of their divergences. But they will also decide
and act on the basis of wrong and misdirecting theories of the
business.</p>
<p>Common vision, common understanding, and unity of direction and
effort of the entire organization require definition of “what our
business is and what it should be.”</p>
<p>“What Is Our Business?”—Never Obvious</p>
<p>Nothing may seem simpler or more obvious than to know what a
company’s business is. A steel mill makes steel, a railroad runs trains
to carry freight and passengers, an insur- ance company underwrites fire
risks, a bank lends money. Actually, “What is our busi- ness?” is almost
always a difficult question and the right answer is usually anything but
obvious.</p>
<p>One of the earliest and most successful answers was worked out by
Theodore N. Vail (1845-1920) for the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company (also known as the Bell System) almost seventy years ago: “Our
business is service.” This sounds obvious once it has been said. But
first there had to be the realization that a telephone system, be- ing a
natural monopoly, was susceptible to nationalization and that a
privately owned telephone service in a developed and industrialized
country was exceptional and needed community support or its survival.
Second, there had to be the realization that community support could not
be obtained by propaganda campaigns nor by attacking critics as “un-
American” or “socialistic.” It could be obtained only by creating
customer satisfaction. This realization meant radical innovations in
business policy. It meant constant indoctri- nation in dedication to
service for all employees, and public relations which stressed ser-
vice. It meant emphasis on research and technological leadership, and it
required financial policy which assumed that the company had to give
service wherever there was a demand, and that it was management’s job to
find the necessary capital and to earn a return on it. The United States
would hardly have gone through the New Deal period without a serious
attempt at telephone nationalization but for the careful analysis of its
own business that the Telephone Company made between 1905 and 1915.</p>
<p>Vail’s definition served his company for two-thirds of a century, up
into the late 1960s; it may have been the longest-lived answer to the
question “What is our business?” That the American railroads never
thought their way through to any definition of their business is surely
a major reason for the perpetual crisis in which they have floundered
since World War I, and for the almost complete lack of community support
that is their greatest weakness.</p>
<p>In retrospect all of Vail’s answers were obvious, if not trite. But
not only did it take years to work them out, each was heresy when first
propounded and bitterly resisted throughout the company. Vail was fired
from his position as general manager in the late 1890s when he dared
propose to his top management that the question “What is our busi-
ness?” be asked. He was called back, a decade later, when the
consequences of the lack of an answer had become painfully evident—that
is, when the Bell System, operating with- out clear definition of its
mission and purpose, had drifted into severe crisis and was threatened
by government takeover.</p>
<p>The answer to the question “What is our business?” is the first
responsibility of top management. Indeed, one sure way to tell whether a
particular job is top management or not is to ask whether its holder is
expected to be concerned with, and responsible for, an- swering this
question. Only top management can make sure that this question receives
the</p>
<p>attention it deserves and that the answer makes sense and enables the
business to plot its course and set its objectives.</p>
<p>That business purpose and business mission are so rarely given
adequate thought is perhaps the most important single cause of business
frustration and business failure. Con- versely, in outstanding
businesses such as the Telephone Company or Sears, success al- ways
rests to a large extent on raising the question “What is our business?”
clearly and deliberately, and on answering it thoughtfully and
thoroughly.</p>
<p>But there are reasons why managements shy back from asking the
question; the first is that the question causes controversy, argument,
and disagreement.</p>
<p>To raise the question always reveals cleavages and differences within
the top- management group itself. People who have worked side by side
for many years and who think that they know each other’s thoughts
suddenly realize with a shock that they are in fundamental
disagreement.</p>
<p>The Need for Dissent</p>
<p>Most managements shrink back from these disagreements as divisive and
painful. But deciding “What is our business?” is a genuine decision; and
a genuine decision must be based on divergent views to have a chance to
be a right and an effective decision. (See Chapter 37, “The Effective
Decision.”) The answer to the question “What is our busi- ness?” is
always a choice between alternatives each of which rests on different
assump- tions regarding the reality of the business and its environment.
It is always a high-risk decision. It always leads to changes in
objectives, strategies, organization, and behavior.</p>
<p>This is far too important a decision to be made by acclamation. In
the end there must, of course, be a decision. But it must be a decision
based on conscious choice of alterna- tives rather than on suppression
of different and dissenting opinions and points of view.</p>
<p>Indeed, to bring these dissents out into the open is in itself
salutary. It is a big step to- ward management effectiveness. It enables
the top-management group to work together precisely because each member
is cognizant of fundamental differences within the group, and,
therefore, far more likely to understand what motivates his colleagues
and what ex- plains their behavior. Conversely, hidden or
half-understood disagreements on the defini- tion of one’s business
underlie many of the personality problems, communication prob- lems, and
irritations that tend to divide a top-management group.</p>
<p>The main reason why it is important to bring out dissents within the
top-management group on the question “What is our business?” is that
there is never one right answer. The answer never emerges as a logical
conclusion from postulates or from “facts.” It requires judgment and
considerable courage. The answer rarely follows what “everybody knows.”
It should never be made on plausibility alone, never be made fast, never
be made painlessly.</p>
<p>Method Rather Than Opinions</p>
<p>Another reason why managements fail to ask “What is our business?” is
their reluctance to listen to opinions. And everyone has an opinion on
“what our business is.” Manage- ments, however, quite rightly dislike
debating societies and bull sessions.</p>
<p>There is need for a method for defining “what our business is.”
Opinions are, of course, needed—and anyhow are unavoidable. But they
need to be focused on a specific, central issue to become
productive.</p>
<p>With respect to the definition of business purpose and business
mission, there is only one such focus, one starting point. It is, the
customer. The customer defines the business.</p>
<p>A business is not defined by the company’s name, statutes, or
articles of incorpora- tion. It is defined by the want the customer
satisfies when he buys a product or a service. To satisfy the customer
is the mission and purpose of every business. The question “What is our
business?” can therefore be answered only by looking at the business
from the out- side from the point of view of customer and market. What
the customer sees, thinks, be- lieves, and wants, at any given time,
must be accepted by management as an objective fact</p>
<p>and must be taken as seriously as the reports of the salesman, the
tests of the engineer, or the figures of the accountant. And management
must make a conscious effort to, get an- swers from the customer himself
rather than attempt to read his mind.</p>
<p>Management always, and understandably, considers its product or its
service to be im- portant. If it did not, it could not do a good job.
Yet to the customer, no product or ser- vice, and certainly no company,
is of much importance. The executives of a company always tend to
believe that the customer spends hours discussing their products. But
how many housewives, for instance, ever talk to each other about the
whiteness of their laun- dry? If there is something badly wrong with one
brand of detergent they switch to another. The customer only wants to
know what the product or service will do for him tomorrow. All he is
interested in are his own values, his own wants, his own reality. For
this reason alone, any serious attempt to state “what our business is”
must start with the customer, his realities, his situation, his
behavior, his expectations, and his values.</p>
<p>Who Is The Customer?</p>
<p>“Who is the customer?” is the first and the crucial question in
defining business purpose and business mission. It is not an easy, let
alone an obvious question. How it is being an- swered determines, in
large measure, how the business defines itself.</p>
<p>The consumer, that is, the ultimate user of a product or a service is
always a customer.</p>
<p>But he is never the customer; there are usually at least
two—sometimes more. Each cus- tomer defines a different business, has
different expectations and values, buys something different. Yet, all
customers have to be satisfied in the answer to the question “What is
our business?”</p>
<p>The power of the question “Who is the customer?” and the impact of a
thoughtful an- swer to it are shown by the experience of the carpet
industry in the United States since World War II.</p>
<p>The carpet industry is an old one, with little glamour and little
sophisticated technol- ogy. Yet it was a conspicuous marketing success
in the American economy of the post- World War II period. For thirty
years, until well into the early fifties, the industry had been in a
steady, long-term, and apparently irreversible decline. Then, within a
few years, the industry completely reversed the trend. Even “good”
houses built before the fifties had, as a rule, no more than a cheap rug
in the living room. Today, even low-cost homes—including most mobile
homes—have wall-to-wall carpeting of fair quality in all rooms, kitchen
and bathrooms included. And the home buyer is spending an increasing
share of his housing dollar on carpeting.</p>
<p>Floor covering is one of the very few means to alter the appearance
and comfort of a home, especially of a cheap and small one. This message
had been broadcast by the rug and carpet manufacturers for decades,
without the slightest effect on actual customer be- havior. The rug and
carpet industry achieved its success only when it stopped persuasion and
hard selling, and instead thought through the questions “Who is our
customer and who should he be?”</p>
<p>Traditionally the rug and carpet manufacturer had defined his
customer as the home- owner, and especially as the family buying its
first home. But at that stage, the young couple has no money left over
for luxuries. They postpone buying rugs—and this means they are not
likely to buy them at all. The industry realized, as a result of asking
“Who is our customer, and who should he be?” that it must succeed in
making the mass builder its customer. It therefore had to make it
profitable for the mass builder to incorporate rugs and carpets into the
new home at the time of building. This meant switching from selling
individual rugs and carpets to selling wall-to-wall carpeting. In the
traditional home the builder had to lay expensive and fully finished
floors. Wall-to-wall carpeting can be put over cheap and unfinished
flooring—resulting in a better house at lower cost to the builder.</p>
<p>The industry further realized that it must enable the new homeowner
to pay for floor covering as part of the monthly payment on the
mortgage, rather than expecting him to</p>
<p>pay a substantial sum at a time when he is already short of cash. It
therefore worked hard at getting the lending agencies, and especially
the government agencies insuring home mortgages (such as the Federal
Housing Administration), to accept floor covering as part of the capital
investment in the house and thus as part of the mortgage value. Finally,
the industry redesigned its product to enable the building contractor to
act as the informed buyer for his customer, the homeowner. Today home
buyers are offered a great variety of patterns and colors, but
essentially only three qualities: “good,” “better,” and “best.” The
difference among them amounts to very little in the monthly mortgage
payment, with the result that most homeowners order at least the
“better” carpeting.</p>
<p>As this story shows, the right answer to the question “Who is the
customer?” is usually that there are several customers.</p>
<p>Most businesses have at least two. The rug and carpet industry has
both the contractor and the homeowner for its customers. Both have to
buy if there is to be a sale. The manu- facturers of branded consumer
goods always have two customers at the very least: the housewife and the
grocer. It does not do much good to have the housewife eager to buy if
the grocer does not stock the brand. Conversely, it does not do much
good to have the grocer display merchandise advantageously and give it
shelf space if the housewife does not buy.</p>
<p>Some businesses have two customers unconnected with each other. The
business of an insurance company can be defined as selling insurance.
But an insurance company is also an investor. In fact, it can well be
defined as a channel that conducts the savings of the community into
productive investments. An insurance company needs two definitions of
its business, as it has to satisfy two separate customers. Similarly, a
commercial bank needs both depositors and borrowers. It cannot be in
business without either. Both, even if they are the same person or the
same business, have different expectations and define the business of
the bank completely differently. To satisfy only one of these customers
with- out satisfying the other means that there is no performance.</p>
<p>One of the great strengths of Vail’s definition of Bell Telephone’s
business was the acceptance in it of two separate customers: the
telephone subscriber and the regulating agencies of the various state
governments. Both had to be given service. Both had to be satisfied.
Yet, they had widely different concepts of value, wanted and needed
different things, and behaved quite differently.</p>
<p>There are also businesses in which economically there is only one
customer while strategically—in terms of buying decision—there are two
or more.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why IBM has been so successful in the computer
business is that it realized early that entirely different people in a
company have to buy a computer if there is to be a sale. The people who
use the computer (which largely means accounting and financial people)
have to buy it. But top management also has to buy. And so do the peo-
ple who are to use the computer as their information tool, that is,
operating managers. From the beginning, therefore, IBM has sold all
these groups and has thought through what each looks for, needs to know,
considers value, and how each can be reached.</p>
<p>Practically everyone who makes and sells equipment faces a similar
situation. While the paper company pays the bill, the process engineer
in the paper mill, the paper chemist in the laboratory, and the
purchasing agent are all separate customers, each buying some- thing
different when they buy the same equipment or the same chemicals; each,
above all, buying in different ways and reached through different
channels.</p>
<p>It is also important to ask “Where is the customer?” One of the
secrets of Sears’s suc- cess—in the 1920s was the discovery that its old
customer was now in a different place: the farmer had become mobile and
was beginning to buy in town. This made Sears realize early—almost two
decades before most other American retailers—that store location is a
major business decision and a major element in answering the question
“What is our business?” American leadership in international banking in
the last twenty years is not primarily the result of superior resources.
It is largely the result of asking, “Where is the customer?” As soon as
the question was asked, it became clear that the old customers, the
American corporations, were going multinational and had to be served
from a multitude</p>
<p>of locations all over the world rather than from New York or San
Francisco headquarters. The resources for serving the new multinational
customers did not come from the United States but from the international
market itself, and, above all, from Europe and the Euro- dollar
market.</p>
<p>The next question is, “What does the customer buy?”</p>
<p>The Cadillac people say that they make an automobile, and their
business is called the Cadillac Motor Division of General Motors. But
does the man who spends ,000 on a new Cadillac buy transportation, or
does he buy primarily prestige? Does the Cadillac compete with
Chevrolet, Ford, and Volkswagen? Nicholas Dreystadt, the German-born
service mechanic who took over Cadillac in the Depression years of the
thirties, an- swered: “Cadillac competes with diamonds and mink coats.
The Cadillac customer does not buy ‘transportation’ but ‘status.’” This
answer saved Cadillac, which was about to go under. Within two years or
so, it made it into a major growth business despite the Depres-
sion.</p>
<p>What Is Value to the Customer?</p>
<p>The final question needed to come to grips with business purpose and
business mission is: “What is value to the customer?” It may be the most
important question. Yet it is the one least often asked.</p>
<p>One reason is that managers are quite sure that they know the answer.
Value is what they, in their business, define as quality. But this is
almost always the wrong definition.</p>
<p>For the teenage girl, for instance, value in a shoe is high fashion.
It has to be “in.”</p>
<p>Price is a secondary consideration and durability is not value at
all. For the same girl as a young mother, a few years later, high
fashion becomes a restraint. She will not buy some- thing that is quite
unfashionable. But what she looks for is durability, price, comfort and
fit, and so on. The same shoe that represents the best buy for the
teenager is a very poor value for her slightly older sister.</p>
<p>Manufacturers tend to consider this as irrational behavior. But the
first rule is that there are no irrational customers. Customers almost
without exception behave rationally in terms of their own realities and
their own situation. High fashion is rationality for the teenage girl;
her other needs—food and housing—are, after all, still taken care of by
her parents, as a rule. High fashion is a restraint for the young
housewife who has to budget, who is on her feet a great deal, who has
“her man,” and who no longer goes out every weekend.</p>
<p>The customer never buys a product. By definition the customer buys
the satisfaction of a want. He buys value. Yet the manufacturer, by
definition, cannot produce value. He can only make and sell a product.
What the manufacturer considers quality may, there- fore, be irrelevant
and nothing but waste and useless expense.</p>
<p>Another reason why the question “What is value to the customer?” is
rarely asked is that the economists think they know the answer: value is
price. This is misleading, if not actually the wrong answer.</p>
<p>Price is anything but a simple concept, to begin with. Then there are
other value con- cepts which may determine what price really means. In
many cases, finally, price is sec- ondary and a limiting factor rather
than the essence of value.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to illustrate what price might mean to
different customers.</p>
<p>Electrical equipment such as fuse boxes or circuit breakers are paid
for by the homeowner but selected and bought by the electrical
contractor. What is price to the electrical con- tractor is not the
manufacturer’s price for the product. It is the price of the
manufacturer plus the cost of installation—for that, of course, is price
to his customer, the homeowner. Contractors are notoriously
price-conscious. Yet, a high-priced make of fuse boxes and circuit
breakers is the market leader in the U.S. To the contractor this line is
actually low- priced because it is engineered to be installed fast and
by relatively unskilled labor.</p>
<p>Xerox owes its success, to a large extent, to defining price as what
the customer pays for a copy rather than what he pays for the machine.
Xerox, accordingly, has priced its</p>
<p>machines in terms of the copies used. In other words, the customer
pays for the copy rather than for the machine—and, of course, what the
customer wants are copies rather than a machine.</p>
<p>In the American automobile industry, where most new cars are sold in
trade against a used car, price is actually a constantly shifting
configuration of differentials between the manufacturer’s price for a
new car and prices for a second-hand and third-hand used car, a
third-hand and fourth-hand used car, and so on. And the whole is further
complicated on the one hand by constantly changing differentials between
the amount a dealer will allow on a used car and the price he will ask
for it, and on the other hand by the differences in running costs
between various makes and sizes. Only advanced mathematics can calculate
the real automobile price.</p>
<p>For products and services, price can be determined—as distinct from
undifferentiated commodities such as copper of a certain purity—only by
understanding what is value to the customer. As the Xerox example shows,
it is up to the manufacturer or supplier to design the pricing structure
which fits the customer’s value concept.</p>
<p>But price is also only a part of value. There is a whole range of
quality considerations which are not expressed in price: durability,
freedom from breakdown, the maker’s stand- ing, service, etc. High price
itself may actually be value—as in expensive perfumes, ex- pensive furs,
or exclusive gowns.</p>
<p>Here are two examples. In the early days of the Common Market, two
young Euro- pean engineers opened a small office with a few hundred
dollars, a telephone, and a shelf full of manufacturers’ catalogs of
electronic components. Within ten years they had built a large and
highly profitable wholesale business. Their customers are the industrial
users of electronic equipment such as relays and machine controls. The
young engineers manufac- ture nothing. The components which they supply
can be obtained, often at a lower price, directly from the manufacturer.
But these young engineers relieve the customer of the tedious chore of
finding the right component part. They need only be told the kind of
equipment, the manufacturer, the model number, and the part that needs
replacement—a condenser, for instance, or a micro-switch. They then
immediately identify the specific part needed. They also know what parts
made by other manufacturers can be used for a job. They therefore can
tell a customer what he needs, give him immediate service, often on the
same day, and yet keep their inventory low. Expertise and speedy service
is value to the customer for which he is perfectly willing to pay a
substantial premium. “Our busi- ness is not electronic parts,” said one
of the young men, “it is information.”</p>
<p>An American company making lubricating compounds for heavy
earthmoving equip- ment such as is used by highway builders has long had
a reputation for the quality of its products. Yet it could not gain more
than a very small share of the market, as it competed against every
major petroleum company. It then asked the question “What is value to
the customer?” The answer was “to keep very expensive machinery
operating without break- downs.” One hour down-time may cost a
construction company more money than it could possibly spend on
lubricating compounds in the course of an entire year. The company
usually works against a deadline and risks penalty payments if it misses
it. As a result of this seemingly obvious insight, the lubricating
compound manufacturer no longer sells lubricating compounds. Instead he
offers to pay the owner of heavy earth-moving equip- ment the full cost
of any hour of down-time caused by lubricating failure. The only condi-
tion attached to this offer is that the construction company adopt and
follow a mainte- nance program designed by the manufacturer’s service
representatives which, of course, prescribes the company’s lubricating
compounds. The company formerly had to price its products below those of
the major petroleum companies; no customer now even asks, “What do you
charge for your lubricating compounds?”</p>
<p>What about such concepts of value on the part of the customer as the
service he re- ceives? There is little doubt, for instance, that the
American housewife today buys appli- ances largely on the basis of the
service experience she or her friends and neighbors have had with other
appliances sold under the same brand name. The speed with which she
can</p>
<p>obtain service if something goes wrong, the quality of the service,
and its cost have be- come major determinants in the buyer’s
decision.</p>
<p>What a company’s different customers consider value is so complicated
that it can be answered only by the customers themselves. Management
should not even try to guess at the answers—it should always go to the
customers in a systematic quest for them.</p>
<p>The marketing approach outlined here will not, by itself, result in a
definition of the purpose and mission of a business. For many businesses
the approach will raise more questions than it answers. This is true of
the business which has as its basic core of unity a common technology
rather than a common market. (See Chapter 57, “Building Unity Out of
Diversity.”) Examples are chemical companies but also commercial banks.
Similarly, process businesses—e.g., steel companies or aluminum
refiners—need much more than one market definition to define their
business. Of necessity, their products go into an in- finity of markets,
serve a multitude of customers, and have to satisfy a great variety of
value concepts and value expectations.</p>
<p>Yet even such businesses should start their attempt to ask “What is
our business?” by first asking, “Who are our customers? Where are they?
What do they consider value?” A business—and for that matter, any
institution—is determined by its contribution; every- thing else is
effort rather than result. What the customer pays is revenue; everything
else is cost. The approach from the outside, that is, from the market,
is only one step. But it is the step that comes before all others. It
alone can give understanding and thereby replace opinions as the
foundation for the most fundamental decision that faces every manage-
ment.</p>
<p>When to Ask “What Is Our Business?”</p>
<p>Most managements, if they ask the question at all, ask “What is our
business?” when the company is in trouble. Of course, then it must be
asked. And then asking the question may, indeed, have spectacular
results and may even reverse what appears irreversible decline—as shown
by the example of Vail’s work at Bell Telephone and of the reversal of
the carpet industry’s long-term downward trend. The success of General
Motors also re- sulted from asking “What is our business?” when the
company was floundering. When Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., became president in
1920, GM was in deep trouble and barely viable. Sloan’s definition of
the purpose and mission of GM, and his development of both strat- egy
and structure from this definition, gave GM leadership and outstanding
profitability within three years or less.*</p>
<p>To wait until a business—or an industry—is in trouble is playing
Russian roulette. It is irresponsible management. The question should be
asked at the inception of a business— and particularly for a business
that has ambitions to grow. Such a business better start with a clear
entrepreneurial concept.</p>
<p>One successful example is the Wall Street firm which in the sixties
rose to leadership in the American securities market. Donaldson, Lufkin,
and Jenrette (DLJ) was founded by three young men right out of business
school. They had little except an idea. Yet the firm rose within five or
six years to seventh place among Wall Street houses. DLJ then became the
first Wall Street firm to sell its shares to the public and started the
long-overdue change of the New York Stock Exchange from a private club
to a service institution. It was the first firm to do something about
Wall Street’s need to broaden its capital base, which thoughtful people
had seen for thirty years. “Our business,” the founders of DLJ said, “is
to provide financial services, financial advice, and financial
management to the new ‘capitalists,’ the institutional investors such as
pension funds and mutual funds.” In retrospect, this definition was
obvious: right answers always are. By 1950 it had become quite clear
that these new institutional investors were rapidly becoming the
dominant force in the American capital market and the main channel
through which individuals</p>
<p>*On Sloan’s work, see his book, My Years with General Motors
(Doubleday, 1964), and my book, Managing for Results (1964).</p>
<p>were directing their savings into the capital market. Yet at the time
at which this answer was given, it went counter to everything the rest
of Wall Street knew.</p>
<p>The man who decides to become his own boss may not have to ask, “What
is my busi- ness?” If he, for instance, mixes up a new cleaning compound
in his garage and starts peddling it from door to door, he needs to know
only that his mixture does a superior job in removing stains. But when
the product catches on; when he has to hire people to mix it and to sell
it; when he has to decide whether to keep on selling directly or through
retail stores—department stores, supermarkets, hardware stores, or all
three; what additional products he needs for a full line—then he has to
ask and to answer the question “What is my business?” Otherwise, even
with the best of products, he will soon be back wearing out his own shoe
leather peddling from door to door.</p>
<p>The most important time to ask seriously “What is our business?” is
when a company has been successful. To understand this has been the
great strength of Sears, Roebuck. It is also one of the secrets of the
success of Marks andandandand Spencer in Great Britain. (See the next
chapter.) And not to have understood this is a major reason for the
present crisis of American schools and American universities.</p>
<p>Success always obsoletes the very behavior that achieved it. It
always creates new re- alities. It always creates, above all, its own
and different problems. Only the fairy story ends “They lived happily
ever after.”</p>
<p>It is not easy for the management of a successful company to ask,
“What is our busi- ness?” Everybody in the company then thinks that the
answer is so obvious as not to de- serve discussion. It is never popular
to argue with success, never popular to rock the boat.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks knew that the penalty for the hubris of success is
severe. The management that does not ask “What is our business?” when
the company is successful is, in effect, smug, lazy, and arrogant. It
will not be long before success will turn into failure.</p>
<p>The two most successful American industries of the 1920s were
anthracite coal mines and railroads. Both believed that God had given
them an unshakable monopoly forever. Both believed that the definition
of their business was so obvious as to eliminate all need for thought,
let alone for action. Neither need have tumbled from its leadership
position— the anthracite industry into total oblivion—had their
managements not taken success for granted.</p>
<p>Above all: when a management attains the company’s objectives, it
should always ask seriously, “What is our business?’’ This requires
self-discipline and responsibility. The alternative is decline.</p>
<p>“What Will Our Business Be?”</p>
<p>Sooner or later even the most successful answer to the question “What
is our business?” becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail’s answer was good for almost two-thirds of a century.
But by the late 1960s it became apparent that it was no longer adequate;
the telephone system was no longer, as in Vail’s days, a natural
monopoly. Alternative ways of telecommunication were rapidly becoming
possible. By the late sixties it had also become apparent that the
traditional definition of the telephone as an instrument to transmit
voice messages had become inadequate, both because of the rapid growth
in data transmission over telephone wires and because of the increasing
possibility of transmitting visual images together with the voice.
Vail’s simple and elegant definition of the business of the Bell
Telephone Sys- tem was in need of reexamination.</p>
<p>The brilliant answer which Alfred P. Sloan, as the new president of
General Motors, gave in the early 1920s to the question “What is GM’s
business?” also held good for an amazingly long time, right through
World War II and the postwar recovery. But by 1960 or so, while Sloan,
though retired, was himself still alive, the answer had become inade-
quate and inappropriate. That GM has not raised the question again and
apparently has not seen the need to think it through again surely has a
lot to do with the evident vulner-</p>
<p>ability of the company to consumer dissatisfaction, public pressures,
and political attack, and with its inability to attain leadership
position in the world automobile market.</p>
<p>Very few definitions of the purpose and mission of a business have
anything like a life expectancy of thirty, let alone fifty, years. To be
good for ten years is probably all one can normally expect.</p>
<p>In asking “What is our business?” management therefore also needs to
add, “And what will it be? What changes in the environment are already
discernible that are likely to have high impact on the characteristics,
mission, and purpose of our business?” and “How do we now build these
anticipations into our theory of the business, into its objectives,
strategies, and work assignments?”</p>
<p>The method and approach needed to tackle this question—and the next
question, “What should our business be?”—will be discussed in Chapter
10, “Strategic Planning.” But what basic questions to ask belongs
here.</p>
<p>Again the market, its potential and its trends, is the starting
point. How large a market can we project for our business in five or ten
years—assuming no basic changes in cus- tomers, in market structure, or
in technology? And, what factors could validate or dis- prove these
projections?</p>
<p>The most important of these trends is one to which few businesses pay
much attention: changes in population structure and population dynamics.
Traditionally businessmen, following the economists, have assumed that
demographics are a constant. Historically this has been a sound
assumption. Populations used to change very slowly except as a result of
catastrophic events, such as major war or famine. This is no longer
true, how- ever. Populations nowadays can and do change drastically, in
developed as well as in de- veloping countries.</p>
<p>Every developed country (with the single exception of Great Britain
perhaps) had at least a small baby boom in the decade following World
War II. Young married women had many more babies than before, and had
them in closer sequence. Ten years later this was followed by an equally
spectacu1ar “baby bust,’’ in which the number of live births went down
very sharply.</p>
<p>In the developing countries the birth rate did not increase, but the
number of babies who survived infancy increased spectacularly, and is
still increasing. In other words, in a short twenty-five years, the
whole population structure changed drastically. In the United States,
for instance, the largest single age group in 1950 were the
thirty-eight- to forty- year-olds. Ten years later the largest age group
were the seventeen-year-olds. But by 1980 the largest single age group
in America will be the twenty-five-year-olds. Since 1945, also, there
has been an educational explosion in every developed country. In the
develop- ing countries there has been rapid urbanization, as a result of
which Latin America, for instance, has ceased to be rural in its
population structure and has become predominantly urban.</p>
<p>The importance of demographics does not lie only in the impact
population structure has on buying power and buying habits, and on the
size and structure of the work force. Population shifts are the only
events regarding the future for which true prediction is pos- sible.
People do not enter the labor force till they are at least in their
teens—and in the developed countries, increasingly, not until they are
twenty. They do not form households until then either, nor become
primary customers in their own right. In other words, major trends in
markets, buying power and buying behavior, customer needs, and
employment can be predicted with near-certainty by analyzing what has
already happened in popula- tion dynamics and population structure.</p>
<p>Any attempt to anticipate tomorrow—and this is, of course, what we
are trying to do by asking “What will our business be?”—has to start
with demographic analysis as the sturdiest and most reliable
foundation.</p>
<p>The massive impact of even fairly minor demographic changes is
illustrated by the sharp shift in the American magazine industry.</p>
<p>As late as 1950 the mass-circulation magazine was America’s most
successful and most profitable communications medium, and seemed
impregnable. But the leaders of</p>
<p>those days—Collier’s, The Saturday Evening Post, Look, and Life—have
disappeared. The survivors are fighting for their lives. The development
is often blamed on television. But magazines as a whole have not
suffered from television just as they did not earlier suffer from radio.
On the contrary, total magazine circulation as well as magazine adver-
tising have gone up faster since television appeared than they did
before, and they are still going up fast. What has happened is that
population has changed—partly because of the change in age structure,
but primarily because of the change in educational levels. The
undifferentiated mass audience is gone. Its place has been taken by a
large number of specialty mass markets, that is, groups of substantial
but still limited size, of much higher education and purchasing power,
and of sharply defined and specialized interests. These groups read
magazines even more than the earlier generation—for the simple reason
that they read more. They are a better market for magazine
advertisers—for the simple reason that they buy more. Each of these
better-educated and affluent audience segments is, in itself, a mass
audience—but a specialized one.</p>
<p>This change in audience could easily have been anticipated in
1950—the demographic development had already happened. It was seen
clearly by a number of publishers. On this understanding are based all
the American magazine successes of the last twenty years, from Business
Week to Modern Bride, from Sports Illustrated to Playboy, from
Scientific American to Psychology Today or TV Guide. All these new
magazines apply basic con- cepts which the mass-circulation magazines
first developed, in editorial, in circulation, and in advertising. But
they apply them in accordance with the new population structure, that
is, to a demographic segment characterized by a common interest. All of
them have circulations well above half a million, if not larger; but
they deliberately do not appeal to a general audience. All of them
represent a conscious and deliberate exploitation of demographic
opportunities. They can obtain their audience at low—or at least at
reason- able—circulation-acquisition costs. The old mass-audience
magazines, however, have increasingly had to buy circulation, that is,
to invest far more in subscription acquisition than they can possibly
get back in subscription revenue. As a result the new specialty mass
magazines soon also get the advertising.</p>
<p>Management needs to anticipate changes in market structure resulting
from changes in the economy; from changes in fashion or taste; from
moves by competition. And competi- tion must always be defined according
to the customer’s concept of what product or ser- vice he buys and thus
must include indirect as well as direct competition.</p>
<p>The Unsatisfied Wants of the Customer</p>
<p>Finally, management has to ask which of the consumer’s wants are not
adequately satis- fied by the products or services offered him today.
The ability to ask this question and to answer it correctly usually
makes the difference between a growth company and one that depends for
its development on the rising tide of the economy or of the industry.
But whoever contents himself to rise with the tide will also fall with
it.</p>
<p>One example of a successful analysis of the customer’s unsatisfied
wants is Sears, Roebuck, of course. But the topic is so important as to
warrant further illustration.</p>
<p>Sony asked the question “What are the customer’s unsatisfied wants?”
when it first decided to move into the American consumer market in the
mid-fifties. Sony had been founded right after the end of World War II
as a manufacturer of tape recorders and had achieved modest success with
its products in its own domestic market. It had entered the U.S. as a
small but reliable supplier of high-priced professional tape-recording
equipment for broadcasting studios. Yet the product with which it first
established itself in the American mass-consumer market was a product it
had never made before—portable tran- sistor radios. Young people, Sony’s
analysis of the market showed, were taking the exist- ing heavy, clumsy,
and expensive equipment—phonographs weighing many pounds, or
battery-powered radios with audio tubes—on picnics, camping trips, and
other excur- sions. Surely here was an unsatisfied want for light,
cheap, and yet dependable instru- ment. Sony did not develop the
transistor—Bell Laboratories had done that, in America.</p>
<p>The Bell Laboratories people, however, as well as all the electronic
manufacturers in America, had decided that the customer was not yet
ready for transistorized equipment. They looked at the wants of the
customer that were satisfied by the existing equipment, wants for
equipment that was meant to be kept in one place. Sony, by asking “What
are the unsatisfied wants?” identified a new growth market—and within an
incredibly short period established itself worldwide as the leader and
the pacesetter.</p>
<p>Of the world’s leading businesses, Unilever has probably done the
most work on “What will our business be?” The method Unilever has
developed and the models it has built for each of its major product
lines and each of its major national markets take into account a large
number of factors, from national income to changes in retail
distribution, and from eating habits to taxation. But the foundation and
starting point are population figures and population trends. These one
does not have to forecast; one can build on what has already
happened.</p>
<p>“What Should Our Business Be?”</p>
<p>“What will our business be?” aims at adaptation to anticipated
changes. It aims at modify- ing, extending, developing the existing,
ongoing business.</p>
<p>But there is need also to ask “What should our business be?” What
opportunities are opening up or can be created to fulfill the purpose
and mission of the business by making it into a different business?</p>
<p>IBM had long defined its business as data processing. Prior to 1950,
this meant punch cards and equipment for sorting them. When the computer
came, and with it a new tech- nology in which IBM had not the slightest
expertise, IBM, asking, “What should our business be?,” realized that
data processing henceforth would have to mean computers rather than
punch cards.</p>
<p>Businesses that fail to ask this question are likely to miss their
major opportunity. The American life insurance industry has long defined
its business as providing basic invest- ment and financial security to
the American family. Right through World War II, the life insurance
policy was indeed the best way to discharge this purpose and mission.
Since World War II, however, the majority of the American people has
attained incomes that enable it to accumulate savings beyond what is
needed to buy adequate life insurance pro- tection. At the same time,
the whole population has become acutely conscious of inflation, that is,
of the erosion of the value of the traditionally conservative and safe
investments of fixed money value. The life insurance companies have the
access to the market and the selling organization. In their own list of
policyholders they have the largest inventory of financial customers in
the country. Yet very few of them have asked the question “What should
our business be?” As a result, life insurance has steadily been losing
market stand- ing. Before World War II life insurance was, next to the
family’s home, the leading in- vestment of the middle class. It has now
slipped to third or fourth place and is still going down. The new
savings increasingly have not been going into life insurance but into
mu- tual funds and pension funds.</p>
<p>What the life insurance companies lacked was not innovation. The
needed financial instruments had all been developed much earlier. What
they lacked was the willingness to ask “What should our business be?”
and to take the question seriously.</p>
<p>Next to changes in society, economy, and market as factors demanding
consideration in answering “What should our business be?” comes, of
course, innovation, one’s own and that of others.</p>
<p>Changes in the nature of the business arising out of innovation are
too well known to require much documentation. All major enterprises in
the engineering and chemical fields have largely grown by converting
innovation into new business. The Eurodollar which these last ten years
has financed a good deal of world trade was (as said earlier not in-
vented by the large American commercial banks. But they immediately saw
its signifi- cance, and their success in making the Eurodollar into an
international currency explains, in large measure, their rapid growth in
multinational banking.</p>
<p>Finally—a special but important reason for changing what “our
business is” to “what it should be”—then is the business of “the wrong
size.” (See Chapter 55, “On Being the Wrong Size.”)</p>
<p>The Need for Planned Abandonment</p>
<p>Just as important as the decision on what new and different things to
do is planned, sys- tematic abandonment of the old that no longer fits
the purpose and mission of the busi- ness, no longer conveys
satisfaction to the customer or customers, no longer makes a su- perior
contribution.</p>
<p>An essential step in deciding what our business is, what it will be,
and what it should be is, therefore, systematic analysis of all existing
products, services, processes, markets, end uses, and distribution
channels. Are they still viable? And are they likely to remain viable?
Do they still give value to the customer? And are they likely to do so
tomorrow? Do they still fit the realities of population and markets, of
technology and economy? And if not, how can we best abandon them—or at
least stop pouring in further resources and efforts? Unless these
questions are being asked seriously and systematically, and unless
managements are willing to act on the answers to them, the best
definition of “What our business is, will be, and should be” will remain
a pious platitude. Energy will be used up in defending yesterday. No one
will have the time, resources, or will to work on exploit- ing today,
let alone to work on making tomorrow.</p>
<p>Planned abandonment was first discussed and advocated in my book
Managing for Results. It first was adopted as a systematic policy a few
years later by the General Elec- tric Company. Most long-range planning
in large companies, like Unilever, focuses on the question “What will
our business be?” GE’s strategic business planning developed in the late
sixties is an exception. Its aim is to answer “What should our business
be?” Yet GE’s planning does not start out with the question “What new
things should we go into?” It starts out with “What existing product
lines and businesses should we abandon?” and “Which ones should we cut
back and deemphasize?”</p>
<p>Defining the purpose and mission of the business is difficult,
