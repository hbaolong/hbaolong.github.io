<h4 id="the-innovative-organization">61 The Innovative Organization</h4>
<p>Innovation an Economic or Social Term—Innovation Characteristics—The
Dynamics of Innovation—Innovation Strategy and Its Basic Assumption—The
Need for Planned Abandonment of the Old—The Need to Aim High—The Batting
Average—The Pro- gress of an Innovation—Measurements and Budgets—The
Risk of Failures or of “Near Success” —Innovative Attitudes and
Practices—Management’s Different Role—Focus on Responsibility—Continuous
Learning—The Structure for Innova- tion—The Du Pont Example—Innovation a
“Business” Rather Than a “Function” — The Team—The Innovating Unit as an
Entrepreneur—The Challenge of the Innova- tive Organization</p>
<p>THE NEED TO INNOVATE is mentioned—indeed emphasized—in every book on
management. But beyond this the books, as a rule, pay little attention
to what man- agement and organization need to be and need to do to
stimulate, to direct, and to make effective innovation. Most discussions
stress, almost exclusively, the administrative function of management,
that is, the task of keeping going and of improving what is al- ready
known and what is already largely being done. Little thought or space is
normally devoted to the entrepreneurial function of creating effectively
and purposefully the new and the different.</p>
<p>In this neglect of the management of innovation, the books only
mirror business real- ity. Every management stresses the need to
innovate. But few, in the large as well as the small businesses,
organize innovation as a distinct and major task. To be sure, since
World War II, “research” has become fashionable. Large sums of money are
being spent on it. But in many companies the outcome has been
improvement rather than innovation.</p>
<p>This is even more true of the public-service institutions.</p>
<p>There were good reasons in the past for the focus on the
administrative function to the neglect of innovation. When management
first became a concern, in the early years of this century, the great
and new need was to learn how to organize, structure, and direct the
large-scale human organization which was suddenly coming into being.
Innovation inso- far as it received attention was seen as a separate
job, a job done by the individual by himself, by the “inventor” of the
nineteenth century. Or it was seen as a predominantly technical job,
that of research.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was not too much scope for innovation in the years
from 1920 to 1950 when most of the basic work on management was being
done. For contrary to com- mon belief, these were not years of rapid
change, either in technology or in society. They were (as was stressed
in Chapter 3) years in which, by and large, technology built on
foundations that had been laid before World War I. And while they were
years of tremen- dous political turbulence, social and economic
institutions were stagnant. Indeed, the same can be said for social and
economic ideas. The great revolutionary ideas which have been at work in
the last fifty years are those of thinkers living, or at least rooted,
in the nineteenth century, such as Marx, Darwin, and Freud. Even Keynes,
no matter how inno-</p>
<p>vative he was, built on foundations which such economists of the late
nineteenth century as Leon Walras and Alfred Marshall had already put
securely in place.</p>
<p>Now, however, we may be entering a period of rapid change more
comparable in its basic features to the closing decades of the
nineteenth century than to the immediate past with which we are
familiar. In the late nineteenth century, as we need to remind
ourselves, a new major invention leading almost immediately to the
emergence of a new major in- dustry, surfaced every few months on
average. This period began in 1856, the year that saw both Siemens’s
dynamo and Perkins’s aniline dye. It ended with the development of the
modern electronic tube in 1911. In between came typewriter and
automobile, electric light bulb, man-made fibers, tractors, streetcars,
synthetic drugs, telephone, radio, and airplane—to mention only a few.
In between, in other words, came the modern world.</p>
<p>By contrast, no truly new major industry was started after 1914 until
the late 1950s, when computers first became operational.</p>
<p>Between 1870 and 1914 the industrial geography of the world was in
rapid change. A new major industrial area emerged on average every
decade or so: the U.S. and Germany between 1860 and 1870, western Russia
and Japan during the next twenty years, Central Europe (that is, the
western part of the old Austria-Hungary and northern Italy) by 1900.
Between World War I and World War II, however, no major new industrial
area joined the “industrial club.”</p>
<p>Now, however, there are signs of rapid change, with Brazil and China,
for instance, approaching “the takeoff point”—Brazil may well have
reached it. Now, in other words, there are signs that fundamental
economic relationships will be in rapid change and flux. And while
Bretton Woods in 1944 attempted to restore the monetary world as it had
ex- isted before 1914—and almost succeeded for twenty-five years—the
Eurodollar of the sixties, followed by the “paper gold” of the Special
Drawing Rights a few years later, and finally by the abandonment of the
dollar as the key currency, ended the period in which yesterday was the
norm and clearly ushered in a period of great and rapid change and of
major innovation in international economy, international currency, and
international credit.</p>
<p>But the need for innovation will be equally great in the social
field. And the public- service institutions too will have to learn how
to manage innovation.</p>
<p>Just as the late nineteenth century was a period of tremendous
innovative activity in technology, so also was it in social and economic
institutions. And just as the fifty years after World War I were years
of technological continuity rather than of rapid change and innovation,
so also were they years of continuity in social and economic
institutions. Government as we know it today had largely been created by
the time of World War I. The Local Government reform in Great Britain
which began in the middle of the nine- teenth century created new
institutions, new relationships, and, above all, established new tasks
for government. Building the modern welfare state began shortly
thereafter in Bis- marck’s Germany. At about the same time—the 1880s—the
United States made a major contribution to the arts and practice of
government: the regulatory commission. Every one of the New Deal reforms
of the 1930s had been discussed, worked out, and in many cases put in
practice on the local or state level twenty years earlier, that is, in
the Progressive Era just before World War I.</p>
<p>The great American university was the innovative creation of half a
dozen brilliant university presidents between 1860 and 1900 (on this,
see Chapter 13). The modern hos- pital was essentially designed between
1900 and 1920. Armed services took their present shape in the two major
conflicts of the mid-nineteenth century, the American Civil War and the
Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Since then, the development has been
linear— larger armies, more firepower, more armor, but fundamentally the
same strategies and tactics and indeed even the same stress on “hardware
technology.” Even such radical technical innovations as the tank and the
airplane were largely integrated into traditional command structures and
traditional military doctrines.</p>
<p>Now the need for social and political innovation is becoming urgent
again. The mod- ern metropolis needs new governmental forms. The
relationship between man and his</p>
<p>environment has to be thought through and restructured. No modern
government governs effectively anymore. The crisis of the world is,
above all, an institutional crisis demanding institutional
innovation.</p>
<p>The business enterprise, its structure and organization, the way in
which it integrates knowledge into work and work into performance—and
the way in which it integrates en- terprise with society and
government—are also areas of major innovative need and inno- vative
opportunity. Surely there is need in the social and economic sphere for
another period of innovative activity such as we last lived through in
the second half of the nine- teenth century.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the nineteenth century, however, innovation from
now on will have to be built into existing organizations. Large
businesses—and equally large public- service institutions—will have to
become increasingly capable of organizing themselves for innovation as
well as for administration.</p>
<p>In the first place, they command access to manpower and capital to a
degree un- dreamed of a hundred years ago. But also the ratio between
invention or research and the efforts needed to convert the results of
research or invention into new businesses, new products, or new
institutions had changed significantly. It is by now accepted, if only
as a rule of thumb, that for every dollar spent on generating an idea,
ten dollars have to be spent on “research” to convert it into a new
discovery or a new invention. For every ten dollars spent on “research,”
at least a hundred dollars need to be spent on development, and for
every hundred dollars spent on development, something between a thousand
and ten thousand dollars are needed to introduce and establish a new
product or a new busi- ness on the market. And only after a new product
or a new business has been established in the market is there an
“innovation.”</p>
<p>This may be particularly true with respect to the public-service
institution. A hundred years ago there were few of them and they were
small. The task then was largely to create new institutions where none
existed. Today these institutions are massive and dominate the social,
political, and economic landscape. They represent existing
bureaucracies, ex- isting concentrations of expertise, existing
assignments, and ongoing programs. If they cannot become innovative, the
new we need has little chance of becoming effective inno- vation. It is
likely to be smothered by muscle-bound giants of big government and big
armed service, big university and big hospital, and many others.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the small business, or even the lone
entrepreneur, will not continue to play an important role. Nothing is
further from the truth than the hoary myth of the Populists that the
small man is being squeezed out of the marketplace by the giants. The
innovative growth companies of the last twenty-five years all started as
small busi- nesses. And by and large the small businesses have done far
better than the giants.</p>
<p>In every single industry, except those where monopoly is protected by
government (e.g., in railroading), small upstarts which a few short
years ago were unknown have ac- quired major market positions and have
proven themselves more than capable of competi- tion with the giants.
This is particularly true, as has been said before, where the giants,
through natural growth or deliberate policy, grew into conglomerates. In
the chemical industry, in the electrical apparatus industry, and in many
others, the traditional giant, a GE or an Imperial Chemical, has lost
market position and market share in many mar- kets—and largely to small
or medium-sized newcomers with an innovative bent.</p>
<p>An established company which in an age demanding innovation is not
capable of in- novation is doomed to decline and extinction. And a
management which in such a period</p>
<p>does not know how to manage innovation is incompetent and unequal to
its task. Manag- ing innovation will increasingly become a challenge to
management, and especially to top management, and a touchstone of its
competence.</p>
<p>Innovative Examples</p>
<p>While in a minority, especially among big businesses, innovative
companies do exist. One might mention Renault in France and Fiat in
Italy, Marks andandandand Spencer in England, ASEA in Sweden, Sony in
Japan—or between the two World Wars, the publishing house of Ull- stein
in Germany. In the United States 3M (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,
St. Paul, Minnesota), the Bell Laboratories of the Telephone Company, or
the Bank of Amer- ica come to mind. These firms—apparently have no
difficulty innovating and no difficulty getting change accepted in their
organizations. Their managements, one would expect, rarely have occasion
to ask, “How can we keep our organization flexible and willing to accept
the new?” These managements are much too busy finding the manpower and
the money to run with the innovations their own organizations force on
them.</p>
<p>Innovative organizations are not confined to business. Both the
Manhattan Project in the United States, which developed the atomic bomb
during World War II, and CBRN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche
Nucleaire) in Geneva under its first Director- General, Victor
Weisskopf, furnish examples of innovative organizations. This is all the
more remarkable, as these two institutions were heavily staffed with
university professors who, in their natural habitat, are remarkably
resistant to change and notoriously slow to innovate.</p>
<p>These examples indicate that an organization’s ability to innovate is
a function of management rather than of industry, size, or age of the
organization, let alone to be ex- plained with that common excuse of
poor managers, a country’s “culture and traditions.”</p>
<p>Nor can the explanation be found in research. Bell
Laboratories—perhaps the most productive industrial research
laboratory—has indeed been stressing for many years fun- damental
inquiries into the laws of nature. But Renault and Fiat are not
particularly dis- tinguished for their research; what makes them
innovative organizations is ability to get new designs and new models
rapidly into production and on the market. The Bank of America, finally,
innovates mainly in its customers’ businesses, and in terms of financial
structure and credit, inventory and marketing policies.</p>
<p>These examples imply that the innovative organization
institutionalizes the innovative spirit and creates a habit of
innovation. At the beginning of these organizations there might well
have been an individual, a great innovator. He might have succeeded in
build- ing around him an organization to convert into successful
business reality his new ideas and inventions—as did Werner von Siemens
in Germany a hundred years ago, A. P. Giannini in building the Bank of
America seventy years ago, and as Edwin H. Land of Polaroid has been
doing since World War II. But no such founding genius presided over Bell
Laboratories, over 3M, or over Renault. The innovative organization
manages to innovate as an organization, that is, as a human group
organized for continual and produc- tive innovation. It is organized to
make change into norm.</p>
<p>These various innovative organizations are very different indeed in
their structures, their businesses, their characteristics, and even
their organization and management phi- losophies. But they do have
certain characteristics in common.</p>
<p>1 Innovating organizations know what “innovation” means.</p>
<p>2 Innovative organizations understand the dynamics of innovation.</p>
<p>3 They have an innovative strategy.</p>
<p>4 They know that innovation requires objectives, goals, and
measurements that</p>
<p>are different from the objectives, goals, and measurements of a
managerial organization, and appropriate to the dynamics of
innovation.</p>
<p>5 Management, especially top management, plays a different role and
has a dif- ferent attitude in an innovative organization.</p>
<p>6 The innovative organization is structured differently and set up
differently from the managerial organization.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Innovation</p>
<p>Innovation organizations first know what “innovation” means. They
know that innovation is not science nor technology, but value. They know
that it is not something that takes place within an organization but a
change outside. The measure of innovation is the im- pact on the
environment. Innovation in a business enterprise must therefore always
be: market-focused. Innovation that is product-focused is likely to
produce “miracles of tech- nology” but disappointing rewards.</p>
<p>The outstanding innovators among the world’s pharmaceutical companies
define their goal as new drugs that will make a significant difference
to medical practice and to patient health. They do not define innovation
in terms of research, but in terms of the practice of medicine.
Similarly, Bell Laboratories always starts out with the question “What
will make a difference to telephone service?”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, however, it is precisely the most market-focused
innovator who has come up with some of the most important technical or
scientific advances. Bell Labs, for instance, created the transistor,
produced the basic mathematics of information theory, and is responsible
for some of the fundamental discoveries underlying the computer.</p>
<p>To start out with the consumer’s or client’s need for a significant
change is often the most direct way to define new science, new
knowledge, and new technology, and to or- ganize purposeful and
systematical work on fundamental discovery.</p>
<p>The Dynamics of Innovation</p>
<p>Innovating businesses are aware of the dynamics of innovation. They
do not believe that innovation is determined—or at least they know that
there are so many factors in what- ever causal patterns may exist that
no one can possibly unravel them. Neither, however, do they share the
common belief that innovation is haphazard and incapable of being pre-
dicted or foreseen.</p>
<p>They know that innovation follows a probability distribution. They
know that it is possible to say what kind of innovation, if successfully
brought about, is likely to become a major product or process, a major
new business, a major market. They know how to look systematically for
the areas where innovative activity, if it produces results, is likely
to enjoy success and to be rewarding.</p>
<p>One such heuristic guide to what one could call “the
innovation-prone” is basic eco- nomic vulnerability of a process, a
technology, or an industry. Wherever an industry en- joys growing market
demand without being able to turn the demand into profitability, one can
say, with high probability, that a major innovation which changes
process, product, distributive channel, or customer expectations will
produce high rewards.</p>
<p>Examples abound. One is the paper industry, which, all the world
over, has enjoyed rapidly expanding consumer demands—on the order of 5
to 10 percent a year, year in and year out—without being able apparently
to earn a decent return on its capital. There is the steel industry,
which is in a very similar position. But there is also life insurance,
which is one of the few “products” a customer is ready to buy—one of the
few products, by the way, in which the interests of producer and
consumer are completely identical—and which yet has to be sold through
“hard-sell” methods and against apparently very high buyer
resistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, innovative opportunity exists where there is glaring
disparity between vari- ous levels of an economy or of a market.</p>
<p>The major growth industry in Latin America in the 1960s, for
instance, was not manu- facturing. It was retail distribution. Huge
masses of people flocked into the cities and from a subsistence economy
into a money economy. Individually they were, of course,</p>
<p>mostly very poor. But collectively they represented large new
purchasing power. Yet the distribution system in most Latin American
countries remained in the pre-urban mold— small shops, undercapitalized,
undermanaged, poorly stocked, and yet with very slow turnover. Wherever
an entrepreneur moved in to offer modern distribution—Sears, Roe- buck
was the first to recognize the opportunity—success was
instantaneous.</p>
<p>Another area of innovative opportunity is the exploitation of the
consequences of events that have already happened but have not yet had
their economic impacts. Demo- graphic developments, i.e., changes in
population, are among the most important. They are also the most nearly
certain. Changes in knowledge are less certain—the lead time is
difficult to predict. But they too offer opportunities. And then, most
important, but least certain, are changes in awareness, changes in
vision, changes in people’s expectations.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, earned its success largely
because it antici- pated the impact of fundamental changes in awareness.
After World War II health care every place became a “good buy.” And
drugs are the only way to health care easily acces- sible to poor and
poorly educated rural countries. Where physicians and hospitals are
scarce, drugs can still be dispensed and will be effective for a great
many health prob- lems. The pharmaceutical company which understood this
and went into the developing countries found that, with respect to drug
purchases, they are “fully developed.”</p>
<p>Finally, of course, there are the innovations which are not part of
the pattern, the inno- vations that are unexpected and that change the
world rather than exploit it. They are the innovations in which an
entrepreneur sets out to make something happen. They are the truly
important innovations. They are the innovations of a Henry Ford, who
envisioned something that did not exist at the time, namely a mass
market, and then set about to make it happen.</p>
<p>These innovations lie outside of the probability distribution—or, at
least, they place so far toward the extreme as to be grossly improbable.
They are also clearly the most risky ones. For every one such innovation
that succeeds, there must be ninety-nine that fail, ninety-nine of which
nothing is ever heard.</p>
<p>It is important for the innovating business to realize that these
atypical innovations ex- ist and that they are of supreme importance. It
is important to keep watching for them. But, by their very nature, they
cannot be the object of systematic, purposeful organized activity within
the business enterprise. They cannot be managed.</p>
<p>And they are sufficiently rare to be treated as exceptions, despite
their overreaching importance. The business that focuses on the
probability pattern and organizes its innova- tion strategy to take
advantage of it will innovate. And it will in the process become sensi-
tive to the exceptional, the great, the truly historic innovation, and
equipped to recognize it early and to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>To manage innovation, a manager need not be a technologist. Indeed,
the first-rate technologist is rarely good at managing innovation. He is
so deeply engrossed in his spe- cialty that he rarely sees development
outside of it. It is not a metallurgist who is likely to recognize the
importance of basic new knowledge in plastics even though it may, within
a reasonably short time, obsolete a good many of his proudest products.
Similarly, the in- novative manager need not be an economist. The
economist, by definition, can concern himself with the impact of
innovations only after they have become massive. The innovat- ing
manager needs to anticipate vulnerabilities and opportunities—and this
is not the economist’s bent. The innovative manager needs to study
innovation as such and to learn its dynamics, its pattern, its
predictability. To manage innovation, a manager has to be at least
literate with respect to the dynamics of innovation.*</p>
<p>Innovative Strategy</p>
<p>Like all business strategies, an innovative strategy starts out with
the question “What is our business and what should it be?” But its
assumptions regarding the future are different</p>
<p>*For a more extended discussion of this topic, see my book, Managing
for Results, especially Part II.</p>
<p>from the assumptions made with respect to the ongoing business. There
the assumption is that present product lines and services, present
markets and present distribution channels, present technologies and
processes will continue. The first objective of a strategy for the
ongoing business is to optimize what already exists or is being
established.</p>
<p>The ruling assumption of an innovative strategy is that whatever
exists is aging. The assumption must be that existing product lines and
services, existing markets and distribu- tion channels, existing
technologies and processes will sooner or later—and usually sooner—go
down rather than up.</p>
<p>The governing device of a strategy for the ongoing business might
therefore be said to be: “Better and More.” For the innovative strategy
the device has to be: “New and Differ- ent.”*</p>
<p>The foundation of innovative strategy is planned and systematic
sloughing off of the old, the dying, the obsolete. Innovating
organizations spend neither time nor resources on defending yesterday.
Systematic abandonment of yesterday alone can free the resources, and
especially the scarcest resource of them all, capable people, for work
on the new.</p>
<p>Unwillingness to do this may be the greatest obstacle to innovation
in the existing large business. That the General Electric Company did
not succeed in establishing itself as a computer producer is, within the
company itself, explained in large part as the result of unwillingness
or inability to make available managers and professionals of the high
quality and proven performance capacity needed. To be sure, GE assigned
a great many good people to its computer group. But few of them were
allowed to stay there long. No sooner were they gone from their original
post in a research lab or a large division, than the cry went up “we
cannot do without them,” and back they went to their old assignments of
improving what was already known and what was already done.</p>
<p>The new and especially the as-yet unborn, that is, the future
innovation, always looks insignificant compared to the large volume, the
large revenue, and the manifold problems of the ongoing business. It is
all the more important, therefore, for an existing business to commit
itself to the systematic abandonment of yesterday if it wants to be able
to create tomorrow.</p>
<p>Second in a strategy of innovation is the clear recognition that
innovation efforts must aim high. It is just as difficult, as a rule, to
make a minor modification to an existing product as it is to innovate a
new one.</p>
<p>Michaei J. Kami, the author of the essay cited above, states as a
rule of thumb that the projected results of innovative efforts should be
at least three times as large as the results needed to attain company
objectives. This is probably an underestimate. In improvement
work—adding a new product, upgrading a product line, broadening the
market, and so on—one can assume a success rate of 50 percent. No more
than half the projects should be total failures.</p>
<p>This is not the way innovation works. Here the assumption must be
that the majority of innovative efforts will not succeed. Nine out of
every ten “brilliant ideas” turn out to be nonsense. And nine out of
every ten ideas which, after thorough analysis, seem to be worthwhile
and feasible turn out to be failures or, at best, puny weaklings. The
mortality rate of innovations is—and should be—high.</p>
<p>Innovative strategy therefore aims at creating a new business rather
than a new prod- uct within an already established line. It aims at
creating new performance capacity rather than improvement. It aims at
creating new concepts of what is value rather than satisfying existing
value expectations a little better. The aim of innovating efforts is to
make a sig- nificant difference. What is significantly different is not
a technical decision. It is not the quality of science that makes the
difference. It is not how expensive an undertaking it is or how hard it
is to bring it about. The significant difference lies in the impact on
the envi- ronment.</p>
<p>*This point has been made with great force by Michael J. Kami, who
served successively as head of long-range planning for IBM and Xerox.
See his essay, “Business Planning and Business Opportunity,” in Peter F.
Drucker, ed., Preparing Tomorrow’s Business Leaders Today.</p>
<p>“Success” in innovating efforts is a batting average of one out of
ten. This is, of course, the reason for aiming high in innovative
efforts. The one winner has to make up for the nine losers and has to
produce its own results.</p>
<p>Bernard Baruch is mostly remembered today as the head of the U.S. war
economy in World War I and the friend, confidant, and advisor of
presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Harry Truman. But before Baruch became
America’s elder statesman, he had amassed a very sizable fortune as a
venture capitalist. While other financiers of his era, the thirty years
before World War I, speculated in real estate and railroad bonds, Baruch
looked for new and innovative businesses. He knew apparently little
about technology—or at least affected ignorance. He invested in the man
rather than in the idea. And he invested at the very early stage at
which the budding business, as a rule, did not need much money be- yond
a few years’ support for a man with an idea. He invested on the
principle that eight out of every ten investments would turn out
failures and would have to be written off. But he maintained—and his own
record proved him right—that if only two out of ten turned out to be
successful, he would reap a far larger harvest than the shrewdest
investor in al- ready existing businesses could possibly attain.</p>
<p>An innovation does not proceed in a nice linear progression. For a
good long time, sometimes for years, there is only effort and no
results. The first results are then usually meager. Indeed, the first
products are rarely what the customer will eventually buy. The first
markets are rarely the major markets. The first applications are rarely
the applica- tions that, in the end, will turn out to be the really
important ones.</p>
<p>The discussion of the social impacts of new technology (Chapter 25)
pointed out that the impacts of new technology are very difficult, and
sometimes impossible, to predict. But this difficulty extends to
everything connected with the truly new—as demonstrated by the example
(also given in Chapter 25) of the gross miscalculation of the size of
the computer market in the thorough market-research study conducted
around 1950. But even more difficult to predict than the eventual
success of the genuinely new is the speed with which it will establish
itself. “Timing is of the essence”—above all in innovation. Yet timing
is totally incapable of being predicted. There are the computer, the
antibiotics, the Xerox machine—all innovations that swept the market.
But for every successful innova- tion that has results faster than
anyone anticipates, there are five or six others—in the end perhaps,
equally successful ones—which for long years seem to make only
frustratingly slow headway. The outstanding example may be the
steam-driven ship. By 1835 its supe- riority was clearly established;
but it did not replace the sailing ship until fifty years later. Indeed,
the “golden age of sail” in which the great clippers reached perfection
began only after the steamship had been fully developed. For almost half
a century, in other words, the steamship continued to be “tomorrow” and
never seemed to become “today.”</p>
<p>But then, after a long, frustrating period of gestation, the
successful innovation rises meteorically. It becomes within a few short
years a new major industry or a new major product line and market. But
until it has reached that point it cannot be predicted when it will take
off, nor indeed whether it ever will.</p>
<p>Measurements and Budgets</p>
<p>Innovation strategy requires different measurements and a different
use of budgets and budgetary controls from those appropriate to an
ongoing business.</p>
<p>To impose on innovating efforts the measurements, and especially the
accounting conventions that fit ongoing businesses, is misdirection. It
cripples the innovative effort the way putting a one-hundred-pound pack
would cripple a six-year-old going on a hike. And it also fails to give
true control. Finally, it may become a threat when the innovation
becomes successful. For then it needs controls that are appropriate to
rapid growth, that is, controls which show what efforts and investments
are needed to exploit success and prevent overextension.</p>
<p>The successfully innovating businesses learned this long ago. The
oldest, best-known, and most successful managerial control system is
probably that of the Du Pont Company,</p>
<p>which, as early as the 1920s, developed a model for all its
businesses focused on return on investment. But innovations were not
included in that famous model. As long as a busi- ness, a product line,
or a process was in the innovating stage, its capital allocation was not
included in the capital base on which the individual Du Pont division in
charge of the project had to earn a return. Nor were the expenses
included in its expense budget. Both were kept separate. Only after the
new product line had been introduced in the market and had been sold in
commercial quantities for two years or more were its measurements and
controls merged into the budget of the division responsible for the
development.</p>
<p>This made sure that division general managers did not resist
innovation as a threat to their earnings record and performance. It also
made sure that expenditures on, and in- vestments in, innovative efforts
could be tightly controlled. It made it possible to ask at every step,
“What do we expert at the end, and what is the risk factor, that is, the
likeli- hood of nonsuccess?” “Can we justify continuing this particular
innovative effort or not?”</p>
<p>Budgets for ongoing businesses and budgets for innovative efforts
should not only be kept separate, they should be treated differently. In
the ongoing business, the question is always “Is this effort necessary?
Or can we do without it?” And if the answer is “We need it,” one asks,
“What is the minimum level of support that is needed?”</p>
<p>In the innovative effort the first and most serious question is “Is
it the right opportu- nity?” And if the answer is yes, one asks, “What
is the maximum of good people and key resources which can productively
be put to work at this stage?”</p>
<p>A separate measurement system for innovative effort makes it possible
to appraise the three factors that determine innovative strategy: the
ultimate opportunity, the risk of fail- ure, and the effort and
expenditure needed. Otherwise, efforts will be continued or will even be
stepped up where the opportunity is quite limited while the risk of
nonsuccess is great.</p>
<p>Examples are the many broad-spectrum antibiotics produced with great
scientific in- genuity by pharmaceutical companies in the late sixties.
By then the probability of synthe- sizing a new broad-spectrum
antibiotic with properties significantly better than those al- ready on
the market had become fairly small. The risk of nonsuccess was high, in
other words. At the same time the opportunity had become much more
limited than ten years earlier. Even an antibiotic with significantly
better performance than the existing ones would have to compete against
perfectly good products with which the physicians were familiar and
which they had learned to use. Even a scientific breakthrough would in
all likelihood have produced a “me-too” product. At the same time, the
expenditure and ef- fort needed to find anything really new in a field
that had been worked over so thoroughly were rising fast. Traditional
market thinking, that is, thinking that looks at the size of the market
and deduces therefrom great success for a new product that is “better,”
would have been totally misleading—as indeed it misled a substantial
number of companies.</p>
<p>Nothing is therefore as inimical to successful innovation as a goal
of “5 percent growth in profits” every year. Innovations for the first
three or five years—some for longer—show no growth in profits. They do
not show any profits at all. And then their growth rate for five to ten
years should be closer to 40 percent a year than to 5 percent a year. It
is only after they have reached relative maturity that they can be
expected to grow year by year by a small percentage. But then they are
no longer innovations.</p>
<p>Innovative strategy, therefore, requires a high degree of discipline
on the part of the innovator. He has to operate without the crutch of
the conventional budget and accounting measures which feed back fairly
fast and reasonably reliable information from current results to efforts
and investments. The temptation is to keep on pouring people and money
into innovative efforts without any results. It is therefore important
in managing innova- tion to think through what one expects, and when.
Inevitably, these expectations are changed by events. But unless there
are intermediate results, specific progress, “fallouts” to actual
operation along the way, the innovation is not being managed.</p>
<p>When Du Pont engaged, in the late twenties, in the polymer research
that eventually led to nylon more than ten years later, no one was
willing or able to predict whether mas- tery of polymer technology would
lead to synthetic rubber, to textile fibers, to synthetic</p>
<p>leathers, or to new lubricants. (In the end, of course, it 1ed to all
of them.) It was not until fairly close to the end of the work that it
became clear that synthetic fiber would be the first major commercial
product. But from the beginning Du Pont, together with Dr. Car- rothers,
the research scientist in charge, systematically laid out a road map of
what kind of findings and results could be expected and when. This map
was changed every two or three years as results came in. But it was
always redrawn again for the next stages along the road. And only when
he came up with polymer fibers, which then made large-scale development
work possible, did Du Pont commit itself to massive investment. Until
then, the total cost was essentially the cost of supporting Carrothers
and a few assistants.</p>
<p>The Risk of Failure</p>
<p>A strategy for innovation has to be based on clear acceptance of the
risk of failure—and of the perhaps more dangerous risk of
“near-success.”</p>
<p>It is as important to decide when to abandon an innovative effort as
it is to know which one to start. In fact, it may be more important.
Successful laboratory directors know when to abandon a line of research
which does not yield the expected results. The less successful ones keep
hoping against hope, are dazzled by the “scientific challenge” of a
project, or are fooled by the scientists’ repeated promise of a
“breakthrough next year.” And the unsuccessful ones cannot abandon a
project and cannot admit that what seemed like a good idea has turned
into a waste of men, time, and money.</p>
<p>But a fair number of innovative efforts end up in near-success rather
than in success or failure. And near-success can be more dangerous than
failure. There is, again and again, the product or the process that was
innovated with the expectation that it would “revolu- tionize” the
industry only to have it become a minor addition to the product line,
neither enough of a failure to be abandoned nor enough of a success to
make a difference. There is the innovation which looks so “exciting”
when work on it is begun, only to be over- taken, during its gestation
period, by a more innovative process, product, or service. There is the
innovation which was meant to become a “household word” that ends up as
another “specialty” which a few customers are willing to buy but not
willing to pay for.</p>
<p>It is therefore particularly important in managing innovation to
think through and to write out one’s expectations. And then, once the
innovation has become a product, a process, or a busincss, one compares
one’s expectations to reality. If reality is signifi- cantly below
expectations, one does not pour in more men or more money. One rather
asks, “Should we not go out of this, and how?”</p>
<p>Bernard Baruch knew this seventy years ago. When asked whether there
were not in- vestments in innovations that were neither great successes
nor great failures, he is re- ported to have answered, “Of course—but
those I sell as early as possible and for what- ever I can get.” He then
added, “In my early days those were the ventures on which I spent all my
time. I always thought I could turn them around and make them the
success we had originally expected. It never worked. But I found that I
missed the real opportuni- ties and that I misallocated my money by
putting it into ‘sound investments,’ rather than into the big
opportunities of the future.”</p>
<p>The Innovative Attitude</p>
<p>Resistance to change, by executives and workers alike, has for many
years been consid- ered a central problem of management. Countless books
and articles have been written on the subject. Countless seminars,
discussions, and courses have been devoted to it. Yet it is questionable
that much progress has been made in resolving the problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is incapable of being resolved as long as we talk of
“resistance to change.”</p>
<p>Not that there is no such resistance, or that it is not a major
obstacle. But to focus on re- sistance to change is to misdefine the
problem in a way that makes it less, rather than more, tractable. The
right way to define the problem so as to make it capable of resolution
is as a challenge to create, build, and maintain the innovative
organization, the organiza- tion for which change is norm rather than
exception, and opportunity rather than threat.</p>
<p>Innovation is, therefore, attitude and practices. It is, above all,
top-management attitude and practices. The innovative organization casts
top management into a different role and embodies a different concept of
top management’s relationship to the organization.</p>
<p>In the traditional managerial organization such as management texts
discuss, top man- agement is final judge. This means, in effect, that
management’s most important power is the veto power, and its most
important role is to say no to proposals and ideas that are not
completely thought through and worked out. This concept is caricatured
in that well- known jingle composed many years ago by a senior Unilever
executive.</p>
<p>Along this tree</p>
<p>From root to crown</p>
<p>Ideas flow up</p>
<p>And vetoes down.</p>
<p>In the innovative organization, the first and most important job of
management is the opposite: it is to convert impractical, half-baked,
and wild ideas into concrete innovative reality. In the innovative
organization, top management sees it as its job to listen to ideas</p>
<p>and to take them seriously. Top management, in the innovative
organization, knows that new ideas are always “impractical.” It also
knows that it takes a great many silly ideas to spawn one viable one,
and that in the early stages there is no way of telling the silly idea
from the stroke of genius. Both look equally impossible or equally
brilliant.</p>
<p>Top management in the innovative organization, therefore, not only
“encourages”</p>
<p>ideas, as all managements are told to do. It asks continuously, “What
would this idea have to be like to be practical, realistic, effective?”
It organizes itself to think through rapidly even the wildest and
apparently silliest idea for something new to the point where its fea-
sibility can be appraised.</p>
<p>Top management in the innovative organization is the major “drive”
for innovation. It uses the ideas of the organization as stimuli to its
own vision. And then it works to make ideas a concern of the entire
organization. Top management in the innovative organiza- tion fashions
thought and work on the new into both organizational energy and
entrepre- neurial discipline.</p>
<p>This, however, presupposes restructuring relations between top
management and the human group within the enterprise. The traditional
organization, of course, remains. In- deed, on the organization chart
there may be little to distinguish the innovative organiza- tion from
the most rigidly bureaucratic one. And an innovative organization need
not be “permissive” or “democratic” at all. But the innovative
organization builds, so to speak, a nervous system next to the bony
skeleton of the formal organization. Where traditional organization is
focused on the logic of the work, there is also an additional
relationship focused on the logic of ideas.</p>
<p>In innovative companies (as has been mentioned before) senior
executives typically make it their business to meet with the younger men
throughout the organization in scheduled (though not necessarily
regular) sessions in which there is no “agenda” for top management.
Rather, the seniors sit down with the younger men and ask, “What
opportu- nities do you see?”</p>
<p>In the period of its greatest growth and development, the 3M Company
was anything but a permissive company. It was tightly run by two or
three men at the top who made all the decisions. But even the most
junior engineer was encouraged, indeed practically commanded, to come to
the top-management people with any idea, no matter how wild. And again
and again he would be told, “The idea makes no sense to me; but are you
will- ing to work on it?” If the engineer said yes, he would then be
asked to write up his idea, together with a budget request—and more
often than not he would be freed from his other responsibilities, given
a modest sum of money for a year or two, and told to go ahead. As a
result, the company grew from a small and obscure producer of abrasives
into one of America’s largest businesses.</p>
<p>Yet the young engineers at 3M were held strictly accountable. Not all
of them suc- ceeded, of course. Indeed, only one or two out of every ten
did. And failure of an idea was not held against them—at least, not the
first time. But failure to take responsibility, to organize the task, to
work at it, and to appraise progress realistically—let alone to keep top
management fully informed of the progress of the project—was not
tolerated.</p>
<p>The innovative organization requires a learning atmosphere throughout
the entire business. It creates and maintains continuous learning. No
one is allowed to consider him- self “finished” at any time. Learning is
a continuing process for all members of the or- ganization.</p>
<p>Resistance to change is grounded in ignorance and in fear of the
unknown. Change has to be seen as opportunity by people—and then there
will be no fear. It is seen as opportu- nity by the Japanese because
they are guaranteed their jobs and are not afraid of putting themselves
or their colleagues out of work by proposing something new (see Chapter
20). But fear and ignorance are also overcome in Japan by making
continuing change the op- portunity for personal achievement, for
recognition, for satisfaction. The man who in a Japanese training
session comes up with a new idea receives no monetary reward, even if
his idea is a big and profitable one. But even if it is a very small
improvement he derives stature, recognition, intense pleasure.</p>
<p>We need not go to Japan to learn this. Every one of the “suggestion
systems” that are so widely used in American business teaches the same
lesson. The suggestion system in which the reward is recognition,
achievement, participation, is the successful system. And in those
departments in a plant where the suggestion system is being run this
way, there is very little resistance to change, despite fears for job
security and union restrictions. Where this does not prevail—as in the
great majority—the suggestion system is not a suc- cess, no matter how
well it pays for successful suggestions. It also has none of the effect
on worker behavior and attitude which the proponents of the suggestion
system promise.</p>
<p>Structure for Innovation</p>
<p>The search for innovation needs to be organized separately and
outside of the ongoing managerial business. Innovative organizations
realize that one cannot simultaneously cre- ate the new and take care of
what one already has. They realize that maintenance of the present
business is far too big a task for the people in it to have much time
for creating the new, the different business of tomorrow. They also
realize that taking care of tomorrow is far too big and difficult a task
to be diluted with concern for today. Both tasks have to be done. But
they are different.</p>
<p>Innovative organizations, therefore, put the new into separate
organizational compo- nents concerned with the creation of the new.</p>
<p>The oldest example is probably the development department at E. I. du
Pont de Ne- mours in Wilmington, founded in the early twenties. This
unit is concerned exclusively with the making of tomorrow. It is not a
research department—Du Pont has a separate, big research lab. The job of
the development department is to develop new businesses; production,
finance, and marketing are as much its concern as technology, products,
and processes. 3M, too, has set up a separate business development lab
in parallel with, but separate from, its research labs.</p>
<p>This was not understood in 1952 when the General Electric Company
embarked on its massive reorganization which then became the prototype
for major organization changes in large businesses around the world.
Under the GE plan the general manager of every “product business” was to
have responsibility for both the ongoing business in his charge and the
innovative efforts for tomorrow’s new and different business. This
seemed plausi- ble enough. Indeed it seemed an inescapable conclusion
from the idea that the general manager of a product business should, as
much as possible, behave like the chief execu- tive of an independent
business. But it did not work—the general managers did not inno-
vate.</p>
<p>One reason was the press of ongoing business. General managers had
neither the time nor the motivation to work on obsoleting what they were
managing. Another, equally im- portant reason was that true innovation
is rarely an extension of the already existing busi- ness. It rarely
fits into the scope, objectives, goals, technologies or processes of
today. But, of course, one can define only the scope, products,
technologies, processes—even the markets—of today. The most important
innovative opportunities always fall outside existing definitions—and
thereby outside the “assigned scope” of an existing decentral- ized
product business. After ten years or so GE began to draw the proper
conclusions from its frustrations and began to organize major innovation
separately and outside of existing product departments and product
divisions—and very similar to the way innova- tive efforts had been
organized at Du Pont for many years, that is, in a separate organiza-
tional “business development” unit.</p>
<p>Experience in public-service institutions also indicates that
innovative efforts best be organized separately and outside of existing
managerial organization.</p>
<p>The greater innovative capacity of the American university as
compared to the univer- sities of continental Europe has often been
remarked upon. The main reason is clearly not that American academicians
are less resistant to change. It is the ease with which the American
university can set up a new department, a new faculty, or even an
entirely new school to do new things. The European university, by
contrast, tends to be compelled by law and tradition to set up a new
activity within an already existing department or faculty. This not only
creates immediately a “war of the ancients against the moderns” in which
the new is fought as a threat by the established disciplines. It also
deprives the new, as a rule, of the resources needed to innovate
successfully. The ablest of the young scholars, for instance, will be
under great pressure to stick to the “safe” traditional fields which
still control the opportunities for promotion. For significant
innovation to move fast in the European academic setting usually
requires “break-away institutions.” The great age of English physics and
chemistry in the late seventeenth century was ushered in by setting up
the Royal Academy outside the established university system. More than
two hundred years later, a similar break-away institution, the London
School of Economics, created the opportunity for genuine innovation in
teaching—and learning—in the economic and so- cial fields. In France,
Napoleon systematically set up the grandes écoles such as the École
Polytechnique and the École Normale outside the university system as
vehicles for inno- vation in learning and research, e.g., to make
effective the then brand-new idea that teach- ers needed training and
could actually be trained. And one of the main reasons why the Germans,
in the decade before World War I, set up the separate scientific
research insti- tutes of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (now Max-Planck
Gesellschaft) was to gain freedom to develop new disciplines and new
approaches in old disciplines, that is, to gain freedom for
innovation.</p>
<p>Similarly the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, as
well as CERN, the European nuclear-research facility, were set up
outside the existing academic and governmental structures precisely
because their purpose was to be innovation.</p>
<p>Innovation as a “Business”</p>
<p>At the same time, the innovative organizations realize that
innovation needs from the be- ginning to be organized as a “business”
rather than as a “function.” In concrete terms, this means setting aside
the traditional time sequence in which “research” comes first, fol-
lowed by “development,” followed by “manufacturing,” with “marketing” at
the very end. The innovative organizations consider these functional
skills as part of one and the same process, the process of developing a
new business. When and how each of these tools is to be put into play is
decided by the logic of the situation rather than by any preconceived
time sequence.</p>
<p>A project manager or business manager is therefore put in charge of
anything new as soon as it is decided to pay attention to it. He may
come from any function—or from no function at all. And he can draw on
all the functions right from the beginning; use market-</p>
<p>ing, for instance, before there is any research; or work out the
financial requirements of a future business before he even knows whether
he will have products.</p>
<p>The traditional functions organize work from where we are today to
where we are go- ing. The innovative function organizes work from where
we want to be, back to what we now have to do in order to get there.</p>
<p>The design principle for innovation is the team, set up outside of
existing structures, that is, as an “autonomous unit.” It is not a
“decentralized business” in the traditional sense of the word, but it
has to be autonomous and separate from operating organizations.</p>
<p>One way to organize innovative units within a large business might
well be to group them together into an innovative group, which reports
to one member of top management who has no other function but to guide,
help, advise, review, and direct the innovating team at work. This is,
in effect, what the Du Pont development department is. Innovation has
its own logic, which is different from the logic of an ongoing business.
No matter how much the innovative units may themselves differ in their
technologies, their markets, their products, or their services, they all
have in common that they are innovative.</p>
<p>Even such autonomous team organization may be too restricted for the
kind of innova- tion that will increasingly be needed, innovation in
fields that are quite different from anything that business has done so
far. We may need to set up the innovating unit as a genuine
entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Several large companies in the United States, e.g., GE and
Westinghouse—and also several large companies in Europe—have set up
innovative efforts in the form of partner- ships with the
“entrepreneurs” in charge. The innovative effort is organized as a
separate company, in which the parent company has majority control and
usually a right to buy out the minority stockholders at some prearranged
price. But the entrepreneurs, that is, the people who are responsible
directly for developing the innovation, are substantial share- holders
in their own right.</p>
<p>One advantage of such a relationship is that it eases the
compensation problem. Inno- vative people can command substantial
salaries in the managerial organization, as senior research scientists
or as senior marketing people. Yet it is highly undesirable to saddle an
innovative venture with high salary costs—it cannot afford them. At the
same time, it is highly desirable to compensate the entrepreneurs for
results. But results in the innovative effort are unlikely to be known
for a good many years. A method of compensation which induces these
entrepreneurs to work for modest salaries until results are achieved,
while promising substantial rewards in case of success, is therefore
appropriate. A “partnership” makes this possible. It also—and this is no
small advantage—lessens (although it never completely eliminates) the
friction which setting up separate innovative organizations within the
company structure otherwise creates.</p>
<p>The same results, however, can also be achieved without a
partnership—provided the tax laws permit it (which, in many countries,
they no longer do). 3M, for instance, never organized a partnership with
its young engineers heading a project team. It never set up a separate
corporation in which the entrepreneurs became shareholders. Still, the
salaries of the entrepreneurs were kept low until the innovation had
proven itself and had become successful. And then the entrepreneurs not
only had the opportunity to stay on and man- age what they had created,
at salaries commensurate to the size and performance of the business
they had built, they also received handsome bonuses.</p>
<p>Whether these “confederations” in which the entrepreneurs become
partners and shareholders will become general will depend as much on tax
laws as on economics or organization structure. The principle, however,
is important: compensation of the innova- tors should be appropriate to
the economic reality of the innovating process. This is a process in
which the risks are high, the lead time long, and the rewards, in case
of success, very great.</p>
<p>Whether the innovating team is a separate company or simply a
separate unit, an inno- vating company is likely to apply some of the
design principles of systems management. There will be managerial units
engaged in managing what is already known and what is already being
done. And there will be innovative units, separate from them, working
with</p>
<p>them but also working on their own, and charged with their own
responsibility. Both will have to report independently of each other to
the top-management group and work with top-management people. To
innovate within existing organizations will require accep- tance of a
hybrid and rather complex organization design. It is neither centralized
nor decentralized. Within such a company, functional organization,
federal decentralization, simulated decentralization, and teams may all
be found next to each other and working together.</p>
<p>The innovative organization, the organization that resists stagnation
rather than change, is a major challenge to management, private and
public. That such organizations are possi- ble, we can assert with
confidence; there are enough of them around. But how to make such
organizations general, how to make them productive for society, economy,
and indi- vidual alike, is still largely an unsolved task. There is
every indication that the period ahead will be an innovative one; one of
rapid change in technology, society, economy, and institutions. There is
every indication, therefore, that the innovative organization will have
to be developed into a central institution for the last quarter of the
twentieth century.</p>
