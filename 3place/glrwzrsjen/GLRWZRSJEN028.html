<h4 id="the-limits-of-social-responsibility">26 The Limits of Social
Responsibility</h4>
<p>Management’s First Responsibility: Its Own Institution—The Need to
Know Minimum Profitability Requirements—To “Do Good” and to “Do
Well”—The Limits of Com- petence—The Limitations of One’s Value
System—The Areas of Incompetence—The Limits of Authority—No
Responsibility without Authority—When to Say No—The Commitment to
Working Out Alternatives—The Limits of Social Responsibility as a
Central Problem to Management and to the Society of Organizations</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE MANAGER IS A SERVANT. His master is the institution he manages and
his first responsibility must therefore be to it. His first task is to
make the institution, whether business, hospital, school, or university,
perform the function and make the contribution for the sake of which it
exists. The man who uses his position at the head of a major institution
to become a public figure and to take leadership with respect to social
problems, while his company or his university erodes through neglect, is
not a statesman. He is irresponsible and false to his trust.</p>
<p>The institution’s performance of its specific mission is also
society’s first need and in- terest. Society does not stand to gain but
to lose if the performance capacity of the institu- tion in its own
specific task is diminished or impaired. Performance of its function is
the institution’s first social responsibility. Unless it discharges its
performance responsibly, it cannot discharge anything else. A bankrupt
business is not a desirable employer and is unlikely to be a good
neighbor in a community. Nor will it create the capital for tomor- row’s
jobs and the opportunities for tomorrow’s workers. A university which
fails to pre- pare tomorrow’s leaders and professionals is not socially
responsible, no matter how many “good works” it engages in.</p>
<p>The first “limitation” on social responsibility is, therefore, the
higher responsibility for the specific performance of the institution
which is the manager’s master. This needs par- ticular stress with
respect to the business enterprise, the economic institution of society.
Any solution of a social impact or of a social problem except to make it
into an opportu- nity for performance and results creates social
overhead costs. These costs cannot be borne out of profits, no matter
what popular rhetoric may say. They are paid for either out of current
costs—that is, by consumer or taxpayer—or they are paid for out of
capital— that is, by fewer and poorer jobs tomorrow and impaired
standards of living. The only way to cover ccsts and to accumulate
capital is through economic performance. All other satisfactions of
society are being paid for, one way or another, out of the surplus
between current production and current consumption, that is, out of the
surplus of the economy.</p>
<p>This again underscores the responsibility of managers to anticipate
problems and to think through the trade-offs involved in their
solutions. At what point does a solution be- come prohibitively
expensive for society because it impairs the performance capacity of
existing and needed institutions, whether of the economy, of health
care, of education, or of the military? What is the optimal balance
between the need to take care of a social problem and the need to
preserve the performance capacity of the existing social institu-</p>
<p>tions? And at what point does one risk losing social performance—and
thereby creating new and bigger problems—by overloading the existing
institutions? At what point do we achieve the best balance between the
old costs and the new benefits?</p>
<p>Managers need to be able to think through the limits on social
responsibility set by their duty to the performance capacity of the
enterprises in their charge.</p>
<p>In the case of the business enterprise this requires knowing the
objectives in the key areas (see Chapters 8 and 9). For these objectives
set the minimum performance goals for the attainment of the enterprise’s
mission. As long as they can be attained, the enterprise can perform. If
the objective in any one area is seriously jeopardized, the performance
capacity of the entire business is endangered.</p>
<p>Above all, management needs to know the minimum profitability
required by the risks of the business and by its commitments to the
future. It needs this knowledge for its own decisions. But it needs it
just as much to explain its decisions to others—the politicians, the
press, the public. As long as managements remain the prisoners of their
own ignorance of the objective need for, and function of, profit—i.e. as
long as they think and argue in terms of the “profit motive”—they will
be able neither to make rational decisions with respect to social
responsibilities, nor to explain these decisions to others inside and
out- side the business.</p>
<p>A popular pun these days says, “It is not enough for business to do
well; it must also do good.” But in order to “do good,” a business must
first “do well” (and indeed “do very</p>
<p>well”).</p>
<p>Whenever a business has disregarded the limitation of economic
performance and has assumed social responsibilities which it could not
support economically it has soon gotten</p>
<p>into trouble.</p>
<p>Union Carbide was not socially responsible when it put its plant into
Vienna, West Virginia, to alleviate unemployment there. It was, in fact,
irresponsible. The plant was marginal to begin with. The process was
obsolescent. At best the plant could barely keep its head above water.
And this, inevitably, meant a plant unable to take on social respon-
sibility, even for its own impacts. Because the plant was uneconomical
to begin with, Un- ion Carbide resisted so long all demands to clean it
up. This particular demand could not have been foreseen in the late
1940s when concern with jobs far outweighed any concern for the
environment. But demands of some kind can always be expected. To do
something out of social responsibility which is economically irrational
and untenable is therefore never responsible. It is sentimental. The
result is always greater damage.</p>
<p>Similarly, Deltec in Buenos Aires may be vulnerable to the charge
that to keep a plant open when every other major meat-packer had reached
the conclusion that the business could not survive was sentimentality
rather than social responsibility. It was an assump- tion of
responsibility beyond tenable limits. The intentions were good and
honorable—as in Union Carbide’s case. It may be argued that Deltec took
a calculated risk. Also, the outcome was far more the result of internal
Argentinean politics than of anything Deltec did or omitted to do. Yet
Deltec management took a greater risk than might be compatible with true
social responsibility.</p>
<p>The same limitation on social responsibility applies to non-economic
institutions.</p>
<p>There, too, the manager is duty-bound to preserve the performance
capacity of the institu- tion in his care. To jeopardize it, no matter
how noble the motive, is irresponsibility. These institutions too are
capital assets of society on the performance of which society
depends.</p>
<p>This, to be sure, is a very unpopular position to take. It is much
more popular to be “progressive.” But managers, and especially managers
of key institutions of society, are not being paid to be heroes to the
popular press. They are being paid for performance and
responsibility.</p>
<p>The Limits of Competence</p>
<p>To take on tasks for which one lacks competence is irresponsible
behavior. It is also cruel. It raises expectations which will then be
disappointed.</p>
<p>In particular an institution better refrain from tackling tasks which
do not fit into its value system (on this see also Chapter 58, “Managing
Diversity). Skills and knowledge are fairly easily acquired. But one
cannot easily change personality. No one is likely to do well in areas
which he does not respect. If a business or any other institution
tackles such an area because there is a social need, it is unlikely to
put its good people on the task and to support them adequately. It is
unlikely to understand what the task involves. It is almost certain to
do the wrong things. As a result, it will do damage rather than
good.</p>
<p>What not to do was demonstrated when the American universities in the
sixties rushed into taking social responsibility for the problems of the
big city. These problems are rea1 enough. And within the university were
to be found able scholars in a variety of areas with relevance to the
problems. Yet the tasks were primarily political tasks. The values
involved were those of the politician rather than the scholar. The
skills needed were those of compromise, of mobilizing energies, and
above all, of setting priorities. And these are not skills which the
academician admires and respects, let alone excels in. They are al- most
the opposite of the objectivity and the “finding of truth” which
constitute excellence in academia. These tasks exceeded the competence
of the university and were incompati- ble with its value system.</p>
<p>The result of the universities’ eager acceptance of these tasks was
therefore, inevita- bly, lack of performance and results. It was also
damage to the prestige and standing of the university, and to its
credibility. The universities did not help the problems of the city; but
they seriously impaired their own performance capacity in their own
area.</p>
<p>The major corporations in New York City would have acted totally
irresponsibly had they responded to Mayor Lindsay’s call to “adopt the
Black ghetto.” All they could have done (as they apparently realized)
was damage—to the ghetto and to themselves.</p>
<p>What the limits of competence depends in part on circumstances. If a
member of a climbing team develops acute appendicitis in the high
Himalayas and is almost certain to die unless operated on, any medical
man in the group will operate, even though he may be a dermatologist who
has never done a single operation in his life. The dermatologist, though
a qualified physician, will be considered irresponsible and vulnerable
to both a malpractice suit and a conviction for manslaughter, should he
operate on an appendix in a place where a qualified surgeon, or even a
general practitioner, are within reach.</p>
<p>Management therefore needs to know at the very least what it and its
institution are truly incompetent for. Business, as a rule, will be in
this position of absolute incompe- tence in an “intangible” area. The
strength of business is accountability and measurability. It is the
discipline of market test, productivity measurements, and profitability
require- ment. Where these are lacking businesses are essentially out of
their depth. They are also out of fundamental sympathy, that is, outside
their own value systems. Where the criteria of performance are
intangible, such as “political” opinions and emotions, community ap-
proval or disapproval, mobilization of community energies and
structuring of power rela- tions, business is unlikely to feel
comfortable. It is unlikely to have respect for the values that matter.
It is, therefore, most unlikely to have competence.</p>
<p>In such areas it is, however, often possible to define goals clearly
and measurably for specific partial tasks. It is often possible to
convert parts of a problem that by itself lies outside the competence of
business into work that fits the competence and value system of the
business enterprise.</p>
<p>No one in America has done very well in training hard-core
unemployable Black teen- agers for work and jobs. But business has done
far less badly than any other institution: schools, government programs,
community agencies. This task can be identified. It can be</p>
<p>defined. Goals can be set. And performance can be measured. And then
business can per- form.</p>
<p>Before acceding to the demand that it take on this or that social
responsibility, and go to work on this or that problem, management
better think through what, if any, part of the task can be made to fit
the competence of its institution. Is there any area which can be
defined in terms of tangible goals and measurable performance—as
business managers understand these slippery terms? If the answer is yes,
one is justified in thinking seriously about one’s social
responsibility. But when the answer is no—and this will be the answer in
a good many areas—business enterprise better resist, no matter how
important the problem and how urgent the demand for business to take it
over. It can only do harm to society and to itself. It cannot perform
and therefore cannot be responsible.</p>
<p>The Limits of Authority</p>
<p>The most important limitation on social responsibility is the
limitation of authority. The constitutional lawyer knows that there is
no such word as “responsibility” in the political dictionary. The term
is “responsibility and authority.” Whoever claims authority thereby
assumes responsibility. But whoever assumes responsibility thereby
claims authority. The two are but different sides of the same coin. To
assume social responsibility therefore always means to claim
authority.</p>
<p>Again, the question of authority as a limit on social responsibility
does not arise in connection with the impacts of an institution. For the
impact is the result of an exercise of authority, even though purely
incidental and unintended. And then responsibility follows.</p>
<p>But where business or any other institution of our society of
organizations is asked to assume social responsibility for one of the
problems or ills of society and community, management needs to think
through whether the authority implied in the responsibility is
legitimate. Otherwise it is usurpation and irresponsible.</p>
<p>Every time the demand is made that business take responsibility for
this or that, one should ask, “Does business have the authority and
should it have it?” If business does not have and should not have
authority—and in a great many areas it should not have it—then
responsibility on the part of business should be treated with grave
suspicion. It is not re- sponsibility; it is lust for power.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman’s position (see Chapter 24) that business should
stick to its business, that is, to the economic sphere, is not a denial
of responsibility. It is indeed the only con- sistent position in a free
society. It can be argued with great force that any other position can
only undermine and compromise a free society. Any other position can
only mean that business will take over power, authority, and
decision-making in areas outside of the eco- nomic sphere, in areas
which are or should be reserved to government or to the individual or to
other institutions. For, to repeat, whoever assumes responsibility will
soon have to be given the authority. History amply proves this.</p>
<p>From this point of view the present “critics” of big business can
rightly be accused of pushing big business into becoming our master.</p>
<p>Ralph Nader, the American consumerist, sincerely considers himself a
foe of big busi- ness and is accepted as such by business and by the
general public. Insofar as Nader de- mands that business take
responsibility for product quality and product safety, he is surely
concerned with legitimate business responsibility, i.e., with
responsibility for performance and contribution. The only question—apart
from the accuracy of his facts and the style of his campaign—would be
whether Nader’s demand for perfection is not going to cost the consumer
far more than the shortcomings and deficiencies which Nader assails. The
only questions are the trade-offs.</p>
<p>But Ralph Nader demands, above all, that big business assume
responsibility in a mul- titude of areas beyond products and services.
This, if acceded to, can lead only to the emergence of the managements
of the big corporations as the ultimate power in a vast number of areas
that are properly some other institution’s field.</p>
<p>And this is, indeed, the position to which Nader—and other advocates
of unlimited social responsibility—are moving rapidly. One of the Nader
task forces published in 1972 a critique of the Du Pont Company and its
role in the small state of Delaware, where Du Pont has its headquarters
and is a major employer. The report did not even discuss eco- nomic
performance; it dismissed as irrelevant that Du Pont, in a period of
general infla- tion, consistently lowered the prices for its products,
which are, in many cases, basic ma- terials for the American economy.
Instead it sharply criticized Du Pont for not using its economic power
to force the citizens of the state to attack a number of social
problems, from racial discrimination to health care to public schools.
Du Pont, for not taking re- sponsibility for Delaware society, Delaware
politics, and Delaware law, was called grossly remiss in its social
responsibility.</p>
<p>One of the ironies of this story is that the traditional liberal or
left-wing criticism of the Du Pont Company for many years has been the
exact opposite, i.e., that Du Pont, by its very prominence in a small
state, “interferes in and dominates” Delaware and exercises
“illegitimate authority.”</p>
<p>The Nader line is only the best-publicized of the positions which,
under the cover of anti-business rhetoric, actually plead for a society
in which big business is the most pow- erful, the dominant, the ultimate
institution. Of course such an outcome is the opposite of what Nader
intends. But it would not be the first time that a demand for social
responsi- bility has had results opposite from those intended.</p>
<p>The most likely result of the Nader line neither he nor management
would want. It is either a destruction of all authority, that is,
complete irresponsibility. (A parallel would be the way in which the
demand that the barons of early feudal society take social responsi-
bility led around the year 1000 to the complete destruction of the
crown’s authority on the European continent and to the uncontrolled
despotism of the feudal grandees.) Or it is totalitarianism—another form
of irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Yet Milton Friedman’s “pure” position—to eschew all social
responsibility—is not tenable either. There are big, urgent, desperate
problems. Above all, there is the “sickness of government” which is
creating a vacuum of responsibility and performance—a vacuum that
becomes stronger the bigger government becomes. Business and the other
institutions of our society of organizations cannot be pure, however
desirable that may be. Their own self-interest alone forces them to be
concerned with society and community and to be prepared to shoulder
responsibility beyond their own main areas of task and responsibil-
ity.</p>
<p>But in doing this they have to be conscious of the danger—to
themselves and to soci- ety. They have to be conscious of the risk. No
pluralist society such as ours has become, has ever worked unless its
key institutions take responsibility for the common good. But at the
same time, the perennial threat to a pluralist society is the
all-too-easy confusion between the common good and one’s own lust for
power.</p>
<p>In a few areas guidelines can be developed. It is not the task of
business (or of the university) to substitute its authority for that of
the duly constituted political sovereign, the government, in areas that
are clearly national policy. In a free society a business is, of course,
entitled not to engage in activities, even though they are sanctioned
and even en- couraged by governmental policy. It can stay out. But it is
surely not entitled to put itself in the place of government. And it is
not entitled to use its economic power to impose its values on the
community.</p>
<p>By these criteria, the Quaker sage who chided his friend the
steel-mill manager (see Chapter 24) for using the economic power of a
big company to impose a little racial jus- tice on a southern U.S. city
in the 1940s was right. That the end was surely right and moral does not
sanction the means, that is, the exercise of an authority which a
business does not possess. This is as much “imperialism” as any which
the most fervent believer in racial equality denounces. The steel
company can be faulted—deservedly so, I would say—for having done
nothing for long years to work toward the racial justice in which it
professed to believe. It can be faulted, and with cause, for not finding
whatever possibili-</p>
<p>ties for racial justice could have been put into practice. But two
wrongs do not make a right, two examples of irresponsibility do not add
up to responsibility.</p>
<p>By these criteria also the demand that a Swedish company such as ASEA
stay out of a power project in a Portuguese colony in Africa which its
own Swedish socialist govern- ment supports is dubious in logic and in
ethics. A short time ago the “Old Left” used to criticize business as
immoral and irresponsible for sabotaging national policies the Old Left
approved of. It is just as immoral and irresponsible for business to
sabotage national policies of Old Left governments of which the New Left
does not approve.</p>
<p>When to Say No</p>
<p>Demands for social responsibility which in effect ask of business—or
any other institu- tion—that it usurp authority are to be resisted. They
are to be resisted in business’s own self-interest; the usurper’s power
is always shaky. They are to be resisted on grounds of true social
responsibility. For they are, in effect, demands for irresponsibility.
Whether they are made sincerely and out of honest anguish, or whether
they are rhetoric to cloak the lust for power, is irrelevant. Whenever
business, or any other of our institutions, is being asked to take
social responsibility beyond its own area of performance and its own
impact, it better ask itself, “Do we possess authority in the area and
should we have it?” And if the answer is no, then the socially
responsible thing is not to accede to the demand.</p>
<p>Yet in many cases it may not be enough to say no. Management must
resist responsi- bility for a social problem that would compromise or
impair the performance capacity of its business (or its university or
its hospital). It must resist when the demand goes beyond the
institution’s competence. It must resist when responsibility would, in
fact, be illegiti- mate authority. But then, if the problem is a real
one, it better think through and offer an alternative approach. If the
problem is serious, something will ultimately have to be done about it.
And if management then has been purely obstructionist and has blocked
any ap- proach—even though its objection to any one proposed course of
action was legitimate and indeed responsible—the ultimate solution is
likely to do even more damage.</p>
<p>In a pluralist society responsibility for the common good is a
central problem that is never solved. The only way concern for social
responsibility could disappear would be for society to become
totalitarian. For it is the definition of a totalitarian government that
it has authority over everything and responsibility for nothing.</p>
<p>For this reason managements of al1 major institutions, including
business enterprise, need too to concern themselves with serious ills of
society. If at all possible they convert solution of these problems into
an opportunity for performance and contribution. At the least they think
through what the problem is and how it might be tackled. They cannot
escape concern; for this society of organizations has no one else to be
concerned about real problems. In this society managers of institutions
are the leadership group.</p>
<p>But we also know that a developed society needs performing
institutions with their own autonomous management. It cannot function as
a totalitarian society. Indeed, what characterizes a developed
society—and indeed makes it a developed one—is that most of its social
tasks are carried out in and through organized institutions, each with
its own autonomous management. These organizations, including most of
the agencies of our government, are special-purpose institutions. They
are organs of our society for specific performance in a specific area.
The greatest contribution they can make, their greatest social
responsibility, is performance of their function. The greatest social
irresponsibility is to impair the performance capacity of these
institutions by tackling tasks beyond their competence or by usurpation
of authority in the name of social responsibility.</p>
