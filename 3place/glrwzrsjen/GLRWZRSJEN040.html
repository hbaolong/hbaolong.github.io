<p>W</p>
<p>E HAVE MORE ATTEMPTS at communications today, that is, more attempts
to talk to others, and a surfeit of communications media, unimaginable
to the men who, around the time of World War I, started to work on the
problems of commu- nicating in organizations. Communications in
management has become a central concern to students and practitioners in
all institutions—business, the military, public administra- tion,
hospital, university, and research. In no other area have intelligent
men and women worked harder or with greater dedication than
psychologists, human relations experts, managers, and management
students have worked on improving communications in our major
institutions.</p>
<p>Yet communications has proven as elusive as the Unicorn. The noise
level has gone up so fast that no one can really listen any more to all
that babble about communications. But there is clearly less and less
communicating. The communications gap within institu- tions and between
groups in society has been widening steadily—to the point where it
threatens to become an unbridgeable gulf of total misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is an information explosion. Every
professional and every ex- ecutive—in fact, everyone except the deaf
mute—suddenly has access to data in, inex- haustible abundance. All of
us feel—and overeat—very much like the little boy who has been left
alone in the candy store. But what has to be done to make this
cornucopia of data redound to information, let alone to knowledge? We
get a great many answers. But the one thing clear so far is that no one
really has an answer. Despite information theory and data processing, no
one yet has actually seen, let adone used, an “information sys- tem,” or
a “data base.” The one thing we do know, though, is that the abundance
of in- formation changes the communications problem and makes it both
more urgent and even less tractable.</p>
<p>There is a tendency today to give up on communications. In
psychology, for instance, the fashion today is the T-group with its
sensitivity training. The avowed aim is not commu- nications, but
self-awareness. T-groups focus on the “I” and not on the “Thou.” Ten or
twenty years ago the rhetoric stressed “empathy”; now it, stresses
“doing one’s thing.” However needed self-knowledge may be, communication
is needed at least as much (if</p>
<p>indeed self-knowledge is possible without action on others, that is,
without communica- tions).</p>
<p>Despite the sorry state of communications in theory and practice, we
have learned a good deal about information and communications. Most of
it, though, has not come out of the work on communications to which we
have devoted so much time and energy. It has been the by-product of work
in a large number of seemingly unrelated fields, from learn- ing theory
to genetics and electronic engineering. We equally have a lot of
experience— though mostly of failure—in a good many practical situations
in all kinds of institutions. We may indeed never understand
“communications.” But “communications in organiza- tions”—call it
managerial communications—we do know something about by now.</p>
<p>We are, to be sure, still far away from mastery of communications,
even in organiza- tions. What knowledge we have about communications is
scattered and, as a rule, not accessible, let alone in applicable form.
But at least we increasingly know what does not work, and, sometimes,
why it does not work. Indeed we can say bluntly that most of to- day’s
brave attempts at communication in organizations—whether business, labor
unions, government agencies, or universities—is based on assumptions
that have been proven to be invalid—and that, therefore, these efforts
cannot have results. And perhaps we can even anticipate what might
work.</p>
<p>What We Have Learned</p>
<p>We have learned, mostly through doing the wrong things, four
fundamentals of communi- cations.</p>
<p>1 Communication is perception.</p>
<p>2 Communication is expectation.</p>
<p>3 Communication makes demands.</p>
<p>4 Communication and information are different and indeed largely
opposite— yet interdependent.</p>
<p>tion.</p>
<p>This may seem trite; after all, the mystics of old already knew this,
for they too always answered that there is no sound unless someone can
hear it. Yet the implications of this rather trite statement are great
indeed.</p>
<p>First, it means that it is the recipient who communicates. The
so-called communicator, the person who emits the communication, does not
communicate. He utters. Unless there is someone who hears, there is no
communication. There is only noise. The communicator speaks or writes or
sings—but he does not communicate. Indeed, he cannot communicate. He can
only make it possible, or impossible, for a recipient—or rather,
“percipient”—to perceive.</p>
<p>Perception, we know, is not logic. It is experience. This means, in
the first place, that one always perceives a configuration. One cannot
perceive single specifics. They are al- ways part of a total picture.
The “silent language,”* that is, the gestures, the tone of voice, the
environment altogether, not to mention the cultural and social
referents, cannot be dissociated from the spoken language. In fact,
without them the spoken word has no meaning , and cannot
communicate.</p>
<p>*As Edward T. Hall called it in the title of his pioneering work
(Doubleday, 1959).</p>
<p>It is not only that the same words, e.g., “I enjoyed meeting you,”
will be heard as hav- ing a wide variety of meanings. Whether they are
heard as warmth or as icy cold, as en- dearment or as rejection depends
on their setting in the “silent language,” such as the tone of voice or
the occasion. More important is that by itself, that is, without being
part of the total configuration of occasion, value, “silent language,”
and so on, the phrase has no meaning at all. By itself it cannot make
possible communication. It cannot be understood. Indeed it cannot be
heard. To paraphrase an old proverb of the human-relations school: One
cannot communicate a word; the whole man always comes with it.”</p>
<p>But we know about perception also that one can perceive only what one
is capable of perceiving. Just as the human ear does not hear sounds
above a certain pitch, so does hu- man perception altogether not
perceive what is beyond its range of perception. It may, of course, hear
physically, or see visually, but it cannot accept it. It cannot become
commu- nication.</p>
<p>This is a fancy way of stating something the teachers of rhetoric
have known for a very long time—though the practitioners of
communications tend to forget it again and again.</p>
<p>In Plato’s Phaedo which, among other things, is also the earliest
extant treatise on rhetoric, Socrates points out that one has to talk to
people in terms of their own experi- ence, that is, that one has to use
carpenters’ metaphors when talking to carpenters, and so on. One can
communicate only in the recipient’s language or in his terms. And the
terms have to be experience-based. It, therefore, does very little good
to try to explain terms to people. They will not be able to receive them
if they are not terms of their own experi- ence. They simply exceed
their perception capacity.</p>
<p>The connection between experience, perception, and concept
formation—that is, cog- nition—is, we now know, infinitely subtler and
richer than any earlier philosopher imag- ined. But one fact is proven
and comes out strongly in the most disparate work, e.g:, that of Piaget
(in Switzerland), that of B. F. Skinner, and that of Jerome Bruner (both
at Har- vard). Percept and concept in the learner, whether child or
adult, are not separate. We cannot perceive unless we also conceive. But
we also cannot form concepts unless we can perceive. To communicate a
concept as impossible unless the recipient can perceive it, that is,
unless it is within his perception.</p>
<p>There is a very old saying among writers: “Difficulties with a
sentence mean confused thinking. It is not the sentence that needs
straightening out, it is the thought behind it.” In writing we attempt,
first, to communicate with ourselves. An “unclear sentence” is one that
exceeds our own capacity for perception. Working on the sentence, that
is, working on what is normally called communications, cannot solve the
problem. We have to work on our own concepts first to be able to
understand what we are trying to say—and only then can we write the
sentence.</p>
<p>In communicating, whatever the medium, the first question has to be
“Is this commu- nication within the recipient’s range of perception? Can
he receive it?”</p>
<p>The “range of perception” is, of course, physiological and largely
(though not en- tirely) set by physical limitations of man’s animal
body. When we speak of communica- tion, however, the most important
limitations on perception are usually cultural and emo- tional rather
than physical. That fanatics are not being convinced by rational
arguments, we have known for thousands of years. Now we are beginning to
understand that it is not “argument” that is lacking. Fanatics do not
have the ability to perceive a communication which goes beyond their
range of emotions. First their emotions would have to be altered. In
other words, no one is really “in touch with reality,” if by that we
mean that he has complete openness to evidence. The distinction between
“sanity” and “paranoia” does not lie in the ability to perceive, but in
the ability to learn, that is, in the ability to change one’s emotions
on the basis of experience.</p>
<p>That perception is conditioned by what we are capable of perceiving
was realized forty years ago by the most quoted but probably least
heeded of all students of organiza- tion, Mary Parker Follett (e.g.,
especially in her collected essays, Dynamic Administra- tion, Harper’s,
1941). Follett taught that a disagreement or a conflict is likely not to
be</p>
<p>about the answers, or indeed about anything ostensible. It is, in
most cases, the result of incongruity in perceptions. What A sees so
vividly, B does not see at all. And, therefore, what A argues, has no
pertinence to B’s concerns, and vice versa. Both, Follett argued, are
likely to see reality. But each is likely to see a different aspect of
it. The world, and not only the material world, is multidimensional. Yet
one can see only one dimension at a time.</p>
<p>One rarely realizes that there could be other dimensions, and that
something that is so obvious to us and so clearly validated by our
emotional experience has other dimensions, a “back” and “sides,” which
are entirely different and which, therefore, lead to entirely different
perceptions. The story I mentioned earlier about the blind men and the
elephant in which each one, encountering this strange beast, feels one
of the elephant’s parts, his leg, his trunk, his hide, and reports an
entirely different conclusion, and holds to it tena- ciously, is simply
a metaphor of the human condition. There is no possibility of commu-
nication until this is understood and until he who has felt the hide of
the elephant goes over to him who has felt the leg and feels the leg
himself. There is no possibility of com- munications, in other words,
unless we first know what the recipient, the true communica- tor, can
see and why.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Communication is expectation. We perceive, as a rule, what we expect
to perceive.</li>
</ol>
<p>We see largely what we expect to see, and we hear largely what we
expect to hear. That the unexpected may be resented is not the important
thing—though most of the work on communications in business and
government thinks it is. What is truly important is that the unexpected
is usually not received at all. It is not seen or heard, but ignored. Or
it is misunderstood, that is, mis-seen or mis-heard as the expected.</p>
<p>On this we now have a century or more of experimentation. The results
are unambigu- ous. The human mind attempts to fit impressions and
stimuli into a frame of expectations. It resists vigorously any attempts
to make it “change its mind,” that is, to perceive what it does not
expect to perceive or not to perceive what it expects to perceive. It
is, of course, possible to alert the human mind to the fact that what it
perceives is contrary to its expec- tations. But this first requires
that we understand what it expects to perceive. It then re- quires that
there be an unmistakable signal “this is different,” that is, a shock
which breaks continuity. A gradual change in which the mind is
supposedly led by small, incre- mental steps to realize that what is
perceived is not what it expects to perceive will not work. It will
rather reinforce the expectations and will make it even more certain
that what will be perceived is what the recipient expects to
perceive.</p>
<p>Before we can communicate, we must therefore, know what the recipient
expects to see and hear. Only then can we know whether communication can
utilize his expecta- tions—and what they are—or whether there is need
for the “shock of alienation,” for an “awakening” that breaks through
the recipient’s expectations and forces him to realize that the
unexpected is happening.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Communication makes demands. Many years ago psychologists stumbled
on a strange phenomenon in their studies of memory, a phenomenon that,
at first, upset all their hypotheses. In order to test memory, the
psychologists compiled a list of words to be shown to their experimental
subjects for varying times as a test of their retention capacity. As
control, a list of nonsense words, mere jumbles of letters, was devised.
Much to the surprise of these early experimenters almost a century ago
or so, their subjects (mostly students, of course) showed totally uneven
memory retention of individual words. More surprising, they showed
amazingly high retention of the nonsense words. The explanation of the
first phenomenon is fairly obvious. Words are not mere information. They
do carry emotional charges. And, therefore words with unpleasant or
threatening associations tend to be suppressed, words with pleasant
associations retained. In fact, this selective reten- tion by emotional
association has since been used to construct tests for emotional disor-
ders and for personality profiles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The relatively high retention rate of nonsense words was a greater
puzzle. It was ex- pected that no one would really remember words that
had no meaning at all. But it has become clear over the years that the
memory for these words, though limited, exists pre-</p>
<p>cisely because these words have no meaning. For this reason, they
make no demand. They are truly neutral. With respect to them, memory
could be said to be truly “mechanical,” showing neither emotional
preference nor emotional rejection.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon, known to every newspaper editor, is the
amazingly high read- ership and retention of the “fillers,” the little
three- or five-line bits of irrelevant incidental information that are
used to “balance” a page. Why should anybody want to read, let alone
remember, that it first became fashionable to wear different-colored
hose on each leg at the court of some long-forgotten duke? Or, when and
where baking powder was first used? Yet there is no doubt that these
little tidbits of irrelevancy are read and, above all, that they are
remembered, far better than almost anything else in the daily paper ex-
cept the screaming headlines of the catastrophes. The answer is that the
fillers make no demands. It is their total irrelevancy that accounts for
their being remembered.</p>
<p>Communication is always “propaganda.” The emitter always wants “to
get something across.” Propaganda, we now know, is both a great deal
more powerful than the rational- ists with their belief in “open
discussion” believe, and a great deal less powerful than the myth-makers
of propaganda, e.g., Dr. Goebbels in the Nazi regime, believed and
wanted us to believe. Indeed the danger of total propaganda is not that
the propaganda will be believed. The danger is that nothing will be
believed and that every communication be- comes suspect. In the end, no
communication is being received. Everything anyone says is considered a
demand and is resisted, resented, and in effect not heard at all. The
end re- sults of total propaganda are not fanatics, but cynics—but this,
of course, may be even greater and more dangerous corruption.</p>
<p>Communication, in other words, always makes demands. It always
demands that the recipient become somebody, do something, believe
something. It always appeals to moti- vation. If, in other words,
communication fits in with the aspirations, the values, the pur- poses
of the recipient, it is powerful. If it goes against his aspirations,
his values, his mo- tivations, it is likely not to be received at all
or, at best, to be resisted. Of course, at its most powerful,
communication brings about “conversion,” that is, a change of personal-
ity, of values, beliefs, aspirations. But this is the rare, existential
event, and one against which the basic psychological forces of every
human being are strangely organized. Even the Lord, the Bible reports,
first had to strike Saul blind before he could raise him up as Paul.
Communications aiming at conversion demand surrender. By and large,
therefore, there is no communication unless the message can key in to
the recipient’s own values, at least to some degree.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Communication and information are different and indeed largely
opposite—yet in- terdependent. Where communication is perception,
information is logic. As such, infor- mation is purely formal and has no
meaning. It is impersonal rather than interpersonal. The more it can be
freed of the human component, that is, of such things as emotions and
values, expectations and perceptions, the more valid and reliable does
it become. Indeed it becomes increasingly informative.</li>
</ol>
<p>All through history, the problem has been how to glean a little
information out of communications, that is, out of relationships between
people, based on perception. All through history, the problem has been
to isolate the information content from an abun- dance of perception.
Now, all of a sudden, we have the capacity to provide information— both
because of the conceptual work of the logicians (especially the symbolic
logic of Russell and Whitehead, which appeared in 1910), and because of
the technical work on data processing and data storage, that is,
especially because of the computer and its tre- mendous capacity to
store, manipulate, and transmit data. Now, in other words, we have the
opposite problem from the one mankind has always been struggling with.
Now we have the problem of handling information per se, devoid of any
communication content.</p>
<p>The requirements for effective information are the opposite of those
for effective communication. Information is, for instance, always
specific. We perceive a configuration in communications; but we convey
specific individual data in the information process. Indeed, information
is, above all, a principle of economy. The fewer data needed, the
bet-</p>
<p>ter the information. And an overload of information, that is,
anything much beyond what is truly needed, leads to information
blackout. It does not enrich, but impoverishes.</p>
<p>At the same time, information presupposes communication. Information
is always en- coded. To be received, let alone to be used, the code must
be known and understood by the recipient. This requires prior agreement,
that is, some communication. At the very least, the recipient has to
know what the data pertain to. Are the figures on a piece of computer
tape the height of mountaintops or the cash balances of Federal Reserve
mem- ber banks? In either case, the recipient would have to know what
mountains are or what banks are to get any information out of the
data.</p>
<p>The prototype information system may well have been the peculiar
language known as Armee Deutsch (Army German) which served as language
of command in the Imperial Austrian Army prior to 1918. A polyglot army
in which officers, noncommissioned offi- cers, and men often had no
language in common, it functioned remarkably well with fewer than two
hundred specific words— “fire,” for instance, or “at ease,” each of
which had only one totally unambiguous meaning. The meaning was always
an action. And the words were learned in and through actions, i.e., in
what behaviorists now call “operant conditioning.” The tensions in the
Austrian Army after many decades of nationalist tur- moil were very
great indeed. Social intercourse between members of different nationali-
ties serving in the same unit became increasingly difficult, if not
impossible. But to the very end, the information system functioned. It
was completely formal; completely rigid; completely logical in that each
word had only one possible meaning; and it rested on completely
pre-established communication regarding the specific response to a
certain set of sound waves. This example, however, shows also that the
effectiveness of an informa- tion system depends on the willingness and
ability to think through carefully what infor- mation is needed by whom
for what purposes, and then on the systematic creation of communication
among the various parties to the system as to the meaning of each
specific input and output. The effectiveness, in other words, depends on
the pre-establishment of communication.</p>
<p>Communication communicates the more levels of meaning it has and the
less it lends itself to quantification.</p>
<p>Medieval esthetics held that a work of art communicates on a number
of levels, at least three if not four: the literal; the metaphorical;
the allegorical; and the symbolic. The work of art that most consciously
converted this theory into artistic practice was Dante’s Divina
Commedia. If by “information” we mean something that can be quantified,
then the Divina Commedia is without any information content whatever.
But it is precisely the ambiguity, the multiplicity of levels on which
this book can be read, from being a fairy tale to being a grand
synthesis of metaphysics, that makes it the overpowering work of art it
is and the immediate communication which it has been to generations of
readers.</p>
<p>Communications, in other words, may not be dependent on information.
Indeed the most perfect communications may be purely “shared
experiences,” without any logic whatever. Perception has primacy rather
than information.</p>
<p>This summary of what we have learned is gross oversimplification. It
glosses over some of the most hotly contested issues in psychology and
perception. Indeed it may well brush aside most of the issues which the
students of learning and of perception, would consider central and
important.</p>
<p>But the aim has not been to survey these big areas. My concern here
is not with learn- ing or with perception. It is with communications,
and in particular, with communications in the large organization, be it
business enterprise, government agency, university, or armed
service.</p>
<p>This summary might also be criticized for being trite, if not
obvious. No one, it might be said, could possibly be surprised at its
statements. They say what “everybody knows.” But whether this be so or
not, it is not what “everybody does.” On the contrary, the logical
implication for communications in organizations of these apparently
simple and obvious statements is at odds with current practice and
indeed denies validity to the honest and serious efforts we have been
making to communicate for many decades now.</p>
<p>Why Downward Communications Cannot Work</p>
<p>What, then, can our knowledge and our experience teach us about
communications in organizations, about the reasons for our failures, and
about the prerequisites for success in the future?</p>
<p>For centuries we have attempted communication “downward.” This,
however, cannot work, no matter how hard and how intelligently we try.
It cannot work, first, because it focuses on what we want to say. It
assumes, in other words, that the utterer communicates. But we know that
all he does is utter. Communication is the act of the recipient. What we
have been trying to do is to work on the emitter, specifically on the
manager, the adminis- trator, the commander, to make him capable of
being a better communicator. But all one can communicate downward are
commands, that is, prearranged signals. One cannot communicate downward
anything connected with understanding, let alone with motiva- tion. This
requires communication upward, from those who perceive, to those who
want to reach their perception.</p>
<p>This does not mean that managers should stop working on clarity in
what they say or write. Far from it. But it does mean that how we say
something comes only after we have learned what to say. And this cannot
be found out by “talking to,” no matter how well it is being done.
“Letters to the Employees,” no matter how well done, will be a waste
unless the writer knows what employees can perceive, expect to perceive,
and want to do. They are a waste unless they are based on the
recipient’s rather than the emitter’s perception.</p>
<p>But “listening” does not work either. The Human Relations School of
Elton Mayo, forty years ago, recognized the failure of the traditional
approach to communications. Its answer* was to enjoin listening. Instead
of starting out with what “we,” that is, the execu- tive, want to “get
across,” the executive should start out by finding out what subordinates
want to know, are interested in, are, in other words, receptive to. To
this day, the human relations prescription, though rarely practiced,
remains the classic formula.</p>
<p>Of course, listening is a prerequisite to communication. But it is
not adequate, and it cannot, by itself, work. Listening assumes that the
superior will understand what he is being told. It assumes, in other
words, that the subordinates can communicate. It is hard to see,
however, why the subordinate should be able to do what his superior
cannot do. In fact, there is no reason for assuming he can. There is no
reason, in other words, to believe that listening results any less in
misunderstanding and miscommunications than does talk- ing. In addition,
the theory of listening does not take into account that communications
is demands. It does not bring out the subordinate’s preferences and
desires, his values and aspirations. It may explain the reasons for
misunderstanding. But it does not lay down a basis for
understanding.</p>
<p>This is not to say that listening is wrong, any more than the
futility of downward communications furnishes any argument against
attempts to write well, to say things clearly and simply, and to speak
the language of those whom one addresses rather than one’s own jargon.
Indeed, the realization that communications have to be upward—or rather
that they have to start with the recipient rather than the emitter,
which underlies the concept of listening—is absolutely sound and vital.
But listening is only the starting point.</p>
<p>More and better information does not solve the communications
problem, does not bridge the communications gap. On the contrary, the
more information, the greater is the need for functioning and effective
communication. The more information, in other words, the greater is the
communications gap likely to be. The information explosion demands
functioning communications:</p>
<p>The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first
place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and
application, that is, on communica- tions. In the second place, the more
effective the information process, the more imper- sonal and formal will
it become; the more will it separate human beings and thereby re-</p>
<p>*Especially as developed in Mayo’s two famous books, The Human
Problems of an Industrial Civitization (Harvard Business School, 1933)
and The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization (Harvard Business
School, 1945).</p>
<p>quire separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the
human relationship, the relationship of communication. It may be said
that the effectiveness of the information process will depend
increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of
effective communication—that is, in the present situation—the
information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can
produce is data.</p>
<p>The information explosion is the most compelling reason to go to work
on communi- cations. Indeed, the frightening communications gap all
around us—between management and workers; between business and
government; between faculty and students, and be- tween both of them and
university administration; between producers and consumers, and so
on—may well reflect in some measure the tremendous increase in
information without a commensurate increase in communications.</p>
<p>What Can Managers Do?</p>
<p>Can we then say anything constructive about communication? Can we do
anything? We can say that communication has to start from the intended
recipient of communications rather than from the emitter. In terms of
traditional organization we have to start upward. Downward
communications cannot work and do not work. They come after upward
communications have successfully been established. They are reaction
rather than action; response rather than initiative.</p>
<p>But we can also say that it is not enough to listen. The upward
communications must be focused on something that both recipient and
emitter can perceive, focused on some- thing that is common to both of
them. They must be focused on what already motivates the intended
recipient. They must, from the beginning, be informed by his values,
beliefs, and aspirations.</p>
<p>Management by objectives is thus a prerequisite for functioning
communication. It re- quires the subordinate to think through and
present to the superior his own conclusions as to what major
contribution to the organization—or to the unit within the
organization—he should be expected perform and should be held
accountable for.</p>
<p>What the subordinate comes up with is rarely what the superior
expects. Indeed, the first aim of the exercise is precisely to bring out
the divergence in perception between superior and subordinate. But the
perception is focused, and focused on something that is real to both
parties. To realize that they see the same reality differently is in
itself already communication.</p>
<p>Management by objectives gives to the intended recipient of
communication—in this case the subordinate—access to experience that
enables him to understand. He is given access to the reality of
decision-making, the problems of priorities, the choice between what one
likes to do and what the situation demands, and above all, the
responsibility for a decision. He may not see the situation the same way
the superior does—in fact, he rarely will or even should. But he may
gain an understanding of the complexity of the superior’s situation and
of the fact that the complexity is not of the superior’s making, but is
inherent in the situation itself.</p>
<p>And these communications, even if they end in a “no” to the
subordinate’s conclu- sions, are firmly focused on the aspirations,
values, and motivation of the intended recipi- ent. In fact, they start
out with the question “What would you want to do?” They may then end up
with the command “This is what I tell you to do.” But at least they
force the supe- rior to realize that he is overriding the desires of the
subordinate. It forces him to explain, if not to try to persuade. At
least he knows that he has a problem—and so does the subor- dinate.</p>
<p>These are only examples, and rather insignificant ones at that. But
perhaps they illus- trate the main conclusion to which our experience
with communications—largely an ex-</p>
<p>perience of failure—and all the work on learning, memory, perception,
and motivation point: communication requires shared experience.</p>
<p>There can be no communication if it is conceived as going from the
“I” to the “Thou.”</p>
<p>Communication works only from one member of “us” to another.
Communication in or- ganization—and this may be the true lesson of our
communication failure and the true measure of our communication need—is
not a means of organization. It is the mode of organization.</p>
