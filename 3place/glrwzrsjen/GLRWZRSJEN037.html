Management to Knowledge Organization</h4>
<p>Middle Management’s Predicted Demise—And the Middle Management

“Weight Control”— Sloughing Off the Old—Where the Growth Occurred—The

Managers: “Juniors” and “Colleagues” Rather Than “Subordi- nates”</p>
<p>and automation were the headline makers, the was widely predicted. By
1980, we were told</p>
<p>by a number of experts, middle management would have disappeared. All
decisions would be made by the computer or by top management on the
basis of a “total informa- tion system.”</p>
<p>Very few predictions have been disproved so fast and so completely.
At the very time the predictions were being widely publicized, the
middle-management boom began. And it kept going for twenty years.
Indeed, the fifties and the sixties might have been called the era of
middle management. No other group in the work force, in all developed
coun- tries, has been growing as fast.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, during this period, a powerful force at work
reducing the number of middle-management jobs. It was not, however, the
computer, automation, or any other new technology. It was the press of
mergers, takeovers, and acquisitions, especially in the U.S. and in
Great Britain. It resulted in consolidating or closing countless sales
and ac- counting offices—and with it the abolition of middle-management
positions by the score. Yet despite this force—which reached hurricane
strength in the late sixties in the English- speaking world—the demand
for middle-rank managerial people grew steadily except in periods of
economic recession as in Great Britain in the late sixties and in the
U.S. in 1970-71. And in companies not directly affected by mergers or
acquisitions, or in public- service institutions, the demand grew
spectacularly.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from manufacturing, that is, from the economic
sector where automation has been most widely applied and where computers
have become as common- place, at least in big companies, as smokestacks
were a few generations ago. One of the large American automobile
companies recently built a major manufacturing plant to turn out the
entire production of a new model. It was the company’s first major
automotive plant since 1949, when a similar plant, designed for a
similar production volume, was opened. The number of rank-and-file
employees, both blue-collar and clerical, is almost</p>
<p>one-third less than that of the earlier plant—the result, however, of
normal increases in productivity rather than of a shift of the process
to automation. The top-management group in the new plant is about the
same size. But the middle-management group, that is, the group that is
paid more than a general foreman and less than the plant’s general man-
ager, is almost five times the size of the middle-management group in
the 1949 plant.</p>
<p>Another manufacturing company—a producer of a wide range of
industrial compo- nents—grew between 1950 and 1970 from a sales volume
of 0 million to one of 00 million. In terms of units the growth was
fivefold. During this period of rapid expansion, the top-management
group grew from three men to five. Rank-and-file employment grew from
l,000 to 4,000. The middle-management ranks, again defined by salary,
grew from 14 men to 235—that is, almost seventeen times—and this does
not include salesmen.</p>
<p>Here is an example from England: One of the large materials
companies—a world- wide leader in its industry—grew by 45 percent
between 1950 and 1970, measured in volume of output and discounting for
inflation and price increases. The top-management group at the end of
the period was actually somewhat smaller as the result of two reor-
ganizations in which older members of the founding families were being
replaced by pro- fessional managers. The rank and file, both in the
factories and in the office, grew by about a fifth. But the middle group
tripled.</p>
<p>The same rapid expansion in the middle ranks has occurred in Japan.
Middle man- agement in Japan is synonymous with “university graduates on
the payroll.” And that number in Japan—and especially the number of
university graduates working for busi- ness—has increased even faster
than the Japanese economy. Indeed, the words “salary man,” the Japanese
term for the middle group, has become a slogan.</p>
<p>These examples actually understate the growth rate of middle
management. During the period in which middle management was expected to
disappear, the center of economic gravity and growth shifted to
industries that have a much higher ratio of middle managers in their
employ than have the industries which dominated the business scene in
1950. The symbol of economic dynamism in the United States economy of
1970 was no longer Gen- eral Motors. It was IBM. And at IBM, or at any
other computer manufacturer, the middle group is far bigger than in
traditional manufacturing industries such as automobile or steel. The
same is true of the pharmaceutical companies which grew so rapidly in
the twenty years between 1950 and 1970.</p>
<p>Outside of manufacturing industries the growth has been even more
rapid. It has been particularly pronounced in the non-business service
institutions. The prototype is the hos- pital.</p>
<p>Top management in the hospital—however one defines it—has not grown.
There is still the hospital administrator, perhaps with an assistant in
the larger hospital. There are in the community hospitals, the trustees,
and there is a medical director. Rank-and-file employment in terms of
number of employees per patient day has gone down rather than up. It is
in the kitchen, in maintenance, and in the other rank-and-file areas
that hospitals have become somewhat less labor-intensive. But the middle
ranks—technicians, engi- neers, accountants, psychologists and social
workers—have exploded. They have grown at least fourfold—in some big
teaching hospitals even faster.</p>
<p>The Needed Correction</p>
<p>Growth at such rates always overshoots the target. It is bound to be
disorderly and waste- ful. There is overstaffing because it is the
fashion to go in for this or that activity whether needed or not. There
is overstaffing because times are good and it is easier to accede to a
demand for more people than to fight it. And in such a period of
explosive growth no one pays much attention to the organization of the
work. Yet expansion of such magnitude is always qualitative change
rather than more additional quantity. If the work and its organi- zation
are not studied and changed, waste, duplication of effort, and
organizational obe- sity follow.</p>
<p>Examples of wasteful overstaffing in the middle ranks abound. The
worst are some American defense projects. To design the Mirage fighter,
the best military plane of the 1954-1970 period, the French employed
some seventy engineers and designers who did the job in record time. A
comparable American development might have been staffed with three
thousand engineers and designers and have taken four times as long and,
in the end, might have come out with an inferior design at infinitely
greater cost.</p>
<p>But there are examples of blatant overstaffing in private industry
too. It is quite unlikely that IBM, on its rapid expansion, could have
put to productive work all the masses of middle-management people it
hired, on the basis of their college diplomas as a rule rather than for
proven performance or because the need for their services had been
clearly established.</p>
<p>The middle-management boom therefore had to lead, like any other
boom, to a “mid- dle-management depression.” At the first significant
economic setback there had to be a sharp correction. This came first in
Great Britain, where the fairly sharp recession of the late sixties
coincided with a peak in mergers and takeovers, resulting in layoffs of
middle- rank executives and professionals. In the United States, in the
1970/71 recession, the reac- tion was far milder: it consisted of a
sharp two-year curtailment of college recruiting for management and
professional positions with very few layoffs of middle-management people
already on the payroll (except in the particularly distressed aerospace
and defense industries). And Japan, when scared by President Nixon’s
trade and economic offensive in 1971, also reacted by curtailing
temporarily new hiring.</p>
<p>Such a reaction, however painful, is fundamentally healthy. It always
goes too far, of course. But at least it forces management to think
through what the work is and what it needs. Such thinking is
particularly important with respect to middle-management work. There are
few areas where overstaffing does as much damage as in the middle-
management group. It costs a great deal more than money. It costs
performance and moti- vation.</p>
<p>The Danger of Overstaffing</p>
<p>Knowledge work—that is, the specific work of middle managers—should
always be de- manding. It should be lean, and err, if at all, on the
side of understaffing. An overstaffed middle-management organization
destroys motivation. It destroys accomplishment, achievement, and
satisfaction. In the end, it destroys performance.*</p>
<p>The middle-management boom and the resulting overstaffing, especially
in larger companies, did indeed undermine morale and motivation.
Overstaffing is a main reason for the dissatisfaction and disenchantment
of so many of the young middle-rank people, managers and career
professionals, whom business, governments, school systems, and hospitals
recruited in such large numbers during the fifties and sixties. They are
well paid and well treated; but there is not enough for them to do, not
enough challenge, not enough contribution, not enough accomplishment,
and too much sheer busyness. There are too many bodies busily
“interacting” with each other rather than doing their own work. When the
able young educated people, e.g., the brightest graduates of the leading
American business schools, are asked to explain their growing preference
for a job in a small com- pany or in the medium-sized city
administration, they always say, “At least I’ll have something to
do.”</p>
<p>The first lesson is to keep the middle ranks lean. “What really needs
to be done?” is the first question. And the second and equally important
one is “What no longer needs to be done and should be cut back or cut
out?” The first lesson is the need for weight con- trol.</p>
<p>In particular this means that a new middle-management activity
should, as a rule, be sanctioned only if an old one is sloughed off or,
at least, pruned back. The middle- management budget is predominately an
“administered expense” (see Chapter 9) and</p>
<p>*On this see especially the two books by Frederick Herzberg: Work and
the Nature of Man (World Publishing Co., 1966) and The Motivation to
Work (Wiley, 1959).</p>
<p>needs to be constantly watched to make sure that good, performing
people are allocated to opportunities, to results, and to making the
future rather than wasted on problems, busy- ness, and on defending the
past.</p>
<p>What needs even more thought and attention is, however, the work of
middle man- agement and its organization. The expansion of the middle
ranks not only produced a qualitative change—it was itself produced by a
change in the nature of the middle- management function.</p>
<p>Middle management will, it is safe to predict, continue to expand.
But future growth will have to be directed, controlled, managed. It will
have to be based on an understand- ing of the changing nature of middle
management and of the resulting need for change in function,
relationship, and structure.</p>
<p>Where the Growth Occurred</p>
<p>The middle management of forty years ago has not disappeared. Rather
it has grown, and quite substantially. There are today proportionately
more plant managers around, more district sales managers, and more
branch managers in banks than there were before World War II.</p>
<p>But the real growth of middle-rank people in management jobs has been
in manufac- turing engineers and process specialists; in tax accountants
and market analysts; in prod- uct and market managers; in advertising
and promotion specialists. It has been in a host of functions which, a
generation ago, were hardly known. The new middle managers are the
knowledge professionals (see Chapter 30).</p>
<p>The traditional middle, manager is essentially a commander of men.
The new middle manager is essentially a supplier of knowledge. The
traditional middle manager has au- thority downward, over the people who
report to him. The new middle manager essen- tially has responsibility
sideways and upward, that is, to people over whom he exercises no
command authority.</p>
<p>Above all, the traditional middle manager’s job is largely routine.
He did not make decisions. He carried them out. At the most, he
implemented them and adapted them to local conditions. His job was to
keep running a system that he had neither designed nor was expected to
alter.</p>
<p>This underlay, of course, the traditional definition of a manager as
someone who is re- sponsible for the work of others rather than
responsible for his own work. It also underlay the traditional social
structure of management outside the U.S. and Japan, especially in
Europe.</p>
<p>In the United States and Japan top management has traditionally been
recruited from middle management, that is, from people who worked their
way up in the business. In European countries this was not the pattern.
In England there was—and to some extent still is—a tremendous gulf
between managers and “the board,” that is, top management. Even in large
companies the board was until recently recruited from people who had
never discharged operating management functions, if not from people who
had never worked in a business; such as distinguished former public
servants. In Holland top man- agement, even in the large and
professionally managed companies, rarely comes out of operations. In the
large French company all positions in top and senior management are
typically held by graduates of the Grandes Écoles. Most of them,
especially top- management people, make their careers in government and
then move directly into senior management jobs in business. Operating
managers who come up in the business are nor- mally considered unfit for
top jobs, even if they are university graduates. The Germans tend to
draw a sharp line between Führung, i.e., top management, and Leitung,
operating management.*</p>
<p>*The semantic hurdle the word “management” has faced outside of the
United Stata is a result. In most Euro- pean languages—and thirty years
ago even in British English—there is no one term comprising the totality
of the management group. There are separate terms for the people at the
top and for the people in the middle. And since “management” is usually
being translated into these languages with the word that connotes the
operating,</p>
<p>Georg Siemens, the founder of the Deutsche Bank (see Chapter 29 and
especially Chapter 49), became the head of a major financial institution
as a young government law- yer barely thirty, without experience in the
banking business. His youth was exceptional; his lack of business
preparation and operating knowledge was not.</p>
<p>That this social structure could work—and work very well in many
cases—shows that the European view of the traditional middle manager as
being concerned with routines rather than with decisions, and with
maintenance of going operations rather than with direction, had a good
deal of substance.</p>
<p>The Decision Impact of the New Middle Manager</p>
<p>But as the new middle people are knowledge professional, their
actions and decisions are intended to have direct and major impact on
the business, its ability to perform, and its direction.</p>
<p>Here are some fairly typical examples.</p>
<p>The product manager in companies such as Procter andandandand
Gamble’s soap and detergent business, in Unilever’s food business, or in
the radio and TV business of Philips of Hol- land, is definitely middle
management by rank and compensation. He has no command authority. The
work is being carried out by people who report to their respective func-
tional bosses, the manufacturing manager, the sales manager, the head of
the chemical and development laboratories, and so on. But he is held
responsible for the development, the introduction, and the performance
of a product in the marketplace. He decides very largely whether a new
product should indeed be developed. He decides what its specifica- tions
should be. He determines its price. He decides where and how to
test-market it. And he decides the sales goals. He does not have any
direct command authority and cannot issue an order. But he controls
directly a major determinant of performance and success for a branded
consumer product, the advertising and promotion budget.</p>
<p>The quality control engineer in a machine tool company also has no
command author- ity and has no one, except junior quality engineers,
reporting to him. But he decides the design and structure of the
manufacturing process. His quality control standards largely decide the
costs of the manufacturing process and the performance of the
manufacturing plant. The manufacturing manager or the plant manager does
indeed make the decisions. But the quality control man can veto
them.</p>
<p>The tax accountant also has no command, can give no orders, and often
has no one re- porting to him except his secretary. Yet, in effect, he
has a veto power over even top- management decisions. His opinion on the
tax consequences of a course of action often determines both what a
company can do and how it must do it.</p>
<p>The industry specialist in a large commercial bank, e.g., the man who
is the expert on retail trade, is not supposed to make loans on his own
authority. But the lending officers, in turn, are not supposed to make
loans to a retail chain without his approval. And when a retail store
customer of the bank gets into difficulties, it is the retail specialist
who takes over. The retail specialist in the bank is also expected to
determine on his own responsi- bility and based on his own knowledge
whether the bank should, at any given time, ex- pand or contract its
lending to retail stores. He is expected to determine what the criteria
for loans to retail stores should be. And if he sees a loan to a retail
chain which, to him, seems dubious, he is not expected to go “upstairs.”
He picks up the telephone and calls the lending officer in charge of the
account. He cannot “order” the lending officer to call the loan or to
cut it back. Still, the lending officer, who may well outrank the
retail-trade specialist will not say, “I was advised by the specialist
to cut back this loan.” He will say, “I was told by the specialist.”</p>
<p>The product manager at Procter andandandand Gamble, the quality
engineer, and the tax account- ant are not “line” managers. But neither
are they “staff.” Their function is not advice and</p>
<p>middle-management people, the people at the top, such as the German
Unternehmer, tended to conclude that management was concerned with
routine operations rather than with crucial decisions and that,
therefore, man- agement was for “them” and not for “us.”</p>
<p>teaching. They do “operating” work. Yet they have top-management
impacts even though they are not top management in rank, compensation,
or function.</p>
<p>To be sure, they cannot make some of the key decisions—what our
business is and what it should be; what its objectives are; what the
priorities are and should be; where to allocate key resources of capital
and people. But even with respect to these decisions they contribute the
essential knowledge without which the key decision cannot be made, at
least not effectively. And the key decisions cannot become effective
unless these new middle managers build them into their own knowledge and
work on their own responsibil- ity and on their own authority. In an
earlier chapter (Chapter 30) it was argued that the knowledge
professional is a manager even though no one reports to him. Now we see
that in his impacts and responsibilities he is top management even
though he may be five or six organizational levels down.</p>
<p>The Knowledge Organization</p>
<p>Middle management has not disappeared, as was predicted. Indeed not
even the tradi- tional middle manager has disappeared. But yesterday’s
middle management is being transformed into tomorrow’s knowledge
organization.</p>
<p>This requires restructuring individual jobs, but also restructuring
the organization and its design. In the knowledge organization the job,
all the way down to the lowest profes- sional or managerial level, has
to focus on the company’s objectives. It has to focus on contribution,
which means that it has to have its own objectives. It has to be
organized according to assignment. It has to be thought through and
structured according to the flow of information both to and from the
individual position. And it has to be placed into the decision
structure. It can no longer be designed; as was the traditional middle-
management job, in terms of downward authority alone. It has to be
recognized instead as multidimensional.</p>
<p>Traditionally, middle-management jobs have been designed narrowly.
The first con- cern has been with the limits on a middle manager’s
authority. In the knowledge organiza- tion we will instead have to ask,
“What is the greatest possible contribution this job can make?” The
focus will have to shift from concern with authority to stress on
responsibil-</p>
<p>ity.</p>
<p>The Need for Clear Decision Authority</p>
<p>The knowledge organization demands clear decision authority. It
demands clear thinking through what decision belongs where (see Chapter
42). The knowledge organization is far more complex than the simple
“line” organization it is replacing. Unless decision author- ity is
clearly spelled out, it will tend to become confused.</p>
<p>The knowledge organization is also designed to take greater risks.
Operating no longer is a “routine” in which the norms are clear. It is a
decision-making organization rather than one that has no other function
than to keep the machinery running at a preset speed and for already
known results. Things, therefore, will go wrong, and in unexpected ways.
And unless authority to change the decision is built into the decision
itself, mal- function is bound to result.</p>
<p>A major pharmaceutical company decided to introduce seven new
products in one year—twice as many as the company had ever introduced
before in a single year. An elaborate multinational strategy was worked
out in year-long sessions of task forces as- sembled from all functions,
all levels, and all major territories. Some products were to be
introduced first into European markets, some into the American market,
some first with general practitioners of medicine, others with
specialists or in hospitals. When the prod- ucts were brought out,
however, the two which had been considered the weakest unex- pectedly
developed into best sellers. But the two supposedly strongest products
ran into unforeseen troubles which sharply slowed down their growth. In
working out the strategy, no one had asked, “If things do not work out
as planned, who is going to be responsible for changing the plan?” As a
result, there were endless reports, endless studies, endless</p>
<p>meetings—and no action. In the end, the company lost much of the
benefit of its accom- plishments. The two products that had shown
unexpected success did not receive the sup- port needed to exploit their
acceptance by the medical profession. Competitors who moved in with
near-imitations were therefore able to reap most of the harvest.
Clinical testing and marketing efforts on the two products that had run
into unexpected difficulties should either have been cut back sharply or
should have been raised sharply. Everyone saw that; but no one had the
authority to make the decision.</p>
<p>In the knowledge organization of the new middle management any
program, any pro- ject, and any plan will have to ask and answer the
question “Who has the authority to change the plan?” And this will lead
to far greater devolution of authority to middle peo- ple than even the
American middle management tradition ever envisaged. Even line man-
agers will need more rather than less authority in the knowledge
organization.</p>
<p>In the pharmaceutical company case the field sales manager of the
relatively small French subsidiary was the only man who could have
prevented the worst damage: the loss to competitors of the market for
the one product which unexpectedly turned into a poten- tial best
seller. But he had neither the information to understand the
significance of his sales results nor the authority to alter his sales
goals and his sales plan. And yet nobody had “made a mistake.” The
French field sales manager was just being treated the way middle
management has traditionally been treated, that is, as somebody who
carries out orders. But in the knowledge organization the line manager
must also be a part of the de- cision and understand what it implies. He
must be given authority commensurate to his responsibility—and this is
not knowledge authority, but command authority. Or, if in any area he
cannot be given the command authority which his task—and his
people—require, it must be perfectly clear, above all to him, where the
command authority lies. (On the implications of this for organization
structure see discussion of “task force team” and “functional”
organization in Chapter 45.)</p>
<p>Top Management’s Role in the Knowledge Organization</p>
<p>In the knowledge organization, top management can no longer assume
that the “operating people” do as they are being told. It has to accept
that the middle ranks make genuine decisions. But the operating
organization can also no, longer assume that it can do its job in
isolation from top management. It must understand the top-management
decisions. In- deed middle management in the knowledge organization must
take responsibility for “educating” top management. Top management must
understand what the knowledge organization tries to do, what it is
capable of doing, and where it sees the major opportu- nities, the major
needs, the major challenges to the enterprise. Finally, middle manage-
ment must insist that top management make decisions on what the business
is and what it should be, on objectives, strategies, and priorities.
Otherwise the middle ranks cannot do their own job.</p>
<p>Top management needs to know the knowledge organization and to
understand it. It needs to establish communication with it. The
traditional American assumption that the people in top management know
the middle manager’s job because they have been through it is no longer
going to be valid. Even the men who have risen into top manage- ment
through the middle-management organization can no longer expect to have
been exposed directly to more than a small sample of the functional work
of the knowledge organization. And some of the most important areas of
middle management will no longer prepare and test a man for
top-management positions.</p>
<p>Indeed the most capable men in such areas will not even want to get
into top- management work but will prefer to stay in their specialty.
The computer specialist wants, as a rule, to stay within his
specialization and work on information and information tech- nology.
Equally, most researchers want to stay in research, whether in physical
and tech- nical fields, in research on people, or in economic
research.</p>
<p>But the assumption that underlies the traditional European approach
is also becoming invalid. Middle managers in knowledge organizations can
no longer be taken for granted</p>
<p>and be treated with condescension as people who, after all, do only
routine tasks and only carry out and implement top-management decisions
and orders. If it wants to be effective, top management therefore needs
to establish team work with, and communications from and to, the
knowledge organization.</p>
<p>The most important “public” in the knowledge organization for top
management—and the one that most needs a relationship to top
management—are the younger and highly specialized knowledge workers.
They most need a “godfather” (see Chapter 20). They are least likely to
understand what top management is trying to do, least likely to see the
business whole, least likely to focus themselves on company objectives
and performance. Yet they are likely, because of their knowledge, to
have impact early in their careers. In any business of any size or
complexity the top-management group needs to organize its relationship
to these younger knowledge professionals.</p>
<p>Each member of the top-management team might sit down a few times a
year with a group of younger knowledge people and say to them, “I have
no agenda. I have nothing I want to tell you. I am here to listen. It is
your job to tell me what you think we in top management need to know
about your work and how you think we can make it most pro- ductive. It
is your job to tell me where you see the problems and opportunities for
this company and to tell me what we in top management do to help you in
your job and what we do that hampers you. I shall insist on only one
thing: that you have done your home- work and that you take seriously
your responsibility to inform and to educate.”</p>
<p>But altogether in the knowledge organization it becomes a
top-management job to mobilize, to organize, to place, and to direct
knowledge. Knowledge people—and that means managers and career
professionals in today’s organization—cannot be seen and treated as
inferiors. They are middle in rank, pay, authority. But they are juniors
and col- leagues rather than subordinates.</p>
<p>“Management” means, in the last analysis, the substitution of thought
for brawn and muscle, of knowledge for folkways and superstition, and of
cooperation for force. It means the substitution of responsibility for
obedience to rank, and of authority of per- formance for authority of
power. The knowledge organization, therefore, is what man- agement
theory, management thinking, management aspirations have been about, all
along. But now the knowledge organization is becoming accomplished fact.
The tremen- dous expansion of managerial employment since World War II
converted the middle ranks into knowledge professionals—that is, people
paid for putting knowledge to work and to make decisions based on their
knowledge which have impact on performance ca- pacity, results, and
future directions of the whole enterprise. The task of making these new
knowledge people in the middle ranks truly effective and achieving has
barely begun. It is a central task in managing managers.</p>
