<p>ONE COMPANY IN THE WESTERN WORLD CAN (as has been said earlier) be
compared with Sears, Roebuck: Marks andandandand Spencer. It might even
be slightly ahead in growth of sales and profits over a long period of
years.</p>
<p>Like Sears, Marks andandandand Spencer is a chain retailer. It opened
its first penny bazaar in 1884, or just about the time Richard Sears
made his first mail-order offer of cheap but reliable watches to the
Midwestern farmer. By 1915 the company was building variety stores. It
has been growing fast ever since. Its most spectacular growth period,
however, was the ten years between 1963 and 1972—a period in Britain’s
economic history which was characterized by “stagflation,” i.e.,
inflationary stagnation, rather than growth. During this difficult
period Marks andandandand Spencer more than doubled its sales volume
(from £184 million to £463 million, or in U.S. dollars, 60 million to $
l,100 million). Profits went up just as fast, from £22 million to £54
million (5 million to 35 million). Equally remarkable was the profit
margin—almost 12 percent on sales before taxes—which is double what any
other retail merchant (except Sears) would consider fully
satisfactory.</p>
<p>Social Revolution as Business Mission</p>
<p>By the mid-twenties the four brothers-in-law (Simon Marks, Israel
Sieff, Harry Sacher, and Norman Laski) who had built the penny bazaars
of 1915 into a major chain of variety stores owned a successful
business. They might have been satisfied to rest on their laurels and to
enjoy their considerable wealth. Instead they decided—following a trip
to America by Simon Marks in 1924 in the course of which he carefully
studied Sears, Roebuck—to rethink the purpose and mission of their
business. The business of Marks andandandand Spencer, they decided, was
not retailing. It was social revolution.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer redefined its business as the subversion
of the class structure of nineteenth-century England by making available
to the working and lower middle classes upper-class goods of better than
upper-class quality, and yet at prices the working and
lower-middle-class customer could well afford.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer was by no means alone in the England of
the twenties in seeing a major opportunity in the rapid social changes
of the post-World War I period (another contemporary example was
Montague Burton, the “Fifty Shilling Tailor”). What made</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer unique and successful, however, was its
conversion of the definition of “what our business is, and should be”
into clear, specific, operationally effective and multiple
objectives.</p>
<p>This required first a decision as to what to concentrate on, that is,
a basic strategy objective.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer had been a variety store chain like many
others, offering a large assortment of products which had nothing in
common except low price. Now the company decided to concentrate on
wearing apparel (to which it soon added household textiles such as
towels and draperies).</p>
<p>This was a rational decision. In the England of that time dress was
still highly classdetermined and the most visible of all class
distinctions. Yet all of Europe, after World War I, had become fashion
conscious. At the same time mass-production facilities for good-quality
but inexpensive fabrics and clothes had come into being, in large part
as a result of the huge demand for uniforms during World War I. New
textile fibers, such as rayon and acetate, were coming on the market.
There was still, however, no massdistribution system in England for
well-designed, up-to-date, and inexpensive clothing for the masses.</p>
<p>Within a few years the new Marks andandandand Spencer had become the
leading clothing and textile distributor in England, a position held
ever since. By 1972 clothing sales accounted for a full three-quarters
of total Marks andandandand Spencer volume, i.e., for £327 million
(roughly 00 million).</p>
<p>After World War II the same thinking was applied to a new major
product category: food. During World War II the English people, formerly
known for their dogged resistance to any innovation in eating, learned
to accept new foods. Marks andandandand Spencer’s food business
accounted, in 1972, for the remaining one-fourth of its sales.</p>
<p>From having been a successful variety chain in the early twenties,
and even in the early thirties, Marks andandandand Spencer purposefully
changed itself into a highly distinct “specialty” marketer—maybe the
largest in the world.</p>
<p>The concentration decision then enabled the company to set specific
marketing objectives. The decision enabled it to decide who its customer
was and should be; what kind of store it needed and when; what pricing
policy to follow; and what market penetration to aim at.</p>
<p>The next area which Marks andandandand Spencer tackled was that of
innovation objectives. The clothing and textiles Marks andandandand
Spencer needed did not exist at the time. Marks andandandand Spencer
started out with quality control, like any other large retailer. But it
rapidly built its qualitycontrol laboratories into research, design, and
development centers. It developed new fabrics, new dyestuffs, new
processes, new blends, and so on. It developed designs and fashions.
Finally, it went out and looked for the right manufacturer, whom it
often had to help get started—for the existing old-line manufacturers
were for obvious reasons none too eager to throw in their lot with the
brash upstart who tried to tell them how to run their business. And
when, after World War II, the company moved into prepared and processed
foods, bakery goods, and dairy products, it applied the same innovative
approach to a new industry.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer set innovation goals in marketing. It
pioneered, for instance, in consumer research in the early thirties,
when such work was still so new* that Marks andandandand Spencer had to
develop the needed techniques.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer set objectives for the supply and
development of key resources. It early copied and adapted the Sears
program for recruiting, training, and developing managers. It set
objectives for the systematic development of financial resources, and
measurements to control the utilization of these resources. And it set
objectives for the development of its physical facilities, that is, for
retail stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>General Motors had a consumer research activity well before 1929. I
doubt that this was known to Marks andandandand Spencer, however; it was
not generally known even within the American automobile indastry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hand in hand with these objectives for resources went objectives for
their productivity. Marks andandandand Spencer had originally taken its
measurements and controls from America. In the twenties and early
thirties it began to set its own objectives for continuously improving
the productivity of key resources.</p>
<p>As a result, Marks andandandand Spencer has a singularly high
productivity of capital—surely one of the keys to its success.
Unnoticed, by and large—but fully as important—is the productivity of
the Marks andandandand Spencer retail store, which exceeds, to my
knowledge, anything to be found anyplace else, including even Sears,
Roebuck or Kresge, the acknowledged store-management virtuosi of the
American retail scene.</p>
<p>Up till the late twenties the expansion of Marks andandandand Spencer
had been achieved primarily by opening new stores. Since the thirties
Marks andandandand Spencer’s expansion has been achieved primarily by
making each store more productive and by raising sales per square foot
of selling space. Marks andandandand Spencer, measured by the number of
its stores, is still a small chain—there are only 250 stores. The stores
themselves are not large, even by English standards; the average selling
area is only 20,000 square feet per store. (The large American
supermarket, by comparison, goes up to 100,000 square feet.) Yet these
small stores sell something like million apiece a year, which is many
times what even highly successful retail stores of other companies do.
The only explanation is continual upgrading of volume per store, that
is, upgrading of merchandise, display, and sales per customer. Store
selling space is the controlling resource of a retail merchant; Marks
andandandand Spencer’s success in raising its utilization was central to
its performance.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer set objectives for its social
responsibilities, and especially for areas of major impact: its own work
force and its suppliers. It introduced “staff manageresses” into its
stores to look after the employees, to take care of personal problems,
and to make sure employees are treated with intelligence and compassion.
Personnel management remains the job of the store manager. The staff
manageress was set up to be the “people conscience” of the company.</p>
<p>Similarly Marks andandandand Spencer developed objectives for its
relations with its suppliers.</p>
<p>The more successfully a supplier works with Marks andandandand
Spencer, the more dependent upon the company he will be. To safeguard
the supplier against exploitation by the company became a concern of the
company’s management. It set out to develop a “putting out” system
which, unlike its pre-industrial predecessor of early eighteenth-century
England, would not impoverish the supplier and make him less secure but
would, on the contrary, enrich the supplier and give him security.</p>
<p>But what about a profit objective? The answer is that there has never
been one. Profit goals have been anathema at Marks andandandand Spencer.
Obviously the company is highly profitable and highly profit conscious.
But it sees profit not as an objective but as a requirement of the
business, that is, not as a goal but as a need. Profit, in the Marks
andandandand Spencer view, is the result of doing things right rather
than the purpose of business activity. It is, above all, determined by
what is necessary to attain company objectives. Profitability is a
measurement of how well the business discharges its functions in serving
market and customer. Above all, it is a restraint; unless profit is
adequate to cover the risks, a company will not be able to attain its
objectives.</p>
<p>I do not know how conscious Marks andandandand Spencer’s top
management was in the early years, the late twenties and early thirties,
of the full import of the decisions they then made. There was probably
no master plan. But the young key executives who were brought into the
firm in those years to take on new jobs such as innovation or the
development of productivity objectives and standards were fully aware
that their company had committed itself to a definition of what its
business was—and they knew what the definition entailed. They were
highly conscious of the company’s social and business objectives. They
knew what these objectives meant to each of them individually in terms
of performance goals, performance standards, and demands for their own
contribution.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer from the start converted objectives into
work assignments. It thought through what results and contributions were
needed in each objectives area. It</p>
<p>assigned responsibility for these results to someone and held him
accountable. And it measured performance and contribution against the
objectives.</p>
<p>The Lessons</p>
<p>The Marks andandandand Spencer story reaffirms the central importance
of thinking through “what our business is and what it should be.” But it
also shows that this, by itself, is not enough. The basic definition of
the business and of its purpose and mission have to be translated into
objectives. Otherwise, they remain insight, good intentions, and
brilliant epigrams which never became achievement.</p>
<p>The Marks andandandand Spencer story brings out the specifications
for objectives. Each of them will be discussed in some detail in the
next chapter. But here is the list:</p>
<p>3 Objectives must make possible concentration of resources and
efforts. They must winnow out the fundamentals among the goals of a
business so that the key resources of men, money, and physical
facilities can be concentrated. They must, therefore, be selective
rather than encompass everything.</p>
<p>4 There must be multiple objectives rather than a single objective.
Much of today’s lively discussion of management by objectives is
concerned with the search for the “one right objective.” This search is
not only likely to be as unproductive as the quest for the philosopher’s
stone; it does harm and mis-</p>
<p>directs.</p>
<p>To manage a business is to balance a variety of needs and goals. And
this requires multiple objectives.</p>
<p>5 Objectives are needed in all areas on which the survival of the
business depends. The specific targets, the goals in any objective area,
depend on the strategy of the individual business. But the areas in
which objectives are needed are the same for all businesses, for all
businesses depend on the same</p>
<p>factors for their survival.</p>
<p>Objectives, therefore, have to be set in these eight key areas:</p>
<p>The Basis for Work and Assignments</p>
<p>Objectives are the basis for work and assignments. They determine the
structure of the business the key activities which must be discharged,
and, above all, the allocation of people to tasks. Objectives are the
foundation for designing both the structure of the business and the work
of individual units and individual managers.</p>
<p>Objectives are always needed in all eight key areas. The area without
specific objectives will be neglected. Unless we determine what shall be
measured and what the yardstick of measurement in an area will be, the
area itself will not be seen. (On this see Chapter 39.)</p>
<p>The measurements available for the key areas of a business enterprise
are still haphazard by and large. We do not even have adequate concepts,
let alone measurements, except for market standing. For something as
central as profitability we have only a rubber yardstick; and we have no
real tools at all to determine how much profitability is necessary. In
respect to innovation and, even more, to productivity; we hardly know
more than that something ought to be done. In the other areas—including
physical and financial resources—we are reduced to statements of
intentions; we do not possess goals and measurements for their
attainment.</p>
<p>However, enough is known about each area to give a progress report at
least. Enough is known for each business to go to work on
objectives.</p>
<p>How To Use Objectives</p>
<p>We know one more thing about objectives: how to use them. If
objectives are only good intentions they are worthless. They must
degenerate into work. And work is always specific, always has—or should
have—clear, unambiguous, measurable results, a deadline and a specific
assignment of accountability.</p>
<p>But objectives that become a straitjacket do harm. Objectives are
always based on expectations. And expectations are, at best, informed
guesses. Objectives express an appraisal of factors that are largely
outside the business and not under its control. The world does not stand
still.</p>
<p>The proper way to use objectives is the way an airline uses schedules
and flight plans.</p>
<p>The schedule provides for the 9 A.M. flight from Los Angeles to get
to Boston by 5 P.M. But if there is a blizzard in Boston that day, the
plane will land in Pittsburgh instead and wait out the storm. The flight
plan provides for flying at 30,000 feet and for flying over Denver and
Chicago. But if the pilot encounters turbulence or strong headwinds he
will ask flight control for permission to go up another 5,000 feet and
to take the MinneapolisMontreal route. Yet no flight is ever operated
without schedule and flight plan. Any change is immediately fed back to
produce a new schedule and flight plan. Unless 97 per-</p>
<p>cent or so of its flights proceed on the original schedule and flight
plan—or within a very limited range of deviation from either—a well-run
airline gets another operations manager who knows his job.</p>
<p>Objectives are not fate; they are direction. They are not commands;
they are commitments. They do not determine the future; they are means
to mobilize the resources and energies of the business for the making of
the future.</p>
