“Temperamental Fit”</p>
<p>Tiish,ilypifidaoceu, tciief</p>
<p>within the unity of a common market. And a business can be highly
diversified and have fundamental unity if its businesses, its markets,
its products and product lines, and its ac- tivities are held together
in a common technology. Both a common market and a common technology
provide the first requirement for unity: a common language throughout
the entire organization. They make possible mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Of the two, unification in and through the market is more likely to
be successful.</p>
<p>Pepsi-Cola stayed in its own market when it bought Fritolay; a
manufacturer of snack foods—for a bottled soft drink is, of course, also
a “snack.” And Coca-Cola stayed within its market when it bought Minute
Maid, the pioneer of frozen orange juice. Unilever and Nestle, the two
giant multinationals of the European consumer goods industry; are in
many phases of packaged and processed products in a large number of
countries. But for all their products, the customer is the grocery store
or the supermarket. Similarly, Procter andandandand Gamble stayed within
its market when it bought a large regional coffee blender. Mich- elin,
the world’s oldest rubber tire manufacturer and, in fact, the pioneer in
pneumatic tires of the 1890s, diversified within the same market, the
automobilist, when it went into travel guides.</p>
<p>Provided there is true unity in the market, technology can be very
diverse indeed and yet not lead to the kind of diversification that is
splintering and complex.</p>
<p>One major pharmaceutical company has successfully added a chain of
medical labora- tories and a line of advanced diagnostic instruments to
its business. The technologies are totally different. But the customers
are the same—the practicing physicians who are in private practice or on
a hospital staff. They consider very much the same things “value” with
respect to prescription drugs, to medical tests, and to instruments.</p>
<p>There are two caveats to diversification within market unity. First,
the customer de- cides what the market is rather than the manufacturer.
It is not enough that a diversifica- tion appears to the manufacturer to
constitute another approach to the same and familiar</p>
<p>market. The customer must also see the new diversification as part of
the same market. Otherwise there is high risk of failure.</p>
<p>RCA, in the late 1940s, was probably the leading brand in the United
Slates for radios and phonographs. From the point of view of
manufacturing industry, these are “appli- ances.” It therefore must have
seemed logical to RCA to diversify into the rapidly grow- ing market for
kitchen appliances such as ranges and refrigerators. RCA clearly had the
engineering competence. It also had the distribution network. Yet RCA,
despite its re- sources, and despite the acknowledged high quality of
its products, did not succeed in the kitchen business. To the customer,
the housewife, the kitchen and the living room are different. Living
room appliances are not appliances. They are “furniture.” RCA’s famous
trademark did not, as the company confidently expected, create customer
acceptance. After a few years of struggle, RCA was forced to sell its
kitchen appliance business to an appliance manufacturer whose trademark
was established in the kitchen market, the Whirlpool Corporation, which
had long been supplying refrigerators and ranges to Sears, Roebuck.</p>
<p>This holds true for services as well as goods. And it holds true in
industrial markets too. Despite the prestige of General Electric as a
manufacturer of advanced electrical and electronic equipment, the buyers
of computers did not accept GE as a “superior” com- puter maker. The GE
computers were technically fully competitive. Yet GE could not establish
itself in the computer business and finally gave up.</p>
<p>Technical expertise is altogether unlikely to lead to a correct
definition of a “common market.” It is far more likely to work as the
foundation of unity for diversification into different markets.</p>
<p>For the customer is very likely not to consider as one market what to
the manufacturer or supplier appear as closely related products. He is
also quite likely to aggregate as one market what to the manufacturer or
supplier are clearly very different products or ser- vices, and even
quite different end uses and end users.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck carries, as do, of course, many retailers, a
staggering number of dif- ferent products in its stores and catalogs. It
also has developed a successful casualty in- surance company which has
become a leader in the competitive automobile insurance field. It has
launched a mutual fund. It has the largest chain of automotive repair
centers. And it has, at various times, organized book clubs and travel
services. What all these have in common is that these goods and services
are being bought by the American middle- class family and as part of its
normal “budget.” They fit into Sears’s definition of its busi- ness as
buyer for the American family. Technically there is a world of
difference between automobile insurance. But the same customer buys
them, very much the same way, and with the same value expectations.</p>
<p>The basic risk of the market definition is implied in these examples.
Foresight and analysis are highly unreliable tools to define a common
market. It is not easy to predict whether a given product or service
will actually fit into one’s market or not. It is not even easily
determined by market research. Only in the blinding light of hindsight
is it always obvious why this or that product that seemed such a perfect
fit did not succeed in what “should have been” its market.</p>
<p>No amount of market or consumer research, it is safe to say, would
have brought out the fact that the American housewife does not consider
kitchen appliances and living room radios part of the same product
category. After all, several companies were at that time successful in
both markets, e.g., General Electric, GM, and Westinghouse. And Sears
too had established itself successfully in both. After the RCA debacle
the reason for it became crystal clear. But by then it was too late.</p>
<p>The Need for a Business Strategy</p>
<p>The second caveat is that unity of the market will work on a basis of
diversification only if there is a true business strategy. It will not
work if diversification is mere aggregation.</p>
<p>A strategy always defines both what to include within the definition
of one’s business and what to exclude. One of the earliest and most
successful diversification policies based on market unity was the
“transportation company” which the Canadian Pacific Railroad built in
the early years of this century. Canadian Pacific built, on its railroad
foundation, a sizable chain of hotels across Canada and a large
steamship company operating both on the Atlantic and the Pacific (to
which was added, after World War II, a fair-sized interna- tional
airline). But the market that gave unity to CP’s businesses was not
transportation. It was the passenger. While the railroad, of course,
carried goods as well as people, the di- versification strategy focused
on the traveling public.</p>
<p>A diversification strategy should include a plan which defines the
role of each busi- ness within the entire enterprise. Diversification
strategy—like any other strategy—must serve as the basis for specific
goals, specific targets, specific assignments to specific busi-
nesses.</p>
<p>Diversification strategy explains the success of General Motors after
it had been reor- ganized—and in effect re-founded—around market unity
by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., in the early 1920s. The GM which Sloan
inherited was diversified on the basis of market unity but without any
strategy. It included half a dozen automobile businesses, each with its
own nameplate, its own engineering, its own policies, and its own
distribution network, but none with clear mission or identity. It had
been built by financial acquisitions and was essentially a conglomerate
even though its businesses were all primarily automotive. What made GM
effective is that Sloan revamped this structure on the basis of a
system- atic strategy. Despite tremendous opposition from within, he
took the grave risk of mov- ing an established nameplate, Oldsmobile,
out of its market segment and into a new and more logical one. He
completely changed the basic policy of Chevrolet and focused it on the
market which Chevrolet had been trying to avoid till then: the mass
market where Ford seemed to hold an impregnable position. He replaced
Oakland with an entirely new nameplate, Pontiac, to which he gave, from
the beginning, a clear position in the market and a clear strategy.</p>
<p>In contrast to Sloan, the men who merged the bulk of the
British-owned automobile companies into British Leyland Motors in the
sixties have kept a miscellany of name- plates, some with a clear market
of their own, some without much identity or personality. They went
apparently much further than Sloan did in internal rationalization of
manufac- turing facilities, interchangeability of parts and processes,
and effective cost control— things General Motors tackled only much
later. But they did not, as far as an outsider can discern, develop a
business strategy for a unified business, or a market strategy based
thereon.</p>
<p>General Motors emerged as the leader in the American automobile
industry within two or three years after Sloan’s reorganization. British
Leyland, five years after the merger that created it, had not
significantly improved its market position or its performance. It had
remained a conglomerate.</p>
<p>Each business within a diversified company, indeed each product line
and each distri- bution channel, needs its own plans, goals, and
strategies. Each needs to set clear objec- tives and to measure results
against expectations. Each needs, in other words, to be man- aged as an
autonomous business. But, at the same time, to obtain the results of
diversifica- tion, there has to be a unified strategy, an overall
design, a common mission for the entire business. There has to be
diversity in unity. Otherwise even a common market will not provide
unity. A common market makes unity possible. It is management that makes
it reality.</p>
<p>Technology as a Common Core of Unity</p>
<p>The second axis of successful diversification is technology. A common
technology can be used as the foundation for diversification into a
substantial number of quite different mar- kets.</p>
<p>It seems to be more difficult to build market diversification on
common technology than it is to build technological diversification on
market unity. Psychologically, the man- ager is likely to be respectful
of, and attentive to, different demands of different technolo- gies.
They are “rational.” But that different markets behave differently he is
far more likely to resist—indeed, to resent—as “irrational.” Expertise
in technology is readily iden- tified. It can be acquired
systematically, though not always in a “course.” Expertise in a market
is experience. It is “feel” rather than “fact.” It is understanding
rather than infor- mation.</p>
<p>For one major group of industries, technology-based diversification
is the only way to conduct their business. These are the materials or
process industries: steel, glass, alumi- num, paper, and copper. They
are “process-determined.” The only thing that can come out of a glass
kiln is glass. Yet these products go into every conceivable market.</p>
<p>The experience of the materials industries shows that
technology-based diversification is not easy. By and large these
industries have performed indifferently, at least since World War II—and
some have been among the poorest performers. They have al1 put great
emphasis on “marketing.” Many (as pointed out earlier in Chapter 46)
have used the design principle of simulated decentralization to create
near-autonomous units for specific markets. But they have found this no
royal road to success.</p>
<p>The materials industries were the leaders in nineteenth-century
industrial develop- ment. In terms of volume—let alone of capital
investment—they are still growing vigor- ously. But their products have
become “commodities,” earning not much more than their costs. The cause
is clearly the built-in diversity in the market which their technology
im- poses on them. The one exception seems to be petroleum. But
petroleum is the one mate- rials industry with market concentration. The
great bulk of the industry’s output are fuels for a very small number of
end uses: gasoline and diesel fuel for motor vehicles on land, sea, and
air, and fuel for power plants. Economically the petroleum industry is a
“market- ing industry” that has integrated backward into raw material
supply.</p>
<p>Even among the genuine materials companies, a few have done very
well. They ex- emplify both what can be done and how to do it.</p>
<p>An outstanding example may, well be an American glass manufacturer,
Corning Glass Works. Corning Glass is in a multitude of markets, from
special glasses for the most ad- vanced scientific uses, to tableware
for the mass market sold through hardware stores and supermarkets, to
receiving tubes for television sets and many others—all based on one
common technology: glassmaking.</p>
<p>With 00 million in sales in 197l and some 30,000 employees, Corning
is still a fairly small company compared to the materials giants of
petroleum, steel, and copper. But it is a very large company in its own
materials field. And it is both far more profitable and has shown far
faster growth than the great majority of materials businesses.</p>
<p>Outside of the materials field there are also examples of successful
technology-based diversification. Tateisi Electronics in Kyoto is not as
well known in the West as Sony but is in its own way as successful. The
company grew as a maker of industrial equipment such as control
instruments and switches. It built first on licenses from foreign, and
mostly from American, electronic companies. It then developed its own
technological competence in the electronics field. It has successfully
diversified into medical technol- ogy, first into the design and
production of highly sophisticated diagnostic tools, and then into the
design and production of electronically controlled artificial limbs. It
also has moved into the office equipment market with a line of desk
calculators, and so on. The markets for its products are diverse. The
technology is common.</p>
<p>“Technology” does not necessarily mean “science and engineering.”
Techne, the Greek word from which “technology” derives, means, after
all, “useful knowledge,” or “organized skill,” rather than
“engineering.”</p>
<p>The bank credit card, such as BankAmericard, was not “invented” by
the commercial banks and is surely not science or engineering. But it
required learning new and difficult skills. It represents genuine
diversification based on new techne.</p>
<p>A common technology provides a common language. It provides a
competitive edge.</p>
<p>It gives advantage in the marketplace. And it makes possible
diversification which does not splinter a business but unites it.</p>
<p>Some Basic Rules</p>
<p>Technology-based diversification, to be successful, requires
observance of same basic rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The technology must be specific. It must be a “skill,” a techne,
rather than a theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clichés such as communications or transportation are not a common
technology. The large broadcasting chains in the U.S. are undoubtedly in
communications. They have not covered themselves with glory in managing
book publishers. Nor, one suspects, would they do well publishing trade
magazines. The large American university floundered mis- erably when it
took on government contracts in urban and social problems, or in
interna- tional development, as an extension of its competence in
“knowledge” and in “teaching.”</p>
<p>Academic disciplines are not a “common technology,” if only because
they are theory- focused rather than skill-focused. Nor is competence in
“problem solving.” One can build a successful practice on problem
solving, e.g., as a consultant in operations research who applies his
tools to the problems of a client. One cannot say, “We know how to solve
problems and therefore can make or market any product or science where
‘problems’ ex- ist.”</p>
<p>Most managements tend to define “market” too narrowly. They tend to
see it as “the market for what we make” rather than as “the value the
customer pays for.” But many managements tend to define “technology”
much too broadly. They think it means “what we can intellectually
grasp.” What it really means is “what we can do with great skill and
high distinction.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The technology must be distinct. It must be able to endow a
company’s product with leadership characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is observance of this rule which explains why Corning Glass has
high performance while so many other materials companies produce
undifferentiated commodities and show only mediocre results. Corning has
stayed away from ordinary glass tableware, even though it has both the
technical and the productive capacity to make it. But in glass ta-
bleware there are no requirements above the ordinary glass technology.
The tableware and kitchenware which Corning makes and sells are based on
advanced or proprietary technology, such as making glass heat-resisting
or chip-proof. And when Corning went into an area of glass exploitation
in which the premium was on design and artistry rather than on glass
technology; that is, when it decided to go into the production of
specially designed and hand-blown art objects made from glass but meant
for collection rather than for use, it set this up as a completely
separate business, under its own name, Steuben Glass, with its own
management and its own marketing. Steuben has been highly success-
ful—but it is not managed as a part of Corning Glass, even though it is
wholly owned.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The technology in which a company has distinction must be central
rather than in- cidental to the product or service into which a company
diversifies. To disregard this rule invites frustration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bank credit card seemed a logical extension of “retail banking.”
Yet it turned out that the major skills of the commercial banker were
only incidental to the credit card business. New and very different
skills are required—mail selling, for instance, which has a highly
specialized technology, and credit control. As a result, the banks did
not do well for a long time. They signed up the customers all right—but
then lost their shirts. The Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, which had
pioneered the bank credit card, aban- doned the field after a few
disastrous years, as did the major banks in Chicago. The Bank of
America, which took over when the Chase gave up, then spent five years
or more to learn the new skills.</p>
<p>The American paper industry presents good examples of both the right
way and the wrong—or at least, unduly risky—way of using technology as a
base for diversification.</p>
<p>A few, mostly medium-sized, companies extended the standard and
well-known technol- ogy of papermaking into new consumer markets, making
and selling, for instance, facial tissues. They were highly successful
(though a non-papermaker, Procter andandandand Gamble, has been equally
successful in parts of this field, e.g., disposable diapers, where it
used its knowledge of consumer marketing to diversify in technology and
product beyond its original oil, soap, and fat-based business).</p>
<p>By contrast, many, especially the very large, paper companies have
unsuccessfully spent millions of dollars and years of effort on
establishing themselves in the market for “technical” papers—paper for
photographic or inkless reproduction; heat-conducting or heat-reactive
paper; light reactive or electricity-conducting paper, and many others.
They were right in their assumptions: the market for technical paper has
been growing very fast and has high profit potential. But the paper
companies, it turned out, were wrong in their belief that paper
technology is a central element in making technical paper. The central
technologies are surface physics and surface chemistry; the paper is
merely a—rather in- cidental—carrier.</p>
<p>The paper industry example—but also the bank credit card—shows that
it is not easy to predict whether a given technology will be central to
a new market or a new product line or service. It may indeed be even
more difficult to predict the applicability of tech- nology than to
predict whether a given new product or service will fit into one’s old
mar- ket and market understanding.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, technological-based diversification needs basic strategy as
much as does market-based diversification. And the strategy is more
complex and more difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>The examples given so far of technology-based diversification all
dealt with new and additional products, services, or businesses. But
technology can be productively exploited in a number of ways of which
doing it oneself is only one. “What is the best way to ex- ploit our
technology” should always be asked in considering diversification of
one’s techne.</p>
<p>One of the leading pharmaceutical companies has a firm rule. Whenever
research comes up with a new development that seems to have high
promise, top management sits down with the research and marketing people
and asks, “For which of our competitors would this be an ideal
development? Into whose product line, whose market, whose ex- pertise
would this development fit the best, provided it really works out?” “We
do not ask this question,” says one of the firm’s senior executives,
“because we prefer to sell a de- velopment, least of all to a
competitor. We ask this question in the first place to force our- selves
to think through what the development will require from us to live up to
its prom- ise, what strategy we should work out, what resources will be
needed, and what we can eventually expect. But in almost half the cases,
this question has led us not to go ahead, ourselves and alone.</p>
<p>“Occasionally, as a result of this question, we have decided to
abandon what at first seemed to be a highly promising development. It
turned out not to be so promising after all. Instead of a major new
addition to the physicians’ arsenal of disease-fighting drugs, it would
have been a nice scientific curiosity, with little therapeutic
differentiation. But more often, we have come to the conclusion that the
development, while indeed highly promising, is not for us. It may be a
development that, if successfully carried to conclu- sion, will result
in a drug with significant disease-fighting properties, but for a very
nar- row range of diseases or for a very limited segment of the medical
practice. Then the drug fits better into the product line of a small
company which specializes in the area, a com- pany for which this drug
is really a major product, where for us it would be a complica- tion
requiring marketing efforts that lie essentially outside our business
and our market. In other cases, while the development seemed to lead to
a product line with substantial sales potential, we still sometimes have
come to the conclusion that we might as well license it, and either
become one company among many that produce the product or let others do
it altogether. We have done this, for instance, with a few drugs mainly
applicable to tropical diseases where we have very little marketing
strength. We have licensed developments where the end result was likely
to be a single drug in a market, e.g., pain-killers, in which</p>
<p>we have no other drugs in the line so that we would have had to mount
a major marketing effort to sell just one drug where the physician needs
half a dozen to choose from.</p>
<p>“In a few cases, we decided to use the development to build on it a
joint venture with other companies, usually with chemical companies
which have production expertise which was needed for this particular
drug category and which we do not possess. I cannot recall a single case
where we abandoned, sold, licensed, or joint-ventured a development we
should have held on to. If we made a mistake, it is by holding on to too
many of our own developments, by being too reluctant to accept the fact
that the development of our own research, no matter how exciting and
promising, could still not be the right thing for us, or that we could
not be the right company to do the development and marketing job.”</p>
<p>Yet, this company is known above all for the breadth of its product
line and for its leadership position, domestic as well as international,
in the major end-use markets of the pharmaceutical industry. For its
policy has enabled it to focus on the developments of major
significance. It has, at the same time, enabled it to derive maximum
benefit from its technological resources. It derives almost one-third of
its income from drugs and chemi- cals that it pioneered but does not
make itself, but has sold, licensed, or joint-ventured.</p>
<p>Another strategy requirement is to identify and define what
additional or new technol- ogy is needed to put existing technology into
new products, services, or markets.</p>
<p>This was the question the large American commercial banks did not ask
when they originally went into bank credit cards. They saw the skills
that “fitted,” but not the ones they lacked. And a corollary is the
question “And what old technology do we need to abandon or play down
because it does not fit the new products, services, or markets?”</p>
<p>A small company had for many years based its business of blending and
marketing grass seed throughout the U.S. on highly developed technical
competence in testing soils and supplying a custom-blended seed mixture
based on the test. When it decided to diver- sify into “lawn-care
products”—that is, into fertilizers, weed controls, pesticides, and her-
bicides based on its knowledge of the techne of lawn making and lawn
maintenance—it decided that it had to abandon the very expertise on
which its earlier business had largely been based: the expertise in soil
testing. To make its fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides truly
distinctive and effective they had to be able to produce good results
with any seed package bearing the company’s label. And this, of course,
meant uniform seed blends, at least for major climatic zones. This
entailed major work on developing and testing new seed blends. It also
was a highly risky thing to do. Yet it explains, in large measure, the
success of the company’s fertilizers and weed controls which, within a
decade, made it into a fair-sized business and gave it leadership
position in a market many times as large as its original seed
market.</p>
<p>Finally, technology-based diversification often requires new
marketing knowledge and new marketing strategy.</p>
<p>GM succeeded in diversifying into diesel locomotives because it
recognized this. It failed in aircraft engines because it did not
recognize this. Its Electromotive Division was based or a technological
development: the re-engineering of the diesel engine. But it suc-
ceeded—to the point of having a virtual monopoly position in the
market—because of a clear recognition that the railroads were a very
different market and required hard, consis- tent work and new marketing
strategies. GM also acquired a small aircraft engine maker, Allison, as
a vehicle for technology-based diversification. Despite substantial
technologi- cal achievements, at least in the early years before the jet
engine, Allison has never amounted to much. It took for granted that the
aircraft market was not much different from the markets GM knows,
understands, and is active in.</p>
<p>The “Extended Technological Family”</p>
<p>The most challenging problem in technology-based diversification is
what one might call “the extended technological family”: the business
that is being pushed into diversification through the inherent dynamics
of technology and its tendency to “branch.” In their origin,</p>
<p>these businesses have a common technological ancestor: electricity or
chemistry. But then technology “branched.”</p>
<p>The electrical giants of today, Siemens and AEG in Germany, the
American and Brit- ish General Electric Companies, Westinghouse,
Philips, and Hitachi, all grew out of what was a hundred years ago, the
common technology of “electricity.” But step by step they have
diversified into an almost infinite number of different businesses with
different mar- kets, from nuclear generators to toasters. All of them
have something to do with electric- ity. But in many of them,
electricity is a minor rather than the essential factor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the chemical giants grew out of what a century ago was a
unified discipline and, step by step, branched into a multitude of
different technologies, processes, and mar- kets. The ancestors of I.G.
Farben in Germany, Du Pont, Monsanto, and Union Carbide in the United
States, and Imperial Chemical in England all grew out of narrow
technologies. The descendants are in scores of markets and in as many
technologies: in industrial prod- ucts and consumer goods, in textile
fibers and in explosives, in dyestuffs, in pharmaceuti- cals, and in
food additives.</p>
<p>Are these “natural conglomerates” viable? Are they manageable? Are
they optimal? A short time ago such questions would have seemed
preposterous. These technology-linked natural conglomerates were so
clearly the major success stories of the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. But while they still dominate the industrial landscape these
ex- tended technological families no longer possess the clear advantages
they seemed to enjoy not so long ago. All around them there are
businesses which, concentrating on one field within these extended
technologies, are doing very well indeed and are, in many cases,
steadily increasing their market shares.</p>
<p>It is perhaps even more ominous that the major innovations within
their own technol- ogy, no longer seem to come from these giants—even
though they are the companies with the large research labs and lavish
research budgets. Pharmaceutical sales of U.S. compa- nies grew from 00
million in 1945 to some billion in 1970—most of it in products that did
not exist in 1945. Practically none of these products were developed by
the chemical giants, whether American or European. It is not GE or RCA
who have the com- puter but companies that started small and were
innocent of electronic technology such as IBM, Remington Rand (Univac),
an old typewriter manufacturer, or Honeywell, which had grown as a
manufacturer of switches and simple controls. Even in electronics, the
most successful firms are specialists such as Texas Instruments or Sony,
which make a very small corner of the electronics technology their
province rather than attempt to di- versify into all the possible
businesses in which electronics play a role.</p>
<p>It may well be that the extended technological family is becoming
outmoded as a business strategy. It may represent a transition phase in
the development of a technology similar to that of diversification into
many different businesses within a small, confined economy discussed in
the preceding chapter. In the early stages of a new major technol- ogy
there is sometimes not enough scope for the full exploitation of new
knowledge and skill within one area or a few areas. Simultaneous
development into many areas to which the new technology applies is
optimal. Beyond a certain stage—characterized as much by the size of the
markets at by the proliferation or branching of the technology into many
directions— “electricity” or “chemistry” or “electronics” ceases to
provide a “common technology.” But so probably do “banking” or
“retailing.” Beyond this stage diversifica- tion becomes splintering and
counterproductive.</p>
<p>That this might be the case is indicated by the fact that most of
these giant extended technological families have a few areas in which
they have strength and maintain their leadership position: GE and
Westinghouse in heavy electrical apparatus, Philips in con- sumer
electronics, Union Carbide in metallurgical chemistry, Du Pont in
textile fibers and so on. In these areas they also maintain their
innovative capacity. The reason for the rela- tive sluggishness and
vulnerability of these companies is not “poor management” but “spotty
management.” It is not that they are in too few “good” businesses but
that they are in too many that do not “fit.”</p>
<p>Only the General Electric Company among the major extended
technological families seems so far to have faced up to these questions.
At least GE in the sixties and early sev- enties quietly went out of a
number of businesses—in the consumer goods as well as the industrial
products areas—in which electricity had become an incidental, rather
than an essential factor.</p>
<p>The extended technological family is at the limit of manageable
diversification. What holds it together is common history rather than
common task.</p>
<p>What Does Not Work</p>
<p>Attempts to diversify, without either a foundation in common market
or in common tech- nology are doomed to frustration. They result
essentially in unmanageable businesses; that is, in businesses that do
well in fair weather but flounder when the wind starts blowing.</p>
<p>The most nearly manageable of these is the business that diversifies
simultaneously along both axes—that of market and that of
technology.</p>
<p>One of the leading multinational companies started out a century ago
with a process to extract starch from corn (maize). Out of this basis of
a common technology, it grew stead- ily into industrial products such as
adhesives, glues, and coatings, and into a whole range of consumer
products. For the last thirty years or so, the emphasis has been on the
devel- opment of consumer products. To the original corn-based products,
a whole list of’ other product lines, condensed soups, for instance, and
mayonnaise, were added—all aimed at the processed foods market, that is,
at the grocer or supermarket. Yet the industrial prod- ucts business was
continued. The company’s performance, whether measured by growth or by
profits, has been outstanding in processed foods where corn-based
products now account for a fairly small share of sales. The industrial
products business, by contrast, has not done so well. It has not
developed new products out of the original cornstarch tech- nology. And
it has not been able to move into new technologies, that is, into
synthetic glues, adhesives, or coatings based on petrochemicals and
polymerization. It produces volume and grinds up a great deal of corn.
But it no longer achieves market standing, let alone substantial
profits.</p>
<p>The reason is probably not that cornstarch is an “old technology.” A
number of smaller (but still sizable) competitors who have stayed with
the corn-based technology and have made it the foundation for their
diversification are doing well. The reason is that market-based
diversification and technology-based diversification require different
man- agement thinking, different management attitudes, different
strategies, and raise different questions. Either management, especially
top management, will be divided, or one atti- tude and point of view
will prevail to the neglect of the other. It is perhaps not impossible
to develop and manage a diversified business that has both axes of
diversification. But it is certainly difficult.</p>
<p>“Countercyclical” Diversification</p>
<p>Diversification to make a business “countercyclical,” e.g., by
balancing cyclical strengths and risks of a capital goods business
against the different cyclical strengths and risks of a consumer goods
business, rarely works.</p>
<p>It is not true that these two kinds of businesses tend to behave
radically differently in cyclical fluctuations. Or rather they do so
only in the kind of cyclical fluctuation that mat- ters the least; that
is, the relatively mild and relatively short downturn, which is the
classi- cal “recession” of business cycle theory. Then sometimes some
consumer goods do in- deed show greater strength than capital goods. But
where it really matters—that is, both on the upside and the downside of
a major business cycle—the two businesses behave pretty much the same
way. What the consumer goods business may gain in a severe downturn in
terms of sales volume, it is likely to lose through higher credit losses
and lower margins.</p>
<p>The Illusion of “Financial Synergism”</p>
<p>Equally fallacious is the attempt to diversify by marrying a business
with a high demand for capital to a business with a high cash throw-off.
A healthy and growing business rarely produces cash surpluses for very
long.</p>
<p>The one exception to this, the acquisition by manufacturing companies
with substan- tial cash needs of investment businesses such as insurance
companies, for instance, is per- nicious on other grounds. An investment
company, such as an insurance company, a sav- ings bank, or a commercial
bank, is a fiduciary. Its first duty is to invest the money en- trusted
to it in the best interests of its policyholders and depositors, and to
be totally un- swayed by any other consideration. If it is part of an
industrial company, it may subject itself to pressures to invest its
funds which are incompatible with its first duty to its de- positors or
policyholders. And a fiduciary owes it to its trust not to expose itself
even to the most unfounded suspicion that there exists such a conflict
of duties and interests.</p>
<p>Financial “synergy” is a will-o’-the-wisp. It looks good on paper,
but it fails to work out in practice. For two and two to make more than
four—indeed for two and two in busi- ness even to add up to four—a great
deal more “fit” is needed than money alone. Money is universal in that
every effort requires it and every economic value can be expressed in
it. But for that reason money by itself is symbol rather than economic
value and reality. Yet in diversification, economic realities and
economic values have to fit—and this means market, productivity,
technology, and management.</p>
<p>The “financial strategy” that was most popular in the sixties in the
U.S. and England, that is, “acquisition by price/earnings ratio” is even
unsound as a purely financial maneu- ver. It is, in fact, not much more
than a confidence game. To buy a business not because it makes sense as
a business but because the accident of stock-market valuation makes it
possible to acquire it and obtain an immediate increase in the buyer’s
per share earn- ings—i.e., by paying for a stock with a low
price/earnings ratio with a share with a high price/earnings ratio—is
financial sleight-of-hand. It creates “leverage,” that is, raises ap-
parent earnings per share and with it stock prices in a rising economy
and a rising market. But leverage always works in both directions. In a
sagging economy and a sagging stock market such acquisition policy
therefore creates at the slightest setback sharply lower per share
earnings and collapsing stock prices. Such an “acquisition policy” is
simply another variation of the old game of “pyramiding” that was so
popular in the U.S. in the twenties and—deservedly—was outlawed in the
thirties, in which companies sold bonds to buy up the shares of other
companies. The people who fell for it and sold their companies to the
financial manipulators and their “takeover bids” usually found this out
fairly soon— unless they immediately sold the securities they got in the
merger.</p>
<p>To diversify for the sake of diversification rather than because it
is the best thing to do for the business and for its performance and
growth is always a mistake. Yet the grass always tends to be greener on
the other side of the fence. It is always easy to say, “We break our
backs in this business for a 6 percent return on capital; look at this
or that indus- try where they make 20 percent—and then let’s find a
cheap company in that industry and buy it.” But there are almost always
very good reasons why a company is available, let alone why it can be
bought cheaply. Second, the acquired company will not retain its
profitability, very long. The management that knew how to run it is
unlikely to stay. And the management that has bought the company does
not understand the business and is unlikely to make the right decisions
or to put in the right people.</p>
<p>Equally, diversification will fail if its aim is to cure the
weaknesses and vulnerabilities of a business by going into other and
different businesses. It is obviously unsound to say, “Because we are
not competent to manage our own business, we better go into another one
of which we know even less.” Yet this is, in effect, what a company says
which, in order to cure a weakness of its own, acquires another business
which supposedly has the needed strengths.</p>
<p>The same multinational cornstarch-based company mentioned above,
aware of its weakness in chemical technology outside of the milling of
cornstarch, bought a small</p>
<p>company in the polymer-chemical field to obtain its apparently highly
knowledgeable management. Within two years the polymer chemists had
left—as managements of ac- quired companies will do under such
circumstances. And then the cornstarch company found that it could not
manage a business of which it understood neither the technology nor the
markets.</p>
<p>In diversification one has to build on strength. Diversification will
be successful only if it promises a greater return on what one can do,
and do well. It has to be an extension of one’s proven performance
capacity. Whenever management contemplates diversification, whether
through grassroots growth or through acquisition, it should ask, “If
this new busi- ness got into trouble, would we know how to fix it?” If
the answer is no, one better stay away from it. For any business, and
especially a new one or a newly acquired one, will predictably get into
trouble sooner or later, and usually sooner. And then it is the parent
company and the parent company’s top management who have the
responsibility for knowing what action to take and for taking it.</p>
<p>The Need for “Temperamental Fit”</p>
<p>One more thing remains to be said about the management of diversity
and complexity. There is one absolute requirement for successful
diversification: “temperamental” unity. Even if the diversity is
embedded in the common unity of the market or in the common unity of a
technology, it will not work if the diversified businesses, product
lines, markets, or technologies are not compatible in their values.
There must be a common “personal- ity.” There must be what I would call
a “temperamental fit.”</p>
<p>Many of the major pharmaceutical companies diversified into cosmetics
and per- fumes. Not one of them has been successful. No one in a
pharmaceutical business really respects cosmetics and perfumes. To
people who see themselves as engaged in a humani- tarian, a serious, a
scientific task, cosmetics are “frivolous.”</p>
<p>One of the major electrical companies found itself in the years after
World War II suddenly a pioneer in an important area of chemistry. In
order to provide better materials for such uses in its own products as
insulation in electrical apparatus and appliances, or tops for ranges,
the company had gone into chemical research and had, much to its sur-
prise, come up with some major inventions and technical breakthroughs.
It decided to build on this a specialty chemicals business—and has been
totally unsuccessful. “We have the basic patents but the chemical
companies have the market,” commented one of the senior executives of
the company. “We should have licensed our patents right away rather than
try to become ourselves a major chemical producer.” The company has
invested more capital in its chemical businesses than chemical companies
would have done for the same sales volume. It has put good men into
chemical management and it has continued productive research work. But a
chemical business in its basic “temperament” is so differ- ent from the
mechanical businesses with which an electrical apparatus manufacturer is
familiar that decisions and timing were always “a little off.”</p>
<p>It took Sears, Roebuck almost twenty years to learn to market
high-fashion merchan- dise. Sears’s top management, from General Wood
down, insisted on the need to become a leader in high-fashion
merchandise. But no one at Sears, from General Wood down, really
respected high fashion. To Sears, basic “values” were utility, wearing
quality, dura- bility, washability—all sterling virtues, to be sure, but
not what the fashion buyer consid- ers “value.” It was not until a whole
management generation at Sears had passed out of the picture that Sears
was able to develop a successful high-fashion business.</p>
<p>That a business has to “fit” temperamentally and in its values is the
fundamental rea- son why the conglomerates cannot really work. Their
trouble is not only that they try to manage a diversity of markets, of
technologies, of products beyond what any one man- agement can truly
know and can truly understand. Their basic problem is that they try to
manage businesses that cut across a wide range of “temperaments,” of
“values,” of “per- sonalities.” This by itself guarantees that in making
the crucial decisions, the conglomer- ate will make the wrong
decisions.</p>
