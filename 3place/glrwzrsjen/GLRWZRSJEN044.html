<h4 id="the-building-blocks-of-organization">42 The Building Blocks of
Organization…</h4>
<p>The Four Tasks of the Organizer—Finding the Key Activities—Key
Vulnerabilities— Values—When Key Activities Have to Be Reanalyzed—The
Contributions Analysis— Revenue-Producing Activities—Result-Producing
Work—Support Work—The “Con- science” Areas—Making Service Staffs
Effective—The Two Faces of Information— Information: An Unanswered
Organization Problem—Hygiene and Housekeeping— Contribution Determines
Function</p>
<p>N DESIGNING THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ORGANIZATION four questions face
the organizer.</p>
<p>1 What should the units of organization be?</p>
<p>2 What components should join together, and what components should be
kept apart?</p>
<p>3 What size and shape pertain to different components?</p>
<p>4 What is the appropriate placement and relationship ot different
units?</p>
<p>From the earliest beginnings of work on organization, well over a
century ago, these were the tasks to which the organizer had to address
himself before he could design struc- ture.</p>
<p>We therefore now have a considerable amount of experience. There are
no prescrip- tions for the design of the building blocks or for the
design of the structure itself. But one can clearly indicate what the
right approaches are and what approaches are unlikely to work.</p>
<p>The traditional approach to the identification of the basic units of
organization has been to analyze all the activities needed for
performance in the enterprise.* This then re- sults in a list of typical
functions of a manufacturing business or of a retail business.</p>
<p>This approach to the typical functions sees organization as
mechanical, as an assem- blage of functions. But organization has to be
“organic.” Organizations will indeed use typical activities—though not
necessarily all of them. But how the structure is to be built depends on
what results are needed. Organizing has to start out with the desired
results.</p>
<p>The Key Activities</p>
<p>What we need to know are not all the activities that might
conceivably have to be housed in the organization structure. What we
need to know are the load-bearing parts of the structure, the key
activities.</p>
<p>Organization design, therefore, starts with these questions:</p>
<p>*I still followed this approach in The Practice of Management in
1954.</p>
<p>In what area is excellence required to obtain the company’s
objectives?</p>
<p>In what areas would lack of performance endanger the results, if not
the survival, or the enterprise?</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the kind of conclusions these questions
lead to. Sears, Roebuck in the United States and Marks andandandand
Spencer in England are in many ways re- markably similar, if only
because the founders and builders of Marks andandandand Spencer con-
sciously modeled their company on Sears, Roebuck. But there is a
pronounced difference in the organizational placement and organizational
role of the “laboratory” in these two companies. Sears, which defines
its business as being “the buyer for the American fam- ily,” uses its
laboratory to test the merchandise it buys. Accordingly, the laboratory,
while large, competent, and respected, is organizationally quite
subordinate. Marks andandandand Spencer, on the other hand, defined its
business as mentioned earlier (Chapter 8), as “developing upper-class
goods for the working-class family.” As a result, the laboratory is
central to Marks andandandand Spencer’s organization structure. The
laboratory rather than the buyer decides what new products are
desirable, develops the new merchandise, designs it, tests it, and then
gets it produced. Only then does the buyer take over. As a result, the
head of the Marks andandandand Spencer laboratory is a senior member of
management and, in many ways, the chief business planner.</p>
<p>Any company that shows outstanding success will be found to have made
the key ac- tivities—and especially those in which excellence is needed
to attain business perform- ance and business objectives—the central,
load-carrying elements in its organization structure.</p>
<p>But equally important are the questions “In what areas could
malfunction seriously damage us? In what areas do we have major
vulnerability?” They are questions, however, that are much less often
asked.</p>
<p>The New York brokerage community, by and large, did not ask it. If it
had, it would have realized that malfunction of the “back office,” where
customer orders, customer ac- counts and securities are handled, could
seriously endanger the business. Failure to organ- ize the back office
as a key activity was the single most important cause for the severe
crisis that overtook Wall Street in 1969 and 1970 and destroyed a good
many of the best- known and apparently most successful firms. The one
Wall Street firm, however, that had asked those questions, Merrill
Lynch, and had organized the back office as a load-bearing key activity
in its structure, emerged from the crisis the giant of the brokerage
business.</p>
<p>Finally, the question should be asked “What are the values that are
truly important to us in this company?” It might be product or process
safety. It might be product quality. It might be the ability of the
company dealers to give proper service to the customer and so on.
Whatever the values are, they have to be organizationally anchored.
There has to be an organizational component responsible for them—and it
has to be a key component.</p>
<p>These three questions will identify the key activities. And they in
turn will be the load- bearing, the structural elements of organization.
The rest, no matter how important, no matter how much money they
represent, no matter how many people they employ, are secondary.
Obviously, they will have to be analyzed, organized, and placed within
the structure. But the first concern must be those activities that are
essential to the success of a bussiness strategy and to the attainment
of business objectives. They have to be identi- fied, defined,
organized, and centrally placed.</p>
<p>An analysis of key activities is needed in the business that has been
going for some time, and especially in the business that has been going
well. In such a business the analy- sis will invariably reveal that
important activities are either not provided for or are left hanging in
midair to be performed in a haphazard fashion. It will almost invariably
bring out activities that, once important, have lost most of their
meaning but continue to be or- ganized as major activities. It will
demonstrate that historically meaningful groupings no longer make sense
but have, instead, become obstacles to proper performance. And it will
certainly lead to the discovery of unnecessary activities that should be
eliminated.</p>
<p>The new business needs such thinking. But the greatest need for
key-activity analysis is found in the business that has been growing
fast (see Chapter 60). Rapid growth is both</p>
<p>a disorganized and a disorganizing process. The enterprise that
starts out, so to speak, in a lowly but functional two-room cottage,
puts in, as it grows, a new wing here, an attic there, a partition
elsewhere, until it is housed in a twenty-six-room monstrosity in which
all but the oldest inhabitants need a St. Bernard to bring them back
from the water cooler. To reorganize mechanically in such a
situation—the usual approach—will make things worse. To copy the “GM
organization” in such a situation will put on a tremendous super-
structure of “staff “ and “coordinators” without remedying the basic
structural defects. Only a key-activities analysis starting out from
objectives and strategy can provide the organization structure the
business really needs.</p>
<p>A business should always analyze its organization structure when its
strategy changes.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason—a change in market or in technology,
diversification or new objec- tives—a change in strategy requires a new
analysis of the key activities and an adaptation of the structure to
them. Conversely, reorganization that is undertaken without a change in
strategy is either superfluous or indicates poor organization to begin
with.</p>
<p>The Contributions Analysis</p>
<p>From the earliest days of concern with organization, a hundred years
ago, the most con- troversial question has been “What activities belong
together and what activities belong apart?” A number of answers have
been given over the years.</p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest one was the German division of a business into
two major areas: the “technical,” embracing research, engineering, and
production, and the “commercial,” embracing sales and finance. Somewhat
later came “line” and “staff,” which tried to dis- tinguish “operating”
and non-operating “advisory” activities. Finally there was Henri Fayol’s
analysis of functions, defined (too narrowly) as “bundles of related
skills,” which still underlies the typical organization of most
businesses.</p>
<p>All of these have merit. But a more searching analysis is needed
which groups activi- ties by the kind of contribution they make. There
are, by and large, four major groups of activities, if distinguished by
their contribution.</p>
<p>There are, first, result-producing activities—that is, activities
which produce measur- able results which can be related, directly or
indirectly, to the results and performance of the entire enterprise.
Some of these activities are directly revenue-producing. Others con-
tribute measurable results.</p>
<p>There are, second, support activities which, while needed, and even
essential, do not by themselves produce results but have results only
through the use made of their “out- put” by other components within the
business.</p>
<p>There are, third, activities which have no direct or indirect
relationship to the results of the business, activities which are truly
ancillary. They are hygiene and housekeeping activities.</p>
<p>Finally, and different in character from any of these, is the
top-management activity (which will be discussed separately in Chapters
49 through 52).</p>
<p>Among the result-producing activities, there are some that directly
bring in revenues (or, in service institutions, directly produce
“patient care” or “learning”). Here belong innovating activities,
selling and all the work needed to do a systematic and organized selling
job, such as sales forecasting, market research, sales training, and
sales manage- ment. Here also belongs the treasury function, that is,
the supply and management of money in the business.</p>
<p>In a commercial bank, all lending operations, the fiduciary
activities of managing other people’s money, and, of course, the
money-making operation of the bank itself, that is, the management of
its own liquid funds, are revenue-producing activities. In a depart-
ment store buying and selling are always revenue-producing operations
(and at Marks andandandand Spencer innovation has also been a
revenue-producing activity). In a life insurance com- pany selling is
obviously revenue-producing. But so is the actuarial activity insofar as
it develops new types or policy; and finally, investment is an
important—in many insurance companies the most
important—revenue-producing activity.</p>
<p>duce a “finished product” that is needed by everyone in the system.
Information perform- ance can also be defined and measured, or at least
appraised. Yet information, by itself, does not produce any revenue. It
is “supply” to revenue and cost centers alike.</p>
<p>First among the “support” activities which do not by themselves
produce a “product”</p>
<p>but are “input” to others stand the “conscience” activities. These
activities set standards, create vision, and demand excellence in all
the key areas where a business needs to strive for excellence.</p>
<p>Conscience activities tend to be slighted in most organizations. But
every company— and every service institution—needs to provide itself and
its managers with vision, with values, with standards, and with some
provision for auditing performance against these standards.</p>
<p>There are indeed in all larger businesses people who are supposed to
do this job, usu- ally the executives who head up major “service
staffs.” But their first duty is not to be the organization’s conscience
but to be servant of, and advisor to, operating managers. As a result
they rarely get around to doing the conscience job systematically.
Instead they run departments.</p>
<p>Another support function is advice and teaching, i.e., the
traditional service staffs. The contribution is not in what the activity
itself does or can do, but the impact it has on the ability of others to
perform and to do. The “product” is an increased performance capacity of
the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>A good many of the “relations activities are also “support”—as is the
legal staff, or the patent department.</p>
<p>The last group of activities defined by their contribution are the
hygiene and house- keeping activities, ranging from the medical
department to the people who clean the floor, from the plant cafeteria
to the management of pension and retirement funds, from finding a plant
site to taking care of all the manifold record-keeping requirements
imposed on business by government. These functions contribute nothing
directly to the results and performance of the business. Their
malfunction, however, can damage the business. They serve legal
requirements, the morale of the work force, or public responsibilities.
Of all activities they are the most diverse. And of all activities they
tend to get the shortest shrift in most organizations.</p>
<p>This is a very rough classification, and far from scientific. Some
activities may be put into one category in one business, into another
one in another, and in a third company will be left fuzzy and without
clear classification at all.</p>
<p>In some manufacturing companies, manufacturing is a cost center. It
contributes re- sults but does not generate revenue. But there are some
true manufacturing businesses, i.e., businesses whose revenue is
generated by manufacturing sans research, sans engi- neering, sans
selling. There are businesses where licensing, selling, and buying of
patents are major revenue producers.</p>
<p>Purchasing, while normally a support activity, can also be defined as
part of a result- contributory activity: “materials management,” which
includes manufacturing and physi-</p>
<p>cal distribution, all three managed together to minimize costs of
goods and money needs, and maximize quality, delivery, and customer
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why classify then? The answer is that activities that differ in
contribution have to be treated differently. Contribution determines
ranking and placement.</p>
<p>Key activities should never be subordinated to non-key
activities.</p>
<p>Revenue-producing activities should never be subordinated to
non-revenue-producing activities.</p>
<p>And support activities should never be mixed with revenue-producing
and result- contributory activities. They should be kept apart.</p>
<p>The “Conscience” Activities</p>
<p>Activities that are the conscience of an organization must never be
subordinated to any- thing else. They also should never be placed with
any other activity; they should be clearly separate.</p>
<p>The conscience function of giving vision, of setting standards, and
of auditing per- formance against these standards is basically a
top-management function. But it has to work with the entire management
group. Every business, even a small business, needs this function. In a
small business, it need not be set up as a separate function but can be
dis- charged as part of the top-management job. In any business of more
than medium size, however, the function has usually to be set up and
staffed separately.</p>
<p>However, there should be very few people actually doing the
conscience job. It is a job for a single individual rather than a staff.
It is a job for a man whose performance has earned the respect of the
management group. It is not a job for a “specialist.” It is best
discharged by a senior member of the management group with proven
performance record who has manifested concern, perception, and interest
in the area for which he is supposed to act as the conscience.</p>
<p>Only those few areas that are vital and central to a company’s
success and survival should become areas of conscience. Objectives and
strategy determine what conscience activities are needed. Managing
people is always a conscience area, and so is marketing. The impact of a
business on its environment, its social responsibilities and basic
relations with the outside community, are also basic conscience areas.
Innovation (whether techno- logical or social innovation) is likely to
be a conscience area for any large business.</p>
<p>Beyond these, however, there is no formula.</p>
<p>Conscience work is incompatible with operating and with giving
advice. The only ac- tivity that should “report” to a man in charge of a
conscience activity is auditing the actual performance of managers. For
it is not enough to have vision and to set standards. Per- formance of
the organization against these standards needs to be appraised
regularly.</p>
<p>“Conscience,” many people will argue, is a very strong, in addition
to being a rather strange, term. But it is the right term. The task of
the conscience activities is not to help the organization do better what
it is already doing. The task is to remind the organization all the time
of what it should be doing and isn’t doing. The task is to be
uncomfortable, to hold up the ideal against the everyday reality, to
defend the unpopular and to fight the expedient.</p>
<p>This requires, however, self-discipline on the part of the conscience
executive and ac- ceptance of his competence and integrity on the part
of the organization.</p>
<p>The tenure of the few conscience executives should be limited as a
rule. No matter how greatly a conscience executive may be respected, and
no matter how successful he has been, he will eventually wear out either
his integrity or his welcome. This is a good place for a senior man to
end a distinguished career. A younger man in the job should be moved out
after a few years—preferably back into a “doing” job.</p>
<p>Making Service Staffs Effective</p>
<p>There are similarly stringent rules with respect to advisory and
teaching, activities, that is, with respect to service staffs.</p>
<p>There should be very few of them. They should be set up only in key
activity areas. It is counterproductive to have a service staff in every
function. The secret of effective work is concentration rather than
busyness.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching staffs should never try to do a little bit of
everything. They should zero in on a very small number of crucial areas.
Rather than serve everybody they should select “targets of opportunity,”
i.e., areas within the organization where the man- agers are receptive
and do not have to be “sold,” and where achievement generates “mul-
tiplier impact” throughout the whole company.</p>
<p>The staffs and their activities should be kept lean.</p>
<p>The supply of men of the right temperament for this kind of work is
not very large. To do a decent job in an advisory and teaching capacity
requires a man who genuinely wants others to get the credit. It requires
a man who starts out with the aim of enabling others to do what they
want to do, provided only that it is neither immoral nor insane. It
requires further a man who has the patience to let others learn rather
than go and do the work him- self. And finally, it requires a man who
will not abuse his position in headquarters close to the seat of power
to politick, to manipulate, and to play favorites. People who possess
these personality traits are rare. Yet people without them in services
work can do only mischief.</p>
<p>One basic rule for advisory and teaching staffs is that they abandon
an old activity be- fore they take on a new one. Otherwise they will
soon start to “build empires” or to pro- duce “canned goods,” that is,
programs and memoranda, rather than develop the knowl- edge and
performance capacity of the operating men whose job it is to produce.
They will also otherwise be forced to use second-raters rather than men
of outstanding competence. Only if they are being required to abandon an
old activity before taking on a new one will they be able to put on the
job the really first-rate people in the group.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching activities should never “operate.” A common
weakness of per- sonnel staffs is that they operate. They run the labor
negotiations, they do a lot of house- keeping chores such as managing
the cafeteria, or they train. As a result the advisory and teaching work
does not get done. The “daily crisis” in “operations” takes precedence
over the work of advice and teaching which can always be postponed.
Mixing advice and op- erations means building large staffs rather than
building performance.</p>
<p>Other service staffs are just as guilty of mixing “doing” work in
with advice and teach- ing—and thereby shifting either the one or the
other.</p>
<p>A company may have need for acoustics engineering while no division,
however, has enough work in the area to justify its own acoustics
engineers. It seems logical therefore to put a few good acoustics
engineers into “manufacturing services” or “engineering ser- vices.” The
acoustics people, however, are not service staff but result-producers
who go to work wherever, in a given division, an acoustics job is to be
done. They are not ex- pected to give advice or to teach, but to do. If
placed into a services component the unit will rarely produce. The good
people in it will become frustrated and are unlikely to stay long.</p>
<p>If “joint-operating work” is needed—and it often is—there might be a
separate central operating pool under one manager for all such work,
regardless of technical area. The management problems in all joint
operating work are the same: relations, assignments, priorities, and
standards.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching activities are service institutions, as
discussed in Chapters 11 through 14. They should be required to impose
on themselves the self-discipline of setting objectives, of setting
targets, of determining priorities and measuring their results against
them. They should not have a monopoly. If consulting or teaching work
has to be done other than in their areas of concentration somebody from
the outside should be brought in to do it. And insofar as possible,
their “customers,” the managers of the various units, should have the
choice between using the internal advisory and teaching staff, going on
the outside, or not using any staff at all.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching work should not be a career. It is work to
which a manager or career professional should be exposed in the course
of his growth. But it is not work</p>
<p>which a man should, normally, do for long. As a career it corrupts.
It breeds contempt for “those dumb operating people,” that is, for
honest work. It puts a premium on being “bright,” rather than on being
right. It is also frustrating work because one does not have results of
one’s own but results only at secondhand.</p>
<p>But it is excellent training, excellent development, and a severe
test of a man’s charac- ter and of his ability to be effective without
having the authority of command. It is an ex- perience everyone should
have had who rises to the top of an organization. But it is an exposure
no one should suffer for more than a limited period of time.</p>
<p>There is constant discussion these days whether this kind of work
requires a high de- gree of specialized knowledge or whether a good
“generalist” can rapidly acquire enough of a “smattering of ignorance”
to be effective in advisory and teaching work. The debate rages forever
in any consulting practice. There is no answer to the question—indeed,
it is probably the wrong question. In some areas, clearly, professional
and highly specialized competence is a requirement. If a company, for
instance, needs advice and teaching in advanced areas of polymer
chemistry or in structuring highly complex and risky interna- tional
capital transactions, somebody with a background in marketing or in
purchasing need not apply, no matter how good and perceptive a teacher
he is. But in many areas of advice and teaching the generalist who is
willing to learn, who will think through the rela- tionship with his
“client,” and who takes responsibility for his contribution, is likely
to do a better job than the highly specialized expert who refuses to
make himself understood and is contemptuous of the “laity” who do not
possess his advanced expertise. Indeed, in most successful advisory and
teaching activities, the expert is the “inside” man who fur- nishes the
tools for the consultants, but who is not himself active, let alone
effective, in advising and teaching work.</p>
<p>The Two Faces of Information</p>
<p>Information activities present a special organizational problem. In
the terms the chemist uses, they are “bi-valent”; they have two faces,
two dimensions, and require two different “bonds.” Unlike most other
result-producing activities, they are not concerned with one stage of
the process but with the entire process itself. This means that they
have to be both centralized and decentralized.</p>
<p>Information-producing activities, whether accounting work or
operations research, re- semble the nervous system of a biological
organism which is also both centralized and decentralized down to the
smallest and most remote cell in the body.</p>
<p>Information activities therefore have two organizational homes rather
than one. The traditional organization chart expresses this in the two
different lines that connect an in- formation activity to “bosses”: a
solid line to the head of the unit for which it is the infor- mation
provider, and a dotted line to the central information group, for
instance, the com- pany controller. One conclusion from this is that
information work should be kept sepa- rate from other kinds of work.</p>
<p>American business has typically violated this rule by putting
accounting, i.e., a tradi- tional information activity, into one
component with the treasurer, i.e., the result- producing operating work
of supplying capital and managing money in the business. The
justification has been that both “deal with money.” But, of course,
accounting does not deal with money; it deals with figures. The
consequence of the traditional approach has been the slighting of
financial management. As long as money was—or seemed—cheap this could he
excused; but the excuse no longer holds.</p>
<p>The tough question with respect to information activities is which of
them belong to- gether and which should be kept apart. There is much
talk today about “integrated total information systems.” This of course
implies that all—or at least most—information ac- tivities should be in
one component. Insofar as this means that new and different informa-
tion activities, e.g., operations research or a computer system, should
not be subordinated to traditional accounting, the point is well taken.
But should they be coordinated? Or should they be separate?</p>
<p>There is, so far, no clear answer and no satisfactory way to organize
information work—though it is clearly a key activity. Nobody has yet
seen a total information system. No one may ever see one. But as we
develop information capacity we will have to grapple with the
organizational problem and will have to find answers, or at least
approaches.</p>
<p>Hygiene and Housekeeping</p>
<p>The last group of activities according to their contribution are
hygiene and housekeeping activities. They should be kept separate from
other work, or else they will not get done. The problem is not that
these activities are particularly difficult. Some are. Many others are
not. The problem is that they are not even indirectly related to
results. Therefore, they tend to be looked down upon by the rest of the
organization. They are “donkey work” because they are neither
result-producing nor professional work.</p>
<p>One reason for the tremendous increase in health-care costs in the
U.S. is managerial neglect of the “hotel services” by the people who
dominate the hospital, such as doctors and nurses. They all know that
the hotel services are essential and that patients do not get well
unless they are reasonably comfortable, are being fed have their beds
changed and their rooms cleaned. But these are not professional
activities for a medical man, for a nurse, or for an X-ray technician.
They are not willing to yield an inch to make it possible for the people
in charge of the hotel services to do their jobs. They are not willing
to have these activities represented on the upper levels of hospital
management. As a result, no “respectable” manager in a hospital wants to
have anything to do with these activities. They are left unmanaged. And
this means they are done badly and expensively.</p>
<p>There rarely is such a problem with the medical department within a
company—if only because our value system respects the doctor and places
him high in our social hier- archy. But even so important a function as
the selection of a plant site, or the construction of a plant are often
considered “extraneous” by the people within a business. Activities
where less seems to be at stake, whether the parking lot, the cafeteria,
or maintenance in general, tend to be slighted and neglected.</p>
<p>This extends even to activities in which a great amount of money is
at stake. Very few companies in the United States for instance have done
even an adequate job of managing the pension funds of their employees,
despite the enormous amount of money involved and the serious impact on
the company’s future. It is an activity which does not, it seems, have
any relationship to results and therefore it is an activity which tends
to be relegated to somebody else.</p>
<p>One way out is to turn hygiene and housekeeping activities over to
the work commu- nity to run (see Chapter 21). They are activities “for”
the employees and they are there- fore best managed by the employees.
Or, such activities may be farmed out to somebody whose business it is
to run a pension fund or to manage a cafeteria.</p>
<p>But insofar as a company’s management has to do these things
itself—and picking a plant site and building a factory is something a
company has to do for itself, or at least has to participate in
actively—hygiene and housekeeping activities ought to be kept separate
from all others. They require different people, different values,
different measurements— and should require little supervision by
business management itself.</p>
<p>One example are the autonomous real estate management companies which
large businesses have created to handle everything concerned with the
procurement of real es- tate, the construction of a building or a
factory, and the management and maintenance of buildings. Another
example is the General Services Administration of the U.S. Govern- ment,
which handles all housekeeping tasks for all government agencies. For
the senior soil scientist in the Department of Agriculture, managing the
automotive fleet for his unit is a chore for which he has neither
interest nor respect. Yet there obviously is a good deal of money at
stake—and cars need organized, systematic purchasing and organized, sys-
tematic maintenance. For the General Services Administration the
administration of the government automotive fleet is its business and
can be organized as such.</p>
<p>There is one overall rule. Activities that make the same kind of
contribution can be joined together in one component and under one
management, whatever their technical specialization. Activities that do
not make the same kind of contribution do not, as a rule,</p>
<p>belong together.</p>
<p>It is entirely feasible—indeed, it often is the best way—to put all
advising and teach- ing activities, in personnel, in manufacturing, in
marketing, or in purchasing, in one “ser- vices” group under one
manager. Similarly, in any but large companies, one man might well be
the company’s conscience in major conscience areas. Contribution rather
than</p>
<p>skill determines function.</p>
