<h4 id="the-management-boom-and-its-lessons">2 The Management Boom and
Its Lessons</h4>
<p>The Management Boom—How the Management Boom Began—Its Spread—Its End—
What Have We Learned? —Management a Generic Function—Management a Disci-
pline—But Not “Technocracy”—Management Is Culturally Embedded—Management
Is Polycentric—The Changed Management World—The Roots and History of
Man- agement</p>
<p>“HE MANAGEMENT BOOM IS OVER; the time for management performance</p>
<p>For twenty-five years, from the end of World War II to the end of the
196os, a man- agement boom swept over the entire world. Management, an
obscure interest of a mere handful of people before World War II, became
a worldwide concern. The management boom reached every country in the
world, excepting perhaps only Communist China. It permanently changed
society and economy—and above all, management. It created an awareness
of management and its role, functions, and work which will remain with
us.</p>
<p>But the management boom also raised new challenges for management,
created new tasks and new problems. The management boom, as all booms
must, has come to an end. The tasks which it left behind are ahead of
us. Now is the time, therefore, to ask what the management boom has
accomplished and what its lessons are.</p>
<p>Before World War II management was the concern of a tiny band of
“true believers,”</p>
<p>mostly consultants and professors. Very few practicing managers paid
any attention, though Alfred P. Sloan at General Motors, Robert E. Wood
at Sears, Roebuck, and Ches- ter Barnard at the American Telephone
Company—to mention some prominent Ameri- cans—were significant
exceptions.* But even Barnard’s colleagues at the Telephone Company
showed no interest in what they considered his hobby. Few managers at
that time would have even realized that they practiced management; and
concern with man- agement as a field of study, as a discipline, and as a
social function was practically non- existent.</p>
<p>The most extensive management library brought together before the
days of World War II was the collection of the American consultant and
management scholar Harry Hopf (1882-1949). Now preserved in the Advanced
Management Institute of the General Electric Company in Crotonville, N.
Y., it contains several thousand volumes. But even though management was
Hopf’s own interest, there are no more than sixty or seventy vol- umes
that properly could be called management. The rest are accounting,
taxation, engi- neering, and the like. Yet, the Hopf library contained
everything written on management in any language (except Japanese) until
the 1940s.</p>
<p>While Harvard had already begun to teach management, most other
business schools of the time, American as well as European, were still
either schools of commerce or, as in</p>
<p>*On these men and others, see “Note: The Roots and History of
Management,” p. 21.</p>
<p>the case of the more progressive and sophisticated (e.g. New York
University), schools of accounting, banking, and finance. They were
schools of business skills. Management was either not taught at all or
taught only in the form of production engineering or personnel.</p>
<p>How the Management Boom Began</p>
<p>The change from neglect of management to, first, awareness of and
then to stress on man- agement came as a result of World War II. It was,
above all, the performance of American manufacturing industry during the
war that drew attention to management (though the performance of British
managers during the same period merits far more attention than it has
received). As a result, interest in management as a practice, as a
discipline, but also as a focus of social, economic, and ethical concern
began to attract growing interest in the United States.</p>
<p>The management boom, however, was triggered by a non-American. Sir
Stafford Cripps (1889-1952), Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain’s
first postwar Labour gov- ernment, was a convinced socialist. But it was
Cripps who conceived of management as the force that could restore the
British economy and could provide the impetus for its growth and
performance. It was Cripps who invented the productivity teams of
British businessmen and managers who were being sent to the United
States to learn the secrets of management. It was Cripps who, by doing
so, convinced the world—including many Americans—that management was an
American invention.</p>
<p>A few years after the start of the exchange of productivity teams
between Britain and America, the Marshall Plan was mounted, and
management received a central place in it. The Marshall Plan set out to
mobilize management for economic and social reconstruc- tion. The
success of the Marshall Plan made management a best seller. Suddenly
every- body talked management, everybody studied management.</p>
<p>It was not much later that the Japanese followed the West. The
Japanese first talked of a management boom when, after 1950, Japanese
government and Japanese business, re- gaining autonomy after years of
American occupation, began systematically to work on rebuilding the
Japanese economy. They seized upon management as the central force and
the critical factor.</p>
<p>Concern with management rapidly spread to the developing countries.
In India and in Brazil, in the newly independent countries of Africa,
and in Southeast Asia management associations were formed, management
schools came into being, management began to become a major focus of
governmental as well as of business concern.</p>
<p>Eventually the management boom reached the communist world. One
communist country after another in Europe—beginning with the heretic
Yugoslavs and followed by the Poles, the Hungarians, and the Czechs—set
up management schools and management institutes, began to translate
Western, especially American, management books, and be- gan to teach
management as the solution to economic stagnation. Ultimately even the
So- viet Union succumbed. In 1969-70 it created two advanced management
schools and si- multaneously began—though with great hesitation—to talk
about setting up autonomous managements in the major industries and
major business enterprises.</p>
<p>Management in the Developing Countries</p>
<p>The impact of the management boom on the developing countries may
have been even greater than on the developed ones. Economic and social
development means, above all, management. It became clear fairly early
in the post-World War II period that manage- ment is the crucial factor
in economic and social development. It was obvious that the economist’s
traditional view of development as a function of savings and capital
invest- ment was not adequate. Indeed, savings and capital investment do
not produce manage- ment and economic development. On the contrary,
management produces economic and social development, and with it savings
and capital investment. It became apparent that, as a popular slogan in
Latin America has it, the developing countries are not underdevel- oped,
they are undermanaged.</p>
<p>Interest in management spread rapidly throughout the developing
countries. Manage- ment schools, management institutes, and management
societies were formed in Bombay, in Mexico, in West Africa, as well as
in Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>There were notable successes: the rapid development of Brazil; the
rapid development of the noncommunist Chinese countries, that is, of
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan; the rapid development of so poor and
backward a peasant country as Iran; all are trace- able to the impact of
management. Management underlies the rapid growth of Mexico. And
management also accounts for the great advances made in Colombia.
Indeed, in many of these countries, pioneering work in management was
being done, e.g., by the group organized by and around the Technical
University in Monterey, Mexico, and by the</p>
<p>group organized by and around the Universidad del Valle in Cali,
Colombia.</p>
<p>Wherever rapid economic and social development took place after World
War II, it occurred as a result of systematic and purposeful work on
developing managers and man- agement.</p>
<p>Yet, it also became increasingly clear, during this period, that the
development of management and managers in most of the developing
countries was not proceeding fast enough to generate adequate
development, especially in view of the explosive growth of population.
It also became clear that we do not yet know how to transfer the
knowledge of management, its discipline, its vision, and its values, to
new and different societies and cultures. And, the one transfer
mechanism which effectively channels management com- petence into
developing countries, the multinational corporation, proved (as will be
dis- cussed in Chapter 59, “The Multinational Corporation”) ambiguous
and controversial.</p>
<p>The task of transferring management knowledge and management
competence from the developed countries to the developing ones, the task
of generating entrepreneurial and managerial energies fast enough to
satisfy the expectations of the developing world, still remains as one
of the major tasks ahead.</p>
<p>Before World War II all the books on management filled no more than a
modest shelf.</p>
<p>By the late sixties American publishers alone brought out each year
several hundred man- agement titles—four or five times as many in one
year as there had been written alto- gether in all the years before
World War II.* Before World War II only Harvard taught management; by
the late sixties the number of business schools teaching management all
over the world probably numbered well in the hundreds. Advanced
management educa- tion was almost totally unknown before World War II.
Nobody in the 1970s can count the number of advanced management courses,
advanced management seminars, special schools, special institutes, staff
colleges, and other institutions concerned with the profes- sional
formation and advanced training of managers all over the world.</p>
<p>The End of the Management Boom</p>
<p>The management boom, as all such booms must, overreached itself and
came to an end. The first sign—and this too is typical of a boom—was the
appearance of books that prophesied that the management boom would last
forever. In 1967 the American econo- mist J. Kenneth Galbraith predicted
in a worldwide best seller, The New Industrial State (Houghton Mifflin,
1967), that professional management in big corporations, armed with all
the tools of modern management techniques, had become invincible and
incapable of being displaced by any force—such as stockholders or
governments. This prediction ap- peared at the moment when professional
managers began to be unseated right and left by the takeover-raiders
promising “asset management,” with the full and enthusiastic support of
the supposedly docile and impotent stockholders.</p>
<p>*Management books have achieved the impossible: they have become best
sellers—e.g., Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.’s My Years with General Motors
(Doubleday, l964). Even satires on management have become best sellers,
such as Robert Townsend’s Up the Organization (Knopf, 1970). These books
have been read by the general public even though they are replete with
recondite and obscure management terms and management cliches which a
few years ago only a handful of initiates would have understood.</p>
<p>A year later another best seller on management by the French
journalist-politician, Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, Le Défi Américain,
English translation, The American Challenge (Atheneum, 1968), predicted
that American management was taking over the world (or at least Europe),
and that there was a “management gap” between America and Europe which
made American domination all but inescapable fate. This prediction ap-
peared—and was greeted worldwide with tremendous headlines—at the very
moment when the European economy began to forge ahead of America and
when the American economy was forced on the defensive by the Europeans
and the Japanese.</p>
<p>By 1970 the Galbraiths and Servan-Schreibers had begun to sound
naive. The man- agement boom was over. It did not end with a crash or a
bust. Indeed, there were few outward signs that anything had
happened.</p>
<p>Only in Great Britain was there substantial unemployment of managers.
And that re- flected the generally depressed state of the British
economy and the cresting wave of mergers and takeovers in Britain. But
management consulting firms that had sharply ex- panded in the late
sixties suddenly found their sales far below expectations. Yet firms
that had been more conservative and had spent their resources on
building quality rather than on adding staff continued to do
extraordinarily well, in respect to both billings and fees. Such
management programs, management books, and management speakers who had
something to say continued in high demand; indeed, around 1970
non-business manage- ments, e.g., of public-service institutions;
greatly stepped up their attendance at manage- ment programs, their
buying of management books, and their use of management speak- ers. But
the users became far more discriminating and demanding. Applications to
busi- ness schools and to advanced management courses continued to
climb; the students, how- ever, were becoming quite critical of
curriculum and teaching performance.</p>
<p>What happened was that the mystique of management was suddenly gone.
One reason may have been the dollar crisis of 1971, which must have
convinced even the least obser- vant that there was no management gap.
Another reason may have been the business de- bacles of that period—Penn
Central and Lockheed in the U.S., Rolls-Royce in England— which made
professional management look somewhat less than heroic. But the main
rea- son was surely that managers themselves suddenly realized that
management is challenge and work rather than a panacea, and that
management techniques, no matter how sophisti- cated, are not magic
spells. Above all, managers everywhere realized that the foundation on
which the management boom had been based, that is, the knowledge
acquired in the long years of obscurity before World War II, had been
outpaced by new developments. New knowledge, new basic approaches, and
new understanding, it was beginning to be seen, were needed. And those
the management boom could not supply.</p>
<p>While it has run its course, the management boom has nevertheless
permanently changed the world’s economic and social landscape. There is
no return to the period of management innocence, of management
ignorance, and of management obscurity, that is, to the period before
World War II and before the boom. Above all, the awareness of man-
agement as a force, as a function, as a responsibility, and as a
discipline will remain. It is the one permanent result of the management
boom. It is also the most important result.</p>
<p>What Have We Learned?</p>
<p>What have we learned in these twenty-five years? Especially, what
have we learned that should enable us to tackle the demands of the new
era, the era of management perform- ance?</p>
<p>The first thing is that management, that is, the organ of leadership,
direction, and deci- sion in our social institutions, and especially in
business enterprise, is a generic function which faces the same basic
tasks in every country and, essentially, in every society. Man- agement
has to give direction to the institution it manages. It has to think
through the in- stitution’s mission, has to set its objectives, and has
to organize resources for the results the institution has to contribute.
Management is, indeed, J. B. Say’s “entrepreneur” and responsible for
directing vision and resources toward greatest results and
contributions.</p>
<p>In performing these essential functions, management everywhere faces
the same prob- lems. It has to organize work for productivity, it has to
lead the worker toward productiv- ity and achievement. It is responsible
for the social impact of its enterprise. Above all, it is responsible
for producing the results—whether economic performance, student learn-
ing, or patient care—for the sake of which each institution exists.</p>
<p>Management as a Discipline</p>
<p>This means, above all, that managers practice management. They do not
practice econom- ics. They do not practice quantification. They do not
practice behavioral science. These are tools for the manager. But he no
more practices economics than a physician practices blood testing. He no
more practices behavioral sciences than a biologist practices the mi-
croscope. He no more practices quantification than a lawyer practices
precedents. He practices management.</p>
<p>One implication is that there are specific managerial skills which
pertain to manage- ment, rather than to any other discipline. One of
these is communications within organiza- tions. Another is the making of
decisions under conditions of uncertainty. And there is also a specific
entrepreneurial skill: strategic planning.</p>
<p>As a specific discipline, management has its own basic problems, its
own specific ap- proaches, its own distinct concerns. A manager who
understands the discipline of man- agement will still be an
effective—and may even be a first-rate—manager with no more than minimum
competence in managerial skills and tools. A man who knows only the
skills and techniques, without understanding the fundamentals of
management, is not a manager; he is, at best, a technician.</p>
<p>Management is a practice rather than a science. In this, it is
comparable to medicine, law, and engineering. It is not knowledge but
performance. Furthermore, it is not the ap- plication of common sense,
or leadership, let alone financial manipulation. Its practice is based
both on knowledge and on responsibility.</p>
<p>Technocracy Is Not Enough</p>
<p>The management boom has proven that the manager must be more than a
“technocrat.” He cannot be confined to his discipline, cannot be content
with mastery of his skills, his tools, and his techniques.</p>
<p>Management is not culture-free, that is, part of the world of nature.
It is a social func- tion. It is, therefore, both socially accountable
and culturally embedded.</p>
<p>General Motors may well be the best illustration of the inadequacy of
the technocrat concept of management. In the technocrat’s terms, that
is, in terms of company perform- ance, whether measured by market
standing, by profit, or by productivity, General Motors in the
post-World War II period has been an outstanding success. But at the
same time, General Motors has been a resounding failure in public
opinion, in politics, in its standing in the public esteem. Instead of
reaping the rewards for its success as a technocrat, that is, as a
business manager, General Motors has been forced on the defensive.*</p>
<p>The manager has to be a craftsman. His first duty is, indeed, to make
his institution perform the mission and purpose for the sake of which it
exists—whether this be goods and service, learning, or patient care. But
this is not enough. Any institution exists for the sake of society and
within a community. It, therefore, has to have impacts; and one is re-
sponsible for one’s impacts. In the society of institutions of the
developed countries, the leadership groups, that is, the managers of the
various institutions, also have to take social responsibility, have to
think through the values, the beliefs, the commitments of their so-
ciety, and have to assume leadership responsibility beyond the discharge
of the specific and limited mission of their institutions. This
responsibility creates a major new chal-</p>
<p>*For a further discussion of this, see the prologue and the epilogue
to the 1972 reissue of my study of General Motors, Concept of the
Corporation, originally published in 1946.</p>
<p>lenge—and raises the most difficult problems, both of management and
of political theory and practice. But it has become a fact.</p>
<p>Management and Its Society</p>
<p>Management is an objective function, determined by the tasks, that
is, it is a discipline. And yet it is culturally conditioned and subject
to the values, the traditions, the habits of a given society.* The
management boom owes a great deal of its force to the fact that man-
agement is not value-free.</p>
<p>The excitement over management in continental Europe, for instance,
was in large measure the result of the promise that management would
change cultural and social tra- ditions. Management in the Europe of the
fifties was, so to speak, the counterculture, which was welcomed,
especially by the young and educated, as the battering ram to level the
ramparts of privilege and of the class structure and with them, the
obstacles to oppor- tunities which emphasis on birth, wealth, or elite
education (e.g., in France) had put in the path of the able
individual.</p>
<p>The excitement was even more pronounced in the communist world. There
manage- ment promises truly to be a major political and cultural force
against the establishment. Though surely an oversimplification, the
developments of the sixties in the Soviet bloc can largely be explained
in terms of the dynamics of management and their impacts on communist
ideology and organization.</p>
<p>In the Russian satellite countries management was, to a large extent,
the rallying cry of those who opposed the imposition of an alien, that
is, Russian, system on their country. The communist reformers, first in
Yugoslavia, then in Hungary, and finally, in Czecho- slovakia, demanded
managerial autonomy; that demand was at the center of their opposi- tion
to Stalinism. In part, of course, their motives were economic. But in
equal measure, they looked to management as a force to reform government
and society. Management to them embodied specifically Western values:
the value of individual responsibility, the value of autonomy, respect
for the individual. Management, precisely because it is not a political
program but a social and economic function, became their hope for the
preserva- tion of their culture and society in the Western
tradition.</p>
<p>For this reason too, management has become highly controversial in
the Soviet Union and a potential threat to the Stalinist legacy of
totalitarian despotism. When the Czechs proceeded to make their managers
autonomous, the Russians felt that they had to move in their troops and
tanks to stamp out this heresy; their own regime at home could not have
survived such a development. For this reason, any movement toward
management, no matter how badly needed to restore the Russian economy’s
capacity for growth and per- formance, is being resisted every inch of
the way by all the entrenched forces of the Rus- sian bureaucracy, and
also of the Russian tradition. Management, one might suspect, rather
than the “intellectuals,” is the central threat to the Russian system.
Management is, in effect, the “internal contradiction” of Communism.
Marx was absolutely right when he attack, well over a hundred years ago,
the “utopian socialists” as antisocialists. Their em- phasis on manager
and entrepreneur as central, dynamic forces in society is, indeed, in-
compatible with the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>
<p>The great question ahead of China, after Mao is gone, will certainly
be the question of management and managers. Without facing up to this
question, China may not be able to sustain economic growth or political
cohesion. If it decides for bureaucracy—that is, for the Stalinist
path—it can postpone this decision for a couple of decades, though
probably only at a price in human lives, in terror, in suffering, and in
spiritual debasement similar to that which Russia has had to pay for
Stalinism. If it accepts management and managers, China will, however,
equally have turned its back on Mao. The one thing that is unlikely</p>
<p>*A non-Western scholar, the Japanese Chie Nakane, has seen this much
more clearly than any Westerner— precisely because the Japanese
tradition is not a Western tradition, whereas management is distinctly a
Western concept. See her book, Japanese Society (University of
California Press,1970).</p>
<p>is Mao’s plan to have neither the monolithic government apparatus nor
the autonomous and responsible manager.</p>
<p>It is also clear—though it may sound contradictory—that the more
management can use the traditions, values, and beliefs of a society, the
more it will accomplish. The man- agement boom, while it put into
question social and cultural traditions, also strengthened them. At the
height of the boom, in the early and mid-sixties, there was a good deal
of talk about the Americanization of the world; and especially, the
Americanization of manage- ment. To be sure, insofar as management and
managers have come to recognize that they face the same tasks, they have
come to resemble each other. But the management boom has also been used
to strengthen differences and different ways.</p>
<p>Whether today’s Japan is westernized or whether the westernization is
just a surface phenomenon enabling Japan to be even more Japanese than
ever is not within the scope of this book (or within the competence of
its author). But there is little doubt that Japanese management has not
become westernized. It has accepted management concepts. It has eagerly
grasped tools and techniques. It has listened. But it has used
management, its con- cepts, its tools and techniques to remain Japanese.
And only to the extent to which the concepts and tools of management
enable the Japanese institution—whether business en- terprise or
government agency—to retain and to strengthen basic Japanese values have
they been adopted.</p>
<p>Neither have European basic concepts in respect to management been
overturned by the management boom. Top-management structure, for
instance, has remained very much the same in Germany, in France, and in
Italy. Only in Great Britain has there been a change in which the
formerly undifferentiated board of directors has become divided into
executive members, that is, top management in the American sense of the
word, and non-</p>
<p>executive members, that is, the supervisory group.</p>
<p>Career ladders too have been affected only to a slight degree.</p>
<p>In France a man still gets to the top in a big company by graduating
from one of the grandes écoles, especially the École Polytechnique,
going to work for the government as a generalist and then, twenty-five
years later and with the rank of inspecteur de finance, moving directly
into top management in business. In Germany the two parallel career
ladders, as an engineer in highly specialized technical work and as a
graduate in law (or perhaps, economics) in unspecialized staff work,
still dominate. In Great Britain the best starting point for a
top-management position is still accounting.</p>
<p>The one change has been the addition of marketing as a career ladder.
But it is per- haps symptomatic that in Great Britain, where marketing
has become most respectable, the marketing people in top-management
positions tend to have made their careers in the British subsidiaries of
American companies.</p>
<p>The management boom also left untouched the relationship between
business and government in major countries. If anything, it has
accentuated traditions: those of an ad- versary relationship in the
U.S.; of the mercantilist tradition in continental Europe; of the Ie,
the “extended family,” in Japan , and of the “club” in Britain. (On this
important topic see Chapter 27.) By restoring the capacity of Europe and
Japan to grow, the management boom has brought out clearly that
management is not American. There is no American challenge. Just as the
world of the 1970s has become polycentric in its politics and poly-
centric in its economics, so it he’s become polycentric in its
management. We now know that all of us—Americans, Europeans, Japanese,
and many others—have to learn man- agement from each other.</p>
<p>Note: The Roots and History of Management</p>
<p>Some recent writers on management seem to believe that the management
boom invented, or at least discovered, management. This, needless to
say, is nonsense. Management, both as a practice and as a field of
thought and study, has a long history. Its roots go back al- most two
hundred years.</p>
<p>Management, one might say, was discovered before there was any
management to speak of. The great English economists, from Adam Smith
(1723-1790) to David Ricardo (1772-1823) to John Stuart Mill (1806-873),
including their successor and antagonist, Karl Marx (1818-1883), knew no
management. To them the economy was impersonal and objective. As a
modern exponent of the classical tradition, the Anglo-American Kenneth
Boulding (b. 1910) phrases it, “Economics deals with the behavior of
commodities rather than with the behavior of men.” Or, as with Marx,
impersonal laws of history were seen to dominate. Men can only adapt.
Man can, at best, optimize what the economy makes pos- sible; at worst,
he impedes the forces of the economy and wastes resources. The last of
the great English classical economists, Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), did
indeed add man- agement to the factors of production, land, labor, and
capital. But this was a half-hearted concession. Management was still,
even to Marshall, an extraneous factor, rather than central.</p>
<p>From the beginning there was a different approach which put the
manager into the center of the economy and which stressed the managerial
task of making resources pro- ductive. J. B. Say (1767-1832), perhaps
the most brilliant economist produced by France—or for that matter by
continental Europe—was an early follower of Adam Smith and the
propagandist for The Wealth of Nations in France. But in his own works
the pivot is not the factors of production. It is the entrepreneur—a
word Say coined—who directs resources from less productive into more
productive investments and who thereby creates wealth. Say was followed
by the “utopian socialists” of the French tradition, especially François
Fourier (1772-1837) and that eccentric genius, the Comte de Saint-Simon
(1760- 1825). At that time there were no large organizations and no
managers, but both Fourier and Saint-Simon anticipated developments and
“discovered” management before it actu- ally came into being.
Saint-Simon in particular saw the emergence of organization. And he saw
the task of making resources productive and of building social
structures. He saw managerial tasks.</p>
<p>It is for their stress on management, as a separate and distinct
force, and one which can act independently of the factors of production
as well as of the laws of history, that Marx vehemently denounced the
French and gave them the derisory name of “utopians.” But it is the
French—and above all, Saint-Simon—who, in effect, laid down the basic
approaches and the basic concepts on which every socialist economy has
actually been designed. No matter how much the Russians today invoke the
name of Marx, their spiri- tual ancestor is Saint-Simon.</p>
<p>In America too management was early seen as central. Alexander
Hamilton’s (1757- 1804) famous “Report on Manufactures’” starts out with
Adam Smith, but then Hamilton gave emphasis to the constructive,
purposeful, and systematic role of management. He saw in management,
rather than in economic forces, the engine of economic and social
development; and in organization, the carrier of economic advance.
Following him, Henry Clay (1777-1852) with his famous “American system”
produced what might be called the first blueprint for systematic
economic development.</p>
<p>A little later, an industrialist in Scotland, Robert Owen
(1771-1858), actually became</p>
<p>the first manager. In his textile mill in Lanark, Owen; in the 1820s,
first tackled the prob- lems of productivity and motivation, of the
relationship of worker to work, of worker to enterprise, and of worker
to management—to this day key questions in management. With Owen, the
manager emerges as a real person, rather than as an abstraction, as in
Say, Fou- rier, Saint-Simon, Hamilton, and Clay. But it was a long time
before Owen had succes- sors.</p>
<p>The Emergence of Large-Scale Organization</p>
<p>What had to happen first was the rise of large-scale organization.
This occurred simulta- neously—around 1870—in two places. In North
America the transcontinental railroad emerged as a managerial problem.
On the continent of Europe, the “universal bank”—</p>
<p>entrepreneurial in aim, national in scope, and with multiple
headquarters—obsolete tradi- tional structures and concepts and required
management.</p>
<p>One response was given by Henry Towne (1844-1924) in the United
States, especially in his paper “The Engineer as Economist.” Towne
outlined what might be called the first program for management. He
raised basic questions: effectiveness as against efficiency;
organization of the work as against the organization of the plant
community, that is, of the workers; value set in the marketplace and by
the customer as against technical accom- plishment. With Towne begins
the systematic concern with the relationship between the tasks of
management and the work of management.</p>
<p>At roughly the same time, in Germany, Georg Siemens (1839-1901), in
building the Deutsche Bank into the leading financial institution of
continental Europe, first designed an effective top management, first
thought through the top-management tasks, and first tackled the basic
problems of communications and information in the large organization (on
Siemens see Chapter 49).</p>
<p>In Japan, Eiichi Shibusawa (1840-1931), the Meiji statesman turned
business leader, in the seventies and eighties first raised fundamental
questions regarding the relationship between business enterprise and
national purpose, and between business needs and indi- vidual ethics. He
tackled management education systematically. Shibusawa envisioned the
professional manager first. The rise of Japan in this century to
economic leadership is largely founded on Shibusawa’s thought and
work.</p>
<p>A few decades later, in the years before and after the turn of the
century, all the major approaches to modern management were fashioned.
Again the developments occurred independently in many countries.</p>
<p>In the 1880s Frederic W. Taylor (1856-1915), the self-taught American
engineer, be- gan the study of work. It is fashionable today to look
down on Taylor and to decry his outmoded psychology, but Taylor was the
first man in the known history of mankind who did not take work for
granted, but looked at it and studied it. His approach to work is still
the basic foundation (on this see Chapter 17). And, while Taylor in his
approach to the worker was clearly a man of the nineteenth century, he
started out with social rather than engineering or profit objectives.
What led Taylor to his work and provided his motivation throughout was
first the desire to free the worker from the burden of heavy toil,
destruc- tive of body and soul. And then it was the hope to break the
Iron Law of wages of the classical economists (including Marx) which
condemned the worker to economic insecu- rity and to enduring poverty.
Taylor’s hope—and it has largely been fulfilled in the de- veloped
countries—was to make it possible to give the laborer a decent
livelihood through increasing the productivity of work.</p>
<p>Around the same time in France, Henri Fayol (1841-1925), head of a
coal mine which for its time was a very large company, first thought
through organization structure and developed the first rational approach
to the organization of enterprise: the functional prin- ciple. In
Germany, Walter Rathenau (1867-1922), whose early training had been in a
large company (the German equivalent of the General Electric Company,
AEG, founded by his father, Emil (1838-1915), but developed in large
part under the supervision of Georg Siemens), asked: “What is the place
of the large enterprise in a modern society and in a modern nation? What
impact does it have on both? And, what are its fundamental contributions
and its fundamental responsibilities?” Most present questions of the
social responsibilities of business were first raised and thought
through by Rathenau in the years before World War I. Also in Germany, at
the same time, the new discipline of Betrieb- swissenschaft was
developed by such men as Eugen Schmalenbach (1813-1955). The management
sciences developed since managerial accounting, operations research,
deci- sion theory, and so on—are largely extensions, though in the main,
unconscious ones, of the Betriebswissenschaft of those years before
World War I. And in America, German- born Hugo Muensterborg (1863-1916)
first tried to apply the social and behavioral sci- ences, and
especially psychology, to modern organization and management.</p>
<p>The First Management Boom</p>
<p>After World War I there came what might be called the first
management boom. It was sparked primarily by two of the most highly
respected statesmen of the period, the Ameri- can Herbert Hoover
(1874-1964) and the Czech Thomas J. Masaryk (1850-1937). Hoo- ver, the
Quaker engineer, had vaulted to worldwide prominence by applying
principles of management to the first massive foreign-aid operation in
history: the feeding of hundreds of thousands of starving people: first,
before America’s entry into World War I in his Belgian Relief Operation,
and then after the end of World War I in the relief operations in
Central and Eastern Europe. But it was Masaryk, the historian, who had
become the first president of the new Czech Republic, who conceived the
idea that management would be able to restore the economies of Europe
after their destruction by war—an idea that then found its realization
twenty-five years later in the Marshall Plan after World War II. These
two men founded the international management movement and tried to
mobilize management as a major social force.</p>
<p>But the period between the two World Wars was not congenial to such
an idea. It was a period of stagnation, a period in which the highest
goal which any national government or any economy—except the United
States—could conceive was a return to prewar, that is, a restoration of
what had been. It rapidly became a world in which mounting political,
social, and economic tensions paralyzed will as well as vision.</p>
<p>The Work of the Twenties and Thirties</p>
<p>The first management boom fizzled out. Its high hopes were replaced
by frustration. Yet behind the apparent stagnation work went on. It was
in those years that the foundations for the sweeping management boom of
the post-World War II period were put in place.</p>
<p>In the early twenties, Pierre S. du Pont (1870-1954) at the Du Pont
Company, fol- lowed by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. (1875-1966) at General
Motors, first developed the organi- zation principle for the new “big
business,” the principle of decentralization. Du Pont and, even more,
Sloan also first developed systematic approaches to business objectives,
to business strategy, and to strategic planning. Also, in the United
States, Sears, Roebuck— led first by Julius Rosenwald (1862-1932) and
then by Robert E. Wood (1819-1969)— built the first business to be based
on the marketing approach. In Europe shortly thereaf- ter, the
architects of the Dutch-English merger that resulted in the Unilever
Companies designed what to this day may well be the most advanced
structure for the multinational corporation and came to grips also with
the problem of multinational business planning and multinational
marketing.</p>
<p>The discipline of management was also further developed. In the
United States there were the successors to Taylor, the husband and wife
team of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth (1868-1924, 1878-1972), and Henry
Gantt (1861-1919). In Great Britain Ian Hamilton (1853-1947), reflecting
on his experiences as a military leader during World War I, real- ized
the need to balance formal structure and the policies that give “soul”
to an organiza- tion. Two Americans, Mary Parker Follett (1868-1933) and
Chester Barnard (1886- 1961), first studied the process of
decision-making in organizations, the relationships be- tween formal and
informal organizations, and the role and function of the executive.
Cyril Burt (1883-1972) in England and the Australian Elton Mayo
(1880-1949), working at Harvard, developed, respectively, industrial
psychology and human relations and applied each to enterprise and
management.</p>
<p>Management as a discipline also began to be taught in the interwar
years. The Harvard Business School first began in the thirties to teach
courses in management—though still mainly in production management. And
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started, at the same time,
advanced management work with young executives in mid- career.</p>
<p>The American James McKinsey (1889-1937) and the Englishman Lyndall F.
Urwick (b. 1891) started management consulting, that is, consulting no
longer confined to techni- cal problems, but dealing with fundamental
management concerns such as business policy</p>
<p>and management organization. Urwick also classified and codified the
work on the struc- ture of management and on the function of the
executive that had been done until that time.</p>
