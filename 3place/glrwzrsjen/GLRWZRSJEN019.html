Productive: Work and Process</h4>
<p>Work Is Generic—Skill and Knowledge Are in the “Working,” Not in the
Work—The Four Steps Toward Productive Work—The Analysis of Work—Taylor
and His Disciples—What Industrial Engineering Is and Is Not—Focus on the
End Product—Laying Out “Jobs” Not Part of Work Analysis—Work Analysis
Only the First Step—The Principles of Production—Unique Product
Production—Rigid and Flexible Mass Production—Process Production—What
Each Principle Demands</p>
<p>E SPEAK OF misleading. It</p>
<p>UNSKILLED WORK, skilled work, and knowledge work, but this is is not
the work that is unskilled, skilled, or knowledgeable, it is the</p>
<p>worker. Skill and knowledge are aspects of working. The work itself
is the same whether it requires no skill or high skill, a lot of
knowledge or very little.</p>
<p>To make a pair of shoes one used to have to be “highly skilled.” For
almost a century now, we have been able to make shoes practically
without skill. It would be no great trick (though probably uneconomical
to automate shoemaking fully so that it requires no manual work. Yet the
shoe itself has hardly changed. Nor has the process. It requires the
same steps, from preparing leather, to cutting, forming, stitching, and
gluing. The steps are being carried out in the same sequence, to the
same requirements and standards, and result in the same finished
product. The work of shoemaking remains the same, even though</p>
<p>tools and skill requirements have changed drastically. Only an expert
could tell whether a shoe had been made entirely by hand and with great
craft skill or in an entirely automated process.</p>
<p>This may seem to be quibbling. Yet the realization that work is
general and generic and that skill and knowledge are in the working
rather than in the work is the key to making work productive. The
generic nature of work—certainly as far as manual or any other
production work is concerned—implies that work can be worked on
systematically, if not scientifically.</p>
<p>The first step toward making the worker achieving is to make work
productive. The more we understand what the work itself demands, the
more can we then integrate the work into the human “activity we call
working. The more we understand work itself, the more freedom we can
give the worker. There is no contradiction between scientific
management, that is, the rational and impersonal approach to work, and
the achieving worker. The two complement each other, though they are
quite different.</p>
<p>Whatever study of work has been done so far has confined itself to
manual work—for the simple reason that, until quite recently, this was
the main work around. In describing what is known about making work
productive, this book, therefore, of necessity, focuses on manual work.
But the same principles and approaches also apply to any other
production work, e.g., to most service work. They apply to the
processing of information, that is, to most clerical work. They even
apply to most knowledge work. Only the applications and the tools vary.
Precisely because work is general and generic, there is essentially
no</p>
<p>difference among work the end product of which is a thing, work the
end product of which is information, and work the end product of which
is knowledge.</p>
<p>Making work productive requires four separate activities, each having
its own characteristics and demands.</p>
<p>First, it requires analysis. We have to know the specific operations
needed for work, their sequence, and their requirements.</p>
<p>But we also need synthesis. The individual operations have to be
brought together into a process of production.</p>
<p>Third, we need to build into the process the control of direction, of
quality and quantity, of standards, and of exceptions.</p>
<p>Fourth, the appropriate tools have to be provided.</p>
<p>One more basic point needs to be made. Because work is objective and
impersonal and a “something”—even if it is intangible, like information
,or knowledge—making work productive has to start out with the end
product, the output of work. It cannot start with the input, whether
craft skill or formal knowledge. Skills, information, knowledge, are
tools; and what tool is to be applied when, and for what purpose, must
always be determined by the desired end product. The end product
determines what work is needed. It also determines the synthesis into a
process, the design of the appropriate controls, and the specifications
for the tools needed.</p>
<p>The Analysis of Work</p>
<p>The analysis of work—known by such names as work study, scientific
management, and industrial engineering—is by now almost a century old.
As said earlier, it goes back to Frederick W. Taylor’s work in the 1880s
on individual manual operations, such as his famous study of shoveling
sand in a steel mill. It was essentially completed in its present form
shortly after Taylor died during World War I. In those war years and in
the period immediately following, Taylor’s most productive disciples,
Frank Gilbreth and Henry Gantt, added to Taylor’s scientific management
what might be called the script and the syntax for the analysis of
work.</p>
<p>Gilbreth studied, identified, and classified all the motions involved
in manual work, such as “lifting,” “moving,” and “putting dawn.” His
Therbligs (Gilbreth spelled backwards), which list the entire range of
manual operations, specify how each can best be done, what motion it
requires, and how much time it needs, are not, as sometimes has been
said, an alphabet. They are more like Chinese ideographs, that is,
symbols of a fundamental unit which in themselves contain all the
information needed to engineer them.</p>
<p>Gantt, at the same time, addressed himself to the configuration of
operations in work.</p>
<p>His Gantt Chart, which starts out with the desired end product and
then outlines every step needed to attain it, with its place in the
sequence and the time needed, created, in effect, a syntax for work.</p>
<p>Not only has the discipline of work analysis been with us for a long
time; the practice has become general too. The industrial engineer is a
common feature of production work, in the factory, in transportation,
and increasingly in clerical work. Industrial engineering is a
recognized academic discipline with a tremendous literature of its own.
And the impact, as has been said earlier, has been almost
overwhelming.</p>
<p>Managers, therefore, tend to believe that they know all they need to
know about industrial engineering. They may be excused for believing
that the analysis of work is as useful, but also as well known a tool as
cost accounting, for instance, and requires very little managing on
their part. They are convinced they know the essentials. The analysis of
work, they would tell a questioner, consists essentially of the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identification of all operations necessary to produce a known end
product, a known piece of work.</p></li>
<li><p>Rational organization of the sequence of operations so as to make
possible the easiest, smoothest, and most economical flow of
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of each individual operation and its redesign so as to
make possible its most efficient performance—including the provision of
the appropriate tools, the needed information, and the required
materials where and when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration of these operations into individual jobs. And this is
actually what, in essence, the books on industrial engineering say and
what the courses on this subject teach. It is, however, not—or at least
not truly—what the analysis of work has to be to be effective.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Taylor—and this is perhaps the only valid criticism of a great man’s
work—may have been responsible for the common failure to see something
so obvious, for Taylor always took the end product for granted. His
focus was the individual task rather than the joint result.</p>
<p>To start out with the task rather than with the end product may
result, however, in beautiful engineering of work that should not be
done at all. One cannot, as Taylor did, assume that the end product is
rational, systematic, consistent. In most processes it represents little
but untested assumptions, a lot of history, traditions and customs, and
geological strata of human errors. Anyone who starts out with an
analysis of the final product, the work itself, will soon find himself
asking the question “Why do we do this and why do we do that?” Usually
there is no answer other than, “We have always done it.” What proportion
of inefficiency, that is, of lost productivity, can be contributed to
the unquestioning acceptance of the final product as given, no one
knows, but I have heard experienced industrial engineers put it as high
as 30 percent of total cost and total effort—and I would not consider
this estimate improbably high.</p>
<p>The manager, therefore, needs to know that his work analysts have to
participate in the design of product and process. Obviously the finished
product cannot be engineered primarily to make work easier. Its basic
specifications are set by the needs and values of the user and not by
those of the producer. But within the restraints set by these basic
specifications, there is usually considerable leeway to design a product
or service so as to be produced efficiently or inefficiently, simply or
with unnecessary complications, with economy of work or wastefully.</p>
<p>The next—and much better known—weakness of the traditional definition
of work analysis is that it includes something which does not belong in
it. The fourth, and last, step which most managers—and most industrial
engineers, at least in the West—would include in their definition of
industrial engineering is not truly part of the job. Laying out jobs is
no longer analysis. Or rather, the analysis that is required is not that
of work, but that of working. And while the industrial engineer has a
role to play in this process, it is a totally different role from the
one he plays in the analysis of the work (as will be discussed in
Chapter 21).</p>
<p>The inclusion of job design in work analysis is responsible in large
measure for the traditional resistance to industrial engineering on the
part of workers. It is largely responsible for the hostility of the
intellectual to modern technology, and to modern industry and
organization altogether.</p>
<p>But what is resisted and criticized is a misapplication of work
analysis rather than work analysis itself. Taylor is usually blamed for
the resulting “dehumanization” of the worker, especially by today’s
psychologists, but this is unfair and unjust.*</p>
<p>*To belittle Taylor because in 1880 he did not know post-Freudian
psychology is, as I said at another occasion (when I received in 1967
the Taylor Key of the Association for Advancement of Management),
somewhat like belittling Isaac Newton for not knowing quantum mechanics
or non-Euclidian geometry in 1690.</p>
<p>Taylor did not invent the assembly line—he had, in fact, nothing to
do with it. Taylor’s aim from the beginning was strictly in accord with
the most humanist approach to working. Taylor, as his writings show,
knew that making the work productive was but the first step. But he also
knew that neither an empty stomach nor a spent and broken body is a good
foundation for the full life. Taylor addressed himself to the priority
task of creating the economic and physical base for the worker’s
welfare. It was not an accident that Taylor’s most ardent supporter was
the greatest American humanist of the early years of this century, Louis
D. Brandeis, later to become the great liberal Supreme Court justice and
the strongest fighter on the Court for human rights and human dignity.
It was Brandeis, for instance, who, as Taylor’s self-appointed public
relations man, coined the term “scientific management” to get attention
for Taylor’s work.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that scientific management or industrial
engineering has been content to stop where Taylor stopped. Few of its
scholars and practitioners have concerned themselves with working, i.e.,
with the synthesis of operations into a job.*</p>
<p>The manager needs to know that the logic of work analysis and the
analysis of job structure are two different logics. The one is the logic
of work, the other the logic of working.</p>
<p>The last and most common misunderstanding of the industrial engineer
is the belief that work analysis is the whole job. It is only the first
step in making work productive. Analysis identifies individual specific
operations, their sequence, and their interrelationships. It deals with
pieces. It is not concerned with the process of production as a whole,
with its structures, its economy, or its performance.</p>
<p>The Principles of Production</p>
<p>Production is not the application of tools to materials. It is the
application of logic to work. The more clearly, the more consistently,
the more rationally the right logic is applied, the less of a limitation
and the more of an opportunity production becomes.</p>
<p>This definition implies that there must be principles of production.
There must be a small number of basic models, each with its own
constraints, its own requirements, its own characteristics. The
definition further implies that the more closely a process of production
can be designed according to one of these principles, the smoother, the
more effective, and the more productive it will be.</p>
<p>Each system of production makes its own demands on management—in all
areas and on all levels. Each requires different competence, skill, and
performance. One set of demands is not necessarily “higher” than
another, any more than non-Euclidian geometry is “higher” than Euclidian
geometry, but each is different. Unless management understands the
demands of its system of production, it cannot truly make work
productive.</p>
<p>Such understanding is particularly important today when many
processes—in manufacturing as well as in information work—are moving
from one system of production into another. If this move is considered a
mere matter of machines, techniques, and gadgets, the enterprise will
reap inevitably only the difficulties of the new system. To reap its
benefits management must realize that the new system involves new
principles, and must understand what these are.</p>
<p>There are four such principles of production known to us so far. Each
has been worked out for industrial production, that is, largely for
traditional manual work. But each is equally applicable to producing and
handling information, that is, to most clerical work. The principles are
applicable also to knowledge work, at least to knowledge work concerned
with the learning of known knowledge (i.e., already available and
learnable) and its application.</p>
<p>*An important exception was one of Taylor’s disciples, Allen
Mogensen, who, in the 1920s, pioneered what he called “work
simplification”—startlingly similar to what is now being rediscovered as
job enrichment,” if not way ahead of it.</p>
<p>There are two general rules for advancing production performance and
pushing back limitations. First, the limitations on production are
pushed back further and faster the more consistently and thoroughly the
principles pertaining to the system in use are being applied. Second,
the systems themselves represent a distinct order of advance, with
unique-product production the least advanced, process production the
most advanced. They represent different stages of control over physical
limitations. This does not mean that opportunities for advance lie
everywhere in moving from the unique-product system to the
process-production system. Each system has its specific applications,
requirements, and limitations. But we advance to the extent to which we
can organize parts of production on the principles of a more advanced
system and learn, at the same time, how to harmonize different systems
within the same process.</p>
<p>There are also two general rules concerning the demands on management
competence made by each system. First, the systems differ not just in
the difficulty of their demands, but in the variety of competence and
the order of performance. Management, in moving from one system to
another, has to learn how to do new things rather than learn to do old
things better. Second, the more we succeed in applying consistently the
principles of each system , the easier it becomes for management to
satisfy its demands.</p>
<p>Each management has to meet the demands of the system it ought to
have according to the nature of its products and process, rather than
those of the system it actually uses. Being unable or unwilling to apply
what would be the most appropriate system results only in lack of
performance; it does not result in lower demands on management, but
inevitably increases the difficulties of managing the business.</p>
<p>One case in point is basic steelmaking, which has, in the batch
process, primarily a unique-product system. There is probably no
industry that has worked harder or more successfully on perfecting a
unique-product system. Yet the problems the managements of basic-steel
companies face are process-production problems: high fixed capital
requirements and the need for continuous production, resulting together
in high break-even points; the need for a high and constant level of
business; the need to make basic investment decisions for a long time
ahead, etc. As a result the cost structure of the steel industry is that
of capital-intensive process production. At the same time the
basic-steel industry enjoys few of the economic benefits of process
production. The steel industry is thus caught in a perpetual squeeze
between the cost characteristics of process production and the revenue
characteristics of unique-product production. In periods of very rapid
growth and extremely high demand, i.e., in the early stage of
industrialization by and large, it can be very profitable for a few
years. But over any extended period of time, steel industry
profitability will always be marginal and inadequate to the industry’s
own needs—until such time as the basic steelmaking process shifts from
mechanical unique-product production to what would in effect be a
chemical flow-process.</p>
<p>It is, in summary, of major importance in managing a business to know
which system applies; to carry its principles through as far as
possible; to find out which parts of production can be organized in a
more advanced system and to organize them accordingly; and to know what
demands each system makes on management.</p>
<p>Where historical and technological obstacles have barred the
organization of production in the appropriate system, as in the
basic-steel industry, it is a major challenge to management to work
systematically on overcoming these obstacles. Emphasis should not be on
working a little more effectively what is basically, the wrong
system.</p>
<p>Because it acted counter to these rules, the steel industry has
misdirected a great deal of its tremendous technological efforts.
Focused on improving the traditional process, the efforts will turn out
to have been wasted when steelmaking will finally become process
production—and that point is not very far off.</p>
<p>A business using the wrong system has to satisfy all the demands that
the appropriate and more advanced system would make on management. Yet
it does not have the where-</p>
<p>withal to pay for them, for this can come only out of the increased
ability to produce which the more advanced system provides.</p>
<p>All four principles of production provide the foundation for both
production work and achieving worker. All are compatible with the
dynamics of working or can be made compatible. When they fail to do so,
it is not the principle that is at fault; it is its misapplication.</p>
<p>Specifically, the failure of mass production to give the worker
achievement is essentially poor engineering. It is either failure to
understand the meaning of mechanization (see the next chapter; or it is
failure to understand the difference between work and working (as will
be discussed in Chapter 21).</p>
<p>Unique-Product Production</p>
<p>What, then, are these four systems of production and their
principles? In the first, the production of a unique product, each
product is distinct. Of course, strictly speaking, there is no such
thing as manufacturing unique products—they are produced only by the
artist. But building a battleship, a big turbine, or a skyscraper comes
close to turning out a unique product. So does the traditional way of
building houses, one at a time, and, in most cases, batch production in
a job shop.</p>
<p>What is unique in unique-product production is the product. In fact,
unique-product production is always organized around standardized tools
and it typically works with standardized materials.</p>
<p>Goldsmiths and silversmiths use the same tools and they produce very
similar final products. Yet the two crafts have traditionally been
organized separately because they use different materials. This may be
an extreme case, and overspecialization; but it illustrates the
fundamental characteristics of unique-product production.</p>
<p>In unique-product production the basic organization is by homogeneous
stages. In the building of the traditional single-family house—one of
the oldest examples of uniqueproduct production—we can distinguish four
such stages. First, digging the foundation and pouring concrete for the
foundation walls and the basement floor. Second, erecting frame and
roof. Third, installing plumbing and wiring equipment in the walls.
Finally, interior finishing. What makes each of these a distinct stage
is that work on the house can stop after each is completed, without any
damage—even for a fairly long time. On the other hand, within each
stage, work has to be carried right through; or else what has been done
already will be damaged and may even have to be done again. Each stage
can be varied from house to house without too much trouble or adjustment
and without delaying the next stage. Each of these stages by the inner
logic of the product, that is, the house, is an entity in itself.</p>
<p>Unique-product production, with its organization of the work by
homogeneous stages, is radically different from craft organization, in
which a carpenter does all the carpentry, a plumber all the plumbing,
etc. Properly organized, unique-product production does not go by craft
skills but by stage skills.</p>
<p>The model is the telephone installation man who, without being a
skilled electrician, carpenter, plumber, or roofer, installs electric
wiring, saws through boards, makes a ground connection, and can take up
a roof shingle and replace it. In other words, either every man engaged
in the work of a particular stage must be able to do everything needed
within that stage; or, as in the building of a big turbine, there must
be an integrated team for each stage which contains within itself all
the stage skills needed. No skill is needed by individual or team that
goes beyond the requirement of that particular stage.</p>
<p>This is largely how the U.S. succeeded in building ships at such a
tremendous rate during World War II. It was not mass production that
resulted in the unprecedented output of ships. It was the division of
the work into homogeneous stages; the systematic organization of the
work group for the specific requirements of each stage; and the
systematic training of a large number of people to do all the work
required within one stage. This</p>
<p>in turn made possible the progressive scheduling of the work flow,
which was the greatest timesaver.</p>
<p>Rigid and Flexible Mass Production</p>
<p>Most people when they hear the term “mass production” think
immediately of the assembly line. But this is misunderstanding. Very
little mass production work is assembly line work. The assembly line is
the rare exception even in true mass production of the most rigid kind.
A good example is the assembly of electronic appliances such as radios,
TV sets, and telephones. It is true mass production, but one worker does
the entire operation from start to finish. The operations are indeed in
sequence. In that sense there is a line which goes from putting in the
first rivet to soldering all wiring connections, and then to final
inspection. But there is no line in the traditional sense. The work
itself never moves but stays at the individual work place.</p>
<p>Altogether the assembly line, despite its prominence in popular
imagination and in the sociological literature of “alienation,” is quite
rare in reality. Only one out of every fifty workers in America in 1970
worked on an assembly line. Even in manufacturing employment assembly
lines are rare—with fewer than 6 percent of American manufacturing
workers doing assembly-line work. Assembly-line work is even the
exception in the automobile industry; of General Motors’s 550,000
employees, only one-third do assembly-line work.</p>
<p>The traditional picture of the assembly line assumes, moreover, that
there is only rigid mass production. The principle of production that is
clearly in the ascendant is “flexible”</p>
<p>mass production.</p>
<p>What both principles have in common is that the final product is
assembled out of standardized parts. In unique-product production, tools
and materials are standardized. In mass production, the parts are also
standardized. And they, in turn, are, as a rule, built of standardized
parts as well. Mass production, in other words, assembles rather than
makes.</p>
<p>Modern mass production goes back to the making of rifles for the
American infantryman in the War of 1812. By 1880, long before Henry”
Ford, mass-production methods were actually in wide use throughout
American industry, and also in such plants as the German Zeiss Optical
Works and the Ericsson telephone plant in Sweden.</p>
<p>It may be the origin in gun manufacture which explains why for long
years “rigid”</p>
<p>mass production was considered to be the only available
mass-production technology. In making guns for soldiers it is obviously
highly desirable to have a completely uniform end product. It is highly
desirable that each rifle be like any other, use exactly the same
ammunition, require exactly the same cleaning, and be repaired easily
with parts taken from any rifle.</p>
<p>In rigid mass production, therefore, the end product—in addition to
tools, materials, and parts—is also standardized and uniform. Flexible
mass production, however, uses standardization of parts to make possible
diversity of end products.</p>
<p>Historically, flexible mass production antedates rigid mass
production by many hundreds of years. It was developed long before
industrialization. We know far too little about the building methods of
the ancients to know what production processes they applied, though it
is highly likely that the profusion of Greek and Roman temples in Europe
and the Near East could have been built only on the basis of flexible
mass production. For the Gothic cathedral, and for all the thousands of
Gothic churches built in Northern and Western Europe between 1100 and
1300, the evidence is fully available. There is not the slightest doubt
that these were the product of flexible mass production. The basic
parts, building blocks, roofing, and so on, were fully standardized. But
their assembly varied with the architect’s plan. Only windows,
ornaments, doors, i.e., the features that make one church look
different, were produced by unique-product production methods. But—and
this is vitally important—all these are features that are added on to
the basically finished building. Diversity of product, in other words,
in the Gothic cathedrals, and even more in the small Gothic parish
church, was provided at the very end of the process. The basic</p>
<p>process itself was standardized, though it resulted in a very large
diversity of finished products.</p>
<p>Similarly, the enormous number of Japanese Buddhist temples built
between A.D. 700 and 1600 were also built by flexible mass-production
methods. Each of these temples looks quite different. And yet each is
put together out of essentially standardized parts, such as beams
standardized as to width and length; standardized roofing and roof
tiles; standardized intervals between the various levels of a pagoda,
and so on. The individually distinctive features, e.g., doors or iron
grilles or the ornamentation of the tiles on the roof’s edge, were added
only at the very end, thus creating brilliant diversity based, however,
on true mass production, that is, on standardized parts assembled
according to prearranged patterns. Japanese temples, built of wood,
burned down again and again. But they could always be rebuilt exactly
from drawings showing only exterior appearance. Everything structural
was so standardized that any skilled craftsman knew exactly what it had
to be.</p>
<p>Without mass-production methods, neither the Gothic cathedrals and
churches nor the Japanese temples could have been built. They had to be
built essentially by semiskilled, if not unskilled, workers. Skilled men
in the numbers that would have been needed to erect such major
structures in such enormous quantities were simply not available in what
were then poor, largely illiterate, and thinly populated areas.
Mass-production methods alone made it possible for ordinary farm folk,
drafted for a few months of work in the summer, or volunteering for the
spiritual rewards of participation in such holy work, to do the great
bulk of the work, with skilled artisans needed only to supervise and to
execute the distinctive finishing touches.</p>
<p>When the principle of mass production was rediscovered, however, in
the nineteenth century, uniform standardized end products were taken for
granted. Henry Ford illustrates this perfectly.</p>
<p>When Henry Ford said, “The customer can have a car in any color as
long as it’s black,” he was not joking. He meant to express the essence
of mass production as the manufacture of uniform products in large
quantity. Of course, he knew that it would be easy enough to give his
customer a choice of color; all that was needed was to give the painter
at the end of the assembly line three or four spray guns instead of one.
But Ford also realized, rightly, that the uniformity of the product
would soon be gone altogether once he made any concession to diversity.
To him the uniformity of the product was the key to mass production.</p>
<p>However, from the beginning, the alternative, flexible mass
production, was actually being used—though rarely understood. Otto
Doering, who built the first mail-order plant for Sears, Roebuck,
designed a genuine mass-production plant to handle an enormous diversity
of individual orders. The individual items in the mail-order catalog
were the “standardized parts.” Every order went through the same process
in being filled. But what was finally assembled was not a “standard
order,” it was whatever the customer had ordered, on one shipping
pallet, with one invoice, and yet with a range of diversity almost
beyond belief. Very early in Sears, Roebuck’s history the catalog came
to contain many thousands of items, which meant theoretically—and to a
large extent practically—that the end product had to be assembled in
millions of different combinations, with the probability of any two
orders being identical practically nil.</p>
<p>Even earlier, Ernst Abbé (as discussed in Chapter 20) had organized
lens-making in the Zeiss Optical Works in Jena, Germany, as flexible
mass production.</p>
<p>Another example, this one from the 1930s and 1940s, was the
farm-equipment manufacturer in Southern California who designed and made
specialized cultivating machines for large-scale farming on irrigated
land. Every one of his designs was unique. He made, for instance, a
machine that performs, with various attachments, all operations needed
in large-scale cucumber growing—from preparing the hills in the spring,
to harvesting cucumbers at the right stage of their growth, to pickling
them. He rarely made more than one of each machine at a time. Yet every
one of his more than seven hundred different machines was made up
entirely of mass-produced, uniform, standardized parts, which some-</p>
<p>one in the American economy turned out by the thousands. His biggest
job was not to design a machine that identified cucumbers of the right
ripeness for pickling, but to find a mass producer of a part that,
though originally designed for an entirely different purpose, would,
when put on the cucumber cultivator, do whatever was needed.</p>
<p>The specific technique for applying the principle of flexible mass
production is the systematic analysis of products to find the pattern
that underlies their apparent diversity. Then this pattern can be
organized so that the minimum number of standardized parts will make
possible the assembly of the maximum number of products. The burden of
diversity, in other words, is taken out of manufacturing and shifted to
assembly.</p>
<p>There are obviously processes in which standardization of the end
product is desirable. Rifles for the infantryman are but one example.
There are other processes in which enough diversity of appearance can be
engineered into a rigid mass-production process to satisfy the market
need.</p>
<p>General Motors often points out that there are so many options on its
cars—colors, body styles, seat fabrics, accessories, and so on—that the
customer can actually choose from millions of different final-product
combinations. More important—though not often advertised by General
Motors—is the fact that all makes of General Motors (Chevrolet, Pontiac,
Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac) use the same frames, the same bodies, and
very substantially the same engine, let alone the same brakes, the same
lighting system, and so on. Yet the cars look different, have different
characteristics, and represent a great variety of combinations of basic
standardized elements. All these cars (excepting only Cadillac) are put
together on the same assembly line. All of them are, in effect, products
of rigid mass production and are turned out in a process that has
remained almost unchanged since Henry Ford’s early days.</p>
<p>To obtain the appearance of diversity from rigid mass production
requires, however, a volume of production for every one of the parts to
be assembled on which few industries, other than the automobile
industry, can count. Unless the volume for any one constituent type is
very large, rigid mass production can, as Ford saw, turn out only a
truly standardized product.</p>
<p>American Motors, for instance, is at a very real disadvantage because
it has to turn out a fair diversity of end products—at least in looks
and styling—without the General Motors volume. And yet it produces
300,000 to 400,000 cars a year—a very large volume by any measure other
than that of the American automobile industry.</p>
<p>For most mass-production processes the preferred principle should be
flexible mass production. Until recently, however, mechanization and
flexible mass production were hard to combine. The tools appropriate to
mass production were inherently inflexible.</p>
<p>The advent of the computer is rapidly changing this, for the
computer, and especially the small process computer, which is, so to
speak, a part of the machine or machine tool, eliminates the
inflexibility of the tool and with it the main obstacle to flexible mass
production. In traditional mass production—and in traditional machine
production altogether—any change in product or process requires stopping
the process. Change requires altering the machine setup, cleaning tools,
changing the position of work and of materials, changing speeds, and so
on. As long as this had to be done by hand, it required far too much
time. Worse still, changing one tool meant stopping the entire process.
Computer control, e.g., numerical control on a machine tool, eliminates
the time need. The computer can make the change instantly on the basis
of’ a preset command. Instead of taking hours, changes take seconds, or
at most minutes.</p>
<p>This is not automation. (On mechanization and automation, see the
next chapter.) This is a radical improvement in mechanization. Two
examples are the shipbuilders of Japan and Sweden. That these two
countries were able in the sixties to gain a dominant position in world
shipbuilding and all but crowd out such old and experienced producers as
the Scots at the Clydeside and the Germans in Hamburg is not the result
of lower wages. Swedish wages are, if anything, higher than wages in
Germany and Scotland. It is the result of the application of computer
control to convert shipbuilding, traditionally a uniqueproduct process,
to flexible mass production. As a result, Swedish and Japanese
shipyards</p>
<p>can build ships from standardized parts and yet turn out final
products of great diversity, not only in appearance but also in size,
structure, speed, and so on. The job is still, as in the traditional
unique-product process, organized by stages. But within each stage the
process is a mass-production process in which the parts are standardized
but in which the configuration of parts has almost infinite flexibility.
The process results both in much lower cost and in much greater
speed—and above all, in almost complete predictability of the building
cycle and in such tight control of scheduling that—almost for the first
time in the history of shipbuilding—a reliable and dependable delivery
date for the finished product can be set far in advance.</p>
<p>Computerized control of process changes has also been applied—and
with similar results—to other products, e.g., to the making of glass
bottles.</p>
<p>Computerized control requires redesign of the process. It is
difficult, expensive, and requires hard, time-consuming analysis of
product and process. But wherever it has been used to convert a rigid
process to flexible mass production, there has been major cost
reduction-sometimes reaching 50 to 60 percent. Production speeds have
been substantially increased. Scheduling has become as reliable as in
rigid plant production. At the same time, true marketing has become
possible.</p>
<p>The architects of the Gothic cathedrals and churches could design a
church to fit the needs of the individual customer, the bishop,
cathedral chapter, or parish, and yet have what, in effect, was a
standardized production process using standardized parts and with
semiskilled, if not totally unskilled, labor.</p>
<p>Similarly, flexible mass production can turn out a very large variety
of truly different products and yet have a totally standardized process
of production. For this reason one can predict that it is flexible mass
production that will increasingly become the massproduction system of
tomorrow, with rigid mass production increasingly confined to the very
small number of end products where basic uniformity is in itself a
fundamental customer need and customer specification.</p>
<p>Process Production</p>
<p>The fourth system is process production. Here process and product
become one.</p>
<p>The classic example of a process industry is the oil refinery. The
end products that a refinery will obtain out of crude oil are determined
by the process it uses. It can produce only the oil distillates for
which it is built and only in definite proportions. If new distillates
have to be added or if the proportion of the various distillates is to
be changed significantly, the refinery has to be rebuilt. Process
production is the rule in the chemical industries. It is, with minor
variations, the basic system of a milk-processing or a plateglass
plant.</p>
<p>Process production is an integrated system. There are no stages in
it, there are no parts. There is only one process. Typically, process
production starts with one basic material. But by the logic of that
material, e.g., crude oil, it ends up with a multitude of very different
end products for very different end uses. The process itself has high
rigidity— more rigidity even than rigid mass production. The end product
typically has far more diversity than even unique-product
production.</p>
<p>Because process production is a system, it has tremendous economies
and tremendous productivity where it is appropriate. But where it is
misapplied, or where it is not truly developed into process
production—as in the example of basic steelmaking given above—its
rigidity and cost tend to outweigh its benefits.</p>
<p>Process production is, or should be, the model for a great many
production processes which historically have been organized as
unique-product production or as rigid mass production. The basic
difference in performance between a well-run telephone system and most
post offices is that telephone service is organized as process
production and as a true system. Post offices everywhere are, organized
at best on mass-production principles— and, in effect, by and large,
still on unique-product principles with “stages” of the process and with
totally different processes for different “products,” that is, different
kinds of</p>
<p>mail, or letters versus parcels. To be sure, it is easier to move
electronic impulses than it is to move paper, let alone heavy parcels.
But wherever a mail service has been able to improve its performance
significantly, it has done so by trying to approximate its system to a
model of process production.</p>
<p>All transportation, whether of mail, freight, or people, should be
considered process production. The means of transportation always have
to be a system, have to have great rigidity, have to be scheduled and
have to be integrated with one another. But each letter, each parcel,
let alone each passenger, has a separate destination. There is,
therefore, almost infinite diversity of “end products.” And this only a
system, that is, essentially, process production, can organize and can
perform effectively, productively, and with high satisfaction to the
customer.</p>
<p>What Each Principle Demands</p>
<p>Each of the four principles has different characteristics and makes
different demands. Each has its own costs. Each has its own
vulnerabilities. Each has its own strengths.</p>
<p>another example, but so is the hospital. These are inherently highly
vulnerable industries or services which combine the worst of both
worlds, such as high break-even points and inflexibility of product mix.
We usually do not know how to put such industries on true
process-production, but the more closely such industries or services can
attain genuine process production in part of their activities, the
better will they perform, both in quality and in economic terms.</p>
<p>Process production requires continuing high volume. The typical
process plant in the chemical industry or in the plate-glass industry
can operate only at or near peak capacity. Otherwise it has to be shut
down. It has great diversity of product mix, but it has little or no
flexibility. It can produce only the products for which the system has
been designed. It requires extreme skill in design. It may require very
high skill in operation, e.g., on the part of schedulers, pilots, and
maintenance people of an airline. But it may also require very little
skill, as in the typical oil refinery. But it requires a very high
degree of judgment by practically every employee.</p>
<p>Since product and process have, so to speak, become one in process
production, new products will be created by changes in the process, even
if there is no demand for them in the existing market. This is a common
occurrence in the chemical industry, but also typi-</p>
<p>cal of the airlines industry. When a new, bigger plane comes in, a
new market has to be created. It is characteristic of process production
that the volume of production cannot be increased gradually. The minimum
unit of production—whether a new chemical plant or a new jumbo jet—is so
large that it requires a quantum jump in production, and with it new
markets.</p>
<p>In unique-product production, management’s first job is to get an
order. In both kinds of mass production, the job is to build an
effective distributive organization and to educate the customer to adapt
his wants to the available range of product variety. In process
production, the first task is to create, maintain, and expand a market
and to create new</p>
<p>markets. To distribute kerosene lamps free to the Chinese peasants to
create a market for kerosene—the famous Standard Oil story of eighty
years ago—is a good example of what this means.</p>
<p>In the unique-product system the time span of decisions is short.
Under both types of mass production it becomes longer: a distributive
organization, for instance, may take ten years to build. But under a
process system, decisions are made for an even longer future.</p>
<p>Once built, the productive facilities are relatively inflexible and
can be changed only at major expense; the total investment is likely to
be large; and the development of a market is long range. The marketing
systems of the big oi1 companies are good examples.</p>
<p>The more advanced the production organization, the more important are
decisions for the future.</p>
<p>Each system requires different management skills and organization.
Unique-product production requires people good at technical functions.
Mass production, rigid and flexible, requires management trained in
analytical thinking, in scheduling, and in planning. Flexible mass
production as well as process production require management trained in
seeing a business as a whole, in conceptual synthesis, and in
decision-making.</p>
<p>There are significant differences with respect to the work force and
its management.</p>
<p>Unique-product production can usually adjust its work force to
economic fluctuations, keeping in bad times only foremen and a nucleus
of the most highly skilled. It can, as a rule, find what other skills it
needs on the labor market. Precisely because they have limited skill,
the workers in mass production must increasingly demand employment
stability from the enterprise. The work force in process production
represents such an investment in judgment that the business must try to
maintain employment stability. It is neither accident nor philanthropy
that the oil companies—typical process businesses—have tried so hard to
keep employment steady even in bad depression years.</p>
<p>These four principles of production are “pure” types. But there are
many businesses— and equally many non-businesses (the hospital would be
an example)—where different parts of the work are best organized on
different principles. How then can these principles be combined?</p>
<p>The hospital needs unique-product production. Patient care can be
given only on that basis, even though the great majority of patients in
any hospital fall into a very small number of highly predictable and
highly repetitive categories, such as childbirth, minor orthopedic
surgery, cardiac cases, and so on. At the same time, the medical
services, from X-ray to medical laboratory to physical therapy, have to
be organized in what is essentially flexible mass production. The same
applies to the “hotel” services, i.e., the feeding of patients, the
housekeeping, and so on. Other parts of the hospital require a genuine
system design, i.e., process production. Yet all this has to be
integrated into one hospital, one management, and one process and has to
be delivered to the same patient at his bedside.</p>
<p>Few industrial processes are as complicated as the hospital; but an
airline also has a variety of “production principles” which inform
different parts of its work, and even different parts of its
transportation operation.</p>
<p>The rule for the use of different principles in one organization is
simple—though by no means easy of application. Different principles of
production can work well in the same organization; but they must not be
mixed.</p>
<p>It is fairly easy to organize, for instance, the bulk of the
production process as mass production, either rigid or flexible, with
unique-product production both at the end and at the beginning of the
process, which was what the builders of the Gothic cathedrals or the
Japanese temples did. This is what today’s mass builder of houses does
who designs three or four basic models from the same standardized parts,
then adapts these models to a fairly large variety of different end
products with different floor plans, different lighting and decorating
schemes, and different exterior trim.</p>
<p>But where different principles of production have to be mixed
together, there is confusion, there is friction, there is inefficiency.
This is a basic problem of the hospital, where no one so far has found a
way to separate what are, in effect, quite different principles of
production in the delivery of patient care.</p>
<p>Managers, therefore, need to understand what principles of production
are truly appropriate to the different stages of the production process
they have to manage. They have to analyze the logic of each stage. And
if they find that they require different principles to be organized,
they have then to try to separate these stages so that they do not
interfere with each other. This organization, however, cannot be done by
imitating what others are doing. It requires that management—whether of
a business or of a public-service institution—analyze its own work and
its own production processes. It also requires that management
understand the basic principles of production, their characteristics,
their limitations, and their requirements.</p>
