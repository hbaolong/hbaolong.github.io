Working: Theories and Realities</h4>
<p>McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Z—The Evidence for “Theory Y” —And Its
Weak- nesses—Maslow’s Criticism—What Is the Manager’s Reality? —Why “the
Stick” No Longer Works— “Big Fear” and “Little Fears” —The Overly Potent
“Carrot” —The Myth of Anti-materialism—The Demand for “Much More” —And
Its Toxic Side Ef- fects—From Master to Manager—Can We Replace Carrot
and Stick? —Enlightened Psychological Despotism—Why It Will Not
Work—What Then Can Work?</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>ince the writings of the human-relations school first came to the
notice of managers around World War II, there has been a proliferation
of books, papers, and studies on motivation and achievement, on
industrial psychology and industrial sociology, on interpersonal
relations at work and on worker satisfaction. Indeed, the literature on
man- aging worker and working, in quantity at least, exceeds the
literature in any other man- agement field, including even the
management sciences and the computer.</p>
<p>The most widely read and most often quoted of these books is probably
Douglas McGregor’s The Human Side of Enterprise,* with its Theory X and
Theory Y. McGregor conducted no original research. He acknowledged
freely in his book that he had devel- oped no new ideas but had
formulated the ideas of others (and especially those I had put forth in
three earlier books†). But his book fully deserves the wide attention it
has re- ceived. McGregor powerfully presented fundamental choices for
managing worker and working. His Theory X—the traditional approach to
worker and working—assumes that people are lazy, dislike and shun work,
have to be driven and need both carrot and stick. It assumes that most
people are incapable of taking responsibility for themselves and have to
be looked after. By contrast, Theory Y assumes that people have a
psychological need to work and want achievement and responsibility.
Theory X assumes immaturity. Theory Y assumes fundamentally that people
want to be adults.</p>
<p>McGregor presented these two theories as alternatives and pretended
to impartiality.</p>
<p>Yet no reader ever doubted—or was meant to doubt—that McGregor
himself believed wholeheartedly in Theory Y.</p>
<p>There is impressive evidence for Theory Y. On most jobs most workers,
even those hostile to boss and organization, want to like their work and
look for achievement. In most jobs even the most alienated workers
manage to find something that gives them sat- isfaction.</p>
<p>This was first brought out in the late 1940s, when General Motors
conducted a large- scale contest on “My Job and Why I Like It” (of which
unfortunately few results have been published). Almost 190,000 workers
wrote in and discussed their jobs—by far the largest sample of worker
attitudes we have ever obtained. Very few were uncritical. But</p>
<p>*McGraw-Hill, 1960.</p>
<p>†Concept of the Corporation, The New Society, and The Practice of
Management.</p>
<p>even fewer did not find something that made them like the job, did
not mention some challenge in it, some achievement and satisfaction,
some true motivation.</p>
<p>Equally convincing are the extensive studies of Frederick Herzberg on
knowledge workers (already mentioned in Chapter 16). Herzberg produced
example after example that knowledge workers want achievement and will
indeed work only if there is achieve- ment in their job. Otherwise they
will at best go through the motions.</p>
<p>The most moving statement of Theory Y antedates behavioral science by
thousands of years. It is the funeral oration for the fallen Athenians
which Thucydides has Pericles de- liver in his great history of the
Peloponnesian War. What Pericles said, in effect, was that Athens was a
Theory Y society as against the Spartans, who were probably the world’s
most consistent practitioners of Theory X.</p>
<p>Yet things are far less simple than McGregor’s followers would make
us—and them- selves—believe. In the first place, we have learned that
Theory Y is not by itself ade- quate. When I first propounded what
McGregor later formulated and popularized as The- ory Y, I laid great
stress on the fact that this was not “permissive.” On the contrary, I
said that to manage worker and working by putting responsibility on the
worker and by aiming at achievement made exceedingly high demands on
both worker and manager. McGregor also saw this, though he did not
stress it.*</p>
<p>Maslow’s Criticism</p>
<p>An ardent enthusiast for Theory Y, the late Abraham H. Maslow,
pointed out that the de- mands are actually much higher than even I had
seen. Maslow spent one year working closely with a small company in
Southern California which at the time tried to practice Theory Y. In the
book he wrote on his experience,† Maslow pointed out that the demand for
responsibility and achievement may well go far beyond what any but the
strong and healthy can take. He sharply criticized me and McGregor for
“inhumanity” to the weak, the vulnerable, the damaged, who are unable to
take on the responsibility and self- discipline which Theory Y demands.
Even the strong and healthy, Maslow concluded, need the security of
order and direction; and the weak need protection against the burden of
responsibility. The world is not, Maslow concluded, peopled by adults.
It has its full share of the permanently immature.</p>
<p>Of course, Maslow only paraphrased Dostoyevsky’s famous legend of the
Grand In- quisitor in The Brothers Karamazov. Unlike Dostoyevsky’s Grand
Inquisitor, Maslow, however, did not conclude that paternalist
oppression is the only way to manage and, in fact, the only kindness to
man. His conclusion was far more important and far more valid.
Maslow—who, until his death a few years later, remained a strong
advocate of Theory Y—concluded that it is not enough to remove
restraints. One has to replace the security of Theory X and the
certainty it gives by another but different structure of security and
cer- tainty. There is need to provide by different means what commands
and penalties do un- der Theory X. Theory Y, in other words, has to go
far beyond Theory X. It cannot simply be substituted for it.</p>
<p>This is an important insight. And it is clearly proven by all our
experience with The- ory Y.</p>
<p>In fact, while Maslow wrote Eupsychian Management, one of McGregor’s
closest friends and disciples proved Maslow’s point. Warren Bennis,
himself a distinguished in- dustrial psychologist (and the editor of
McGregor’s posthumous book, The Professional Manager, mentioned above),
attempted in the late sixties to convert the University of Buffalo, in
upstate New York, from an old, tired, and rundown school into a major,
first- rate university. His approach and that of his colleagues was
clearly based on Theory Y— but without giving structure, direction, and
security. The result was tremendous excite- ment but also total failure.
Instead of achievement, there was lack of direction, lack of</p>
<p>*An oversight repaired in his posthumous The Professional Manager
(McGraw-Hill, 1967). †Eupsychian Management (Irwin, 1965).</p>
<p>objectives, lack of controls, and frustration—as Bennis (who later
became president of the University of Cincinnati) himself recounts.</p>
<p>One conclusion from Maslow’s work is that Theory Y is not permissive,
as so many of its advocates believe. It is not freedom from restraint.
It is not, as its critics contend, in- dulging the worker, let alone
coddling him. It is a stern taskmaster, sterner in many ways than the
Theory X—which it replaces. It has to achieve what Theory X achieved,
and then do a good deal more—or else it will prove too great a burden
and will make demands human beings cannot meet.</p>
<p>It has now become clear that Theory X and Theory Y are not, as
McGregor main- tained, theories about human nature (a position never
shared by me, by the way). Whether we will ever know enough about human
nature to have any theories about it re- mains to be seen. But so far,
the evidence is not at all conclusive.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that there are undoubtedly lazy people as there are
undoubtedly en- ergetic ones. Far more important, however, is that
ordinary, everyday experience teaches us that the same people react
quite differently to different circumstances. They may be lazy and
resist work to the point of sabotaging it in one situation. They may be
motivated to achievement in another one. It is clearly not human nature
nor personality structure that is at issue. Or at the very least, there
are different human natures which behave differently under different
conditions.</p>
<p>Modern American slang talks of being “turned on” or “turned off” by
an assignment, a teacher, a job, or a boss. These terms have been
criticized as dehumanizing. They refer to people, it is being said, as
if they were electrical appliances. But everyday experience shows that
this is exactly how a great many people behave. They react rather than
act. The motivation, the drive, the impulse lie outside of them.</p>
<p>But this is not compatible with either Theory X or Theory Y. It
implies that it is not human nature but the structure of job and work
that, in effect, determines how people will act and what management they
will require.</p>
<p>We also now know that individuals can acquire the habit of
achievement but can also acquire the habit of defeat. This again is not
compatible with either the Theory X or the Theory Y of human nature.</p>
<p>The best-known work in this area has been done by David C. McClelland
at Harvard.* McClelland has taken the position that the desire to
achieve is conditioned largely by cul- ture and by experiences, both of
which can be changed even in a non-achieving culture such as that of the
Indian caste system. The most extensive study of actual worker behav-
ior in large-scale industry, the work which the Canadian-born English
psychiatrist Elliott Jaques† conducted for many years at the Glacier
Metal Company in London (together with the company’s chief executive,
Wilfred Brown), supports the same conclusion.</p>
<p>What Is the Manager’s Reality?</p>
<p>The debate over the scientific validity of Theory X versus Theory Y
is, therefore, largely a sham battle. The question the manager needs to
ask is not “Which theory of human na- ture is right?” The question is
“What is the reality of my situation and how can I discharge my task of
managing worker and working in today’s situation?”</p>
<p>The basic fact—unpalatable but inescapable—is that the traditional
Theory X ap- proach to managing, that is, the carrot-and-stick way, no
longer works. In developed countries, it does not even work for manual
workers, and nowhere can it work for knowl- edge workers. The stick is
no longer available to the manager, and the carrot is today be- coming
less and less of an incentive.</p>
<p>The stick of the traditional approach to managing worker and working
was hunger and fear. Traditionally, all but a handful of men in every
society lived at the very margin of subsistence and in imminent threat
of starvation. One bad harvest was enough to force an</p>
<p>*See his book, Motivating Economic Achievement (Free Press,
1969).</p>
<p>†See his books, Changing Culture of the Factory (Dryden Press, 1952),
and Equitable Payment; a General Theory of Work; Differential Payment
and Individual Progress (Wiley, 1961).</p>
<p>Indian or Chinese peasant to sell his daughters into prostitution.
One bad harvest was enough for him to lose the tiny plot of land which
was all that stood between him and beggary. Now, even in only moderately
affluent countries, there is an economic floor well above subsistence
level, even for the very poor. The worker knows today, in every devel-
oped country, that he and his family will not starve if he loses his
job. He may have to do without a lot of things he would like to have,
but he can survive.</p>
<p>Marx’s Lumpenproletariat, that is, the unemployables, still exist
even in some very rich countries. But Marx’s proletariat has
disappeared—and with it the stick of Theory X.</p>
<p>Even where fear exists, it has largely ceased to motivate. Instead of
motivation, fear is becoming a demotivator. One reason for this is the
spread of education, the other reason is the emergence of the society of
organization. The spread of education makes people employable. It gives
them a wider horizon. Even poorly educated people in today’s soci- ety
now know of opportunities. In a society of organizations it is possible
to gain access to a new job. In a society of organizations there is
lateral mobility. Losing one’s job is still unpleasant. But it is no
longer catastrophe.</p>
<p>The English tenant farmer, no matter how accomplished or industrious,
who was evicted by his landlord became a “sturdy beggar.” There was no
other employment for him, except an occasional day of work as a casual
laborer helping out with the harvest. Losing one’s job was more than a
life sentence; it usually condemned a man’s children and his
grandchildren. It made a man an outcast. Now the man who loses his job
registers with the employment exchange for another one. Even at the
depth of a serious recession today—e.g., the American recession of
1970-1971—there were hardly any long-term un- employed adult male
workers.</p>
<p>In addition, there is rising employment security which protects a man
in his job. It takes many forms. In Sweden a three-partite board
guarantees a man another job and pro- vides for his training and support
between jobs (see Chapter 22). In most European (and Latin American)
countries, there are legal restrictions on firing. There are seniority
provi- sions which make job security into a right. In the United States,
increasingly, income, if not employment, is maintained for long periods
through such contractual provisions as supplemental unemployment
compensation.</p>
<p>All developed countries are moving toward the system of the modern
university, where a faculty member after a few years of service acquires
tenure, which all but com- pletely commits his employer to a job for
him. At the same time, the faculty member has almost unlimited mobility
and can freely move from one university position to another.</p>
<p>Japan has lifetime employment, which binds both employer and worker.
Fear of being fired, therefore, does not exist in Japan, at least not in
the “modern” sector. This (as the next chapter will discuss) is a major
factor in Japan’s economic achievement.</p>
<p>The Japanese example also shows that the more fear disappears as a
stick, the more counterproductive remnants of fear become. The Japanese
worker knows that he is tied to an employer and is unlikely to find
other employment if he loses his present job. This makes him dedicated
to the welfare of the organization that employs him. But it also makes
him resent bitterly any structural change in the economy that might
threaten the industry or occupation that employs him—the reason, for
instance, for the extremely bad labor relations on the Japanese National
Railroads. The Japanese worker’s inability to move also makes him
defenseless against the pressure to conform exerted by the organi-
zation. This is increasingly unacceptable to the young educated people.
Indeed, while still expecting the security of lifetime employment, they
increasingly demand for themselves the right to move to another
employer. Rousseau pointed out two hundred years ago that the “right to
emigrate” is the ultimate safeguard of personal liberty.</p>
<p>Japan, it is reasonable to predict, will move toward a system under
which the worker has guarantees of income and job, but also
mobility.</p>
<p>Modern behavioral psychology has demonstrated that great fear
coerces, while rem- nants of fear cause only resentment and resistance.
Fear in all developed countries has lost its coercive power. The lesser
fears that still remain do not motivate. They destroy moti-
vation—precisely because they lack full power and full credibility.</p>
<p>“Big Fear” and “Little Fears”</p>
<p>The “big fear” still motivates where it is truly credible, as is
shown by the quite unex- pected success which a new approach to “curing”
alcoholism has had. Everybody has “known” that the true alcoholic cannot
stop drinking until he is completely down and out, if then. But a good
many employers are now finding that a very large percentage of alco-
holic workers do indeed stop drinking—permanently—if told in unequivocal
language that they will otherwise be fired and that potential new
employers will be told of their problem, so that they are unlikely to
find another job.</p>
<p>But, save in such exceptional cases as the alcoholic who knows that
he is rapidly be- coming unemployable, the big stick, the horrible fear
which drove workers yesterday, is no longer available to today’s manager
in the developed countries, whether the manager likes it or not. It is
extremely foolish to try to depend on “little sticks,” that is, whatever
remnants of fear are still available. To be sure, any organization needs
disciplinary de- vices, but their role and purpose is to take care of
marginal friction. They cannot provide the drive. If misused to drive,
disciplinary devices can cause only resentment and resis- tance. They
can only demotivate.</p>
<p>The Overly Potent Carrot</p>
<p>The carrot of material rewards has not, like the stick of fear, lost
its potency. On the con- trary, it has become so potent that it must be
used with great caution. It has become too potent to be a dependable
tool.</p>
<p>The Sunday issue of every newspaper these days contains an article by
a learned soci- ologist or philosopher reporting that people are turning
away from material satisfactions. On the front page of the same paper,
Sundays and weekdays, there is then always a story that this or that
group of workers—teachers or electricians, newspaper reporters or fire-
men, salesclerks or stevedores—have presented the biggest wage demand
ever or have obtained the biggest wage raise ever.</p>
<p>When the youthful rebels against material civilization half a century
ago went back to nature, all they needed was a tent or a sleeping bag.
These days, turning one’s back on material civilization seems to require
an ,000 camper-truck. The youthful rebels of the 1920s played their
back-to-nature songs on a ukulele; today we need an electronic guitar to
express our rejection of technology. The same European intellectuals who
so vocally inveigh against American materialism use the fees they get
for their lectures and articles for such nonmaterial satisfactions as a
sports car, an airplane trip to a plush resort, or the purchase of a
villa on a Mediterranean beach.</p>
<p>There is not one shred of evidence for the alleged turning away from
material rewards.</p>
<p>On the contrary, affluence means that everybody believes that
material rewards are and should be within his easy reach. Samuel
Gompers, the long-time head of the American labor movement, used to
define the aims of a labor union in one word: “more.” He would surely
have to change this today to “much more.” Anti-materialism is a myth, no
matter how much it is extolled. So far, at least, the reality is
tremendous and steadily rising mate- rial expectations, i.e.,
expectations for more goods and services.</p>
<p>This is not confined to the capitalist world. It has become the
massive reality of com- munist societies as well. In the thirties Stalin
did not hesitate to cut back drastically on the people’s diet when
Russia had a bad harvest. His successors, in 1972, faced by a much less
poor harvest, instead dipped deeply into Russia’s strategic gold
reserves to buy grain from the archenemy, the United States. Mao, in the
years of the Great Cultural Revolution in the sixties, thundered against
“economism,” i.e., against material incentives and re- wards. By the
early seventies the emphasis in China had shifted to heavy stress on
such capitalist incentives as bicycles and sewing machines as rewards
for performance.</p>
<p>The demand for much more is obviously going to run ultimately into
the finite limita- tions of the earth’s resources and the need to
preserve the environment. What we experi- ence today may therefore
indeed be the final frenzied agony of the “material civilization.” But,
at least for the foreseeable future, this will mean above all an even
faster shift from</p>
<p>goods to services as carriers of satisfaction, and with it, from
material-intensive to labor- intensive (and especially
knowledge-labor-intensive) wants and purchases. It is most unlikely, for
the foreseeable future, to alter the basic characteristics. On the
contrary; that rising raw-material prices and ecology costs will push up
the cost of goods is almost cer- tain to add fuel to the fire of demands
for more, much more, monetary rewards.</p>
<p>It is precisely the rising level of material expectations that makes
the carrot of material rewards less and less effective as a motivating
force and as a managerial tool.</p>
<p>The increment of material rewards capable of motivating people to
work has to be- come larger. As people get more they do not become
satisfied with a little more, let alone with less. They expect much
more. This is, of course, one of the major causes of the re- lentless
inflationary pressures that besiege every major economy today. Whereas a
5 per- cent wage boost was, a short few years ago, a major satisfaction,
the teamsters—or the teachers or the physicians—now demand 40 percent
and expect 20 percent.</p>
<p>This may be a manifestation of Maslow’s rule that the closer a need
comes to being satisfied, the larger an increment of additional
gratification will be required to produce the same satisfaction. But the
demand for more and much more of material satisfactions has also been
accompanied by a change in values that does not fit Maslow’s scheme at
all. Economic incentives are becoming rights rather than rewards. Merit
raises are always introduced as rewards for exceptional performance. In
no time at all they become a right. To deny a merit raise or to grant
only a small one becomes punishment. The same is true of Japan’s
semiannual bonus.</p>
<p>But whatever the explanation, the result of the increasing demand for
material rewards is rapidly destroying their usefulness as incentives
and managerial tools. The manager must try to deemphasize the role of
material rewards rather than use them as a carrot. If only very
large—and steadily larger—increments have an incentive effect, then
using material incentives becomes self-defeating. The expected result in
terms of motivation will be obtained, but the cost will be so high as to
exceed the benefits. The cost will eat up the additional productivity.
This is, of course, what has been happening with respect to material
incentives for managers (e.g., stock option or extra compensation plans)
as well as with respect to material incentives for all other classes of
workers.</p>
<p>That inflation has become the central problem of the developed
economies is, in terms of traditional or Keynesian economic theory, pure
paradox. Inflation should not occur under conditions of high productive
capacity and high productivity. Instead it is the norm. The reason is
the totally unexpected size of economic appetites, the totally
unexpected potency of material rewards. The result, however, is that to
enable economy, society and enterprise to survive, managers must try to
curb and to contain economic incentives rather than rely on them. The
economic incentive that has a true carrot effect is “too much.” Only
economic rewards that fall well below the threshold of motivational
effectiveness are likely to be defensible economically and in terms of
productivity and contribution.</p>
<p>This also means that the social side effects of the carrot are
reaching toxic propor- tions. A potent medicine always has side effects;
and the larger the dosage, the greater the side effects. Material
incentives and rewards is a very strong medicine indeed, and be- coming
more potent. It therefore is bound to have potent side effects, which
become more pronounced and more dangerous as the dosage required for
effectiveness increases. In particular (as said before in Chapter 16)
the more total income goes up, the more power- ful does dissatisfaction
over relative compensation become. As all our studies show— beginning
with the GM contest “My Job” in the late forties—there is no more
powerful disincentive, no more effective bar to motivation, than
dissatisfaction over one’s own pay compared to that of one’s peers. Once
people’s incomes rise above the subsistence level, dissatisfaction with
relative incomes is a far more powerful sentiment than dissatisfaction
with one’s absolute income. The “sense of injustice,” as Edmond Cahn,
the American legal philosopher, convincingly argued, is deeply ingrained
in man. Nothing is as likely to offend the sense of injustice as
dissatisfaction with relative economic rewards in an or- ganization. An
organization is a redistributive economy (see Chapter 16); relative
eco-</p>
<p>nomic rewards are therefore power and status decisions on the worth
of a person or a group.</p>
<p>Reliance on the carrot of economic rewards therefore runs the risk of
alienating both the recipient and all others. It runs the risk of
dividing the group against itself while unit- ing it against the system,
i.e., against the employing institution and its management.</p>
<p>Clearly no de-emphasis of material rewards is likely. Managers face
instead the tre- mendous challenge of finding some means to relate the
growing emphasis on “much more” to economic reality, i.e., to
productivity and profitability. Material rewards are too potent to be
relied on as the main positive motivator. This can only mean growing
infla- tionary pressures and growing dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>This applies to managers as well as to blue-collar workers. There is
little doubt that managerial carrots have grown into seven-course
Victorian meals, e.g., from small bo- nuses to massive stock option
plans. (This also raises serious problems of social responsi- bility,
which will be discussed in Chapter 28.) With respect to managerial
incentives, we are moving from more to much more. At the same time there
is growing evidence that inequalities in managerial incentives—real or
fancied—are more demotivating than the rewards themselves satisfy and
motivate.</p>
<p>The limitations of the effectiveness of carrot and stick apply with
particular force to two groups in the work force: the new breed of
manual workers and knowledge workers.</p>
<p>In managing manual workers, the manager in the developed country more
and more has to deal with men (and to a lesser extent with women) who
(as said in Chapter 15) start out as “losers,” feel rejected, feel
already defeated. These are people who have been driven all their lives
and yet have not achieved. But losers always learn one thing, and that
to perfection: resistance against being driven. They may not be able to
achieve, but they know how to sabotage.</p>
<p>The best text on this is not a learned study by a professor of
psychology but a best- selling humorous novel of the twenties, The Good
Soldier Schweik, by the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek. Schweik, one of the
world’s defeated, the archetypal dropout, single- handedly stultifies
and frustrates the whole Theory X apparatus of the mighty army of a
great power, pre-World War I Austria-Hungary. He does nothing overt. He
knows how to sabotage.</p>
<p>To drive the new breed of manual workers therefore will not be
successful. Hunger and fear no longer dominate them as they did their
grandparents. But their very failure has made them impervious to
pressures.</p>
<p>The knowledge worker will not produce if managed under Theory X.
Knowledge has to be self-directed and has to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Fear is altogether incompatible with the production of knowledge. It
may produce ef- forts and anxieties. It will not produce results. And
fear inhibits learning, a basic finding of modern behavioral psychology.
Rewards and reaffirmation will produce learning. In anything that has to
do with knowledge, fear will produce only resistance.</p>
<p>Theory X assumes a “master.” But in a society of organizations there
are no masters.</p>
<p>The manager is not a master. He is a superior, but he is a fellow
employee. For the first time in history there is a society which lacks
masters.</p>
<p>This is not the case in communist societies, which have assiduously
worked at replac- ing the old masters with new masters. The role of the
communist party in a communist state is to be a master. It is in crisis
precisely because even under communism a modern society becomes a
society of organizations and as such requires managers and cannot tol-
erate masters.</p>
<p>The manager, not being a master, lacks both the master’s authority
and the master’s credibility. The master’s power is independent of the
support he receives, either from his servants or from society around
him. One can kill a master, but one cannot oust him. But, as the sixties
amply showed, e.g., in the case of countless university presidents, even
the chief executive of an organization can be ousted, precisely because
he is a fallow em- ployee. The authority he exercises is not his own,
and cannot survive a challenge.</p>
<p>In terms of the ancient law of master and servant, the chief
executive officer of the largest corporation is a fellow servant. Others
may be subordinate in rank, but they are equal in law. They are not the
chief executive’s servants, they are his fellow workers.</p>
<p>This is much more than a semantic shift. It means that neither stick
nor carrot will ac- tually work if used by a manager, no matter how well
they used to work for the master of old.</p>
<p>Can We Replace Carrot and Stick?</p>
<p>Can we replace the carrot of monetary rewards and the stick of fear
with a new carrot and a new stick appropriate to the new managerial
reality?</p>
<p>After all, carrot and stick have worked for an amazingly long time.
One does not lightly toss out the tradition of the ages. Over the
millennia during which working and worker have been managed, society has
changed fundamentally. Yet managing worker and working has shown amazing
continuity. The same Theory X principles that were ap- plied to managing
worker and working in the building of the great pyramids of Egypt still
inform the organization of worker and working in the modern
mass-production plant.</p>
<p>Henry Ford’s best-known epigram is “History is bunk.” Ford was a bold
innovator in organizing work, in marketing, and in economics, but when
it came to managing worker and working he was completely the prisoner of
history and a traditionalist.</p>
<p>The traditional way of managing working and worker cuts across all of
man’s cultures.</p>
<p>There is no great difference between West and East, between pagan
antiquity and Chris- tendom, between China and the Occident, between
Inca Peru and Mogul India. Nor does the organization of society itself
seem to make much difference.</p>
<p>In that respect the Marxist analysis has altogether failed. The
factory and office in So- viet Russia or in the Soviet satellites in
Europe are organized no differently from the wicked capitalist West.
Nor, all evidence clearly shows, is the worker any more achieving or the
bosses any less the bosses. The same applies to the far more imaginative
Yugoslav experiment of direct worker control of individual businesses,
to direct worker ownership, to ownership by a cooperative, and so
on.</p>
<p>We therefore know Theory X management. What to put in its place is—or
so it seems—largely guesswork and speculation. Surely it would be the
better part of wisdom to try to maintain the essence of Theory X by
substituting “modern” drives for the old driving force of fear and
money. What we need, one might argue, is to find the organiza- tional
equivalent to the gasoline engine which replaced the horse—but to keep
the wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p>Not only managers ask this question. The labor unions are perhaps
even more eager to keep the Theory X structure. The unions, after all,
have a stake in the coercive relation- ship between master and servant
of Theory X; if there were no master, what, indeed, would the union’s
role be? Also labor leaders derive their pride and sense of mission from
opposition to Theory X, know how to behave under it, and have its
rhetoric down pat.</p>
<p>When the younger workers in some General Motors plants began to talk
about human- izing the assembly line, the greatest resistance did not
come from General Motors man- agement. It came from the United
Automobile Workers’ leadership, which insisted on talking about money,
pensions, hours off, coffee breaks—and so on. The UAW Ieaders, in other
words, insisted, against their own members, on maintaining and even
strengthen- ing a Theory X management on the part of the company.</p>
<p>To look for a new set of drives to take the place of the old carrot
and stick seems not only rational but tempting. Such replacement drives
are indeed being offered managers in the form of a new “enlightened
psychological despotism.”</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the recent writers on industrial psychology
profess allegiance to Theory Y. They use terms like “self-fulfillment,”
“creativity,” and “the whole man.” But what they talk and write about is
control through psychological manipulation. They are led to this by
their basic assumptions, which are precisely the Theory X assumptions:
man is weak, sick, and incapable of looking after himself. He is full of
fears, anxieties, neuro-</p>
<p>ses, inhibitions. Essentially he does not want to achieve but wants
to fail. He therefore wants to be controlled. Indeed, for his own good
he needs to be controlled—not by fear of hunger and incentive of
material rewards but through his fear of psychological alienation and
the incentive of “psychological security.”</p>
<p>I know that I am oversimplifying. I know that I am lumping under one
heading half a dozen different approaches. But they all share the same
basic assumptions, those of The- ory X, and they all lead to the same
conclusions. Psychological control by the superior, the manager, is
possible; and psychological control by the superior, the manager, is
“un- selfish” and in the worker’s own interest. By becoming his workers’
psychological ser- vant, however, the manager retains control as their
“boss.”</p>
<p>This is “enlightened” whereas the old carrot-and-stick approach may
be condemned as crassly coercive (and is condemned as such by the
psychologists). But it is despotism nonetheless. Under this new
psychological dispensation, persuasion replaces command. Those
unconvinced by persuasion would presumably be deemed sick, immature, or
in need of psychotherapy to become adjusted. Psychological manipulation
replaces the car- rot of financial rewards; and empathy, i.e., the
exploitation of individual fears, anxieties, and personality needs,
replaces the old fear of being punished or of losing one’s job.</p>
<p>This is strikingly similar to the eighteenth-century philosopher’s
theory of the enlight- ened despot. As in modern organization today,
affluence and education—in this case, the affluence and rising education
of the middle class—threatened to deprive the sovereign of his carrot
and stick. The philosopher’s enlightened despot was going to maintain
absolut- ism by replacing the old means with persuasion, reason, and
enlightenment—all in the interest of the subjects, of course.</p>
<p>Psychological despotism, whether enlightened or not, is gross misuse
of psychology.</p>
<p>The main purpose of psychology is to acquire insight into, and
mastery of, oneself. Not for nothing were what we now call the
behavioral sciences originally called the moral sciences and “Know
thyself” their main precept. To use psychology to control, dominate, and
manipulate others is self-destructive abuse of knowledge. It is also a
particularly re- pugnant form of tyranny. The master of old was content
to control the slave’s body.</p>
<p>We are concerned, however, here neither with the proper use of
psychology nor with morality. But can the Theory X structure be
maintained through psychological despotism? Can psychological despotism
work?</p>
<p>Psychological despotism should have tremendous attraction for
managers. It promises them that they can continue to behave as they have
always done. All they need is to ac- quire a new vocabulary. It flatters
them. And yet managers, while avidly reading the psy- chology books and
attending psychological workshops, are shying away from trying the new
psychological Theory X.</p>
<p>Managers show sound instincts in being leery. Psychological despotism
cannot work any more than enlightened despotism worked in the political
sphere two hundred years ago—and for the same reason. It requires
universal genius on the part of the ruler. The manager, if one listens
to the psychologists, will have to have insight into all kinds of
people. He will have to be in command of all kinds of psychological
techniques. He will have to have empathy for all his subordinates. He
will have to understand an infinity of individual personality
structures, individual psychological needs, and individual psycho-
logical problems. He will, in other words, have to be omniscient. But
most managers find it hard enough to know all they need to know about
their own immediate area of exper- tise, be it heat-treating or cost
accounting or scheduling.</p>
<p>And to expect any large number of people to have “charisma”—whatever
the term might mean—is an absurdity. This particular quality is reserved
for the very few.</p>
<p>Managers should indeed know more about human beings. They should at
least know that human beings behave like human beings, and what that
implies. Above all, like most of us, managers need to know much more
about themselves than they do; for most man- agers are action-focused
rather than introspective. And yet, any manager, no matter how many
psychology seminars he has attended, who attempts to put psychological
despotism</p>
<p>into practice will very rapidly become its first casualty. He will
immediately blunder. He will impair performance.</p>
<p>The work relationship has to be based on mutual respect.
Psychological despotism is basically contemptuous—far more contemptuous
than the traditional Theory X. It does not assume that people are lazy
and resist work, but it assumes that the manager is healthy while
everybody else is sick. It assumes that the manager is strong while
everybody else is weak. It assumes that the manager knows while
everybody else is ignorant. It assumes that the manager is right,
whereas everybody else is stupid. These are the assumptions of fool- ish
arrogance.</p>
<p>Above all, the manager-psychologist will undermine his own authority.
There is, to be sure, need for psychological insight, help, counsel.
There is need for the healer of souls and the comforter of the
afflicted. But the relationship of healer and patient and that of
superior to subordinate are different relationships and mutually
exclusive. They both have their own integrity. The integrity of the
healer is his subordination to the patient’s welfare. The integrity of
the manager is his subordination to the requirements of the common task.
In both relationships there is need for authority; but each has a
different ground of author- ity. A manager who pretends that the
personal needs of the subordinate for, e.g., affection, rather than the
objective needs of the task, determine what should be done, would not
only be a poor manager; no one would—or should—believe him. All he does
is to destroy the integrity of the relationship and with it the respect
for his person and his function.</p>
<p>Enlightened psychological despotism with its call for an unlimited
supply of universal geniuses for managerial positions and its confusion
between the healer’s and the man- ager’s authority and role is not going
to deliver what it promises: to maintain Theory X while pretending to
replace it.</p>
<p>But what then can work?</p>
<p>It is not simply McGregor’s Theory Y. The manager must indeed assume
with Theory Y that there are at least a substantial number of people in
the work force who want to achieve. Otherwise there is little hope.
Fortunately the evidence strongly supports this assumption. The manager
must further accept it as his job to make worker and working achieving.
He must be willing, as a result, to accept high demands on himself, his
serious- ness, and his competence. But the manager cannot assume, as
Theory Y does, that people will work to achieve if only they are given
the opportunity to do so. More is needed— much more—to make even the
strong and healthy accept the burden of responsibility. The structure we
need cannot depend on driving the worker; neither carrot nor stick is
de- pendable any more. But the structure must also provide substitutes
to the weak—and not only to them—for Theory X’s security of command and
of being looked after.</p>
<p>What would such an organization look like? And how would it work?
Fortunately we do not have to speculate. Some such organizations—though
certainly not examples of Theory Y—exist and can be examined.</p>
