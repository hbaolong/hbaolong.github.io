<h4 id="top-management-structure">51 Top-Management Structure</h4>
<p>Top-Management Team Structures—The “General Director” —The Group
Execu- tive—How Many Top Managements? —Specifications for Top-Management
Teams— Teamwork in Top Management—The “Reserved” Decisions—How to
Nourish the Brain—The “Secretariat” and Its Weaknesses— “Business
Research” — “The Bot- tleneck Is at the Head of the Bottle”</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>OP-MANAGEMENT WORK IS WORK FOR A TEAM rather than for one man. It is
quite unlikely that any one man will, in his own person, unite the
divergent tem- peraments which the job requires. Moreover, it will be
found, when the top- management tasks are analyzed, that there is more
work to be done than any one man can do. The tasks require, except in
the smallest business, at least one full-time man who does nothing else,
and then one or two, at least for a major part of their time, who take
on part of the task in which they are then the “leaders” and have
primary responsibility.</p>
<p>There are additional reasons why the one-man top management tends to
malfunction.</p>
<p>Every top-management succession in a one-man top management is a
“crisis” and a des- perate gamble. No one in the business except the
former top man has really done the top- management work and proven
himself in it.</p>
<p>To recognize the team nature of the top-management job is
particularly important in the small business. The one-man top management
is a major reason why businesses fail to grow. (On this, see Chapter
60.)</p>
<p>But the job itself is a team job to begin with. Whatever the titles
on the organization chart, the top-management job in a healthy company
is almost always actually done by a team.</p>
<p>Henry Ford, as has been said (in Chapter 29, “Why Managers?”), did
not believe in managers at all, and this, in large part, explains the
decline and near-collapse of his com- pany in his latter years. But, as
recent studies have brought out (especially Allan Nevins’s Ford, the
Times, the Man, the Company [Scribner,1954]), the Ford Motor Company at
the time of its growth and success, that is, from 1907 through the early
twenties, was in effect run by a true top-management team with James
Couzens co-equal to Ford and the final authority in a great many and
clearly assigned top-management areas. After Couzens left—he later
entered politics and became a greatly beloved liberal senator from
Michigan in the New Deal days—Henry Ford became a one-man top
management. It is hardly coin- cidence that from that day on the Ford
Motor Company began to go downhill.</p>
<p>On paper the top management of a company may look like a one-man job.
But if the company is healthy, a closer look is likely to disclose that
other people carry clearly as- signed top-management responsibilities as
well. The controller often takes on a part of the top-management
function—usually the analytical, the planning, the objective-setting as-
pects. Or it is the manufacturing man who takes on responsibility for
the human organiza- tion in addition to his functional duties.</p>
<p>This works reasonably well as long as the business is simple and
small. The larger and more complex business needs a clearly structured
top-management team.</p>
<p>This team may be organized, as has become the fashion, as a
“president’s office,” in which a number of people serve as equals, each
with his own assigned area of primary responsibility within which he has
final say. This is the structure Siemens designed; and for the large and
complex business it is probably the best one—though it is not an easy
one.</p>
<p>It is essentially the structure which the organization builders of
the twenties at Du Pont, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Royal Dutch/Shell,
and Unilever evolved—probably without ever having heard of Georg
Siemens.</p>
<p>Put it is also possible to have one man only, a president or a
chairman, who carries the title of chief executive officer. He has then
affiliated with him a small number of col- leagues, perhaps with some
such title as executive vice-president, each of whom has clearly
assigned authority and responsibility for a part of the top-management
task, and no other duties.</p>
<p>Or, to cite another fairly common structure, there may be a three- or
four-man top, with each man carrying clearly assigned top-management
responsibilities even though one man is definitely number one. This is
the structure which General Motors has had for fifty years—a chairman, a
vice-chairman, a chairman of the executive committee, a president. What
, assignments each of these four men carries is then worked out to fit
their person- alities. But the four positions are permanent.</p>
<p>And there are many variations on these themes.</p>
<p>But just because the organization chart shows a top-management team
does not neces- sarily mean that there is one. There is need for
safeguards against the danger of dictator- ships disguised as a
top-management team.</p>
<p>The best proof is what happened to Siemens’s own concept in Germany.
The German Company Law, enacted in 1887, largely as a result of
Siemens’s work, provided for a Vorstand, i.e., a top-management team.
But many German companies, especially in the period between 1900 and
World War II, were run by an autocratic Generaldirektor be- cause the
other members of the Vorstand—contrary to Siemens’s rule—had full-time
functional assignments. Few of these companies were well-managed or did
well.</p>
<p>The only effective guard is to have every top-management task clearly
lodged in a man with direct and primary responsibility for it. And in
the larger company no one who carries any top-management responsibility
should carry any responsibility that is not part</p>
<p>of the top-management job.</p>
<p>The same lesson is being taught by a more recent and perhaps less
serious top- management malfunction, the operating “group executive” who
is supposed to “give part of his time” to the top-management job.</p>
<p>The group executive in charge of a number of divisions who has become
popular in large companies is supposed to be the operating head of his
group but give some of his time—a common figure is 30 percent—to the
company’s top-management tasks. This sounds plausible—but it has not
worked out. The group executive is far too busy to have clearly assigned
responsibility for a top-management task. As a result, he makes no top-
management contribution.</p>
<p>One company that has recognized this is IBM. IBM has group executive
for major ar- eas (research, engineering, and manufacturing; domestic
marketing and service; interna- tional; and non-computer businesses).
But it also has a four-man management committee composed of the
chairman, the president, and two senior officers, none of whom operates.
Each of the four has clearly assigned top-management responsibilities
and no other func- tion.</p>
<p>And yet the group executive is a member of a top-management team.
Only it is not the top-management team of the parent company. It is the
top-management team of the divi- sions in his group, each a major and
important autonomous business in its own right, and each therefore
requiring its own top management.</p>
<p>This was largely the way GE managers worked their way out of the
mistaken designa- tion of the general manager of a product business as
an operating manager (see Chapter 46). The group executive became, in
effect, the leader of a top-management team for his group, and a member
of the top management of every one of the product businesses. But he
never functioned as a member of GE’s top management—which is what the
job had been designed to be.</p>
<p>How Many Top Managements?</p>
<p>In the large and complex business—and even more in the multinational
company—there are always several top managements rather than one. The
company as a whole is a busi- ness. But the autonomous division of a
federally organized company is also a business. It requires its own top
management, has its own top-management tasks, and its own key
activities.</p>
<p>Again Georg Siemens realized this a century ago. His Vorstand in
Berlin was one top- management group. Another one was composed of
members of the Berlin Vorstand and the key men in the major branches.
But every one of the major branches outside of Berlin had also a small
top-management team of its own. The Berlin team was, so to speak, the
first team. But every one of the provincial teams had responsibilities
in which it was “first,” and with respect to which Berlin was “support”
or “understudy.”</p>
<p>Indeed, it is one of the characteristics of complexity in a business
that it requires more than one top-management team—with clear
recognition of which of the teams has primary responsibility in what
area and with what limitations.</p>
<p>We can now summarize the basic specifications for a functioning
top-management structure:</p>
<p>• The starting point is an analysis of the top management tasks.</p>
<p>• Each top management task must be clearly assigned to someone who
has di- rect and full responsibility for it.</p>
<p>• This requires a top management team, with responsibilities assigned
to fit the personalities, qualifications, and temperaments of the
members.</p>
<p>• Whoever has assigned responsibility for a top-management activity
is “top management” whatever his title.</p>
<p>• Except in the small and simple business no one who has
top-management re- sponsibilities, does any but top-management work.</p>
<p>• The complex business requires more than one top management team,
each structured according to these rules.</p>
<p>Teamwork in Top Management</p>
<p>A top-management team has to satisfy stringent requirements to be
effective. It is not a simple structure. It will not work just because
its members like each other. Indeed whether the members like or dislike
each other is beside the point. A top-management team must function no
matter what the personal relationships between its members are.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, whoever has primary responsibility in a given area has, in
effect, the final say.</li>
</ol>
<p>To have a functioning top management requires further that no
subordinate can appeal a decision by one member of the team to another.
Every member speaks with the full au- thority of top management.</p>
<p>To deviate from this and to allow an appeal from one member of the
top-management group to another invites politicking. It undermines the
authority of the entire top- management group.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>No member will make a decision with regard to a matter for which he
does not have primary responsibility. Should such a matter be brought to
him, he will refer it to the col- league whose primary responsibility it
is. Indeed it is a wise precaution for members of</li>
</ol>
<p>the top-management team not even to have an opinion on matters that
are not within their own areas of primary responsibility.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., was the undoubted head of General Motors with
moral authority within GM’s general management such as has rarely been
equaled. Yet Sloan said again and again, “I think you’d better take this
matter up with Mr. Brown or with Mr. Bradley or with Mr. Wilson”—at that
time (the late forties) his colleagues in the top-management group. “I
would be interested to hear what they decide; perhaps you’ll let me
know.” Af- ter the caller had left—and the callers were usually high GM
executives—Sloan would sometimes take the telephone and quietly call up,
Mr. Brown and ask him to come to the office to discuss the matter. Sloan
usually had very definite opinions and fought for them. But he had
disciplined himself never to express an opinion outside the top group,
unless he himself had direct responsibility in the matter under
discussion.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Members of the top-management team need not like each other. They
need not even respect each other. But they must not agitate against each
other. In public, that is, outside top management’s conference room,
they have no opinions on each other, do not criticize each other, do not
belittle each other. Preferably they do not even praise each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>To enforce this rule is the team captain’s job—and he better be
strict about it. Even the most “temperamental” (i.e., undisciplined) man
must not be allowed, as a member of top management, to express in public
criticism, dislike, or contempt for any other mem- ber.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>A top-management team is not a committee. It is a team. A team needs
a captain.</li>
</ol>
<p>The team captain is not the “boss”; he is a leader.</p>
<p>There are several ways of determining the role of the team captain.
The president of Du Pont traditionally has just one vote and depends
primarily on his moral authority. At Standard Oil of New Jersey the
chairman traditionally did not even have this much legal power; for many
years votes, whenever taken, required unanimity. Alfred P. Sloan at
General Motors had the legal power to overrule his colleagues on the
management team. But he almost never used it. He made a decision after
he had made sure that he knew where every colleague on the
top-management team stood and that each, in turn, had fully grasped
where the chairman and chief executive officer stood. In other
top-management teams the senior man has the power of final decision, or
at least a veto power. In yet oth- ers, it is the team captain’s main
role to designate the member of the team who, in a par- ticular
situation, makes the final decision, which is then accepted by
everybody.</p>
<p>But there has to be a team captain. And in times of extreme crisis he
has to be willing and able—and has to have the legal power—to take over.
In times of common peril there has to be unity of command.</p>
<p>Key personnel decisions are made neither by acclamation nor by taking
a vote. They do require careful thought, careful discussion, and the
pooling of the experience of differ- ent people within the organization.
They are, properly, matters which top management considers as a group,
even though it will then often leave the actual decision to one of its
members.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The top-management task requires systematic and intensive work on
communica- tions among the members of the top-management team. It
requires this precisely because there are so many different
top-management tasks, each, however, with decisive impact</li>
</ol>
<p>on the welfare of the entire organization. It requires it, above all,
because each member of top management should be able to operate with the
maximum of autonomy within his own sphere—and that can be granted him
only if he makes every effort to keep his colleagues fully informed.</p>
<p>Philip Young and Gerald Swope, who largely built the General Electric
Company in the twenties and thirties, formed a singularly effective
top-management team. Swope, headquartered in Schenectady, was concerned
with engineering; production, and selling; Young was in charge of
finance, government relations, international affairs, and public
responsibilities. The two men, legend has it, disliked each other and
rarely talked to each other. But they took great care to keep each other
informed of all their actions and activi- ties—everything that went on
in one office was known at the other office within a day or two. There
are some old-timers in GE who maintain that this impersonal but highly
organ- ized system worked better than the constant meetings and the
close personal association of the top-management teams that have
succeeded Swope and Young since World War II.</p>
<p>Respect for the task, and clear understanding of what it is and who
has responsibility, are, in other words, the foundations for an
effective top management.</p>
<p>How to Nourish the Brain</p>
<p>Siemens’s most distinct innovation in organizing the top management
was the “executive secretariat.” It may have been his most important
contribution.</p>
<p>The human brain absorbs almost half of all the oxygen and all the
energy in the body.</p>
<p>The five sense organs work directly for the brain and supply it with
stimuli. Altogether, the human body, it may be said, is organized first,
and above all, to nourish the brain, to supply it with stimulus and
energy.</p>
<p>One cannot expect a social body to equal the performance of a
biological organism, let alone of that marvel of flexibility, precision,
and economy, the functioning human body. But still one might wonder
whether the “brain” of the business enterprise, its top management, does
not need its own organ of nourishment, of stimulation, and of informa-
tion.</p>
<p>In most businesses all the world over there is a surfeit of data.
There are constant re- ports, there are studies, there are researches of
all kinds, there are presentations and meet- ings. Most of them are
intended for operating management and for its use. The staff ser- vices
within the typical business are set up to support the operating people.
Indeed, it is the theory of staffs that their job is to support,
service, and educate operating managers. Who then nourishes the brain,
who then serves top management?</p>
<p>What top managements get, by and large, are the same data, the same
information, the same stimuli that operating managers get. Yet there are
specific top-management tasks and specific top-management needs. Top
management’s needs are different in kind from those of the operating
people, if only because it is largely concerned with the future rather
than solely with the present, and with the whole business rather than
with any of its parts.</p>
<p>The questions “What is our business?” and “What should it be?” imply
a very differ- ent look at the present enterprise from the look on which
present objectives, present struc- ture, present assignments, and
therefore present information are being based. Genuine innovations never
fit existing organization structures, but fall, outside and beyond any
existing organization scope. And tomorrow’s key people should always be
picked for reasons different from those for which one yesterday picked
the key people of today.</p>
<p>A simple but telling example is that of a major manufacturer of
electrical apparatus.</p>
<p>Traditionally the company had been in the steam-turbine business, in
which it long held a leadership position. During World War II, it went
into jet engines, which at first were seen only as engines to power
aircraft, even though a jet engine, that is, a gas turbine, is just as
much a producer of electrical energy as a steam turbine. Then the
company went into the atomic energy field. Because each of these three
means of producing electricity had a different technological origin, and
at first also a different market, each was organ- ized as a separate
business. However, for the customer, the power company, the three
are</p>
<p>simply alternative ways of producing electricity. Any two of them
together will give an electric utility a complete power supply. But none
of the existing service staffs of the manufacturing company saw this, or
could have seen this. Their job, after all, was to ser- vice the
operating managements of each of the three divisions—the steam turbine,
the jet engine, and the atomic power divisions. The people who ran these
divisions saw their own product as the prime generator and expected to
get for it the lion’s share of the growth in electric-power generation.
A task force organized specifically to supply top management with new
thinking about tomorrow’s markets finally pointed out that these three
divisions were in the same business. By that time the company’s standing
in one of its major mar- kets had already been seriously eroded by the
failure to supply information and thinking for the top-management
job.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens’s specific solution, the German “executive
secretariat,” will not suit every company and every cultural tradition.
Yet every company, beyond the very small and simple one, needs a
specific organ to supply top management with thinking, with stimulation,
with questions, with knowledge and, above all, with information. Top
man- agement work is a specific kind of work. Any kind of work requires
the right tools; and the tools for the top-management job are
information, stimulation, analysis, and questions.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens’s “secretariat” was set up as a distinct career. Great
pains were taken to find the ablest, most brilliant, most intelligent
young men in the bank’s employ, or to recruit such men from the
universities or from government service. Then they stayed, as a rule, in
the secretariat. Very few of them were ever moved out into operating
work in the bank. A few made it into top management—but their number was
small too. As a result, the secretariat tended to become insulated.</p>
<p>This is still a weakness of the secretariat as it is being used in
Germany. But it is an unnecessary weakness and one that can be remedied.
The rule should be that no one gets into such a secretariat, that is,
into a group the purpose of which is to support top man- agement with
information, stimulation, and questions, unless he first has shown real
per- formance in actual work. A secretariat assignment should be
considered as a major train- ing position for men who, at a fairly early
age, have shown high capacity to perform.</p>
<p>No one should stay in the secretariat for more than a few years—five
to eight might be the upper limit. Then he should be moved back into a
position where he has to perform, that is, into an operating position
with direct and measurable responsibility for contribu- tion and
results.</p>
<p>The secretariat should always be kept small. It should be kept on key
activities rather than attempt to cover everything. It should be
expected to focus on the major needs of the business. Indeed its
first—and perhaps its most important—assignment is to identify and to
think through the major factors that affect the performance and results
of the business, the major factors that underlie the question, “What is
our business and what should it be?” It should always ask, “What
information does top management need to make its deci- sions?”</p>
<p>In countries in which “secretariat” has the connotation of low-level
paper-pushing clerks (as it has in English-speaking countries) the
function might well be called “business research.” But the function
should be clearly defined as an organ to serve top manage- ment. Its job
is to provide top management with the information it needs to work as an
effective team, and with the information and knowledge to prepare itself
today for the major decisions it has to face tomorrow.</p>
<p>No business can do better than its top management will permit; the
“bottleneck” is, af- ter all, always “at the head of the bottle.” Of all
the jobs in the enterprise the top- management job is the most difficult
one to organize. But it is also the most important one to organize.</p>
