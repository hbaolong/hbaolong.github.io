<h4 id="developing-management-and-managers">33 Developing Management and
Managers</h4>
<p>The Management Development Boom—Why Management Development and
Manager Development are Needed—What They Are Not—The Two Dimensions of
Develop- ment—Designing the Jobs and Skills for
Tomorrow—Self-Development of the Indi- vidual—The Role of Company and
Superior in Self-Development</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE YEARS SINCE 1950 have seen a within the wider management boom.
In</p>
<p>veritable management development boom the mid-forties, when I first
became inter-</p>
<p>ested in this subject, I could find only two companies that had given
serious thought to the development of managers: Sears, Roebuck in
America and Marks andandandand Spencer in England. At that time there
were only three university programs in America for the con- tinuing
advanced education of managers: the Sloan Program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; the programs at New York University. Graduate
Business School for the continuing education of managers and young
professionals in banking and finance; and then, brand-new, the Advanced
Management Program at the Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>Ten years later, in the mid-fifties, when an attempt was made to
catalog the companies with specific management development programs, the
number already ran to some three thousand. And a great many universities
in the United States had gone into all kinds of advanced management
programs.</p>
<p>Today, it is no longer possible to count the number of companies
that, one way or an- other, work on the development of management and
managers. The large company that does not make specific provision for
such work and does not have a management devel- opment staff of its own
is the exception. And so is the business school at university level
without some form of management development program. In addition, an
untold number of outside organizations: trade associations, consulting
firms, and so on, have gone into the management development
business.</p>
<p>This interest is by no means confined to the United States. It has
spread to Europe and to Japan. Within the last few years it has broken
through the Iron Curtain. Some of the Soviet satellites, such as
Czechoslovakia, have started advanced management work and in 1910, the
Soviet Union itself set up two major advanced management schools for
indus- trial executives.</p>
<p>Why Management Development?</p>
<p>Basic business decisions require an increasingly long time span for
their fruition. Since no one can foresee the future, management cannot
make rational and responsible decisions unless it selects, develops, and
tests the men who will have to follow them through and bail them out—the
managers of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Management is becoming increasingly complex. In addition to a rapid
changing tech- nology, management today has to be able to handle many
new “relations” problems— relations with the government, relations with
suppliers and customers, relations with em-</p>
<p>ployees and with labor unions. On top of this are demands for
entrepreneurship and inno- vation; for managing knowledge and the
knowledge worker; for multinational and, often, multicultural
management; or for managerial responsibility for the environment and for
the quality of life. All these increase the standards against which
managers are measured.</p>
<p>The numerical demand for executives is steadily growing. A developed
society in- creasingly replaces manual skill with theoretical knowledge
and the ability to organize and to lead—in short with managerial
ability. In fact, ours is the first society in which the basic question
is not “How many educated people can society spare from the task of pro-
viding subsistence?” It is “How many uneducated people can we afford to
support?”</p>
<p>But management development is also necessary to discharge an
elementary responsi- bility which a business enterprise owes to society;
if business does not discharge this ob- ligation by its own actions,
society will impose it. For continuity, especially of the big business
enterprise, is vital. Our society will not tolerate—and cannot afford—to
see such wealth-producing resources jeopardized through lack of
competent successors to today’s management.</p>
<p>The member of a modern society looks to his work for more than a
livelihood. He looks to it also for satisfactions that go beyond the
economic, that is, for pride, self- respect, and achievement. Management
development is only another name for making work and industry more than
a way of making a living. By offering challenges and oppor- tunities for
the individual development of each manager to his fullest ability, the
enter- prise discharges, in part, the obligation to make a job in
industry a “good life.” And if we know one thing today, it is that
managers are made and not born. There has to be system- atic work on the
supply, the development, and the skills of tomorrow’s management. It
cannot be left to luck or chance.</p>
<p>Why Manager Development?</p>
<p>The individual manager needs development just as much as company and
society do. He should, first, keep himself alert and mentally alive. He
needs to keep himself challenged. He must acquire today the skills which
will make him effective tomorrow. He also needs an opportunity to
reflect on the meaning of his own experience and—above all—he needs</p>
<p>an opportunity to reflect on himself and to learn to make his
strengths count.</p>
<p>And then he needs development as a person even more than he needs
development as a manager.</p>
<p>One of the strengths, but also one of the weaknesses of a knowledge
worker, i.e., man- ager and career professional, is to expect
satisfaction and stimulation from one’s work. In that respect, the
knowledge worker is badly spoiled during his early formative years. The
manual worker, whether skilled or unskilled, does not expect the work to
challenge him, to stimulate him, to develop him. He expects a living
from the work. The knowledge worker expects a life out of it.</p>
<p>Thus, the knowledge worker, and especially the highly accomplished
knowledge worker is likely to find himself in a spiritual crisis in his
early or mid-forties. By that time the great majority will have reached,
inevitably, their terminal positions. Perhaps they will also have
reached what, within their business, is their terminal function—whether
this be market research, personnel training, or metallurgy. Suddenly
their work will not satisfy them any more. After fifteen or twenty years
in market research in their industry, they know all there is to know
about it. What, in his early thirties, when the job was new, was
tremendous excitement to a man, is boring and humdrum fifteen years
later.</p>
<p>A manager has to be able, in other words, to develop a life of his
own, and outside the organization, before he is in his mid-forties.</p>
<p>He needs this for himself, but he needs it also for the organization.
For the manager who, at age forty-five, “retires on the job” because he
has no more interest in life, is not likely to make any further
contribution to the business. He owes it to himself and to the
business—to develop himself as a person, so that he can build his own
life and not depend</p>
<p>entirely upon the organization, additional promotion, or on new and
different work. He needs to focus on his own personality, on his own
strengths, and on his own interests.</p>
<p>We will (as I have discussed in another book)* have to learn to
develop second ca- reers for accomplished professional and managerial
people when they reach their late forties or so. We will have to learn
to make it possible for the good accountant in a bank to become
comptroller of a hospital or business manager of a college. We will have
to make it possible for people who have worked for twenty years or so in
a business and in a function that is, for the great majority of
managers—to find new challenge, new opportu- nity, and new contributions
in doing something different, or at least in being effective in
different surroundings and in a different institution.</p>
<p>No manager today can be considered as discharging his duty toward
himself toward his family, and also toward his employer, the enterprise,
unless he makes himself ready for such new opportunity.</p>
<p>There are, thus, good reasons why the development of management and
managers has become a central concern.</p>
<p>But what do we really mean by the terms “management development” and
“manager development”? Any boom such as we have experienced these last
two decades is suspect. Undoubtedly there have been as many fads and
follies as there have been sound ventures. There must be—and there
are—quite a few charlatans, and many more who preach man- agement
development only because it is the fashionable thing to do.</p>
<p>What Management Development Is Not</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is best to start by spelling out what
management and manager devel- opment are not.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is not taking courses. Courses are a tool of management
development. But they are not management development.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any course—whether it is a three-day seminar in a special skill or a
two-year “ad- vanced” program three evenings a week—has to fit the
development needs of a manage- ment group or the development needs of an
individual manager. But the job, the superior, and the development
planning of both company and individual are far more important
developmental tools than any course or courses.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of the most popular courses are of questionable value. I
have come to doubt, e.g., the wisdom of courses which take a manager
away from his job for long peri- ods of time. The most effective
courses, in my experience, are those which are done on the manager’s own
time and after hours, e.g., the evening programs offered by a good many
metropolitan universities in the United States, or, for instance, by the
Polytechnic Colleges in Great Britain. And the most effective full-time
courses alternate periods at school with periods of work; a man spends a
week or two off the job in an intensive learn- ing experience, after
which he gets back to his job and applies what he has learned.</p>
<p>Managers are action-focused; they are not philosophers and should not
be. Unless they can put into action right away the things they have
learned, the things they have consid- ered and reconsidered, the course
will not “take.” It will remain “information” and never become
“knowledge.” Pedagogically it is not sound not to have the reaffirmation
of action to strengthen learning, that is, not to be able to put into
practice on Monday what one has learned the preceding Friday. Finally,
the manager who has been away 13 weeks on an advanced course may well
find himself a “displaced person” and homeless when he gets back to his
organization after such a long absence.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have learned to be wary of courses for top management.
Not that top- management people do not have a good deal to learn; they
do. But most of the courses I have seen (including some famous ones) are
not courses for top-management people but for youngsters without
experience and without responsibility. Only the fee is “top-
management.” Such a course is a waste of top-management time.</p>
<p>*The Age of Discontinuity.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Manager development and management development are not promotion
planning, replacement planning, or finding potential. These are useless
exercises. They may even do harm.</li>
</ol>
<p>The worst thing a company can do is to try to develop the “comers”
and leave out the others. Ten years hence, 80 percent of the work will
have to be done by those left out. If they have not developed themselves
to the point where they can understand, accept, and put into action the
vision of the few “comers,” nothing will happen. The eight men out of
every ten who were not included in the program will, understandably,
feel slighted. They may end up by becoming less effective, less
productive, less willing to do new things than they were before.</p>
<p>The attempt to find “potential” is altogether futile. It is less
likely to succeed than ran- dom selection, e.g., taking every fifth man.
Potential is elusive. By itself it is worthless. Performance counts. And
the correlation between promise and performance is not a par- ticularly
high one. Five out of every ten “high potential” young men turn out to
be nothing but good talkers by the time they reach forty. Conversely,
five out of every ten young men who do not look “brilliant” and do not
talk a good game will have proven their capacity to perform by the time
they are in their early forties.</p>
<p>Also, the idea that the purpose of management development is to find
“replacements”</p>
<p>negates the entire reason for the activity. We need management
development and manager development precisely because tomorrow’s jobs
and tomorrow’s organization can be as- sumed, with high probability, to
be different from today’s jobs and today’s organization. If all we had
to do were to replace yesterday’s and today’s jobs, we would not need
any such activity. We would be training people as apprentices under
their present bosses and hope that they learn what their present bosses
know and do.</p>
<p>I used to be in favor of replacement planning such as Joe Hyman
preached and prac- ticed when he tried to convert moribund English
textile companies into new, vital enter- prises through his Viyella
mergers. Hyman asked each executive of the companies ac- quired to name
the man he would like to see as his successor, should he be promoted,
become disabled, or die tomorrow. I am no longer advocating this
practice. It is taken by the organization itself as a promise that the
job of an executive, as it exists today, will be continued in
perpetuity. Second, it freezes future selection. In a few years the man
named today as the most qualified successor may have proven his
incompetence. Or another man may have come from nowhere to overtake him.
Yet once a man has been named, there is a commitment that tends to
become binding. The worst kind of replacement planning is the search for
a “crown prince.” A crown prince either has a legal right to succeed; or
else nomination is likely to destroy him. No matter how carefully
concealed, picking a crown prince is an overt act which the whole
organization very rapidly perceives. And then all the other possible
contenders unite against the crown prince and work to bring him down—and
they usually succeed.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church long ago recognized this. It will not single out
anyone as a suc- cessor to a bishop or archbishop except in rare cases
when the incumbent is obviously old or very ill. Then, however, it will
appoint an auxiliary bishop with the right to succession who
automatically takes over when the See becomes vacant. This auxiliary cum
inre suc- cessionis has a legal title and is in control—and the other
contenders have to accept that fact and work with him.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Finally, management development and manager development are not
means to “make a man over” by changing his personality. Their aim is to
make a man effective. Their aim is to enable a man to use his strengths
fully, and to make him perform the way he is, rather than the way
somebody thinks he ought to be.</li>
</ol>
<p>An employer has no business with a man’s personality. Employment is a
specific con- tract calling for specific performance, and for nothing
else. Any attempt of an employer to go beyond this is usurpation. It is
immoral as well as illegal intrusion of privacy. It is abuse of power.
An employee owes no “loyalty,” he owes no “love” and no “attitudes”— he
owes performance and nothing else.</p>
<p>We have altogether not the slightest idea how to change the
personality of adults. We do know to some extent how to make them more
effective—and this is what we should</p>
<p>The Two Dimensions of Development</p>
<p>Development is not one, but two related tasks which mutually affect
each other. One task is that of developing management. Its purpose is
the health, survival, and growth of the enterprise. The other task is
manager development. Its purpose is the health, growth, and achievement
of the individual, both in his capacity as a member of the organization
and as a person. Management development is a function and activity of
the organization—no matter how it is being discharged. Manager
development is the responsibility of the indi- vidual, though company
and superior have an important part to play.</p>
<p>Management development starts out with the question “What kind of
managers and career professionals will this business need tomorrow in
order to achieve its objectives and to perform in a different market, a
different economy, a different technology, a differ- ent society?”</p>
<p>Management development concerns itself with questions such as the age
structure of the management group or the skills that managers need to
acquire today in order to qual- ify for tomorrow. It also focuses on the
organizational structure and the design of manage- rial jobs to satisfy
the needs, expectations, and aspirations of tomorrow’s “career cus-
tomer,” that is, tomorrow’s young manager or young career professional.
For the market for jobs and careers has become a genuine mass market.
Every organization, therefore, needs to design a “career product” that
will attract and satisfy the career customer of to- morrow.</p>
<p>The career customer will increasingly be a demanding customer. Like
the customer who, in a healthy economy, always wants more and different
goods and services for his money, the career customer, in a healthy
society, always wants something better and dif- ferent from the job.
Where only a few short decades ago he expected a living, he now looks
for a career and for an opportunity to make a contribution. At the same
time, he looks increasingly for a chance to put knowledge to work.</p>
<p>Whether management development requires a separate staff depends on
the size and complexity of the business. It is certainly not an activity
that should require a great many people and run a great many programs.
But it does need power and prestige, for its object is to change the
basic planning of the company, the structure of its organization, and
the design of managerial jobs.</p>
<p>Management development is outside-focused rather than inside-focused.
It is, essen- tially, a form of lesson planning rather than a personnel
activity. At the core of the task are planning the market, designing the
product, and obsoleting existing jobs and existing organizational
structures. Management development, seen this way, is an innovator, a
disorganizer, a critic. Its function is to ask with respect to the
company’s human organiza- tion, “What is our business and what should it
be?”</p>
<p>The development of a manager focuses on the person. Its aim is to
enable a man to develop his abilities and strengths to the fullest
extent and to find individual achievement. The aim is excellence.</p>
<p>No one can motivate a man toward self-development. Motivation must
come from within. But a man’s superior and the company can do a good
deal to discourage even the most highly motivated man and to misdirect
his development efforts. The active participa- tion, the encouragement,
the guidance from both superior and company are needed for
manager-development efforts to be fully productive.</p>
<p>The starting point for any manager-development effort is a
performance appraisal fo- cused on what a man does well, what he can do
well, and what limitations to his perform- ance capacity he needs to
overcome to get the most out of his strengths. Such an ap- praisal,
however, should always be a joint effort. It requires work on the part
of the man himself; it has to be self-appraisal. But it also requires
active leadership by a man’s man- ager.</p>
<p>In appraising themselves people tend either to be too critical or not
critical enough.</p>
<p>They are likely to see their strengths in the wrong places and to
pride themselves on non- abilities rather than on abilities.</p>
<p>There is, typically, the first-class engineer who judges himself to
be a good manager because he is “analytical” and “objective.” Yet, to be
a manager requires equally empa- thy, ability to understand how others
do their work, and a keen sense of such “non- rational” factors as
personality. There is the sales manager who considers his strengths to
lie in “strategy”—in reality he is a shrewd negotiator; and what he
means by strategy is “next week’s bargain sale.” Only too frequently
there is the good analyst and adviser who does not realize that he lacks
the emotional courage to make hard and lonely decisions.</p>
<p>An appraisal should be based on the performance objectives which a
man has set for himself in cooperation with his superior. It should
start with his performance against these objectives. It should never
start out with “potential.” It should ask “What has this man done
well—not once, but consistently?” This should lead to a recognition of
the strengths of a man and of the factors which inhibit him from making
these strengths fully effective. But a self-development appraisal should
also ask, “What do I want out of life? What are my values, my
aspirations, my directions? And what do I have to do, to learn, to
change, to make myself capable of living up to my demands on myself and
my expectations of life?” This question, too, is much better asked by an
outsider, by someone who knows the man, respects him, but at the same
time can have the insight which most of us do not pos- sess about
ourselves.</p>
<p>Self-development may require learning new skills, new knowledge, and
new manners.</p>
<p>But above all, it requires new experience. The most important factors
in self- development, apart from insight into one’s own strengths, are
experience on the job and the example of the superior. Self-appraisal,
therefore, should always lead to conclusions regarding the needs and
opportunities of a man, both with respect to what he himself has to
contribute and with respect to the experiences he needs. The question
should always be asked, “What are the right job experiences for this man
so that his strengths can develop the fastest and the furthest?”</p>
<p>A superior who works on his own development sets an almost
irresistible example.</p>
<p>His example encourages people to develop their strengths and helps
them gain the experi- ences they need. The boss who discourages, who
always knows what people cannot do, and who hangs on to them, rather
than helping them get the job experiences most condu- cive to their
growth, stunts self-development.</p>
<p>Development is always self-development. For the enterprise to assume
responsibility for the development of a man is idle boast. The
responsibility rests with the individual, his abilities, his efforts. No
business enterprise is competent, let alone obligated, to substitute its
efforts for the self-development efforts of the individual. To do this
would not only be unwarranted paternalism, it would be foolish
pretension.</p>
<p>But every manager in a business has the opportunity to encourage
individual self- development or to stifle it, to direct it or to
misdirect it. He should be specifically as- signed the responsibility
for helping all men working with him to focus, direct, and apply
self-development efforts. And every company can make available to its
managers devel- opment challenges and development experiences.</p>
<p>It is no longer necessary to debate whether management development
and manager development are luxuries in which only big companies can
indulge in boom times. Most large—and many small—companies know that the
development of management and man- agers is no more of a luxury than is
a research laboratory. It is not even necessary any longer to combat the
old fear that a company may develop too many good people. Man- agements
should have learned by now that the demand for good people is increasing
faster than the capacity of even a successful development program to
supply them. (The smart ones have, of course, always known that it has
never done a company harm to be known as “the mother of presidents.” On
the contrary, the power of a company to attract good men is directly
proportionate to its reputation as a developer of successful men for
itself as well as for other companies.) The development of management
and managers has become a necessity because the modern business
enterprise has become a basic institution of our society. In any major
institution—the Church, for instance, or the Army—finding, developing
and proving out the leaders of tomorrow is an essential job to which the
best men give fully of, their time and attention.</p>
<p>It is a necessity for the spirit, the vision, and the performance of
today’s managers that they be expected to develop those who will manage
tomorrow. Just as no one learns as much about a subject as the man who
is forced to teach it, no one develops as much as the man who is trying
to help others to develop themselves. Indeed, no one can develop him-
self unless he works on the development of others. It is in and through
efforts to develop others that managers raise their demands on
themselves. The best performers in any pro- fession always look upon the
men they have trained and developed as the proudest monument they can
leave behind.</p>
<p>And again, developing both management and managers is as needed—and
requires the same approaches—in the public-service institution as in
business enterprise.</p>
<p>But above all, today’s manager and career professional has a
responsibility to develop himself. It is a responsibility he has toward
his institution as well as toward himself.</p>
<p>We hear a great deal today about the organization man and about
alienation of people in organizations. I doubt whether there is more
conformity in today’s organization than there was in yesterday’s small
village with its tremendous pressures of class and kin, of caste and
custom. I doubt seriously whether there is more alienation today, than
in earlier societies. The classic diagnosis of alienation, after all,
was not derived from a study of the modern corporation but was made in a
thoroughly agrarian pre-industrial society, the Denmark in which
Kierkegaard lived and wrote in the early nineteenth century. But whether
conformity and spiritual despair are greater or lesser today than they
used to be, the one effective counterforce to both is the individual’s
commitment to self-development, the individual’s commitment to
excellence.</p>
