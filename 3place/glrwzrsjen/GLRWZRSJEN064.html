<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>The Legitimacy of Management</p>
<p>In this century, society has become a society of organizations. Every
major social task in this society is being performed in and through
large, managed institutions. As a result the great majority of people in
developed countries work as employees. They work as mem- bers of managed
institutions and within a managerial structure and organization.</p>
<p>In this century, society has become a knowledge society. More and
more of the mem- bers of developed society make their living by putting
knowledge to work. More and more acquire their qualifications through
long years of formal education. More and more of them are managers
themselves or work as knowledge professionals with direct respon-
sibility for performance and results.</p>
<p>The two developments are interrelated. Because of the emergence of
the society of or- ganizations, one can now make a living through
knowledge work. And because of the availability of large numbers of
people with substantial formal education, large institu- tions are
possible and can be managed.</p>
<p>Management is both the carrier and the result of these two
developments. It is the or- gan through which the institutions of the
society of organizations can be made to function and to perform their
mission. And management itself is such a “knowledge.” It is a disci-
pline with its own subject matters, its own skills, its own expertise.
Above all, the manag- ers of these institutions in a society of
organizations form the leadership groups of the society.</p>
<p>Unless this society of organizations destroys itself, managers as a
leadership group and management as a discipline and challenge will
remain with us. To repeat the leitmotiv of this book, we are moving from
management boom to management performance. It is the task of this
management generation to make the institutions of the society of
organiza- tions, beginning with the business enterprise, perform for
society and economy; for the community; and for the individual
alike.</p>
<p>This requires, first, that managers know their discipline. It
requires that they know management.</p>
<p>We hear a great deal today about the manager of the future. But the
important man is the manager of today. And the first requirement is that
the manager know his craft, his tools, his task and responsibility. The
first requirement is that he be able to function.</p>
<p>The Limits of Technocracy</p>
<p>The management boom focused on management skills and management
competence. But it largely defined the management job as internal. It
was concerned with organization and motivation, with financial and other
controls, with the management sciences, and with manager development. It
was, to use a fashionable term, technocratic in its orientation. This
was understandable. It was also right. One has to know one’s own craft.
There are few things as useless as the man who wants to set right the
world because he does not know his own job.</p>
<p>But if the years of the management boom have taught us anything, it
is that the tech- nocrat as manager is not enough. It is precisely
because in the society of organizations</p>
<p>there is no leadership group other than the managers that more is
required than technoc- racy.</p>
<p>The first task of the manager is indeed to manage the institution for
the mission for which it has been designed. The first task of the
business manager is, therefore, economic performance. But at the same
time he faces the tasks of making the work productive and the worker
achieving, and of providing for the quality of life for society and
individual. And this goes well beyond technocracy.</p>
<p>President Kennedy’s administration was the peak of a great wave of
technocracy. It was also its tragedy. And Robert McNamara, President
Kennedy’s Secretary of Defense, personified both the strength and the
limitations of the technocrat. In the final analysis McNamara was a
failure—not because of Vietnam but because “managing” to him was focus
on the internal and excluded the external, the value, the people, the
social dimen- sions.</p>
<p>But General Motors also can be seen as the triumph and the failure of
the technocrat manager. Indeed the book which the builder of General
Motors, Alfred P. Sloan, wrote* shows both the strength of the truly
accomplished technocratic manager and his limita- tions. General Motors
has stayed with Sloan’s legacy. And in Sloan’s terms i.e., in terms of
sales and profits, it has succeeded admirably, at least in the North
American market. But it has also failed abysmally—in terms of public
reputation, of public esteem, of ac- ceptance by the public.†</p>
<p>There is great temptation here—the temptation for the manager to
become a philoso- pher, the temptation to become “cosmic.” Hence it
cannot be said too often that the foun- dation for “doing good” is
“doing well.” Good intentions are no excuse for incompetence. And the
manager who believes that social consciousness is a substitute for
managing his business—or his hospital or his university—so that it
produces the results for the sake of which it exists, is either a fool
or a knave or both.</p>
<p>The Need for Legitimacy</p>
<p>But a leadership group needs not only to function. It needs not only
to perform. It also has to have legitimacy. It has to be accepted by the
community as “right.”</p>
<p>“Legitimacy” is an elusive concept. It has, in effect, no real
definition. Yet it is cru- cial. Authority without legitimacy is
usurpation. And the leadership groups of a society— and this means the
managers today—have to have authority to perform their functions.</p>
<p>At the same time, none of the traditional grounds of legitimacy will
do for the manag- ers. Birth or magic are just as unsuitable for them as
popular election or the rights of pri- vate property. They hold office
because they perform. And yet performance by itself has never been
sufficient grounds for legitimacy.</p>
<p>What managers need to be accepted as legitimate authority is a
principle of morality.</p>
<p>They need to ground their authority in a moral commitment which, at
the same time, ex- presses the purpose and character of
organizations.</p>
<p>Almost three centuries ago the English pamphleteer Mandeville in a
didactic poem “The Fable of the Bees” laid down what became, a century
later, the principle of capital- ism. “Private vices make public
benefit.” Blind and greedy profit-seeking, Mandeville laid down,
advances the public good through the “invisible hand.” In terms of
perform- ance, history has proven Mandeville remarkably right. But
morally his principle was never acceptable. And the fact that capitalism
has become the less acceptable the more it succeeded—as the great
Austro-American economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out re- peatedly—has
been the basic weakness of modern society and modern economy.</p>
<p>This by the way, is why the rhetoric of “profit maximization” and
“profit motive” are not only antisocial. They are immoral.</p>
<p>*My Years with General Motors (Doubleday, 1964).</p>
<p>†On General Motors’s triumph and failure, see also the Epilogue to
the new (1972) edition of my book Concept of the Corporation.</p>
<p>Although we still talk in De Mandeville’s terms, we have long ago
shifted to a very different base. We long ago learned that it is the job
of the business manager to convert public needs into business
opportunities. It is his task to anticipate, identify, and satisfy the
needs of market and individual, the needs of consumer and employee.</p>
<p>But these are still inadequate grounds of legitimacy. They explain
business activity ra- tionally, but they do not supply it with the
justification for authority. To maintain an autonomous management, a
management that in serving its institution serves society and community,
a principle of morality has to be grounded in the purposes and the
character- istics of organization and in the nature of the institution
itself.</p>
<p>There is only one such principle. It is the purpose of organization
and, therefore, the grounds of management authority: to make human
strength productive. Organization is the means through which man, as an
individual and as a member of the community, finds</p>
<p>both contribution and achievement.</p>
<p>The invention of organization as society’s tool for accomplishing
social purposes may well be as important to the history of man as was
the invention of the specialization of labor for individuals ten
thousand years ago. And the principle underlying it is not “per- sonal
vices make public benefits.” It is “personal strengths make social
benefits.” This can serve as grounds for legitimacy. This is a moral
principle on which authority can be based.</p>
<p>To maintain management as autonomous, and indeed as “private,” is an
essential need of society. It is essential for keeping society free. It
is essential for keeping society per- forming. The alternative, the
“totalitarian” structure in which all activities, all individuals, and
all organizations monolithically repeat the same pattern, are managed by
one and the same governing group, and express the same values, the same
doctrine, and the same or- thodoxy, is not only death to the human
spirit, it is grotesque. It is also wasteful, rigid, stifting. It is
not, above all, business that needs the autonomy of the markets for
goods and services, for capital, and for jobs and careers, that is,
autonomous and accountable man- agement of autonomous institutions. It
is (as Chapter 27 pointed out earlier), the econ- omy, the society, and
government itself which require managerial autonomy and “free
enterprise.”</p>
<p>Yet to have a society of organizations with autonomous managements,
each a deci- sion-maker in its own sphere, requires that managers, while
private, also know themselves to be public. They are private in that
they are not subservient to a central political author- ity which, in
turn, is uncontrolled, uncontrollable, and despotic as inevitable
result. But they are public in that they consciously, knowingly, openly,
strive to make a public need into a private opportunity of their
autonomous self-governing institution.</p>
<p>The old fights are still being fought and the old slogans still
reverberate. Yet even the Soviet Union has had to accept “profit” as a
necessary condition of economic activity and as a means to build the
“capital fund” without which no economy can survive, let alone advance.
Indeed, the profit requirement of a totally planned and therefore rigid
economy is, of necessity, many times greater than that of a “market
economy.” “Ownership” is be- coming a secondary issue, especially as the
“workers” increasingly are also becoming the “owners” in the most highly
developed countries. This does not mean that we cannot be killed by
these old fights and issues. The scars fester and are toxic. But nothing
can be “solved” by the remedies of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>What is needed to break out of the straitjacket of old slogans and
old issues is man- agement performance. This first requires performance
as a technocrat. It requires per- formance that makes the manager’s
organization capable of supplying to society and economy the
contribution for the sake of which it exists, such as economic goods and
services and the capital fund for tomorrow. But it also requires
performance beyond the immediate mission, beyond technocracy:
performance in making work productive and the worker achieving and
performance with respect to the quality of life. But above all, it has
to be performance with respect to the role and function of the manager.
If he is to remain- as he should—the manager of an autonomous
institution, he must accept that he is a pub-</p>
<p>lic man. He must accept the moral responsibility of organization, the
responsibility of making individual strengths productive and
achieving.</p>
