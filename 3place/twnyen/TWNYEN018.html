<h4 id="fourteen">FOURTEEN</h4>
<p>MATERIAL CONDITIONS AND IDEAL ENDS</p>
<p>Is it just or reasonable, that most voices against the main end of
government should enslave the less number that would be free? More just
it is, doubtless, if it come to force, that a less number compel a
greater to retain, which can be no wrong to them, their liberty, than
that a greater number, for the pleasure of their baseness, compel a less
most injuriously to be their fellow slaves. They who seek nothing but
their own just liberty, have always the right to win it, whenever they
have the power, be the voices never so numerous that oppose it.</p>
<p>—John Milton1</p>
<p>Our generation likes to flatter itself that it attaches less weight
to economic considerations than did its parents or grandparents. The
“End of Economic Man” bids fair to become one of the governing myths of
our age.2 Before we accept this claim, or treat the change as
praiseworthy, we must inquire a little further how far it is true. When
we consider the claims for social reconstruction which are most strongly
pressed, it appears that they are almost all economic in character: we
have seen already that the “reinterpretation in economic terms” of the
political ideals of the past, of liberty, equality, and security, is one
of the main demands of people who at the same time proclaim the end of
economic man. Nor can there be much doubt that in their beliefs and
aspirations men are today more than ever before governed by economic
doctrines, by the carefully fostered belief in the irrationality of our
economic system, by the false assertions about “potential plenty,”
pseudo-theories about the inevitable trend toward monopoly, and the
impression created by certain much-advertised occurrences such as the
destruction of stocks of raw materials or the suppression of inventions,
for which competition is blamed, though they are precisely the sort of
thing which could not happen under competition and which are made
possible only by monopoly and usually by government-aided monopoly.3</p>
<p>In a different sense, however, it is no doubt true that our
generation is less willing to listen to economic considerations than was
true of its predecessors. It is most decidedly unwilling to sacrifice
any of its demands to what are called economic arguments; it is
impatient and intolerant of all restraints on their immediate ambitions
and unwilling to bow to economic necessities. It is not any contempt for
material welfare, or even any diminished desire for it, but, on the
contrary, a refusal to recognize any obstacles, any conflict with other
aims which might impede the fulfillment of their own desires, which
distinguishes our generation. Economophobia would be a more correct
description of this attitude than the doubly misleading “End of Economic
Man,” which suggests a change from a state of affairs which has never
existed in a direction in which we are not moving. Man has come to hate,
and to revolt against, the impersonal forces to which in the past he
submitted, even though they have often frustrated his individual
efforts.</p>
<p>This revolt is an instance of a much more general phenomenon, a new
unwillingness to submit to any rule or necessity the rationale of which
man does not understand; it makes itself felt in many fields of life,
particularly in that of morals; and it is often a commendable attitude.
But there are fields where this craving for intelligibility cannot be
fully satisfied and where at the same time a refusal to submit to
anything we cannot understand must lead to the destruction of our
civilization. Though it is natural that, as the world around us becomes
more complex, our resistance grows against the forces which, without our
understanding them, constantly interfere with individual hopes and
plans, it is just in these circumstances that it becomes less and less
possible for anyone fully to understand these forces. A complex
civilization like ours is necessarily based on the individual’s
adjusting himself to changes whose cause and nature he cannot
understand: why he should have more or less, why he should have to move
to another occupation, why some things he wants should become more
difficult to get than others, will always be connected with such a
multitude of circumstances that no single mind will be able to grasp
them; or, even worse, those affected will put all the blame on an
obvious immediate and avoidable cause, while the more complex
interrelationships which determine the change remain inevitably hidden
to them. Even the director of a completely planned society, if he wanted
to give an adequate explanation to anyone why he has to be directed to a
different job, or why his remuneration has to be changed, could not
fully do so without explaining and vindicating his whole plan—which
means, of course, that it could not be explained to more than a few.</p>
<p>It was men’s submission to the impersonal forces of the market that
in the past has made possible the growth of a civilization which without
this could not have developed; it is by thus submitting that we are
every day helping to build something that is greater than any one of us
can fully comprehend. It does not matter whether men in the past did
submit from beliefs which some now regard as superstitious: from a
religious spirit of humility or an exaggerated respect for the crude
teachings of the early economists. The crucial point is that it is
infinitely more difficult rationally to comprehend the necessity of
submitting to forces whose operation we cannot follow in detail than to
do so out of the humble awe which religion, or even the respect for the
doctrines of economics, did inspire. It may, indeed, be the case that
infinitely more intelligence on the part of everybody would be needed
than anybody now possesses, if we were even merely to maintain our
present complex civilization without anyone’s having to do things of
which he does not comprehend the necessity. The refusal to yield to
forces which we neither understand nor can recognize as the conscious
decisions of an intelligent being is the product of an incomplete and
therefore erroneous rationalism. It is incomplete because it fails to
comprehend that the coordination of the multifarious individual efforts
in a complex society must take account of facts no individual can
completely survey. And it fails to see that, unless this complex society
is to be destroyed, the only alternative to submission to the impersonal
and seemingly irrational forces of the market is submission to an
equally uncontrollable and therefore arbitrary power of other men. In
his anxiety to escape the irksome restraints which he now feels, man
does not realize that the new authoritarian restraints which will have
to be deliberately imposed in their stead will be even more painful.</p>
<p>Those who argue that we have to an astounding degree learned to
master the forces of nature but are sadly behind in making successful
use of the possibilities of social collaboration are quite right so far
as this statement goes. But they are mistaken when they carry the
comparison further and argue that we must learn to master the forces of
society in the same manner in which we have learned to master the forces
of nature. This is not only the path to totalitarianism but the path to
the destruction of our civilization and a certain way to block future
progress. Those who demand it show by their very demands that they have
not yet comprehended the extent to which the mere preservation of what
we have so far achieved depends on the coordination of individual
efforts by impersonal forces.</p>
<p>We must now return briefly to the crucial point—that individual
freedom cannot be reconciled with the supremacy of one single purpose to
which the whole society must be entirely and permanently subordinated.
The only exception to the rule that a free society must not be subjected
to a single purpose is war and other temporary disasters when
subordination of almost everything to the immediate and pressing need is
the price at which we preserve our freedom in the long run. This
explains also why so many of the fashionable phrases about doing for the
purposes of peace what we have learned to do for the purposes of war are
so very misleading: it is sensible temporarily to sacrifice freedom in
order to make it more secure in the future; but the same cannot be said
for a system proposed as a permanent arrangement.</p>
<p>That no single purpose must be allowed in peace to have absolute
preference over all others applies even to the one aim which everybody
now agrees comes in the front rank: the conquest of unemployment. There
can be no doubt that this must be the goal of our greatest endeavor;
even so, it does not mean that such an aim should be allowed to dominate
us to the exclusion of everything else, that, as the glib phrase runs,
it must be accomplished “at any price.” It is, in fact, in this field
that the fascination of vague but popular phrases like “full employment”
may well lead to extremely shortsighted measures, and where the
categorical and irresponsible “it must be done at all cost” of the
single-minded idealist is likely to do the greatest harm.</p>
<p>It is of very great importance that we should approach with open eyes
the task which in this field we shall have to face after the war and
that we should clearly realize what we may hope to achieve. One of the
dominant features of the immediate postwar situation will be that the
special needs of war have drawn hundreds of thousands of men and women
into specialized jobs where during the war they have been able to earn
relatively high wages. There will, in many instances, be no possibility
of employing the same numbers in these particular trades. There will be
an urgent need for the transfer of large numbers to other jobs, and many
of them will find that the work they can then get is less favorably
remunerated than was true of their war job. Even retraining, which
certainly ought to be provided on a liberal scale, cannot entirely
overcome this problem. There will still be many people who, if they are
to be paid according to what their services will then be worth to
society, would under any system have to be content with a lowering of
their material position relative to that of others.</p>
<p>If, then, the trade unions successfully resist any lowering of the
wages of the particular groups in question, there will be only two
alternatives open: either coercion will have to be used (i.e., certain
individuals will have to be selected for compulsory transfer to other
and relatively less well paid positions) or those who can no longer be
employed at the relatively high wages they have earned during the war
must be allowed to remain unemployed until they are willing to accept
work at a relatively lower wage. This is a problem which would arise in
a socialist society no less than in any other; and the great majority of
workmen would probably be just as little inclined to guarantee in
perpetuity their present wages to those who were drawn into specially
well-paid employments because of the special need of war. A socialist
society would certainly use coercion in this position. The point that is
relevant for us is that if we are determined not to allow unemployment
at any price, and are not willing to use coercion, we shall be driven to
all sorts of desperate expedients, none of which can bring any lasting
relief and all of which will seriously interfere with the most
productive use of our resources. It should be specially noted that
monetary policy cannot provide a real cure for this difficulty except by
a general and considerable inflation, sufficient to raise all other
wages and prices relatively to those which cannot be lowered, and that
even this would bring about the desired result only by effecting in a
concealed and underhand fashion that reduction of real wages which could
not be brought about directly. Yet to raise all other wages and incomes
to an extent sufficient to adjust the position of the group in question
would involve an inflationary expansion on such a scale that the
disturbances, hardships, and injustices caused would be much greater
than those to be cured.</p>
<p>This problem, which will arise in a particularly acute form after the
war, is one which will always be with us so long as the economic system
has to adopt itself to continuous changes. There will always be a
possible maximum of employment in the short run which can be achieved by
giving all people employment where they happen to be and which can be
achieved by monetary expansion. But not only can this maximum be
maintained solely by progressive inflationary expansion and with the
effect of holding up those redistributions of labor between industries
made necessary by the changed circumstances, and which so long as
workmen are free to choose their jobs will always come about only with
some delays and thereby cause some unemployment: to aim always at the
maximum of employment achievable by monetary means is a policy which is
certain in the end to defeat its own purposes. It tends to lower the
productivity of labor and thereby constantly increases the proportion of
the working population which can be kept employed at present wages only
by artificial means.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that after the war wisdom in the management of
our economic affairs will be even more important than before and that
the fate of our civilization will ultimately depend on how we solve the
economic problems we shall then face. The British, at least, will at
first be poor, very poor indeed—and the problem of regaining and
improving former standards may in fact prove for Great Britain more
difficult than for many other countries. If they act wisely, there is
little question that by hard work and by devoting a considerable part of
their efforts to overhauling and renewing their industrial apparatus and
organization, they will in the course of a few years be able to return
to and even surpass the level they had reached. But this presupposes
that they will be satisfied to consume currently no more than is
possible without impairing the task of reconstruction, that no
exaggerated hopes create irresistible claims for more than this, and
that they regard it as more important to use their resources in the best
manner and for the purposes which contribute most to well-being than
that we should use all their resources somehow.4 Perhaps no less
important is that they should not, by shortsighted attempts to cure
poverty by a redistribution instead of by an increase in our income, so
depress large classes as to turn them into determined enemies of the
existing political order. It should never be forgotten that the one
decisive factor in the rise of totalitarianism on the Continent, which
is yet absent in England and America, is the existence of a large
recently dispossessed middle class.</p>
<p>Our hopes of avoiding the fate which threatens must indeed to a large
extent rest on the prospect that we can resume rapid economic progress
which, however low we may have to start, will continue to carry us
upward; and the main condition for such progress is that we should all
be ready to adapt ourselves quickly to a very much changed world, that
no considerations for the accustomed standard of particular groups must
be allowed to obstruct this adaptation, and that we learn once more to
turn all our resources to wherever they contribute most to make us all
richer. The adjustments that will be needed if we are to recover and
surpass our former standards will be greater than any similar
adjustments we had to make in the past; and only if every one of us is
ready individually to obey the necessities of this readjustment shall we
be able to get through a difficult period as free men who can choose
their own way of life. Let a uniform minimum be secured to everybody by
all means; but let us admit at the same time that with this assurance of
a basic minimum all claims for a privileged security of particular
classes must lapse, that all excuses disappear for allowing groups to
exclude newcomers from sharing their relative prosperity in order to
maintain a special standard of their own.</p>
<p>It may sound noble to say, “Damn economics, let us build up a decent
world”—but it is, in fact, merely irresponsible. With our world as it
is, with everyone convinced that the material conditions here or there
must be improved, our only chance of building a decent world is that we
can continue to improve the general level of wealth. The one thing
modern democracy will not bear without cracking is the necessity of a
substantial lowering of the standards of living in peacetime or even
prolonged stationariness of its economic conditions.</p>
<p>People who admit that present political trends constitute a serious
threat to our economic prospects, and through their economic effects
endanger much higher values, are yet likely to deceive themselves that
we are making material sacrifices to gain ideal ends. It is, however,
more than doubtful whether a fifty years’ approach toward collectivism
has raised our moral standards, or whether the change has not rather
been in the opposite direction. Though we are in the habit of priding
ourselves on our more sensitive social conscience, it is by no means
clear that this is justified by the practice of our individual conduct.
On the negative side, in its indignation about the inequities of the
existing social order, our generation probably surpasses most of its
predecessors. But the effect of that movement on our positive standards
in the proper field of morals, individual conduct, and on the
seriousness with which we uphold moral principles against the
expediencies and exigencies of social machinery, is a very different
matter.</p>
<p>Issues in this field have become so confused that it is necessary to
go back to fundamentals. What our generation is in danger of forgetting
is not only that morals are of necessity a phenomenon of individual
conduct but also that they can exist only in the sphere in which the
individual is free to decide for himself and is called upon voluntarily
to sacrifice personal advantage to the observance of a moral rule.
Outside the sphere of individual responsibility there is neither
goodness nor badness, neither opportunity for moral merit nor the chance
of proving one’s conviction by sacrificing one’s desires to what one
thinks right. Only where we ourselves are responsible for our own
interests and are free to sacrifice them has our decision moral value.
We are neither entitled to be unselfish at someone else’s expense nor is
there any merit in being unselfish if we have no choice. The members of
a society who in all respects are made to do the good thing have no
title to praise. As Milton said: “If every action which is good or evil
in a man of ripe years were under pittance and prescription and
compulsion, what were virtue but a name, what praise should then be due
to well-doing, what gramercy to be sober, just, or continent?”5</p>
<p>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is the air
in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values are daily
re-created in the free decision of the individual. Responsibility, not
to a superior, but to one’s conscience, the awareness of a duty not
exacted by compulsion, the necessity to decide which of the things one
values are to be sacrificed to others, and to bear the consequences of
one’s own decision, are the very essence of any morals which deserve the
name.</p>
<p>That in this sphere of individual conduct the effect of collectivism
has been almost entirely destructive is both inevitable and undeniable.
A movement whose main promise is the relief from responsibility6 cannot
but be antimoral in its effect, however lofty the ideals to which it
owes its birth. Can there be much doubt that the feeling of personal
obligation to remedy inequities, where our individual power permits, has
been weakened rather than strengthened, that both the willingness to
bear responsibility and the consciousness that it is our own individual
duty to know how to choose have been perceptibly impaired? There is all
the difference between demanding that a desirable state of affairs
should be brought about by the authorities, or even being willing to
submit provided everyone else is made to do the same, and the readiness
to do what one thinks right one’s self at the sacrifice of one’s own
desires and perhaps in the face of hostile public opinion. There is much
to suggest that we have in fact become more tolerant toward particular
abuses and much more indifferent to inequities in individual cases,
since we have fixed our eyes on an entirely different system in which
the state will set everything right. It may even be, as has been
suggested, that the passion for collective action is a way in which we
now without compunction collectively indulge in that selfishness which
as individuals we had learned a little to restrain.</p>
<p>It is true that the virtues which are less esteemed and practiced
now—independence, self-reliance, and the willingness to bear risks, the
readiness to back one’s own conviction against a majority, and the
willingness to voluntary cooperation with one’s neighbors—are
essentially those on which the working of an individualist society
rests. Collectivism has nothing to put in their place, and in so far as
it already has destroyed them it has left a void filled by nothing but
the demand for obedience and the compulsion of the individual to do what
is collectively decided to be good. The periodical election of
representatives, to which the moral choice of the individual tends to be
more and more reduced, is not an occasion on which his moral values are
tested or where he has constantly to reassert and prove the order of his
values and to testify to the sincerity of his profession by the
sacrifice of those of his values he rates lower to those he puts
higher.</p>
<p>As the rules of conduct evolved by individuals are the source from
which collective political action derives what moral standards it
possesses, it would indeed be surprising if the relaxation of the
standards of individual conduct were accompanied by a raising of the
standards of social action. That there have been great changes is clear.
Every generation, of course, puts some values higher and some lower than
its predecessors. Which, however, are the aims which take a lower place
now, which are the values which we are now warned may have to give way
if they come into conflict with others? Which kind of values figure less
prominently in the picture of the future held out to us by the popular
writers and speakers than they did in the dreams and hopes of our
fathers?</p>
<p>It is certainly not material comfort, certainly not a rise in our
standard of living or the assurance of a certain status in society which
ranks lower. Is there a popular writer or speaker who dares to suggest
to the masses that they might have to make sacrifices of their material
prospects for the enhancement of an ideal end? Is it not, in fact,
entirely the other way round? Are not the things which we are more and
more frequently taught to regard as “nineteenth-century illusions” all
moral values—liberty and independence, truth and intellectual honesty,
peace and democracy, and the respect for the individual qua man instead
of merely as the member of an organized group?</p>
<p>What are the fixed poles now which are regarded as sacrosanct, which
no reformer dare touch, since they are treated as the immutable
boundaries which must be respected in any plan for the future? They are
no longer the liberty of the individual, his freedom of movement, and
scarcely that of speech. They are the protected standards of this or
that group, their “right” to exclude others from providing their
fellowmen with what they need. Discrimination between members and
nonmembers of closed groups, not to speak of nationals of different
countries, is accepted more and more as a matter of course; injustices
inflicted on individuals by government action in the interest of a group
are disregarded with an indifference hardly distinguishable from
callousness; and the grossest violations of the most elementary rights
of the individual, such as are involved in the compulsory transfer of
populations, are more and more often countenanced even by supposed
liberals.</p>
<p>All this surely indicates that our moral sense has been blunted
rather than sharpened. When we are reminded, as more and more frequently
happens, that one cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs, the eggs
which are broken are almost all of the kind which a generation or two
ago were regarded as the essential bases of civilized life. And what
atrocities committed by powers with whose professed principles they
sympathize have not been readily condoned by many of our so-called
“liberals”?</p>
<p>There is one aspect of the change in moral values brought about by
the advance of collectivism which at the present time provides special
food for thought. It is that the virtues which are held less and less in
esteem and which consequently become rarer are precisely those on which
Anglo-Saxons justly prided themselves and in which they were generally
recognized to excel. The virtues these people possessed—in a higher
degree than most other people, excepting only a few of the smaller
nations, like the Swiss and the Dutch—were independence and
self-reliance, individual initiative and local responsibility, the
successful reliance on voluntary activity, noninterference with one’s
neighbor and tolerance of the different and queer, respect for custom
and tradition, and a healthy suspicion of power and authority. Almost
all the traditions and institutions in which democratic moral genius has
found its most characteristic expression, and which in turn have molded
the national character and the whole moral climate of England and
America, are those which the progress of collectivism and its inherently
centralistic tendencies are progressively destroying.</p>
<p>A foreign background is sometimes helpful in seeing more clearly to
what circumstances the peculiar excellencies of the moral atmosphere of
a nation are due. And if one who, whatever the law may say, must forever
remain a foreigner, may be allowed to say so, it is one of the most
disheartening spectacles of our time to see to what extent some of the
most precious things which England, for example, has given to the world
are now held in contempt in England herself. The English hardly know to
what degree they differ from most other people in that they all,
irrespective of party, hold to a greater or less extent the ideas which
in their most pronounced form are known as liberalism. Compared with
most other peoples only twenty years ago almost all Englishmen were
liberals— however much they may have differed from party liberalism. And
even today the English conservative or socialist, no less than the
liberal, if he travels abroad, though he may find the ideas and writings
of Carlyle or Disraeli, of the Webbs or H. G. Wells, exceedingly popular
in circles with which he has little in common, among Nazis and other
totalitarians, if he finds an intellectual island where the tradition of
Macaulay and Gladstone, of J. S. Mill or John Morley, lives, will find
kindred spirits who “talk the same language” as himself— however much he
himself may differ from the ideals for which these men specifically
stood.7</p>
<p>Nowhere is the loss of the belief in the specific values of British
civilization more manifest, and nowhere has it had a more paralyzing
effect on the pursuit of our immediate great purpose, than in the
fatuous ineffectiveness of most British propaganda. The first
prerequisite for success in propaganda directed to other people is the
proud acknowledgment of the characteristic values and distinguishing
traits for which the country attempting it is known to the other
peoples. The main cause of the ineffectiveness of British propaganda is
that those directing it seem to have lost their own belief in the
peculiar values of English civilization or to be completely ignorant of
the main points on which it differs from that of other people. The Left
intelligentsia, indeed, have so long worshiped foreign gods that they
seem to have become almost incapable of seeing any good in the
characteristic English institutions and traditions. That the moral
values on which most of them pride themselves are largely the product of
the institutions they are out to destroy, these socialists cannot, of
course, admit. And this attitude is unfortunately not confined to avowed
socialists. Though one must hope that this is not true of the less vocal
but more numerous cultivated Englishmen, if one were to judge by the
ideas which find expression in current political discussion and
propaganda, the Englishmen who not only “the language speak that
Shakespeare spake” but also “the faith and morals hold that Milton held”
seem to have almost vanished.8</p>
<p>To believe, however, that the kind of propaganda produced by this
attitude can have the desired effect on our enemies and particularly on
the Germans, is a fatal blunder. The Germans know England and America,
not well, perhaps, yet sufficiently to know what are the characteristic
traditional values of democratic life, and what for the last two or
three generations has increasingly separated the minds of the countries.
If we wish to convince them, not only of our sincerity, but also that we
have to offer a real alternative to the way they have gone, it will not
be by concessions to their system of thought. We shall not delude them
with a stale reproduction of the ideas of their fathers which we have
borrowed from them—be it state socialism, Realpolitik, “scientific”
planning, or corporativism. We shall not persuade them by following them
half the way which leads to totalitarianism. If the democracies
themselves abandon the supreme ideal of the freedom and happiness of the
individual, if they implicitly admit that their civilization is not
worth preserving, and that they know nothing better than to follow the
path along which the Germans have led, they have indeed nothing to
offer. To the Germans all these are merely belated admissions that the
liberals have been wrong all the way through and that they themselves
are leading the way to a new and better world, however appalling the
period of transition may be. The Germans know that what they still
regard as the British and American traditions and their own new ideals
are fundamentally opposed and irreconcilable views of life. They might
be convinced that the way they have chosen was wrong—but nothing will
ever convince them that the British or Americans will be better guides
on the German path.</p>
<p>Least of all will that type of propaganda appeal to those Germans on
whose help we must ultimately count in rebuilding Europe because their
values are nearest to our own. For experience has made them wiser and
sadder men: they have learned that neither good intentions nor
efficiency of organization can preserve decency in a system in which
personal freedom and individual responsibility are destroyed. What the
German and Italian who have learned the lesson want above all is
protection against the monster state—not grandiose schemes for
organization on a colossal scale, but opportunity peacefully and in
freedom to build up once more their own little worlds. It is not because
they believe that to be ordered about by British or Americans is
preferable to being ordered about by the Prussians, but because they
believe that in a world where democratic ideals have been victorious
they will be less ordered about and left in peace to pursue their own
concerns, that we can hope for support from some of the nationals of the
enemy countries.</p>
<p>If we are to succeed in the war of ideologies and to win over the
decent elements in the enemy countries, we must, first of all, regain
the belief in the traditional values for which we have stood in the past
and must have the moral courage stoutly to defend the ideals which our
enemies attack. Not by shamefaced apologies and by assurances that we
are rapidly reforming, not by explaining that we are seeking some
compromise between the traditional liberal values and the new
totalitarian ideas, shall we win confidence and support. Not the latest
improvements we may have effected in our social institutions, which
count but little compared with the basic differences of two opposed ways
of life, but our unwavering faith in those traditions which have made
England and America countries of free and upright, tolerant and
independent, people is the thing that counts.</p>
<p>1 ( John Milton, “The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free
Commonwealth,” in Areopagitica and Other Prose Works (London: J. M. Dent
and Sons, Everyman’s Edition, 1927), p. 181. —Ed.)</p>
<p>2 (In this paragraph Hayek refers to themes found in Peter Drucker’s
The End of Economic Man: A Study of the New Totalitarianism, op. cit.
Drucker argued that Europeans have searched for freedom and equality
over the centuries, first in spiritual, and subsequently in
intellectual, political, and economic spheres. Fascism emerged due to
the failures of both capitalism and socialism to deliver on their
promises of freedom and equality in the economic sphere. “Fascist
Noneconomic Societies” have arisen in which the authority of command
substitutes for economic privilege and where all hopes for economic
growth and wealth creation are abandoned. Under fascism, the individual
serves the larger corporate society, and though equality is achieved,
individual freedom and initiative are foregone. Drucker forecast a
confrontation between the totalitarian states and the western
democracies, and recommended that the latter create their own
noneconomic societies, but ones that retain the quest for the freedom
and equality of individuals. —Ed.)</p>
<p>3 The frequent use that is made of the occasional destruction of
wheat, coffee, etc., as an argument against competition is a good
illustration of the intellectual dishonesty of much of this argument,
since a little reflection will show that in a competitive market no
owner of such stocks can gain by their destruction. The case of the
alleged suppression of useful patents is more complicated and cannot be
adequately discussed in a note; but the conditions in which it would be
profitable to put into cold storage a patent which in the social
interest ought to be used are so exceptional that it is more than
doubtful whether this has happened in any important instance.</p>
<p>4 This is perhaps the place to emphasize that, however much one may
wish a speedy return to a free economy, this cannot mean the removal at
one stroke of most of the wartime restrictions. Nothing would discredit
the system of free enterprise more than the acute, though probably
short-lived, dislocation and instability such an attempt would produce.
The problem is at what kind of system we should aim in the process of
demobilization, not whether the wartime system should be transformed
into more permanent arrangements by a carefully thought-out policy of
gradual relaxation of controls, which may have to extend over several
years.</p>

Prose Works, op. cit., p. 18. —Ed.)</p>
<p>6 This becomes more and more clearly expressed as socialism
approaches totalitarianism, and in England is most explicitly stated in
the program of that latest and most totalitarian form of English
socialism, Sir Richard Acland’s “Common-Wealth” movement. The main
feature of the new order he promises is that in it the community will
“say to the individual ‘Don’t you bother about the business of getting
your own living.’” In consequence, of course, “it must be the community
as a whole which must decide whether or not a man shall be employed upon
our resources, and how and when and in what manner he shall work,” and
that the community will have “to run camps for shirkers in very
tolerable conditions.” Is it surprising that the author discovers that
Hitler “has stumbled across (or has needed to make use of ) a small
part, or perhaps one should say one particular aspect of, what will
ultimately be required of humanity.” See Sir Richard Acland, Bt., The
Forward March, op. cit., pp. 127, 126, 135, and 32.</p>
<p>7 ( In this passage Hayek is contrasting the writings of conservative
thinkers like Carlyle and Disraeli, and those of socialists like the
Webbs and H. G. Wells, with those of writers in the English liberal
tradition. We have earlier met some of these men: Carlyle and Morley in
the author’s introduction, note 4; the Webbs in chapter 5, note 3; Wells
in chapter 6, note 10, Disraeli in chapter 8, note 4, and Gladstone in
chapter 13, note 6, though it might be added that Carlyle’s most
relevant works in the present context are probably his lectures on
heroes and hero worship (in which the need for strong leaders to shape a
nation’s history was advocated), and his multivolume history of the
Prussian king Frederick the Great. On the Liberal side, author,
historian, and MP Thomas Babington Macauley’s (1800–1859) History of
England is often taken as an exemplar of “Whig history.” In his book On
Liberty, philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) defended the freedom
of the individual in the face of political and social control. —Ed.)</p>
<p>8 Though the subject of this chapter has already invited more than
one reference to Milton, it is difficult to resist the temptation to add
here one more quotation, a very familiar one, though one, it seems,
which nowadays nobody but a foreigner would dare to cite: “Let not
England forget her precedence of teaching nations how to live.” It is,
perhaps, significant that our generation has seen a host of American and
English detractors of Milton—and that the first of them, Ezra Pound, was
during this war broadcasting from Italy! (The quotation in the text is
from a poem by William Wordsworth that begins, “It Is Not To Be Thought
Of,” which may be found in The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth,
ed. E. Selincourt and Helen Darbishire (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1946),
volume 3, p. 117. The full passage reads, “we must be free or die, who
speak the tongue that Shakspeare spake; the faith and morals hold which
Milton held.” The quotation from Milton is from his “The Doctrine and
Discipline of Divorce,” reprinted in Areopagitica and Other Prose Works,
op. cit., p. 193. The American poet and critic Ezra Pound (1885–1972)
was credited by T. S. Eliot as being the motivating force behind
“modern” poetry. Pound lived in Italy from 1924 to 1945, where he became
enamored with fascist ideas. In the early part of the war he issued
broadcasts critical of democracy. He was indicted for treason after the
war, but instead of being tried he was judged insane and spent over a
decade in an asylum. He was released in 1958. —Ed.)</p>
