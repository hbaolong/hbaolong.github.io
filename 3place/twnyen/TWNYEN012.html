<p>WHO, WHOM?</p>
<p>The finest opportunity ever given to the world was thrown away
because the passion for equality made vain the hope for freedom. —Lord
Acton1</p>
<p>It is significant that one of the commonest objections to competition
is that it is “blind.” It is not irrelevant to recall that to the
ancients blindness was an attribute of their deity of justice. Although
competition and justice may have little else in common, it is as much a
commendation of competition as of justice that it is no respecter of
persons. That it is impossible to foretell who will be the lucky ones or
whom disaster will strike, that rewards and penalties are not shared out
according to somebody’s views about the merits or demerits of different
people but depend on their capacity and their luck, is as important as
that, in framing legal rules, we should not be able to predict which
particular person will gain and which will lose by their application.
And this is nonetheless true, because in competition chance and good
luck are often as important as skill and foresight in determining the
fate of different people.</p>
<p>The choice open to us is not between a system in which everybody will
get what he deserves according to some absolute and universal standard
of right, and one where the individual shares are determined partly by
accident or good or ill chance, but between a system where it is the
will of a few persons that decides who is to get what, and one where it
depends at least partly on the ability and enterprise of the people
concerned and partly on unforeseeable circumstances. This is no less
relevant because in a system of free enterprise chances are not equal,
since such a system is necessarily based on private property and (though
perhaps not with the same necessity) on inheritance, with the
differences in opportunity which these create. There is, indeed, a
strong case for reducing this inequality of opportunity as far as
congenital differences permit and as it is possible to do so without
destroying the impersonal character of the process by which everybody
has to take his chance and no person’s view about what is right and
desirable overrules that of others.</p>
<p>The fact that the opportunities open to the poor in a competitive
society are much more restricted than those open to the rich does not
make it less true that in such a society the poor are much more free
than a person commanding much greater material comfort in a different
type of society. Although under competition the probability that a man
who starts poor will reach great wealth is much smaller than is true of
the man who has inherited property, it is not only possible for the
former, but the competitive system is the only one where it depends
solely on him and not on the favors of the mighty, and where nobody can
prevent a man from attempting to achieve this result. It is only because
we have forgotten what unfreedom means that we often overlook the patent
fact that in every real sense a badly paid unskilled worker in this
country has more freedom to shape his life than many a small
entrepreneur in Germany or a much better paid engineer or manager in
Russia. Whether it is a question of changing his job or the place where
he lives, of professing certain views or of spending his leisure in a
particular manner, although sometimes the price he may have to pay for
following his inclinations may be high, and to many appear too high,
there are no absolute impediments, no dangers to bodily security and
freedom, that confine him by brute force to the task and the environment
to which a superior has assigned him.</p>
<p>That the ideal of justice of most socialists would be satisfied if
merely private income from property were abolished and the differences
between the earned incomes of different people remained what they are
now is true.2 What these people forget is that, in transferring all
property in the means of production to the state, they put the state in
a position whereby its action must in effect decide all other incomes.
The power thus given to the state and the demand that the state should
use it to “plan” means nothing else than that it should use it in full
awareness of all these effects.</p>
<p>To believe that the power which is thus conferred on the state is
merely transferred to it from others is erroneous. It is a power which
is newly created and which in a competitive society nobody possesses. So
long as property is divided among many owners, none of them acting
independently has exclusive power to determine the income and position
of particular people—nobody is tied to any one property owner except by
the fact that he may offer better terms than anybody else.</p>
<p>What our generation has forgotten is that the system of private
property is the most important guaranty of freedom, not only for those
who own property, but scarcely less for those who do not. It is only
because the control of the means of production is divided among many
people acting independently that nobody has complete power over us, that
we as individuals can decide what to do with ourselves. If all the means
of production were vested in a single hand, whether it be nominally that
of “society” as a whole or that of a dictator, whoever exercises this
control has complete power over us.</p>
<p>Who can seriously doubt that a member of a small racial or religious
minority will be freer with no property so long as fellow-members of his
community have property and are therefore able to employ him, than he
would be if private property were abolished and he became owner of a
nominal share in the communal property? Or that the power which a
multiple millionaire, who may be my neighbor and perhaps my employer,
has over me is very much less than that which the smallest fonctionnaire
possesses who wields the coercive power of the state and on whose
discretion it depends whether and how I am to be allowed to live or to
work? And who will deny that a world in which the wealthy are powerful
is still a better world than one in which only the already powerful can
acquire wealth?</p>
<p>It is pathetic, yet at the same time encouraging, to find as
prominent an old communist as Max Eastman rediscovering this truth:</p>
<p>“It seems obvious to me now—though I have been slow, I must say, in
coming to the conclusion—that the institution of private property is one
of the main things that have given man that limited amount of
free-and-equalness that Marx hoped to render infinite by abolishing this
institution. Strangely enough Marx was the first to see this. He is the
one who informed us, looking backwards, that the evolution of private
capitalism with its free market had been a precondition for the
evolution of all our democratic freedoms. It never occurred to him,
looking forward, that if this was so, these other freedoms might
disappear with the abolition of the free market.”3</p>
<p>It is sometimes said, in answer to such apprehensions, that there is
no reason why the planner should determine the incomes of individuals.
The social and political difficulties involved in deciding the shares of
different people in the national income are so obvious that even the
most inveterate planner may well hesitate before he charges any
authority with this task. Probably everybody who realizes what it
involves would prefer to confine planning to production, to use it only
to secure a “rational organization of industry,” leaving the
distribution of incomes as far as possible to impersonal forces.
Although it is impossible to direct industry without exercising some
influence on distribution, and although no planner will wish to leave
distribution entirely to the forces of the market, they would probably
all prefer to confine themselves to seeing that this distribution
conforms to certain general rules of equity and fairness, that extreme
inequalities are avoided, and that the relation between the remuneration
of the major classes is just, without undertaking the responsibility for
the position of particular people within their class or for the
gradations and differentiations between smaller groups and
individuals.</p>
<p>We have already seen that the close interdependence of all economic
phenomena makes it difficult to stop planning just where we wish and
that, once the free working of the market is impeded beyond a certain
degree, the planner will be forced to extend his controls until they
become all-comprehensive. These economic considerations, which explain
why it is impossible to stop deliberate control just where we should
wish, are strongly reinforced by certain social or political tendencies
whose strength makes itself increasingly felt as planning extends.</p>
<p>Once it becomes increasingly true, and is generally recognized, that
the position of the individual is determined not by impersonal forces,
not as a result of the competitive effort of many, but by the deliberate
decision of authority, the attitude of the people toward their position
in the social order necessarily changes. There will always exist
inequalities which will appear unjust to those who suffer from them,
disappointments which will appear unmerited, and strokes of misfortune
which those hit have not deserved. But when these things occur in a
society which is consciously directed, the way in which people will
react will be very different from what it is when they are nobody’s
conscious choice.</p>
<p>Inequality is undoubtedly more readily borne, and affects the dignity
of the person much less, if it is determined by impersonal forces than
when it is due to design. In a competitive society it is no slight to a
person, no offense to his dignity, to be told by any particular firm
that it has no need for his services or that it cannot offer him a
better job. It is true that in periods of prolonged mass unemployment
the effect on many may be very similar. But there are other and better
methods to prevent that scourge than central direction. But the
unemployment or the loss of income which will always affect some in any
society is certainly less degrading if it is the result of misfortune
and not deliberately imposed by authority. However bitter the
experience, it would be very much worse in a planned society. There
individuals will have to decide not whether a person is needed for a
particular job but whether he is of use for anything, and how useful he
is. His position in life must be assigned to him by somebody else.</p>
<p>While people will submit to suffering which may hit anyone, they will
not so easily submit to suffering which is the result of the decision of
authority. It may be bad to be just a cog in an impersonal machine; but
it is infinitely worse if we can no longer leave it, if we are tied to
our place and to the superiors who have been chosen for us.
Dissatisfaction of everybody with his lot will inevitably grow with the
consciousness that it is the result of deliberate human decision.</p>
<p>Once government has embarked upon planning for the sake of justice,
it cannot refuse responsibility for anybody’s fate or position. In a
planned society we shall all know that we are better or worse off than
others, not because of circumstances which nobody controls, and which it
is impossible to foresee with certainty, but because some authority
wills it. And all our efforts directed toward improving our position
will have to aim, not at foreseeing and preparing as well as we can for
the circumstances over which we have no control, but at influencing in
our favor the authority which has all the power. The nightmare of
English nineteenth-century political thinkers, the state in which “no
avenue to wealth and honor would exist save through the government,”4
would be realized in a completeness which they never imagined—though
familiar enough in some countries which have since passed to
totalitarianism.</p>
<p>As soon as the state takes upon itself the task of planning the whole
economic life, the problem of the due station of the different
individuals and groups must indeed inevitably become the central
political problem. As the coercive power of the state will alone decide
who is to have what, the only power worth having will be a share in the
exercise of this directing power. There will be no economic or social
questions that would not be political questions in the sense that their
solution will depend exclusively on who wields the coercive power, on
whose are the views that will prevail on all occasions.</p>
<p>I believe it was Lenin himself who introduced to Russia the famous
phrase “who, whom?”—during the early years of Soviet rule the byword in
which the people summed up the universal problem of a socialist
society.5 Who plans whom, who directs and dominates whom, who assigns to
other people their station in life, and who is to have his due allotted
by others? These become necessarily the central issues to be decided
solely by the supreme power.</p>
<p>More recently an American student of politics has enlarged upon
Lenin’s phrase and asserted that the problem of all government is “who
gets what, when, and how.”6 In a way this is not untrue. That all
government affects the relative position of different people and that
there is under any system scarcely an aspect of our lives which may not
be affected by government action is certainly true. In so far as
government does anything at all, its action will always have some effect
on “who gets what, when, and how.”</p>
<p>There are, however, two fundamental distinctions to be made. First,
particular measures may be taken without the possibility of knowing how
they will affect particular individuals and therefore without aiming at
such particular effects. This point we have already discussed. Second,
it is the extent of the activities of the government which decides
whether everything that any person gets any time depends on the
government, or whether its influence is confined to whether some people
will get some things in some way at some time. Here lies the whole
difference between a free and a totalitarian system.</p>
<p>The contrast between a liberal and a totally planned system is
characteristically illustrated by the common complaints of Nazis and
socialists of the “artificial separations of economics and politics” and
by their equally common demand for the dominance of politics over
economics. These phrases presumably mean not only that economic forces
are now allowed to work for ends which are not part of the policy of the
government but also that economic power can be used independently of
government direction and for ends of which the government may not
approve. But the alternative is not merely that there should be only one
power but that this single power, the ruling group, should have control
over all human ends and particularly that it should have complete power
over the position of each individual in society.</p>
<p>That a government which undertakes to direct economic activity will
have to use its power to realize somebody’s ideal of distributive
justice is certain. But how can and how will it use that power? By what
principles will it or ought it to be guided? Is there a definite answer
to the innumerable questions of relative merits that will arise and that
will have to be solved deliberately? Is there a scale of values, on
which reasonable people can be expected to agree, which would justify a
new hierarchical order of society and is likely to satisfy the demands
for justice?</p>
<p>There is only one general principle, one simple rule which would
indeed provide a definite answer to all these questions: equality,
complete and absolute equality of all individuals in all those points
which are subject to human control. If this were generally regarded as
desirable (quite apart from the question whether it would be
practicable, i.e., whether it would provide adequate incentives), it
would give the vague idea of distributive justice a clear meaning and
would give the planner definite guidance. But nothing is further from
the truth than that people in general regard mechanical equality of this
kind as desirable. No socialist movement which aimed at complete
equality has ever gained substantial support. What socialism promised
was not an absolutely equal, but a more just and more equal,
distribution. Not equality in the absolute sense but “greater equality”
is the only goal which is seriously aimed at.</p>
<p>Though these two ideals sound very similar, they are as different as
possible as far as our problem is concerned. While absolute equality
would clearly determine the planner’s task, the desire for greater
equality is merely negative, no more than an expression of dislike of
the present state of affairs; and so long as we are not prepared to say
that every move in the direction toward complete equality is desirable,
it answers scarcely any of the questions the planner will have to
decide.</p>
<p>This is not a quibble about words. We face here a crucial issue which
the similarity of the terms used is likely to conceal. While agreement
on complete equality would answer all the problems of merit the planner
must answer, the formula of the approach to greater equality answers
practically none. Its content is hardly more definite than the phrases
“common good” or “social welfare.” It does not free us from the
necessity of deciding in every particular instance between the merits of
particular individuals or groups, and it gives us no help in that
decision. All it tells us in effect is to take from the rich as much as
we can. But, when it comes to the distribution of the spoils, the
problem is the same as if the formula of “greater equality” had never
been conceived.</p>
<p>Most people find it difficult to admit that we do not possess moral
standards which would enable us to settle these questions—if not
perfectly, at least to greater general satisfaction than is done by the
competitive system. Have we not all some idea of what is a “just price”
or a “fair wage”? Can we not rely on the strong sense of fairness of the
people? And even if we do not now agree fully on what is just or fair in
a particular case, would popular ideas not soon consolidate into more
definite standards if people were given an opportunity to see their
ideals realized?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is little ground for such hopes. What standards
we have are derived from the competitive regime we have known and would
necessarily disappear soon after the disappearance of competition. What
we mean by a just price, or a fair wage is either the customary price or
wage, the return which past experience has made people expect, or the
price or wage that would exist if there were no monopolistic
exploitation. The only important exception to this used to be the claim
of the workers to the “full produce of their labor,” to which so much of
socialist doctrine traces back. But there are few socialists today who
believe that in a socialist society the output of each industry would be
entirely shared by the workers of that industry; for this would mean
that workers in industries using a great deal of capital would have a
much larger income than those in industries using little capital, which
most socialists would regard as very unjust. And it is now fairly
generally agreed that this particular claim was based on an erroneous
interpretation of the facts. But once the claim of the individual worker
to the whole of “his” product is disallowed, and the whole of the return
from capital is to be divided among all workers, the problem of how to
divide it raises the same basic issue.</p>
<p>What the “just price” of a particular commodity or the “fair”
remuneration for a particular service is might conceivably be determined
objectively if the quantities needed were independently fixed. If these
were given irrespective of cost, the planner might try to find what
price or wage is necessary to bring forth this supply. But the planner
must also decide how much is to be produced of each kind of goods, and,
in so doing, he determines what will be the just price or fair wage to
pay. If the planner decides that fewer architects or watchmakers are
wanted and that the need can be met by those who are willing to stay in
the trade at a lower remuneration, the “fair” wage will be lower. In
deciding the relative importance of the different ends, the planner also
decides the relative importance of the different groups and persons. As
he is not supposed to treat the people merely as a means, he must take
account of these effects and consciously balance the importance of the
different ends against the effects of his decision. This means, however,
that he will necessarily exercise direct control over the conditions of
the different people.</p>
<p>This applies to the relative position of individuals no less than to
that of the different occupational groups. We are in general far too
likely to think of incomes within a given trade or profession as more or
less uniform. But the differences between the incomes, not only of the
most and the least successful doctor or architect, writer or movie
actor, boxer or jockey, but also of the more and the less successful
plumber or market gardener, grocer or tailor, are as great as those
between the propertied and the propertyless classes. And although, no
doubt, there would be some attempt at standardization by creating
categories, the necessity of discrimination between individuals would
remain the same, whether it were exercised by fixing their individual
incomes or by allocating them to particular categories.</p>
<p>We need say no more about the likelihood of men in a free society
submitting to such control—or about their remaining free if they
submitted. On the whole question, what John Stuart Mill wrote nearly a
hundred years ago remains equally true today:</p>
<p>“A fixed rule, like that of equality, might be acquiesced in, and so
might chance, or an external necessity; but that a handful of human
beings should weigh everybody in the balance, and give more to one and
less to another at their sole pleasure and judgment, would not be borne
unless from persons believed to be more than men, and backed by
supernatural terrors.”7</p>
<p>These difficulties need not lead to open clashes so long as socialism
is merely the aspiration of a limited and fairly homogeneous group. They
come to the surface only when a socialist policy is actually attempted
with the support of the many different groups which together compose the
majority of a people. Then it soon becomes the one burning question
which of the different sets of ideals shall be imposed upon all by
making the whole resources of the country serve it. It is because
successful planning requires the creation of a common view on the
essential values that the restriction of our freedom with regard to
material things touches so directly on our spiritual freedom.</p>
<p>Socialists, the cultivated parents of the barbarous offspring they
have produced, traditionally hope to solve this problem by education.
But what does education mean in this respect? Surely we have learned
that knowledge cannot create new ethical values, that no amount of
learning will lead people to hold the same views on the moral issues
which a conscious ordering of all social relations raises. It is not
rational conviction but the acceptance of a creed which is required to
justify a particular plan. And, indeed, socialists everywhere were the
first to recognize that the task they had set themselves required the
general acceptance of a common Weltanschauung, of a definite set of
values. It was in these efforts to produce a mass movement supported by
such a single world view that the socialists first created most of the
instruments of indoctrination of which Nazis and Fascists have made such
effective use.</p>
<p>In Germany and Italy the Nazis and Fascists did, indeed, not have
much to invent. The usages of the new political movements which pervaded
all aspects of life had in both countries already been introduced by the
socialists. The idea of a political party which embraces all activities
of the individual from the cradle to the grave, which claims to guide
his views on everything, and which delights in making all problems
questions of party Weltanschauung, was first put into practice by the
socialists. An Austrian socialist writer, speaking of the socialist
movement of his country, reports with pride that it was its
“characteristic feature that it created special organizations for every
field of activities of workers and employees.”8</p>
<p>Though the Austrian socialists may have gone further in this respect
than others, the situation was not very different elsewhere. It was not
the Fascists but the socialists who began to collect children from the
tenderest age into political organizations to make sure that they grew
up as good proletarians. It was not the Fascists but the socialists who
first thought of organizing sports and games, football and hiking, in
party clubs where the members would not be infected by other views. It
was the socialists who first insisted that the party member should
distinguish himself from others by the modes of greeting and the forms
of address. It was they who by their organization of “cells” and devices
for the permanent supervision of private life created the prototype of
the totalitarian party. Balilla and Hitlerjugend, Dopolavoro and Kraft
durch Freude, political uniforms and military party formations, are all
little more than imitations of older socialist institutions.9</p>
<p>So long as the socialist movement in a country is closely bound up
with the interests of a particular group, usually the more highly
skilled industrial workers, the problem of creating a common view on the
desirable status of the different members of society is comparatively
simple. The movement is immediately concerned with the status of one
particular group, and its aim is to raise that status relatively to
other groups. The character of the problem changes, however, as in the
course of the progressive advance toward socialism it becomes more and
more evident to everyone that his income and general position are
determined by the coercive apparatus of the state, that he can maintain
or improve his position only as a member of an organized group capable
of influencing or controlling the state machine in his interest.</p>
<p>In the tug-of-war between the various pressure groups which arises at
this stage, it is by no means necessary that the interests of the
poorest and most numerous groups should prevail. Nor is it necessarily
an advantage for the older socialist parties, who avowedly represented
the interests of a particular group, to have been the first in the field
and to have designed their whole ideology to appeal to the manual
workers in industry. Their very success, and their insistence on the
acceptance of the whole creed, is bound to create a powerful
countermovement— not by the capitalists but by the very large and
equally propertyless classes who find their relative status threatened
by the advance of the élite of the industrial workers.</p>
<p>Socialist theory and socialist tactics, even where they have not been
dominated by Marxist dogma, have been based everywhere on the idea of a
division of society into two classes with common but mutually
conflicting interests: capitalists and industrial workers. Socialism
counted on a rapid disappearance of the old middle class and completely
disregarded the rise of a new middle class, the countless army of clerks
and typists, administrative workers and schoolteachers, tradesmen and
small officials, and the lower ranks of the professions. For a time
these classes often provided many of the leaders of the labor movement.
But as it became increasingly clear that the position of those classes
was deteriorating relatively to that of the industrial workers, the
ideals which guided the latter lost much of their appeal to the others.
While they were all socialists in the sense that they disliked the
capitalist system and wanted a deliberate sharing-out of wealth
according to their ideas of justice, these ideas proved to be very
different from those embodied in the practice of the older socialist
parties.</p>
<p>The means which the old socialist parties had successfully employed
to secure the support of one occupational group—the raising of their
relative economic position—cannot be used to secure the support of all.
There are bound to arise rival socialist movements that appeal to the
support of those whose relative position is worsened. There is a great
deal of truth in the often heard statement that fascism and National
Socialism are a sort of middle-class socialism— only that in Italy and
Germany the supporters of these new movements were economically hardly a
middle class any longer. It was to a large extent a revolt of a new
underprivileged class against the labor aristocracy which the industrial
labor movement had created.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that no single economic factor has
contributed more to help these movements than the envy of the
unsuccessful professional man, the university-trained engineer or
lawyer, and of the “white-collared proletariat” in general, of the
engine driver or compositor and other members of the strongest
trade-unions whose income was many times theirs. Nor can there be much
doubt that in terms of money income the average member of the rank and
file of the Nazi movement in its early years was poorer than the average
trade-unionist or member of the older socialist party—a circumstance
which only gained poignancy from the fact that the former had often seen
better days and were frequently still living in surroundings which were
the result of this past.</p>
<p>The expression “class struggle à rebours,” current in Italy at the
time of the rise of fascism, did point to a very important aspect of the
movement. The conflict between the Fascist or National Socialist and the
older socialist parties must, indeed, very largely be regarded as the
kind of conflict which is bound to arise between rival socialist
factions. There was no difference between them about the question of its
being the will of the state which should assign to each person his
proper place in society. But there were, as there always will be, most
profound differences about what are the proper places of the different
classes and groups.</p>
<p>The old socialist leaders, who had always regarded their parties as
the natural spearhead of the future general movement toward socialism,
found it difficult to understand that with every extension in the use of
socialist methods the resentment of large poor classes should turn
against them. But while the old socialist parties, or the organized
labor in particular industries, had usually not found it unduly
difficult to come to an understanding for joint action with the
employers in their particular industries, very large classes were left
out in the cold. To them, and not without some justification, the more
prosperous sections of the labor movement seemed to belong to the
exploiting rather than to the exploited class.10</p>
<p>The resentment of the lower middle class, from which fascism and
National Socialism recruited so large a proportion of their supporters,
was intensified by the fact that their education and training had in
many instances made them aspire to directing positions and that they
regarded themselves as entitled to be members of the directing class.
While the younger generation, out of that contempt for profit-making
fostered by socialist teaching, spurned independent positions which
involved risk and flocked in ever increasing numbers into salaried
positions which promised security, they demanded a place yielding them
the income and power to which in their opinion their training entitled
them. While they believed in an organized society, they expected a place
in that society very different from that which society ruled by labor
seemed to offer. They were quite ready to take over the methods of the
older socialism but intended to employ them in the service of a
different class. The movement was able to attract all those who, while
they agreed on the desirability of the state controlling all economic
activity, disagreed with the ends for which the aristocracy of the
industrial workers used their political strength.</p>
<p>The new socialist movement started with several tactical advantages.
Labor socialism had grown in a democratic and liberal world, adapting
its tactics to it and taking over many of the ideals of liberalism. Its
protagonists still believed that the creation of socialism as such would
solve all problems. Fascism and National Socialism, on the other hand,
grew out of the experience of an increasingly regulated society’s
awakening to the fact that democratic and international socialism was
aiming at incompatible ideals. Their tactics were developed in a world
already dominated by socialist policy and the problems it creates. They
had no illusions about the possibility of a democratic solution of
problems which require more agreement among people than can reasonably
be expected. They had no illusions about the capacity of reason to
decide all the questions of the relative importance of the wants of
different men or groups which planning inevitably raises, or about the
formula of equality providing an answer. They knew that the strongest
group which rallied enough supporters in favor of a new hierarchical
order of society, and which frankly promised privileges to the classes
to which it appealed, was likely to obtain the support of all those who
were disappointed because they had been promised equality but found that
they had merely furthered the interest of a particular class. Above all,
they were successful because they offered a theory, or Weltanschauung,
which seemed to justify the privileges they promised to their
supporters.</p>

<p>2 It is probable that we habitually overestimate the extent to which
inequality of incomes is mainly caused by income derived from property,
and therefore the extent to which the major inequalities would be
abolished by abolishing income from property. What little information we
have about the distribution of incomes in Soviet Russia does not suggest
that the inequalities are substantially smaller there than in a
capitalist society. Max Eastman, in The End of Socialism in Russia
(Boston: Little, Brown, 1937), pp. 30–34, gives some information from
official Russian sources which suggest that the difference between the
highest and the lowest salaries paid in Russia is of the same order of
magnitude (about 50 to 1) as in the United States; and Leon Trotsky,
according to an article quoted by James Burnham, The Managerial
Revolution: What Is Happening in the World (New York: John Day Co.,
1941), p. 46, estimated as late as 1939 that “the upper 11 or 12 per
cent of the Soviet population now receives approximately 50 per cent of
the national income. This differentiation is sharper than in the United
States, where the upper 10 per cent of the population receives
approximately 35 per cent of the national income.” (In the original,
Hayek incorrectly listed the passage from Trotsky as appearing on page
43, not 46, of Burnham’s book. —Ed.)</p>
<p>3 Max Eastman, “Socialism Doesn’t Jibe with Human Nature,” Reader’s
Digest, vol. 38, June 1941, p. 47. (Hayek’s original citation, “Max
Eastman in the Reader’s Digest, July, 1941, p. 39” got both the issue
and page number wrong, and Hayek neglected to hyphenate
“free-and-equalness” as Eastman had done. —Ed.)</p>
<p>4 The actual words are those of the young Disraeli. (The actual
quotation reads, “no public avenues to wealth and honor would subsist
save through the Government.” It is taken from Tory politician and
novelist Benjamin Disraeli’s (1804–1881) essay, “Vindication of the
English Constitution in a Letter to a Noble and Learned Lord” (1835),
reprinted in Benjamin Disraeli, Disraeli on Whigs and Whiggism,
ed. William Hutcheon (New York: Macmillan, 1914), p. 216, a work that
established “the young Disraeli” as a political writer and thinker. He
used the essay to attack Utilitarians and others who would “form
political institutions on abstract principles of theoretic science,
instead of permitting them to spring from the natural course of events,
and to be naturally created by the necessities of nations” (p. 119). His
criticisms of those who would “abrogate the clumsy and chance-born
institutions of England, and substitute in their place their own modish
inventions, formed on the irrefragable basis of Reason and Utility”
(p. 134) bring to mind Hayek’s later criticisms of “rationalist
constructivism.” —Ed.)</p>

<p>9 The political “book clubs” in England provide a not unimportant
parallel. (Balilla was the Italian Fascist organization for boys, named
after the boy who started the insurrection that drove the Austrians out
of Genoa in 1746. The Hitlerjugend, or Hitler Youth, was the
organization for the indoctrination of the young in Germany. Dopolavoro
(from dopo lavoro, Italian for “after work”), was the Italian Fascist
recreational program, which included sports, cultural, and tourist
events. Its German counterpart was Kraft durch Freude (Strength through
Joy). Founded in 1933 within the German Labor Front and modeled after
Dopolavoro, it was designed to win the working classes to National
Socialism, which was particularly important after the trade unions were
abolished. —Ed.)</p>
<p>10 It is now twelve years since one of the leading European socialist
intellectuals, Hendrik de Man (who has since consistently developed
further and made his peace with the Nazis), observed that “for the first
time since the beginning of socialism, anti-capitalist resentments are
turning against the socialist movement,” in Sozialismus und
Nationalfascismus (Potsdam: A. Protte, 1931), p. 6. (Hendrik de Man
(1885–1953) was chairman of the Belgian Socialist party. When Germany
invaded in 1940 he disbanded the party and declared that the destruction
of parliamentary democracy under the “New Order” imposed by the Nazis
would help free the working classes. He was tried and convicted in
absentia of collaboration in Belgium in 1946; he spent the remainder of
his days in Switzerland. —Ed.)</p>
