<h4 id="four">FOUR</h4>
<p>THE “INEVITABILITY” OF PLANNING</p>
<p>We were the first to assert that the more complicated the forms
assumed by civilization, the more restricted the freedom of the
individual must become.</p>
<p>—Benito Mussolini1</p>
<p>It is a revealing fact that few planners are content to say that
central planning is desirable. Most of them affirm that we can no longer
choose but are compelled by circumstances beyond our control to
substitute planning for competition. The myth is deliberately cultivated
that we are embarking on the new course not out of free will but because
competition is spontaneously eliminated by technological changes which
we neither can reverse nor should wish to prevent. This argument is
rarely developed at any length—it is one of the assertions taken over by
one writer from another until, by mere iteration, it has come to be
accepted as an established fact. It is, nevertheless, devoid of
foundation. The tendency toward monopoly and planning is not the result
of any “objective facts” beyond our control but the product of opinions
fostered and propagated for half a century until they have come to
dominate all our policy.</p>
<p>Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of
planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes
have made competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of
fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of
production by private monopolies and direction by the government. This
belief derives mainly from the Marxist doctrine of the “concentration of
industry,” although, like so many Marxist ideas, it is now found in many
circles which have received it at third or fourth hand and do not know
whence it derives.</p>
<p>The historical fact of the progressive growth of monopoly during the
last fifty years and the increasing restriction of the field in which
competition rules is, of course, not disputed—although the extent of the
phenomenon is often greatly exaggerated.2 The important question is
whether this development is a necessary consequence of the advance of
technology or whether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in
most countries. We shall presently see that the actual history of this
development strongly suggests the latter. But we must first consider in
how far modern technological developments are of such a kind as to make
the growth of monopolies in wide fields inevitable.</p>
<p>The alleged technological cause of the growth of monopoly is the
superiority of the large firm over the small, owing to the greater
efficiency of modern methods of mass production. Modern methods, it is
asserted, have created conditions in the majority of industries where
the production of the large firm can be increased at decreasing costs
per unit, with the result that the large firms are everywhere
underbidding and driving out the small ones; this process must go on
until in each industry only one or at most a few giant firms are left.
This argument singles out one effect sometimes accompanying
technological progress; it disregards others which work in the opposite
direction; and it receives little support from a serious study of the
facts. We cannot here investigate this question in detail and must be
content to accept the best evidence available. The most comprehensive
study of the facts undertaken in recent times is that by the Temporary
National Economic Committee on the Concentration of Economic Power. The
final report of this committee (which certainly cannot be accused of an
undue liberal bias) arrives at the conclusion that the view according to
which the greater efficiency of large-scale production is the cause of
the disappearance of competition “finds scant support in any evidence
that is now at hand.”3 And the detailed monograph on the question which
was prepared for the committee sums up the answer in this statement:</p>
<p>“The superior efficiency of large establishments has not been
demonstrated; the advantages that are supposed to destroy competition
have failed to manifest themselves in many fields. Nor do the economies
of size, where they exist, invariably necessitate monopoly. . . . The
size or the sizes of the optimum efficiency may be reached long before
the major part of a supply is subjected to such control. The conclusions
that the advantage of large-scale production must lead inevitably to the
abolition of competition cannot be accepted. It should be noted,
moreover, that monopoly is frequently the product of factors other than
the lower costs of greater size. It is attained through collusive
agreement and promoted by public policies. When these agreements are
invalidated and when these policies are reversed, competitive conditions
can be restored.”4</p>
<p>An investigation of conditions in England would lead to very similar
results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring monopolists regularly seek
and frequently obtain the assistance of the power of the state to make
their control effective can have little doubt that there is nothing
inevitable about this development.</p>
<p>This conclusion is strongly supported by the historical order in
which the decline of competition and the growth of monopoly manifested
themselves in different countries. If they were the result of
technological developments or a necessary product of the evolution of
“capitalism,” we should expect them to appear first in the countries
with the most advanced economic system. In fact, they appeared first
during the last third of the nineteenth century in what were then
comparatively young industrial countries, the United States and Germany.
In the latter country especially, which came to be regarded as the model
country typifying the necessary evolution of capitalism, the growth of
cartels and syndicates has since 1878 been systematically fostered by
deliberate policy. Not only the instrument of protection but direct
inducements and ultimately compulsion were used by the governments to
further the creation of monopolies for the regulation of prices and
sales. It was here that, with the help of the state, the first great
experiment in “scientific planning” and “conscious organization of
industry” led to the creation of giant monopolies, which were
represented as inevitable growths fifty years before the same was done
in Great Britain. It is largely due to the influence of German socialist
theoreticians, particularly Sombart, generalizing from the experience of
their country, that the inevitable development of the competitive system
into “monopoly capitalism” became widely accepted.5 That in the United
States a highly protectionist policy made a somewhat similar development
possible seemed to confirm this generalization. The development of
Germany, however, more than that of the United States, came to be
regarded as representative of a universal tendency; and it became a
commonplace to speak—to quote a widely read political essay of recent
date—of “Germany where all the social and political forces of modern
civilization have reached their most advanced form.”6</p>
<p>How little there was of inevitability in all this, and how much is
the result of deliberate policy, becomes clear when we consider the
position in England until 1931 and the development since that year in
which Great Britain also embarked upon a policy of general protection.7
It is only a dozen years since, except for a few industries which had
obtained protection earlier, British industry was on the whole as
competitive as, perhaps, at any time in its history. And, although
during the 1920s it suffered severely from incompatible policies
followed with regard to wages and to money, at least the years up to
1929 compare with regard to employment and general activity not
unfavorably with the 1930s. It is only since the transition to
protection and the general change in British economic policy
accompanying it that the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an
amazing rate and has transformed British industry to an extent the
public has scarcely yet realized. To argue that this development has
anything to do with the technological progress during this period, that
technological necessities which in Germany operated in the 1880s and
1890s, made themselves felt here in the 1930s, is not much less absurd
than the claim, implied in a statement of Mussolini, that Italy had to
abolish individual freedom before other European people because its
civilization had marched so far in advance of the rest!</p>
<p>In so far as England is concerned, the thesis that the change in
opinion and policy merely follows an inexorable change in the facts can
be given a certain appearance of truth, just because the nation has
followed at a distance the intellectual developments elsewhere. It could
thus be argued that monopolistic organization of industry grew up in
spite of the fact that public opinion still favored competition but that
outside events frustrated their wishes. The true relation between theory
and practice becomes, however, clear as soon as we look to the prototype
of this development—Germany. That there the suppression of competition
was a matter of deliberate policy, that it was undertaken in the service
of the ideal which we now call planning, there can be no doubt. In the
progressive advance toward a completely planned society the Germans, and
all the people who are imitating their example, are merely following the
course which nineteenth-century thinkers, particularly Germans, have
mapped out for them. The intellectual history of the last sixty or
eighty years is indeed a perfect illustration of the truth that in
social evolution nothing is inevitable but thinking makes it so.</p>
<p>The assertion that modern technological progress makes planning
inevitable can also be interpreted in a different manner. It may mean
that the complexity of our modern industrial civilization creates new
problems with which we cannot hope to deal effectively except by central
planning. In a sense this is true— yet not in the wide sense in which it
is claimed. It is, for example, a commonplace that many of the problems
created by a modern town, like many other problems caused by close
contiguity in space, are not adequately solved by competition. But it is
not these problems, like those of the “public utilities,” etc., which
are uppermost in the minds of those who invoke the complexity of modern
civilization as an argument for central planning. What they generally
suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining a coherent
picture of the complete economic process makes it indispensable that
things should be coordinated by some central agency if social life is
not to dissolve in chaos.</p>
<p>This argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the working
of competition. Far from being appropriate only to comparatively simple
conditions, it is the very complexity of the division of labor under
modern conditions which makes competition the only method by which such
coordination can be adequately brought about. There would be no
difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple
that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant
facts. It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account
become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them
that decentralization becomes imperative. But, once decentralization is
necessary, the problem of coordination arises—a coordination which
leaves the separate agencies free to adjust their activities to the
facts which only they can know and yet brings about a mutual adjustment
of their respective plans. As decentralization has become necessary
because nobody can consciously balance all the considerations bearing on
the decisions of so many individuals, the coordination can clearly be
effected not by “conscious control” but only by arrangements which
convey to each agent the information he must possess in order
effectively to adjust his decisions to those of others. And because all
the details of the changes constantly affecting the conditions of demand
and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or
quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one center, what is
required is some apparatus of registration which automatically records
all the relevant effects of individual actions and whose indications are
at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual
decisions.</p>
<p>This is precisely what the price system does under competition, and
which no other system even promises to accomplish. It enables
entrepreneurs, by watching the movement of comparatively few prices, as
an engineer watches the hands of a few dials, to adjust their activities
to those of their fellows. The important point here is that the price
system will fulfill this function only if competition prevails, that is,
if the individual producer has to adapt himself to price changes and
cannot control them. The more complicated the whole, the more dependent
we become on that division of knowledge between individuals whose
separate efforts are coordinated by the impersonal mechanism for
transmitting the relevant information known by us as the price
system.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that if we had had to rely on conscious
central planning for the growth of our industrial system, it would never
have reached the degree of differentiation, complexity, and flexibility
it has attained. Compared with this method of solving the economic
problem by means of decentralization plus automatic coordination, the
more obvious method of central direction is incredibly clumsy,
primitive, and limited in scope. That the division of labor has reached
the extent which makes modern civilization possible we owe to the fact
that it did not have to be consciously created but that man tumbled on a
method by which the division of labor could be extended far beyond the
limits within which it could have been planned. Any further growth of
its complexity, therefore, far from making central direction more
necessary, makes it more important than ever that we should use a
technique which does not depend on conscious control.</p>
<p>There is yet another theory which connects the growth of monopolies
with technological progress, and which uses arguments almost opposite to
those we have just considered; though not often clearly stated, it has
also exercised considerable influence. It contends not that modern
technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be
impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities
unless protection against competition is granted, i.e., a monopoly is
conferred. This type of argument is not necessarily fraudulent, as the
critical reader will perhaps suspect: the obvious answer— that if a new
technique for satisfying our wants is really better, it ought to be able
to stand up against all competition—does not dispose of all instances to
which this argument refers. No doubt in many cases it is used merely as
a form of special pleading by interested parties. Even more often it is
probably based on a confusion between technical excellence from a narrow
engineering point of view and desirability from the point of view of
society as a whole.</p>
<p>There remains, however, a group of instances where the argument has
some force. It is, for example, at least conceivable that the British
automobile industry might be able to supply a car cheaper and better
than cars used to be in the United States if everyone in England were
made to use the same kind of car or that the use of electricity for all
purposes could be made cheaper than coal or gas if everybody could be
made to use only electricity. In instances like these it is at least
possible that we might all be better off and should prefer the new
situation if we had the choice—but that no individual ever gets the
choice, because the alternative is either that we should all use the
same cheap car (or all should use only electricity) or that we should
have the choice between these things with each of them at a much higher
price. I do not know whether this is true in either of the instances
given. But it must be admitted that it is possible that, by compulsory
standardization or the prohibition of variety beyond a certain degree,
abundance might be increased in some fields more than sufficiently to
compensate for the restriction of the choice of the consumer. It is even
conceivable that a new invention may be made some day whose adoption
would seem unquestionably beneficial but which could be used only if
many or all people were made to avail themselves of it at the same
time.</p>
<p>Whether such instances are of any great or lasting importance, they
are certainly not instances where it could be legitimately claimed that
technical progress makes central direction inevitable. They would merely
make it necessary to choose between gaining a particular advantage by
compulsion and not obtaining it—or, in most instances, obtaining it a
little later, when further technical advance has overcome the particular
difficulties. It is true that in such situations we may have to
sacrifice a possible immediate gain as the price of our freedom—but we
avoid, on the other hand, the necessity of making future developments
dependent upon the knowledge which particular people now possess. By
sacrificing such possible present advantages, we preserve an important
stimulus to further progress. Though in the short run the price we have
to pay for variety and freedom of choice may sometimes be high, in the
long run even material progress will depend on this very variety,
because we can never predict from which of the many forms in which a
good or service can be provided something better may develop. It cannot,
of course, be asserted that the preservation of freedom at the expense
of some addition to our present material comfort will be thus rewarded
in all instances. But the argument for freedom is precisely that we
ought to leave room for the unforeseeable free growth. It applies,
therefore, no less when, on the basis of our present knowledge,
compulsion would seem to bring only advantages, and although in a
particular instance it may actually do no harm.</p>
<p>In much of the current discussion on the effects of technological
progress this progress is presented to us as if it were something
outside us which could compel us to use the new knowledge in a
particular way. While it is true, of course, that inventions have given
us tremendous power, it is absurd to suggest that we must use this power
to destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty. It does mean,
however, that if we want to preserve it, we must guard it more jealously
than ever and that we must be prepared to make sacrifices for it. While
there is nothing in modern technological developments which forces us
toward comprehensive economic planning, there is a great deal in them
which makes infinitely more dangerous the power a planning authority
would possess.</p>
<p>While there can thus be little doubt that the movement toward
planning is the result of deliberate action and that there are no
external necessities which force us to it, it is worth inquiring why so
large a proportion of the technical experts should be found in the front
rank of the planners. The explanation of this phenomenon is closely
connected with an important fact which the critics of the planners
should always keep in mind: that there is little question that almost
every one of the technical ideals of our experts could be realized
within a comparatively short time if to achieve them were made the sole
aim of humanity. There is an infinite number of good things, which we
all agree are highly desirable as well as possible, but of which we
cannot hope to achieve more than a few within our lifetime, or which we
can hope to achieve only very imperfectly. It is the frustration of his
ambitions in his own field which makes the specialist revolt against the
existing order. We all find it difficult to bear to see things left
undone which everybody must admit are both desirable and possible. That
these things cannot all be done at the same time, that any one of them
can be achieved only at the sacrifice of others, can be seen only by
taking into account factors which fall outside any specialism, which can
be appreciated only by a painful intellectual effort—the more painful as
it forces us to see against a wider background the objects to which most
of our labors are directed and to balance them against others which lie
outside our immediate interest and for which, for that reason, we care
less.</p>
<p>Every one of the many things which, considered in isolation, it would
be possible to achieve in a planned society creates enthusiasts for
planning who feel confident that they will be able to instill into the
directors of such a society their sense of the value of the particular
objective; and the hopes of some of them would undoubtedly be fulfilled,
since a planned society would certainly further some objectives more
than is the case at present. It would be foolish to deny that the
instances of planned or semiplanned societies which we know do furnish
illustrations in point, good things which the people of these countries
owe entirely to planning. The magnificent motor roads in Germany and
Italy are an instance often quoted—even though they do not represent a
kind of planning not equally possible in a liberal society. But it is
equally foolish to quote such instances of technical excellence in
particular fields as evidence of the general superiority of planning. It
would be more correct to say that such extreme technical excellence out
of line with general conditions is evidence of a misdirection of
resources. Anyone who has driven along the famous German motor roads and
found the amount of traffic on them less than on many a secondary road
in England can have little doubt that, so far as peace purposes are
concerned, there was little justification for them. Whether it was not a
case where the planners decided in favor of “guns” instead of “butter”
is another matter.8 But by our standards there is little ground for
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The illusion of the specialist that in a planned society he would
secure more attention to the objectives for which he cares most is a
more general phenomenon than the term “specialist” at first suggests. In
our predilections and interests we are all in some measure specialists.
And we all think that our personal order of values is not merely
personal but that in a free discussion among rational people we would
convince the others that ours is the right one. The lover of the
countryside who wants above all that its traditional appearance should
be preserved and that the blots already made by industry on its fair
face should be removed, no less than the health enthusiast who wants all
the picturesque but unsanitary old cottages cleared away, or the
motorist who wishes the country cut up by big motor roads, the
efficiency fanatic who desires the maximum of specialization and
mechanization no less than the idealist who for the development of
personality wants to preserve as many independent craftsmen as possible,
all know that their aim can be fully achieved only by planning—and they
all want planning for that reason. But, of course, the adoption of the
social planning for which they clamor can only bring out the concealed
conflict between their aims.</p>
<p>The movement for planning owes its present strength largely to the
fact that, while planning is in the main still an ambition, it unites
almost all the single-minded idealists, all the men and women who have
devoted their lives to a single task. The hopes they place in planning,
however, are the result not of a comprehensive view of society but
rather of a very limited view and often the result of a great
exaggeration of the importance of the ends they place foremost. This is
not to underrate the great pragmatic value of this type of men in a free
society like ours, which makes them the subject of just admiration. But
it would make the very men who are most anxious to plan society the most
dangerous if they were allowed to do so—and the most intolerant of the
planning of others. From the saintly and single-minded idealist to the
fanatic is often but a step. Though it is the resentment of the
frustrated specialist which gives the demand for planning its strongest
impetus, there could hardly be a more unbearable— and more
irrational—world than one in which the most eminent specialists in each
field were allowed to proceed unchecked with the realization of their
ideals. Nor can “coordination,” as some planners seem to imagine, become
a new specialism. The economist is the last to claim that he has the
knowledge which the coordinator would need. His plea is for a method
which effects such coordination without the need for an omniscient
dictator. But that means precisely the retention of some such
impersonal, and often unintelligible, checks on individual efforts as
those against which all specialists chafe.</p>
