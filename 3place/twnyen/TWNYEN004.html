<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Few discoveries are more <strong>irritating</strong> than those which
expose the pedigree of ideas.</p>
<pre><code>            —Lord Acton</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Lord Acton,艾克顿公爵（英国历史学家）</li>
</ul>
<p>C.ntemporary events differ from history in that we do not know the
results they will produce. Looking back, we can assess the significance
of past occurrences and trace the consequences they have brought in
their train. But while history runs its course, it is not history to us.
It leads us into an unknown land, and but rarely can we get a glimpse of
what lies ahead. It would be different if it were given to us to live a
second time through the same events with all the knowledge of what we
have seen before. How different would things appear to us; how important
and often alarming would changes seem that we now scarcely notice! It is
probably fortunate that man can never have this experience and knows of
no laws which history must obey.</p>
<p>Yet, although history never quite repeats itself, and just because no
development is inevitable, we can in a measure learn from the past to
avoid a repetition of the same process. One need not be a prophet to be
aware of impending dangers. An accidental combination of experience and
interest will often reveal events to one man under aspects which few yet
see.</p>
<p>The following pages are the product of an experience as near as
possible to twice living through the same period—or at least twice
watching a very similar evolution of ideas. While this is an experience
one is not likely to gain in one country, it may in certain circumstance
be acquired by living in turn for long periods in different countries.
Though the influences to which the trend of thought is subject in most
civilized nations are to a large extent similar, they do not necessarily
operate at the same time or at the same speed. Thus, by moving from one
country to another, one may sometimes twice watch similar phases of
intellectual development. The senses have then become peculiarly acute.
When one hears for a second time opinions expressed or measures
advocated which one has first met twenty or twenty-five years ago, they
assume a new meaning as symptoms of a definite trend.2 They suggest, if
not the necessity, at least the probability, that developments will take
a similar course.</p>
<p>It is necessary now to state the unpalatable truth that it is Germany
whose fate we are in some danger of repeating. The danger is not
immediate, it is true, and conditions in England and the United States
are still so remote from those witnessed in recent years in Germany as
to make it difficult to believe that we are moving in the same
direction. Yet, though the road be long, it is one on which it becomes
more difficult to turn back as one advances. If in the long run we are
the makers of our own fate, in the short run we are the captives of the
ideas we have created. Only if we recognize the danger in time can we
hope to avert it.</p>
<p>It is not to the Germany of Hitler, the Germany of the present war,
that England and the United States bear yet any resemblance. But
students of the currents of ideas can hardly fail to see that there is
more than a superficial similarity between the trend of thought in
Germany during and after the last war and the present current of ideas
in the democracies. There exists now in these countries certainly the
same determination that the organization of the nation which has been
achieved for purposes of defense shall be retained for the purposes of
creation. There is the same contempt for nineteenth-century liberalism,
the same spurious “realism” and even cynicism, the same fatalistic
acceptance of “inevitable trends.” And at least nine out of every ten of
the lessons which our most vociferous reformers are so anxious we should
learn from this war are precisely the lessons which the Germans did
learn from the last war and which have done much to produce the Nazi
system. We shall have opportunity in the course of this book to show
that there are a large number of other points where at an interval of
fifteen to twenty-five years we seem to follow the example of Germany.
Although one does not like to be reminded, it is not so many years since
the socialist policy of that country was generally held up by
progressives as an example to be imitated, just as in more recent years
Sweden has been the model country to which progressive eyes were
directed. All those whose memory goes further back know how deeply for
at least a generation before the last war German thought and German
practice influenced ideals and policy in England and, to some extent, in
the United States.</p>
<p>The author has spent about half of his adult life in his native
Austria, in close touch with German intellectual life, and the other
half in the United States and England. In the latter period he has
become increasingly convinced that at least some of the forces which
have destroyed freedom in Germany are also at work here and that the
character and the source of this danger are, if possible, even less
understood than they were in Germany. The supreme tragedy is still not
seen that in Germany it was largely people of good will, men who were
admired and held up as models in the democratic countries, who prepared
the way for, if they did not actually create, the forces which now stand
for everything they detest. Yet our chance of averting a similar fate
depends on our facing the danger and on our being prepared to revise
even our most cherished hopes and ambitions if they should prove to be
the source of the danger. There are few signs yet that we have the
intellectual courage to admit to ourselves that we may have been wrong.
Few are ready to recognize that the rise of fascism and naziism was not
a reaction against the socialist trends of the preceding period but a
necessary outcome of those tendencies. This is a truth which most people
were unwilling to see even when the similarities of many of the
repellent features of the internal regimes in communist Russia and
National Socialist Germany were widely recognized. As a result, many who
think themselves infinitely superior to the aberrations of naziism, and
sincerely hate all its manifestations, work at the same time for ideals
whose realization would lead straight to the abhorred tyranny.</p>
<p>All parallels between developments in different countries are, of
course, deceptive; but I am not basing my argument mainly on such
parallels. Nor am I arguing that these developments are inevitable. If
they were, there would be no point in writing this. They can be
prevented if people realize in time where their efforts may lead. But
until recently there was little hope that any attempt to make them see
the danger would be successful. It seems, however, as if the time were
now ripe for a fuller discussion of the whole issue. Not only is the
problem now more widely recognized; there are also special reasons which
at this juncture make it imperative that we should face the issues
squarely.</p>
<p>It will, perhaps, be said that this is not the time to raise an issue
on which opinions clash sharply. But the socialism of which we speak is
not a party matter, and the questions which we are discussing have
little to do with the questions at dispute between political parties. It
does not affect our problem that some groups may want less socialism
than others; that some want socialism mainly in the interest of one
group and others in that of another. The important point is that, if we
take the people whose views influence developments, they are now in the
democracies in some measure all socialists. If it is no longer
fashionable to emphasize that “we are all socialists now,” this is so
merely because the fact is too obvious.3 Scarcely anybody doubts that we
must continue to move toward socialism, and most people are merely
trying to deflect this movement in the interest of a particular class or
group.</p>
<p>It is because nearly everybody wants it that we are moving in this
direction. There are no objective facts which make it inevitable. We
shall have to say something about the alleged inevitability of
“planning” later. The main question is where this movement will lead us.
Is it not possible that if the people whose convictions now give it an
irresistible momentum began to see what only a few yet apprehend, they
would recoil in horror and abandon the quest which for half a century
has engaged so many people of good will? Where these common beliefs of
our generation will lead us is a problem not for one party but for every
one of us—a problem of the most momentous significance. Is there a
greater tragedy imaginable than that, in our endeavor consciously to
shape our future in accordance with high ideals, we should in fact
unwittingly produce the very opposite of what we have been striving
for?</p>
<p>There is an even more pressing reason why at this time we should
seriously endeavor to understand the forces which have created National
Socialism: that this will enable us to understand our enemy and the
issue at stake between us. It cannot be denied that there is yet little
recognition of the positive ideals for which we are fighting. We know
that we are fighting for freedom to shape our life according to our own
ideas. That is a great deal, but not enough. It is not enough to give us
the firm beliefs which we need to resist an enemy who uses propaganda as
one of his main weapons not only in the most blatant but also in the
most subtle forms. It is still more insufficient when we have to counter
this propaganda among the people in the countries under his control and
elsewhere, where the effect of this propaganda will not disappear with
the defeat of the Axis powers. It is not enough if we are to show to
others that what we are fighting for is worth their support, and it is
not enough to guide us in the building of a new world safe against the
dangers to which the old one has succumbed.</p>
<p>It is a lamentable fact that the democracies in their dealings with
the dictators before the war, not less than in their attempts at
propaganda and in the discussion of their war aims, have shown an inner
insecurity and uncertainty of aim which can be explained only by
confusion about their own ideals and the nature of the differences which
separated them from the enemy. We have been misled as much because we
have refused to believe that the enemy was sincere in the profession of
some beliefs which we shared as because we believed in the sincerity of
some of his other claims. Have not the parties of the Left as well as
those of the Right been deceived by believing that the National
Socialist party was in the service of the capitalists and opposed to all
forms of socialism? How many features of Hitler’s system have not been
recommended to us for imitation from the most unexpected quarters,
unaware that they are an integral part of that system and incompatible
with the free society we hope to preserve? The number of dangerous
mistakes we have made before and since the outbreak of war because we do
not understand the opponent with whom we are faced is appalling. It
seems almost as if we did not want to understand the development which
has produced totalitarianism because such an understanding might destroy
some of the dearest illusions to which we are determined to cling.</p>
<p>We shall never be successful in our dealings with the Germans until
we understand the character and the growth of the ideas which now govern
them. The theory which is once again put forth, that the Germans as such
are inherently vicious, is hardly tenable and not very creditable to
those who hold it. It dishonors the long series of Anglo-Saxon thinkers
who during the last hundred years have gladly taken over what was best,
and not only what was best, in German thought. It overlooks the fact
that, when eighty years ago John Stuart Mill was writing his great essay
On Liberty, he drew his inspiration, more than from any other men, from
two Germans—Goethe and Wilhelm von Humboldt— and forgets the fact that
two of the most influential intellectual forebears of National
Socialism—Thomas Carlyle and Houston Stewart Chamberlain— were a Scot
and an Englishman.4 In its cruder forms this view is a disgrace to those
who by maintaining it adopt the worst features of German racial
theories.</p>
<p>The problem is not why the Germans as such are vicious, which
congenitally they are probably no more than other peoples, but to
determine the circumstances which during the last seventy years have
made possible the progressive growth and the ultimate victory of a
particular set of ideas, and why in the end this victory has brought the
most vicious elements among them to the top. Mere hatred of everything
German instead of the particular ideas which now dominate the Germans
is, moreover, very dangerous, because it blinds those who indulge in it
against a real threat. It is to be feared that this attitude is
frequently merely a kind of escapism, caused by an unwillingness to
recognize tendencies which are not confined to Germany and by a
reluctance to re-examine, and if necessary to discard, beliefs which we
have taken over from the Germans and by which we are still as much
deluded as the Germans were. It is doubly dangerous because the
contention that only the peculiar wickedness of the Germans has produced
the Nazi system is likely to become the excuse for forcing on us the
very institutions which have produced that wickedness.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the developments in Germany and Italy about to
be proffered in this book is very different from that given by most
foreign observers and by the majority of exiles from those countries.
But if this interpretation is correct, it will also explain why it is
almost impossible for a person who, like most of the exiles and the
foreign correspondents of English and American newspapers, holds the now
prevalent socialist views to see those events in the proper perspective.
The superficial and misleading view which sees in National Socialism
merely a reaction fomented by those whose privileges or interests were
threatened by the advance of socialism was naturally supported by all
those who, although they were at one time active in the movement of
ideas that has led to National Socialism, have stopped at some point of
that development and, by the conflict into which this brought them with
the Nazis, were forced to leave their country. But the fact that they
were numerically the only significant opposition to the Nazis means no
more than that in the wider sense practically all Germans had become
socialists and that liberalism in the old sense had been driven out by
socialism. As we hope to show, the conflict in existence between the
National Socialist “Right” and the “Left” in Germany is the kind of
conflict that will always arise between rival socialist factions. If
this interpretation is correct, it means, however, that many of those
socialist refugees, in clinging to their beliefs, are now, though with
the best will in the world, helping to lead their adopted country the
way which Germany has gone.</p>
<p>I know that many of my Anglo-Saxon friends have sometimes been
shocked by the semi-Fascist views they would occasionally hear expressed
by German refugees, whose genuinely socialist convictions could not be
doubted. But while these observers put this down to the others’ being
Germans, the true explanation is that they were socialists whose
experience had carried them several stages beyond that yet reached by
socialists in England and America. It is true, of course, that German
socialists have found much support in their country from certain
features of the Prussian tradition; and this kinship between Prussianism
and socialism, in which in Germany both sides gloried, gives additional
support to our main contention.5 But it would be a mistake to believe
that the specific German rather than the socialist element produced
totalitarianism. It was the prevalence of socialist views and not
Prussianism that Germany had in common with Italy and Russia—and it was
from the masses and not from the classes steeped in the Prussian
tradition, and favored by it, that National Socialism arose.</p>
<p>1 (Lord Acton, “Review of Sir Erskine May’s Democracy in Europe”
(1878), reprinted in The History of Freedom and Other Essays, op. cit.,
p. 62. —Ed.)</p>
<p>2 (Hayek alludes here to the trends he identified in his inaugural
lecture at the LSE, “The Trend of Economic Thinking,” op. cit. —Ed.)</p>
<p>3 (The nineteenth century Liberal statesman Sir William Vernon
Harcourt (1827–1904) originated the phrase, “We are all socialists now.”
—Ed.)</p>
<p>4 As some people may think this statement exaggerated, the testimony
of Lord Morley may be worth quoting, who in his Recollections speaks of
the “acknowledged point” that the main argument of the essay On Liberty
“was not original but came from Germany.” (Hayek quotes from John,
Viscount Morley, Recollections, vol. 1 (New York: Macmillan, 1917),
pp. 61–62. John Morley, First Viscount Morley of Blackburn (1838–1923),
was an English statesman and man of letters. He wrote numerous
biographies, the most famous of them a four volume work on William
Gladstone. German poet, playwright, and scientist Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe (1749–1832) was the author of Faust and The Sorrows of Young
Werther. Philologist and statesman Karl Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835)
was the first Prussian minister of education and founder of the
University of Berlin. Essayist and man of letters Thomas Carlyle
(1795–1881), who through various publications helped introduce German
culture and literature to English readers, is best known among
economists for dubbing the classicals “the dreary professors of a dismal
science.” English-born author and propagandist Houston Stewart
Chamberlain (1855–1927) who lived in Germany from 1885 and who wrote
principally on music and philosophy, was known for his support for the
doctrine of Aryan supremacy. Hayek’s note originally was placed after
the name “Humboldt.” —Ed.)</p>
<p>5 That there did exist a certain kinship between socialism and the
organization of the Prussian state, consciously organized from the top
as in no other country, is undeniable and was freely recognized already
by the early French socialists. Long before the ideal of running the
whole state on the same principles as a single factory was to inspire
nineteenth-century socialism, the Prussian poet Novalis had already
deplored that “no other state has ever been administered so much like a
factory as Prussia since the death of Frederick William,” in Novalis,
Glauben und Liebe, oder der König and die Königin (1798) (The cited
passage may be found in Novalis, Schriften, vol. 2 (Stuttgart: Verlag W.
Kohlhammer, 1981, p. 494), and reads “Kein Staat ist mehr als Fabrik
verwaltet worden, als Preußen, seit Friedrich Wilhelm des Ersten Tode.”
Novalis was the pen name of the Prussian poet and novelist Friedrich von
Hardenberg (1772–1801), known as the “Prophet of Romanticism.” The work
from which Hayek quotes may be translated as Faith and Love, or the King
and the Queen. Novalis anticipated there a future in which universal
human spirituality would eliminate the need for government. —Ed.)</p>
