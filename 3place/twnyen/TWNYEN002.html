<h4 id="the-road-to-serfdom">THE ROAD TO SERFDOM</h4>
<p>It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.</p>
<p>—David Hume</p>
<p>I should have loved freedom, I believe, at all times, but in the time
in which we live I am ready to worship it.</p>
<p>—A. de Tocqueville</p>
<p>To the socialists of all parties</p>
<p>PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS 1</p>
<p>When a professional student of social affairs writes a political
book, his first duty is plainly to say so. This is a political book. I
do not wish to disguise this by describing it, as I might perhaps have
done, by the more elegant and ambitious name of an essay in social
philosophy. But, whatever the name, the essential point remains that all
I shall have to say is derived from certain ultimate values. I hope I
have adequately discharged in the book itself a second and no less
important duty: to make it clear beyond doubt what these ultimate values
are on which the whole argument depends.</p>
<p>There is, however, one thing I want to add to this. Though this is a
political book, I am as certain as anyone can be that the beliefs set
out in it are not determined by my personal interests. I can discover no
reason why the kind of society which seems to me desirable should offer
greater advantages to me than to the great majority of the people of my
country. In fact, I am always told by my socialist colleagues that as an
economist I should occupy a much more important position in the kind of
society to which I am opposed—provided, of course, that I could bring
myself to accept their views. I feel equally certain that my opposition
to these views is not due to their being different from those with which
I have grown up, since they are the very views which I held as a young
man and which have led me to make the study of economics my profession.
For those who, in the current fashion, seek interested motives in every
profession of a political opinion, I may, perhaps, be allowed to add
that I have every possible reason for not writing or publishing this
book. It is certain to offend many people with whom I wish to live on
friendly terms; it has forced me to put aside work for which I feel
better qualified and to which I attach greater importance in the long
run; and, above all, it is certain to prejudice the reception of the
results of the more strictly academic work to which all my inclinations
lead me.</p>
<p>If in spite of this I have come to regard the writing of this book as
a duty which I must not evade, this was mainly due to a peculiar and
serious feature of the discussions of problems of future economic policy
at the present time, of which the public is scarcely sufficiently aware.
This is the fact that the majority of economists have now for some years
been absorbed by the war machine, and silenced by their official
positions, and that in consequence public opinion on these problems is
to an alarming extent guided by amateurs and cranks, by people who have
an ax to grind or a pet panacea to sell. In these circumstances one who
still has the leisure for literary work is hardly entitled to keep to
himself apprehensions which current tendencies must create in the minds
of many who cannot publicly express them—though in different
circumstances I should have gladly left the discussion of questions of
national policy to those who are both better authorized and better
qualified for the task.</p>
<p>The central argument of this book was first sketched in an article
entitled “Freedom and the Economic System,” which appeared in the
Contemporary Review for April, 1938, and was later reprinted in an
enlarged form as one of the “Public Policy Pamphlets” edited by
Professor H. D. Gideonse for the University of Chicago Press (1939).2 I
have to thank the editors and publishers of both these publications for
permission to reproduce certain passages from them.</p>
