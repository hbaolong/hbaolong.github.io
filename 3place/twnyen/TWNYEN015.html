<h4 id="eleven">ELEVEN</h4>
<p>THE END OF TRUTH</p>
<p>It is significant that the nationalization of thought has proceeded
everywhere pari passu with the nationalization of industry. —E. H.
Carr1</p>
<p>The most effective way of making everybody serve the single system of
ends toward which the social plan is directed is to make everybody
believe in those ends. To make a totalitarian system function
efficiently, it is not enough that everybody should be forced to work
for the same ends. It is essential that the people should come to regard
them as their own ends. Although the beliefs must be chosen for the
people and imposed upon them, they must become their beliefs, a
generally accepted creed which makes the individuals as far as possible
act spontaneously in the way the planner wants. If the feeling of
oppression in totalitarian countries is in general much less acute than
most people in liberal countries imagine, this is because the
totalitarian governments succeed to a high degree in making people think
as they want them to.</p>
<p>This is, of course, brought about by the various forms of propaganda.
Its technique is now so familiar that we need say little about it. The
only point that needs to be stressed is that neither propaganda in
itself nor the techniques employed are peculiar to totalitarianism and
that what so completely changes its nature and effect in a totalitarian
state is that all propaganda serves the same goal—that all the
instruments of propaganda are coordinated to influence the individuals
in the same direction and to produce the characteristic Gleichschal-tung
of all minds.2 As a result, the effect of propaganda in totalitarian
countries is different not only in magnitude but in kind from that of
the propaganda made for different ends by independent and competing
agencies. If all the sources of current information are effectively
under one single control, it is no longer a question of merely
persuading the people of this or that. The skillful propagandist then
has power to mold their minds in any direction he chooses, and even the
most intelligent and independent people cannot entirely escape that
influence if they are long isolated from all other sources of
information.</p>
<p>While in the totalitarian states this status of propaganda gives it a
unique power over the minds of the people, the peculiar moral effects
arise not from the technique but from the object and scope of
totalitarian propaganda. If it could be confined to indoctrinating the
people with the whole system of values toward which the social effort is
directed, propaganda would represent merely a particular manifestation
of the characteristic features of collectivist morals which we have
already considered. If its object were merely to teach the people a
definite and comprehensive moral code, the problem would be solely
whether this moral code is good or bad. We have seen that the moral code
of a totalitarian society is not likely to appeal to us, that even the
striving for equality by means of a directed economy can result only in
an officially enforced inequality— an authoritarian determination of the
status of each individual in the new hierarchical order—and that most of
the humanitarian elements of our morals, the respect for human life, for
the weak, and for the individual generally, will disappear. However
repellent this may be to most people, and though it involves a change in
moral standards, it is not necessarily entirely antimoral. Some features
of such a system may even appeal to the sternest moralists of a
conservative tint and seem to them preferable to the softer standards of
a liberal society.</p>
<p>The moral consequences of totalitarian propaganda which we must now
consider are, however, of an even more profound kind. They are
destructive of all morals because they undermine one of the foundations
of all morals: the sense of and the respect for truth. From the nature
of its task, totalitarian propaganda cannot confine itself to values, to
questions of opinion and moral convictions in which the individual
always will conform more or less to the views ruling his community, but
must extend to questions of fact where human intelligence is involved in
a different way. This is so, first, because, in order to induce people
to accept the official values, these must be justified, or shown to be
connected with the values already held by the people, which usually will
involve assertions about causal connections between means and ends; and,
second, because the distinction between ends and means, between the goal
aimed at and the measures taken to achieve it, is in fact never so clear
cut and definite as any general discussion of these problems is likely
to suggest; and because, therefore, people must be brought to agree not
only with the ultimate aims but also with the views about the facts and
possibilities on which the particular measures are based.</p>
<p>We have seen that agreement on that complete ethical code, that
all-comprehensive system of values which is implicit in an economic
plan, does not exist in a free society but would have to be created. But
we must not assume that the planner will approach his task aware of that
need or that, even if he were aware of it, it would be possible to
create such a comprehensive code in advance. He only finds out about the
conflicts between different needs as he goes along, and he has to make
his decisions as the necessity arises. The code of values guiding his
decisions does not exist in abstracto before the decisions have to be
made; it has to be created with the particular decisions. We have also
seen how this inability to separate the general problem of values from
the particular decisions makes it impossible that a democratic body,
while unable to decide the technical details of a plan, should yet
determine the values guiding it.</p>
<p>And while the planning authority will constantly have to decide
issues on merits about which there exist no definite moral rules, it
will have to justify its decisions to the people—or, at least, have
somehow to make the people believe that they are the right decisions.
Although those responsible for a decision may have been guided by no
more than prejudice, some guiding principle will have to be stated
publicly if the community is not merely passively to submit but actively
to support the measure. The need to rationalize the likes and dislikes
which, for lack of anything else, must guide the planner in many of his
decisions, and the necessity of stating his reasons in a form in which
they will appeal to as many people as possible, will force him to
construct theories, i.e., assertions about the connections between
facts, which then become an integral part of the governing doctrine.</p>
<p>This process of creating a “myth” to justify his action need not be
conscious. The totalitarian leader may be guided merely by an
instinctive dislike of the state of things he has found and a desire to
create a new hierarchical order which conforms better to his conception
of merit; he may merely know that he dislikes the Jews who seemed to be
so successful in an order which did not provide a satisfactory place for
him, and that he loves and admires the tall blond man, the
“aristocratic” figure of the novels of his youth. So he will readily
embrace theories which seem to provide a rational justification for the
prejudices which he shares with many of his fellows. Thus a
pseudoscientific theory becomes part of the official creed which to a
greater or lesser degree directs everybody’s action. Or the widespread
dislike of the industrial civilization and a romantic yearning for
country life, together with a (probably erroneous) idea about the
special value of country people as soldiers, provide the basis for
another myth: Blut und Boden (“blood and soil”), expressing not merely
ultimate values but a whole host of beliefs about cause and effect
which, once they have become ideals directing the activity of the whole
community, must not be questioned.3</p>
<p>The need for such official doctrines as an instrument of directing
and rallying the efforts of the people has been clearly foreseen by the
various theoreticians of the totalitarian system. Plato’s “noble lies”
and Sorel’s “myths” serve the same purpose as the racial doctrine of the
Nazis or the theory of the corporative state of Mussolini.4 They are all
necessarily based on particular views about facts which are then
elaborated into scientific theories in order to justify a preconceived
opinion.</p>
<p>The most effective way of making people accept the validity of the
values they are to serve is to persuade them that they are really the
same as those which they, or at least the best among them, have always
held, but which were not properly understood or recognized before. The
people are made to transfer their allegiance from the old gods to the
new under the pretense that the new gods really are what their sound
instinct had always told them but what before they had only dimly seen.
And the most efficient technique to this end is to use the old words but
change their meaning. Few traits of totalitarian regimes are at the same
time so confusing to the superficial observer and yet so characteristic
of the whole intellectual climate as the complete perversion of
language, the change of meaning of the words by which the ideals of the
new regimes are expressed.</p>
<p>The worst sufferer in this respect is, of course, the word “liberty.”
It is a word used as freely in totalitarian states as elsewhere. Indeed,
it could almost be said—and it should serve as a warning to us to be on
our guard against all the tempters who promise us New Liberties for Old
5 —that wherever liberty as we understand it has been destroyed, this
has almost always been done in the name of some new freedom promised to
the people. Even among us we have “planners for freedom” who promise us
a “collective freedom for the group,” the nature of which may be
gathered from the fact that its advocate finds it necessary to assure us
that “naturally the advent of planned freedom does not mean that all
[sic] earlier forms of freedom must be abolished.” Dr. Karl Mannheim,
from whose work6 these sentences are taken, at least warns us that “a
conception of freedom modelled on the preceding age is an obstacle to
any real understanding of the problem.” But his use of the word
“freedom” is as misleading as it is in the mouth of totalitarian
politicians. Like their freedom, the “collective freedom” he offers us
is not the freedom of the members of society but the unlimited freedom
of the planner to do with society what he pleases.7 It is the confusion
of freedom with power carried to the extreme.</p>
<p>In this particular case the perversion of the meaning of the word
has, of course, been well prepared by a long line of German philosophers
and, not least, by many of the theoreticians of socialism. But “freedom”
or “liberty” are by no means the only words whose meaning has been
changed into their opposites to make them serve as instruments of
totalitarian propaganda. We have already seen how the same happens to
“justice” and “law,” “right” and “equality.” The list could be extended
until it includes almost all moral and political terms in general
use.</p>
<p>If one has not one’s self experienced this process, it is difficult
to appreciate the magnitude of this change of the meaning of words, the
confusion which it causes, and the barriers to any rational discussion
which it creates. It has to be seen to be understood how, if one of two
brothers embraces the new faith, after a short while he appears to speak
a different language which makes any real communication between them
impossible. And the confusion becomes worse because this change of
meaning of the words describing political ideals is not a single event
but a continuous process, a technique employed consciously or
unconsciously to direct the people. Gradually, as this process
continues, the whole language becomes despoiled, and words become empty
shells deprived of any definite meaning, as capable of denoting one
thing as its opposite and used solely for the emotional associations
which still adhere to them.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to deprive the great majority of independent
thought. But the minority who will retain an inclination to criticize
must also be silenced. We have already seen why coercion cannot be
confined to the acceptance of the ethical code underlying the plan
according to which all social activity is directed. Since many parts of
this code will never be explicitly stated, since many parts of the
guiding scale of values will exist only implicitly in the plan, the plan
itself in every detail, in fact every act of the government, must become
sacrosanct and exempt from criticism. If the people are to support the
common effort without hesitation, they must be convinced that not only
the end aimed at but also the means chosen are the right ones. The
official creed, to which adherence must be enforced, will therefore
comprise all the views about facts on which the plan is based. Public
criticism or even expressions of doubt must be suppressed because they
tend to weaken public support. As the Webbs report of the position in
every Russian enterprise: “Whilst the work is in progress, any public
expression of doubt, or even fear that the plan will not be successful,
is an act of disloyalty and even of treachery because of its possible
effects on the will and on the efforts of the rest of the staff.”8 When
the doubt or fear expressed concerns not the success of a particular
enterprise but of the whole social plan, it must be treated even more as
sabotage.</p>
<p>Facts and theories must thus become no less the object of an official
doctrine than views about values. And the whole apparatus for spreading
knowledge— the schools and the press, radio and motion picture—will be
used exclusively to spread those views which, whether true or false,
will strengthen the belief in the rightness of the decisions taken by
the authority; and all information that might cause doubt or hesitation
will be withheld. The probable effect on the people’s loyalty to the
system becomes the only criterion for deciding whether a particular
piece of information is to be published or suppressed. The situation in
a totalitarian state is permanently and in all fields the same that it
is elsewhere in some fields in wartime. Everything which might cause
doubt about the wisdom of the government or create discontent will be
kept from the people. The basis of unfavorable comparisons with
conditions elsewhere, the knowledge of possible alternatives to the
course actually taken, information which might suggest failure on the
part of the government to live up to its promises or to take advantage
of opportunities to improve conditions—all will be suppressed. There is
consequently no field where the systematic control of information will
not be practiced and uniformity of views not enforced.</p>
<p>This applies even to fields apparently most remote from any political
interests and particularly to all the sciences, even the most abstract.
That in the disciplines dealing directly with human affairs and
therefore most immediately affecting political views, such as history,
law, or economics, the disinterested search for truth cannot be allowed
in a totalitarian system, and the vindication of the official views
becomes the sole object, is easily seen and has been amply confirmed by
experience. These disciplines have, indeed, in all totalitarian
countries become the most fertile factories of the official myths which
the rulers use to guide the minds and wills of their subjects. It is not
surprising that in these spheres even the pretense that they search for
truth is abandoned and that the authorities decide what doctrines ought
to be taught and published.</p>
<p>Totalitarian control of opinion extends, however, also to subjects
which at first seem to have no political significance. Sometimes it is
difficult to explain why particular doctrines should be officially
proscribed or why others should be encouraged, and it is curious that
these likes and dislikes are apparently somewhat similar in the
different totalitarian systems. In particular, they all seem to have in
common an intense dislike of the more abstract forms of thought—a
dislike characteristically also shown by many of the collectivists among
our scientists. Whether the theory of relativity is represented as a
“Semitic attack on the foundation of Christian and Nordic physics” or
opposed because it is “in conflict with dialectical materialism and
Marxist dogma” comes very much to the same thing. Nor does it make much
difference whether certain theorems of mathematical statistics are
attacked because they “form part of the class struggle on the
ideological frontier and are a product of the historical role of
mathematics as the servant of the bourgeoisie,” or whether the whole
subject is condemned because “it provides no guaranty that it will serve
the interest of the people.” It seems that pure mathematics is no less a
victim and that even the holding of particular views about the nature of
continuity can be ascribed to “bourgeois prejudices.” According to the
Webbs, the Journal for Marxist-Leninist Natural Sciences has the
following slogans: “We stand for Party in Mathematics. We stand for the
purity of Marxist-Leninist theory in surgery.”9 The situation seems to
be very similar in Germany. The Journal of the National-Socialist
Association of Mathematicians is full of “party in mathematics,” and one
of the best-known German physicists, the Nobel prizeman Lenard, has
summed up his lifework under the title German Physics in Four
Volumes!10</p>
<p>It is entirely in keeping with the whole spirit of totalitarianism
that it condemns any human activity done for its own sake and without
ulterior purpose. Science for science’s sake, art for art’s sake, are
equally abhorrent to the Nazis, our socialist intellectuals, and the
communists. Every activity must derive its justification from a
conscious social purpose. There must be no spontaneous, unguided
activity, because it might produce results which cannot be foreseen and
for which the plan does not provide. It might produce something new,
undreamed of in the philosophy of the planner. The principle extends
even to games and amusements. I leave it to the reader to guess whether
it was in Germany or in Russia that chess-players were officially
exhorted that “we must finish once and for all with the neutrality of
chess. We must condemn once and for all the formula ‘chess for the sake
of chess’ like the formula ‘art for art’s sake.’”11</p>
<p>Incredible as some of these aberrations may appear, we must yet be on
our guard not to dismiss them as mere accidental by-products which have
nothing to do with the essential character of a planned or totalitarian
system. They are not. They are a direct result of that same desire to
see everything directed by a “unitary conception of the whole,” of the
need to uphold at all costs the views in the service of which people are
asked to make constant sacrifices, and of the general idea that the
knowledge and beliefs of the people are an instrument to be used for a
single purpose. Once science has to serve, not truth, but the interests
of a class, a community, or a state, the sole task of argument and
discussion is to vindicate and to spread still further the beliefs by
which the whole life of the community is directed. As the Nazi minister
of justice has explained, the question which every new scientific theory
must ask itself is: “Do I serve National Socialism for the greatest
benefit of all?”12</p>
<p>The word “truth” itself ceases to have its old meaning. It describes
no longer something to be found, with the individual conscience as the
sole arbiter of whether in any particular instance the evidence (or the
standing of those proclaiming it) warrants a belief; it becomes
something to be laid down by authority, something which has to be
believed in the interest of the unity of the organized effort and which
may have to be altered as the exigencies of this organized effort
require it.</p>
<p>The general intellectual climate which this produces, the spirit of
complete cynicism as regards truth which it engenders, the loss of the
sense of even the meaning of truth, the disappearance of the spirit of
independent inquiry and of the belief in the power of rational
conviction, the way in which differences of opinion in every branch of
knowledge become political issues to be decided by authority, are all
things which one must personally experience—no short description can
convey their extent. Perhaps the most alarming fact is that contempt for
intellectual liberty is not a thing which arises only once the
totalitarian system is established but one which can be found everywhere
among intellectuals who have embraced a collectivist faith and who are
acclaimed as intellectual leaders even in countries still under a
liberal regime. Not only is even the worst oppression condoned if it is
committed in the name of socialism, and the creation of a totalitarian
system openly advocated by people who pretend to speak for the
scientists of liberal countries; intolerance, too, is openly extolled.
Have we not recently seen a British scientific writer defend even
Inquisition because in his opinion it “is beneficial to science when it
protects a rising class”?13 This view is, of course, practically
indistinguishable from the views which led the Nazis to the persecution
of men of science, the burning of scientific books, and the systematic
eradication of the intelligentsia of the subjected people.</p>
<p>The desire to force upon the people a creed which is regarded as
salutary for them is, of course, not a thing that is new or peculiar to
our time. New, however, is the argument by which many of our
intellectuals try to justify such attempts. There is no real freedom of
thought in our society, so it is said, because the opinions and tastes
of the masses are shaped by propaganda, by advertising, by the example
of the upper classes, and by other environmental factors which
inevitably force the thinking of the people into well-worn grooves. From
this it is concluded that if the ideals and tastes of the great majority
are always fashioned by circumstances which we can control, we ought to
use this power deliberately to turn the thoughts of the people in what
we think is a desirable direction.</p>
<p>Probably it is true enough that the great majority are rarely capable
of thinking independently, that on most questions they accept views
which they find ready-made, and that they will be equally content if
born or coaxed into one set of beliefs or another. In any society
freedom of thought will probably be of direct significance only for a
small minority. But this does not mean that anyone is competent, or
ought to have power, to select those to whom this freedom is to be
reserved. It certainly does not justify the presumption of any group of
people to claim the right to determine what people ought to think or
believe. It shows a complete confusion of thought to suggest that,
because under any sort of system the majority of people follow the lead
of somebody, it makes no difference if everybody has to follow the same
lead. To deprecate the value of intellectual freedom because it will
never mean for everybody the same possibility of independent thought is
completely to miss the reasons which give intellectual freedom its
value. What is essential to make it serve its function as the prime
mover of intellectual progress is not that everybody may be able to
think or write anything but that any cause or idea may be argued by
somebody. So long as dissent is not suppressed, there will always be
some who will query the ideas ruling their contemporaries and put new
ideas to the test of argument and propaganda.</p>
<p>This interaction of individuals, possessing different knowledge and
different views, is what constitutes the life of thought. The growth of
reason is a social process based on the existence of such differences.
It is of its essence that its results cannot be predicted, that we
cannot know which views will assist this growth and which will not—in
short, that this growth cannot be governed by any views which we now
possess without at the same time limiting it. To “plan” or “organize”
the growth of mind, or, for that matter, progress in general, is a
contradiction in terms. The idea that the human mind ought “consciously”
to control its own development confuses individual reason, which alone
can “consciously control” anything, with the interpersonal process to
which its growth is due. By attempting to control it, we are merely
setting bounds to its development and must sooner or later produce a
stagnation of thought and a decline of reason.</p>
<p>The tragedy of collectivist thought is that, while it starts out to
make reason supreme, it ends by destroying reason because it
misconceives the process on which the growth of reason depends. It may
indeed be said that it is the paradox of all collectivist doctrine and
its demand for “conscious” control or “conscious” planning that they
necessarily lead to the demand that the mind of some individual should
rule supreme—while only the individualist approach to social phenomena
makes us recognize the superindividual forces which guide the growth of
reason. Individualism is thus an attitude of humility before this social
process and of tolerance to other opinions and is the exact opposite of
that intellectual hubris which is at the root of the demand for
comprehensive direction of the social process.</p>

actually uses the term nationalization of opinion, rather than
nationalization of thought. —Ed.]</p>

the term used to describe the Nazis’ efforts to coordinate all
political, economic, cultural, and even recreational activities in
support of the state. The forced reorganization of the disparate trade
unions into a single labor “front” is a standard example. —Ed.]</p>
<p>3 [Blut und Boden, a term first introduced by the historian Oswald
Spengler, was the doctrine that the state rightly consists of people of
a uniform race on their own land. The Nazis used it to justify a number
of changes in agricultural policy, including the seizure of the land of
non-Germans and the institution of the Hereditary Farm Law, which was
meant to preserve an exclusively German peasantry as a source of
bloodlines for the German Volk. —Ed.]</p>
<p>4 [Plato’s “noble lies” refers to the lies that the leaders of a
republic must tell to get each person to fulfill the function that the
leaders thought best suited his nature, thereby ensuring a stable
society. The French philosopher Georges Sorel (1847–1922) argued that to
be successful political opposition must use violence, and that “social
myths” are necessary to inspire the necessary collective action.

<p>5 This is the title of a recent work by the historian Carl L. Becker.

University Press, 1941). —Ed.]</p>

cit., p. 379. [Hayek incorrectly listed the quotation from Mannheim as
appearing on p. 377. —Ed.]</p>
<p>7 Peter Drucker, The End of Economic Man, op. cit., p. 74, correctly
observes that “the less freedom there is, the more there is talk of the
‘new freedom.’ Yet this new freedom is a mere word which covers the
exact contradiction of all that Europe ever understood by freedom. . . .
The new freedom which is preached in Europe is, however, the right of
the majority against the individual.” [The first part of the quotation
actually appears on page 79, and the last part on page 80. —Ed.]</p>

cit., vol. 2, p. 1038. [Hayek’s 1936 review of the Webbs’ book is
reprinted in F. A. Hayek, Socialism and War, op. cit., pp. 239–42.

<p>10 [The German physicist Philipp von Lenard (1862–1947) made a number
of contributions to experimental physics, and under the Nazis held the
title of Chief of German Physics. The four-volume work to which Hayek
refers is Deutsche Physik in Vier Bänden (Munich: J. F. Lehmann, 1936–
1937). —Ed.]</p>
<p>11 [The speaker was Nikolai V. Krylenko, the People’s Commissar for
Justice, and he said this at a 1932 congress of chess players. The
quotation is cited in full in Boris Souvarine, Stalin: A Critical Survey
of Bolshevism, translated by C. L. R. James (London: Alliance, 1939;
reprinted, New York: Octagon, 1972), p. 575. —Ed.]</p>
<p>12 [Franz Gurtner was the Nazi Minister of Justice from 1933 through
1941. Franz Schlegel-berger followed as Acting Minister, and Otto Georg
Thierack served as Minister from 1942 to 1945. It is not clear which one
is responsible for the statement in the text. —Ed.]</p>
