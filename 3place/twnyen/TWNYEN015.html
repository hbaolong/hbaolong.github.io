<p>WHY THE WORST GET ON TOP</p>
<p>Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>—Lord Acton1</p>
<p>We must now examine a belief from which many who regard the advent of
totalitarianism as inevitable derive consolation and which seriously
weakens the resistance of many others who would oppose it with all their
might if they fully apprehended its nature. It is the belief that the
most repellent features of the totalitarian regimes are due to the
historical accident that they were established by groups of blackguards
and thugs. Surely, it is argued, if in Germany the creation of a
totalitarian regime brought the Streichers and Killingers, the Leys and
Heines, the Himmlers and Heydrichs to power, this may prove the
viciousness of the German character but not that the rise of such people
is the necessary consequence of a totalitarian system.2 Why should it
not be possible that the same sort of system, if it be necessary to
achieve important ends, be run by decent people for the good of the
community as a whole?</p>
<p>We must not deceive ourselves into believing that all good people
must be democrats or will necessarily wish to have a share in the
government. Many, no doubt, would rather entrust it to somebody whom
they think more competent. Although this might be unwise, there is
nothing bad or dishonorable in approving a dictatorship of the good.
Totalitarianism, we can already hear it argued, is a powerful system
alike for good and evil, and the purpose for which it will be used
depends entirely on the dictators. And those who think that it is not
the system which we need fear, but the danger that it might be run by
bad men, might even be tempted to forestall this danger by seeing that
it is established in time by good men.</p>
<p>No doubt an American or English “Fascist” system would greatly differ
from the Italian or German models; no doubt, if the transition were
effected without violence, we might expect to get a better type of
leader. And, if I had to live under a Fascist system, I have no doubt
that I would rather live under one run by Englishmen or Americans than
under one run by anybody else. Yet all this does not mean that, judged
on our present standards, our Fascist system would in the end prove so
very different or much less intolerable than its prototypes. There are
strong reasons for believing that what to us appear the worst features
of the existing totalitarian systems are not accidental by-products but
phenomena which totalitarianism is certain sooner or later to produce.
Just as the democratic statesman who sets out to plan economic life will
soon be confronted with the alternative of either assuming dictatorial
powers or abandoning his plans, so the totalitarian dictator would soon
have to choose between disregard of ordinary morals and failure. It is
for this reason that the unscrupulous and uninhibited are likely to be
more successful in a society tending toward totalitarianism. Who does
not see this has not yet grasped the full width of the gulf which
separates totalitarianism from a liberal regime, the utter difference
between the whole moral atmosphere under collectivism and the
essentially individualist Western civilization.</p>
<p>The “moral basis of collectivism” has, of course, been much debated
in the past; but what concerns us here is not its moral basis but its
moral results. The usual discussions of the ethical aspects of
collectivism refer to the question whether collectivism is demanded by
existing moral convictions; or what moral convictions would be required
if collectivism is to produce the hoped-for results. Our question,
however, is what moral views will be produced by a collectivist
organization of society, or what views are likely to rule it. The
interaction between morals and institutions may well have the effect
that the ethics produced by collectivism will be altogether different
from the moral ideals that lead to the demand for collectivism. While we
are likely to think that, since the desire for a collectivist system
springs from high moral motives, such a system must be the
breeding-ground for the highest virtues, there is, in fact, no reason
why any system should necessarily enhance those attitudes which serve
the purpose for which it was designed. The ruling moral views will
depend partly on the qualities that will lead individuals to success in
a collectivist or totalitarian system and partly on the requirements of
the totalitarian machinery.</p>
<p>We must here return for a moment to the position which precedes the
suppression of democratic institutions and the creation of a
totalitarian regime. In this stage it is the general demand for quick
and determined government action that is the dominating element in the
situation, dissatisfaction with the slow and cumbersome course of
democratic procedure which makes action for action’s sake the goal. It
is then the man or the party who seems strong and resolute enough “to
get things done” who exercises the greatest appeal. “Strong” in this
sense means not merely a numerical majority—it is the ineffectiveness of
parliamentary majorities with which people are dissatisfied. What they
will seek is somebody with such solid support as to inspire confidence
that he can carry out whatever he wants. It is here that the new type of
party, organized on military lines, comes in.</p>
<p>In the Central European countries the socialist parties had
familiarized the masses with political organizations of a semi-military
character designed to absorb as much as possible of the private life of
the members. All that was wanted to give one group overwhelming power
was to carry the same principle somewhat further, to seek strength not
in the assured votes of huge numbers at occasional elections but in the
absolute and unreserved support of a smaller but more thoroughly
organized body. The chance of imposing a totalitarian regime on a whole
people depends on the leader’s first collecting round him a group which
is prepared voluntarily to submit to that totalitarian discipline which
they are to impose by force upon the rest.</p>
<p>Although the socialist parties had the strength to get anything if
they had cared to use force, they were reluctant to do so. They had,
without knowing it, set themselves a task which only the ruthless ready
to disregard the barriers of accepted morals can execute.</p>
<p>That socialism can be put into practice only by methods which most
socialists disapprove is, of course, a lesson learned by many social
reformers in the past. The old socialist parties were inhibited by their
democratic ideals; they did not possess the ruthlessness required for
the performance of their chosen task. It is characteristic that both in
Germany and in Italy the success of fascism was preceded by the refusal
of the socialist parties to take over the responsibilities of
government. They were unwilling wholeheartedly to employ the methods to
which they had pointed the way. They still hoped for the miracle of a
majority’s agreeing on a particular plan for the organization of the
whole of society; others had already learned the lesson that in a
planned society the question can no longer be on what do a majority of
the people agree but what the largest single group is whose members
agree sufficiently to make unified direction of all affairs possible;
or, if no such group large enough to enforce its views exists, how it
can be created and who will succeed in creating it.</p>
<p>There are three main reasons why such a numerous and strong group
with fairly homogeneous views is not likely to be formed by the best but
rather by the worst elements of any society. By our standards the
principles on which such a group would be selected will be almost
entirely negative.</p>
<p>In the first instance, it is probably true that, in general, the
higher the education and intelligence of individuals become, the more
their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are
to agree on a particular hierarchy of values. It is a corollary of this
that if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of
outlook, we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and
intellectual standards where the more primitive and “common” instincts
and tastes prevail. This does not mean that the majority of people have
low moral standards; it merely means that the largest group of people
whose values are very similar are the people with low standards. It is,
as it were, the lowest common denominator which unites the largest
number of people. If a numerous group is needed, strong enough to impose
their views on the values of life on all the rest, it will never be
those with highly differentiated and developed tastes—it will be those
who form the “mass” in the derogatory sense of the term, the least
original and independent, who will be able to put the weight of their
numbers behind their particular ideals.</p>
<p>If, however, a potential dictator had to rely entirely on those whose
uncomplicated and primitive instincts happen to be very similar, their
number would scarcely give sufficient weight to their endeavors. He will
have to increase their numbers by converting more to the same simple
creed.</p>
<p>Here comes in the second negative principle of selection: he will be
able to obtain the support of all the docile and gullible, who have no
strong convictions of their own but are prepared to accept a ready-made
system of values if it is only drummed into their ears sufficiently
loudly and frequently. It will be those whose vague and imperfectly
formed ideas are easily swayed and whose passions and emotions are
readily aroused who will thus swell the ranks of the totalitarian
party.</p>
<p>It is in connection with the deliberate effort of the skillful
demagogue to weld together a closely coherent and homogeneous body of
supporters that the third and perhaps most important negative element of
selection enters. It seems to be almost a law of human nature that it is
easier for people to agree on a negative program—on the hatred of an
enemy, on the envy of those better off— than on any positive task. The
contrast between the “we” and the “they,” the common fight against those
outside the group, seems to be an essential ingredient in any creed
which will solidly knit together a group for common action. It is
consequently always employed by those who seek, not merely support of a
policy, but the unreserved allegiance of huge masses. From their point
of view it has the great advantage of leaving them greater freedom of
action than almost any positive program. The enemy, whether he be
internal, like the “Jew” or the “kulak,” or external, seems to be an
indispensable requisite in the armory of a totalitarian leader.</p>
<p>That in Germany it was the Jew who became the enemy until his place
was taken by the “plutocracies” was no less a result of the
anticapitalist resentment on which the whole movement was based than the
selection of the kulak in Russia. In Germany and Austria the Jew had
come to be regarded as the representative of capitalism because a
traditional dislike of large classes of the population for commercial
pursuits had left these more readily accessible to a group that was
practically excluded from the more highly esteemed occupations. It is
the old story of the alien race’s being admitted only to the less
respected trades and then being hated still more for practicing them.
The fact that German anti-Semitism and anticapitalism spring from the
same root is of great importance for the understanding of what has
happened there, but this is rarely grasped by foreign observers.</p>
<p>To treat the universal tendency of collectivist policy to become
nationalistic as due entirely to the necessity for securing unhesitating
support would be to neglect another and no less important factor. It
may, indeed, be questioned whether anyone can realistically conceive of
a collectivist program other than in the service of a limited group,
whether collectivism can exist in any form other than that of some kind
of particularism, be it nationalism, racialism, or classism. The belief
in the community of aims and interests with fellow-men seems to
presuppose a greater degree of similarity of outlook and thought than
exists between men merely as human beings. If the other members of one’s
group cannot all be personally known, they must at least be of the same
kind as those around us, think and talk in the same way and about the
same kind of things, in order that we may identify ourselves with them.
Collectivism on a world scale seems to be unthinkable—except in the
service of a small ruling élite. It would certainly raise not only
technical but, above all, moral problems which none of our socialists is
willing to face. If the English proletarian, for instance, is entitled
to an equal share of the income now derived from his country’s capital
resources, and of the control of their use, because they are the result
of exploitation, so on the same principle all the Indians would be
entitled not only to the income from but also to the use of a
proportional share of the British capital.</p>
<p>But what socialists seriously contemplate the equal division of
existing capital resources among the people of the world? They all
regard the capital as belonging not to humanity but to the nation—though
even within the nation few would dare to advocate that the richer
regions should be deprived of some of “their” capital equipment in order
to help the poorer regions. What socialists proclaim as a duty toward
the fellow-members of the existing states they are not prepared to grant
to the foreigner. From a consistent collectivist point of view the
claims of the “have-not” nations for a new division of the world are
entirely justified—though, if consistently applied, those who demand it
most loudly would lose by it almost as much as the richest nations. They
are, therefore, careful not to base their claims on any equalitarian
principles but on their pretended superior capacity to organize other
peoples.</p>
<p>One of the inherent contradictions of the collectivist philosophy is
that, while basing itself on the humanistic morals which individualism
has developed, it is practicable only within a relatively small group.
That socialism so long as it remains theoretical is internationalist,
while as soon as it is put into practice, whether in Russia or in
Germany, it becomes violently nationalist, is one of the reasons why
“liberal socialism” as most people in the Western world imagine it is
purely theoretical, while the practice of socialism is everywhere
totalitarian.3 Collectivism has no room for the wide humanitarianism of
liberalism but only for the narrow particularism of the
totalitarian.</p>
<p>If the “community” or the state are prior to the individual, if they
have ends of their own independent of and superior to those of the
individuals, only those individuals who work for the same ends can be
regarded as members of the community. It is a necessary consequence of
this view that a person is respected only as a member of the group, that
is, only if and in so far as he works for the recognized common ends,
and that he derives his whole dignity only from this membership and not
merely from being a man. Indeed, the very concepts of humanity and
therefore of any form of internationalism are entirely products of the
individualist view of man, and there can be no place for them in a
collectivist system of thought.4</p>
<p>Apart from the basic fact that the community of collectivism can
extend only as far as the unity of purpose of the individuals exists or
can be created, several contributory factors strengthen the tendency of
collectivism to become particularist and exclusive. Of these, one of the
most important is that the desire of the individual to identify himself
with a group is very frequently the result of a feeling of inferiority
and that therefore his want will be satisfied only if membership of the
group confers some superiority over outsiders. Sometimes, it seems, the
very fact that these violent instincts which the individual knows he
must curb within the group can be given a free range in the collective
action toward the outsider, becomes a further inducement for merging
personality in that of the group. There is a profound truth expressed in
the title of Reinhold Niebuhr’s Moral Man and Immoral Society—however
little we can follow him in the conclusions he draws from his thesis.
There is, indeed, as he says elsewhere, “an increasing tendency among
modern men to imagine themselves ethical because they have delegated
their vices to larger and larger groups.”5 To act on behalf of a group
seems to free people of many of the moral restraints which control their
behavior as individuals within the group.</p>
<p>The definitely antagonistic attitude which most planners take toward
internationalism is further explained by the fact that in the existing
world all outside contacts of a group are obstacles to their effectively
planning the sphere in which they can attempt it. It is therefore no
accident that, as the editor of one of the most comprehensive collective
studies on planning has discovered to his chagrin, “most ‘planners’ are
militant nationalists.”6</p>
<p>The nationalist and imperialist propensities of socialist planners,
much more common than is generally recognized, are not always as
flagrant as, for example, in the case of the Webbs and some of the other
early Fabians, with whom enthusiasm for planning was characteristically
combined with the veneration for the large and powerful political units
and a contempt for the small state. The historian Élie Halévy, speaking
of the Webbs when he first knew them forty years ago, records that their
socialism was profoundly antiliberal. “They did not hate the Tories,
indeed they were extraordinarily lenient to them, but they had no mercy
for Gladstonian Liberalism. It was the time of the Boer War and both the
advanced liberals and the men who were beginning to form the Labour
Party had generously sided with the Boers against British Imperialism,
in the name of freedom and humanity. But the two Webbs and their friend,
Bernard Shaw, stood apart. They were ostentatiously imperialistic. The
independence of small nations might mean something to the liberal
individualist. It meant nothing to collectivists like themselves. I can
still hear Sidney Webb explaining to me that the future belonged to the
great administrative nations, where the officials govern and the police
keep order.” And elsewhere Halévy quotes George Bernard Shaw, arguing,
about the same time, that “the world is to the big and powerful states
by necessity; and the little ones must come within their border or be
crushed out of existence.”7</p>
<p>I have quoted at length these passages, which would not surprise one
in a description of the German ancestors of National Socialism, because
they provide so characteristic an example of that glorification of power
which easily leads from socialism to nationalism and which profoundly
affects the ethical views of all collectivists. So far as the rights of
small nations are concerned, Marx and Engels were little better than
most other consistent collectivists, and the views occasionally
expressed about Czechs or Poles resemble those of contemporary National
Socialists.8</p>
<p>While to the great individualist social philosophers of the
nineteenth century, to a Lord Acton or a Jacob Burckhardt, down to
contemporary socialists, like Bertrand Russell, who have inherited the
liberal tradition, power itself has always appeared the archevil, to the
strict collectivist it is a goal in itself.9 It is not only, as Russell
has so well described, that the desire to organize social life according
to a unitary plan itself springs largely from a desire for power.10 It
is even more the outcome of the fact that, in order to achieve their
end, collectivists must create power—power over men wielded by other
men—of a magnitude never before known, and that their success will
depend on the extent to which they achieve such power.</p>
<p>This remains true even though many liberal socialists are guided in
their endeavors by the tragic illusion that by depriving private
individuals of the power they possess in an individualist system, and by
transferring this power to society, they can thereby extinguish power.
What all those who argue in this manner overlook is that, by
concentrating power so that it can be used in the service of a single
plan, it is not merely transferred but infinitely heightened; that, by
uniting in the hands of some single body power formerly exercised
independently by many, an amount of power is created infinitely greater
than any that existed before, so much more far-reaching as almost to be
different in kind. It is entirely fallacious when it is sometimes argued
that the great power exercised by a central planning board would be “no
greater than the power collectively exercised by private boards of
directors.”11 There is, in a competitive society, nobody who can
exercise even a fraction of the power which a socialist planning board
would possess, and if nobody can consciously use the power, it is just
an abuse of words to assert that it rests with all the capitalists put
together.12 It is merely a play upon words to speak of the “power
collectively exercised by private boards of directors” so long as they
do not combine to concerted action— which would, of course, mean the end
of competition and the creation of a planned economy. To split or
decentralize power is necessarily to reduce the absolute amount of
power, and the competitive system is the only system designed to
minimize by decentralization the power exercised by man over man.</p>
<p>We have seen before how the separation of economic and political aims
is an essential guaranty of individual freedom and how it is
consequently attacked by all collectivists. To this we must now add that
the “substitution of political for economic power” now so often demanded
means necessarily the substitution of power from which there is no
escape for a power which is always limited. What is called economic
power, while it can be an instrument of coercion, is, in the hands of
private individuals, never exclusive or complete power, never power over
the whole life of a person. But centralized as an instrument of
political power it creates a degree of dependence scarcely
distinguishable from slavery.</p>
<p>From the two central features of every collectivist system, the need
for a commonly accepted system of ends of the group and the
all-overriding desire to give to the group the maximum of power to
achieve these ends, grows a definite system of morals, which on some
points coincides and on others violently contrasts with ours—but differs
from it in one point which makes it doubtful whether we can call it
morals: that it does not leave the individual conscience free to apply
its own rules and does not even know any general rules which the
individual is required or allowed to observe in all circumstances. This
makes collectivist morals so different from what we have known as morals
that we find it difficult to discover any principle in them, which they
nevertheless possess.</p>
<p>The difference of principle is very much the same as that which we
have already considered in connection with the Rule of Law. Like formal
law, the rules of individualist ethics, however unprecise they may be in
many respects, are general and absolute; they prescribe or prohibit a
general type of action irrespective of whether in the particular
instance the ultimate purpose is good or bad. To cheat or steal, to
torture or betray a confidence, is held to be bad, irrespective of
whether or not in the particular instance any harm follows from it.
Neither the fact that in a given instance nobody may be the worse for
it, nor any high purpose for which such an act may have been committed,
can alter the fact that it is bad. Though we may sometimes be forced to
choose between different evils, they remain evils.</p>
<p>The principle that the end justifies the means is in individualist
ethics regarded as the denial of all morals. In collectivist ethics it
becomes necessarily the supreme rule; there is literally nothing which
the consistent collectivist must not be prepared to do if it serves “the
good of the whole,” because the “good of the whole” is to him the only
criterion of what ought to be done. The raison d’état, in which
collectivist ethics has found its most explicit formulation, knows no
other limit than that set by expediency—the suitability of the
particular act for the end in view. And what the raison d’état affirms
with respect to the relations between different countries applies
equally to the relations between different individuals within the
collectivist state. There can be no limit to what its citizen must be
prepared to do, no act which his conscience must prevent him from
committing, if it is necessary for an end which the community has set
itself or which his superiors order him to achieve.</p>
<p>The absence of absolute formal rules in collectivist ethics does not,
of course, mean that there are not some useful habits of the individuals
which a collectivist community will encourage and others which it will
discourage. Quite the reverse; it will take a much greater interest in
the individual’s habits of life than an individualist community. To be a
useful member of a collectivist society requires very definite qualities
which must be strengthened by constant practice. The reason why we
designate these qualities as “useful habits” and can hardly describe
them as moral virtues is that the individual could never be allowed to
put these rules above any definite orders or to let them become an
obstacle to the achievement of any of the particular aims of his
community. They only serve, as it were, to fill any gaps which direct
orders or the designation of particular aims may leave, but they can
never justify a conflict with the will of the authority.</p>
<p>The differences between the virtues which will continue to be
esteemed under a collectivist system and those which will disappear is
well illustrated by a comparison of the virtues which even their worst
enemies admit the Germans, or rather the “typical Prussian,” to possess,
and those of which they are commonly thought lacking and in which the
English people, with some justification, used to pride themselves as
excelling. Few people will deny that the Germans on the whole are
industrious and disciplined, thorough and energetic to the degree of
ruthlessness, conscientious and single-minded in any tasks they
undertake; that they possess a strong sense of order, duty, and strict
obedience to authority; and that they often show great readiness to make
personal sacrifices and great courage in physical danger. All these make
the German an efficient instrument in carrying out an assigned task, and
they have accordingly been carefully nurtured in the old Prussian state
and the new Prussian-dominated Reich. What the “typical German” is often
thought to lack are the individualist virtues of tolerance and respect
for other individuals and their opinions, of independence of mind and
that uprightness of character and readiness to defend one’s own
convictions against a superior which the Germans themselves, usually
conscious that they lack it, call Zivilcourage, of consideration for the
weak and infirm, and of that healthy contempt and dislike of power which
only an old tradition of personal liberty creates. Deficient they seem
also in most of those little yet so important qualities which facilitate
the intercourse between men in a free society: kindliness and a sense of
humor, personal modesty, and respect for the privacy and belief in the
good intentions of one’s neighbor.</p>
<p>After what we have already said it will not cause surprise that these
individualist virtues are at the same time eminently social
virtues—virtues which smooth social contacts and which make control from
above less necessary and at the same time more difficult. They are
virtues which flourish wherever the individualist or commercial type of
society has prevailed and which are missing according as the
collectivist or military type of society predominates—a difference which
is, or was, as noticeable between the various regions of Germany as it
has now become of the views which rule in Germany and those
characteristic of the West. Until recently, at least, in those parts of
Germany which have been longest exposed to the civilizing forces of
commerce, the old commercial towns of the south and west and the Hanse
towns, the general moral concepts were probably much more akin to those
of the Western people than to those which have now become dominant all
over Germany.</p>
<p>It would, however, be highly unjust to regard the masses of the
totalitarian people as devoid of moral fervor because they give
unstinted support to a system which to us seems a denial of most moral
values. For the great majority of them the opposite is probably true:
the intensity of the moral emotions behind a movement like that of
National Socialism or communism can probably be compared only to those
of the great religious movements of history. Once you admit that the
individual is merely a means to serve the ends of the higher entity
called society or the nation, most of those features of totalitarian
regimes which horrify us follow of necessity. From the collectivist
standpoint intolerance and brutal suppression of dissent, the complete
disregard of the life and happiness of the individual, are essential and
unavoidable consequences of this basic premise, and the collectivist can
admit this and at the same time claim that his system is superior to one
in which the “selfish” interests of the individual are allowed to
obstruct the full realization of the ends the community pursues. When
German philosophers again and again represent the striving for personal
happiness as itself immoral and only the fulfilment of an imposed duty
as praiseworthy, they are perfectly sincere, however difficult this may
be to understand for those who have been brought up in a different
tradition.</p>
<p>Where there is one common all-overriding end, there is no room for
any general morals or rules. To a limited extent we ourselves experience
this in wartime. But even war and the greatest peril had led in the
democratic countries only to a very moderate approach to
totalitarianism, very little setting-aside of all other values in the
service of a single purpose. But where a few specific ends dominate the
whole of society, it is inevitable that occasionally cruelty may become
a duty; that acts which revolt all our feeling, such as the shooting of
hostages or the killing of the old or sick, should be treated as mere
matters of expediency; that the compulsory uprooting and transportation
of hundreds of thousand should become an instrument of policy approved
by almost everybody except the victims; or that suggestions like that of
a “conscription of woman for breeding purposes” can be seriously
contemplated. There is always in the eyes of the collectivist a greater
goal which these acts serve and which to him justifies them because the
pursuit of the common end of society can know no limits in any rights or
values of any individual.</p>
<p>But while for the mass of the citizens of the totalitarian state it
is often unselfish devotion to an ideal, although one that is repellent
to us, which makes them approve and even perform such deeds, this cannot
be pleaded for those who guide its policy. To be a useful assistant in
the running of a totalitarian state, it is not enough that a man should
be prepared to accept specious justification of vile deeds; he must
himself be prepared actively to break every moral rule he has ever known
if this seems necessary to achieve the end set for him. Since it is the
supreme leader who alone determines the ends, his instruments must have
no moral convictions of their own. They must, above all, be unreservedly
committed to the person of the leader; but next to this the most
important thing is that they should be completely unprincipled and
literally capable of everything. They must have no ideals of their own
which they want to realize; no ideas about right or wrong which might
interfere with the intentions of the leader. There is thus in the
positions of power little to attract those who hold moral beliefs of the
kind which in the past have guided the European peoples, little which
could compensate for the distastefulness of many of the particular
tasks, and little opportunity to gratify any more idealistic desires, to
recompense for the undeniable risk, the sacrifice of most of the
pleasures of private life and of personal independence which the posts
of great responsibility involve. The only tastes which are satisfied are
the taste for power as such and the pleasure of being obeyed and of
being part of a well-functioning and immensely powerful machine to which
everything else must give way.</p>
<p>Yet while there is little that is likely to induce men who are good
by our standards to aspire to leading positions in the totalitarian
machine, and much to deter them, there will be special opportunities for
the ruthless and unscrupulous. There will be jobs to be done about the
badness of which taken by themselves nobody has any doubt, but which
have to be done in the service of some higher end, and which have to be
executed with the same expertness and efficiency as any others. And as
there will be need for actions which are bad in themselves, and which
all those still influenced by traditional morals will be reluctant to
perform, the readiness to do bad things becomes a path to promotion and
power. The positions in a totalitarian society in which it is necessary
to practice cruelty and intimidation, deliberate deception and spying,
are numerous. Neither the Gestapo nor the administration of a
concentration camp, neither the Ministry of Propaganda nor the SA or SS
(or their Italian or Russian counterparts), are suitable places for the
exercise of humanitarian feelings.13 Yet it is through positions like
these that the road to the highest positions in the totalitarian state
leads. It is only too true when a distinguished American economist
concludes from a similar brief enumeration of the duties of the
authorities of a collectivist state that “they would have to do these
things whether they wanted to or not: and the probability of the people
in power being individuals who would dislike the possession and exercise
of power is on a level with the probability that an extremely
tender-hearted person would get the job of whipping-master in a slave
plantation.”14</p>
<p>We cannot, however, exhaust this subject here. The problem of the
selection of the leaders is closely bound up with the wide problem of
selection according to the opinions held, or rather according to the
readiness with which a person conforms to an ever changing set of
doctrines. And this leads us to one of the most characteristic moral
features of totalitarianism: its relation to, and its effect on, all the
virtues falling under the general heading of truthfulness. This is so
big a subject that it requires a separate chapter.</p>

<p>2 (Hayek’s list comprises a rogue’s gallery of infamous National
Socialist “blackguards and thugs.” Journalist and politician Julius
Streicher (1885–1946), an early associate of Hitler’s, is remembered for
the vehemence of his persecution of the Jews in his newspaper Der
Stürmer. He was convicted of war crimes at Nuremburg and hanged. Manfred
von Killinger (1886–1944) made his name in the early 1920s for his role
in the assassination of Matthias Erzberger, the politician who signed
the armistice. A member of the SA (Sturmabteilung), the brown-shirted
storm troopers that served as the early army of the Nazi party, he later
entered the diplomatic service. Killinger committed suicide in Bucharest
as the Soviet army was entering the city. Robert Ley (1890–1945) was the
guiding force behind the forced reorganization of the trade unions into
a single labor front, as well as the Kraft durch Freude recreational
movement within it. He hanged himself in Nuremberg before the
proceedings there began. Edmund Heines (1897–1934) was a general in the
SA and intimate associate of its leader, Ernst Röhm. He was executed in
June 1934 during the “Night of the Long Knives” in which Hitler purged
elements of the SA. Following the purge, the black-shirted SS
(Schutztaffel ), which began as Hitler’s personal bodyguard, was
elevated above the SA, and Heinrich Himmler (1900–1945) was put in
charge of both the SS and the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei), or secret
state police. Himmler expanded and transformed the SS into an elite
guard that had among its tasks the administration of the concentration
and extermination camps. Chief architect of the holocaust, Himmler
escaped the executioner by swallowing a cyanide tablet after his capture
by the British. Reinhard Heydrich (1904–1942), known as “the hangman,”
was second in command to Himmler in the Gestapo. He was assassinated by
the Czech resistance in 1942; the village of Lidice was razed and all
its men executed in reprisal. —Ed.)</p>

<p>4 It is entirely in the spirit of collectivism when Nietzsche makes
his Zarathustra say:</p>
<p>“A thousand goals have existed hitherto, for a thousand people
existed. But the fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking, the one
goal is still lacking. Humanity has no goal yet.</p>
<p>“But tell me, I pray, my brethren: if the goal be lacking to
humanity, is not humanity itself lacking?”</p>

<p>8 Cf. Karl Marx, Revolution and Counter-revolution, and Engels’s
letter to Marx, May 23, 1851. (Revolution and Counter-revolution is a
history of the revolution of 1848, written by Friedrich Engels and
originally published as articles in the New York Tribune between October
1851 and September 1852. It is reprinted in Friedrich Engels, The German
Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), and the
discussion of the Poles and the “Tschechs” may be found on pp. 174–81.
Though written by Engels, the articles were sent to the newspaper
through Marx and published under Marx’s name, which is why Hayek refers
to Marx, rather than Engels, as the author.</p>
<p>Here is part of what Engels wrote to Marx in his letter of May 23,
1851: “The more I think about it, the more obvious it becomes to me that
the Poles are une nation foutue (a finished nation) who can only
continue to serve a purpose until such time as Russia herself becomes
caught up into the agrarian revolution. From that moment Poland will
have absolutely no raison d’être any more. The Poles’ sole contribution
to history has been to indulge in foolish pranks at once valiant and
provocative. Nor can a single moment be cited when Poland, even if only
by comparison with Russia, has successfully represented progress or done
anything of historical significance.” The Marx-Engels correspondence is

<p>9 (Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) wrote principally
about the Italian renaissance and Greek civilization, hoping that
knowledge of the foundations of European culture would serve as a
bulwark against the social, political, and cultural upheavals that he
witnessed in the nineteenth century. In his book Force and Freedom:
Reflections on History, trans. James Hastings Nichols (New York:
Pantheon, 1943), based on lectures he had delivered just prior to the
formation of the German Empire, he presciently warned about coming
periods of great national wars and of the dangers of all-powerful
states. British philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), who made
important contributions to the foundations of mathematics, logic, and
analytic philosophy, was also a public figure famous for his antiwar
activities, his frequent marriages and even more numerous affairs, and,
later in life, his support of nuclear disarmament. —Ed.)</p>

<p>12 We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the fact that the
word “power,” apart from the sense in which it is used with respect to
human beings, is also used in an impersonal (or rather anthropomorphic)
sense for any determining cause. Of course, there will always be
something that determines everything that happens, and in this sense the
amount of power existing must always be the same. But this is not true
of the power consciously wielded by human beings.</p>
