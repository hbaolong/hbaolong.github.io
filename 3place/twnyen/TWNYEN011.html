<h4 id="seven">SEVEN</h4>
<p>ECONOMIC CONTROL AND TOTALITARIANISM</p>
<p>The control of the production of wealth is the control of human life
itself.</p>
<p>—Hilaire Belloc1</p>
<p>Most planners who have seriously considered the practical aspects of
their task have little doubt that a directed economy must be run on more
or less dictatorial lines. That the complex system of interrelated
activities, if it is to be consciously directed at all, must be directed
by a single staff of experts, and that ultimate responsibility and power
must rest in the hands of a commander-in-chief whose actions must not be
fettered by democratic procedure, is too obvious a consequence of
underlying ideas of central planning not to command fairly general
assent. The consolation our planners offer us is that this authoritarian
direction will apply “only” to economic matters. One of the most
prominent economic planners, Stuart Chase, assures us, for instance,
that in a planned society “political democracy can remain if it confines
itself to all but economic matters.”2 Such assurances are usually
accompanied by the suggestion that, by giving up freedom in what are, or
ought to be, the less important aspects of our lives, we shall obtain
greater freedom in the pursuit of higher values. On this ground people
who abhor the idea of a political dictatorship often clamor for a
dictator in the economic field.</p>
<p>The arguments used appeal to our best instincts and often attract the
finest minds. If planning really did free us from the less important
cares and so made it easier to render our existence one of plain living
and high thinking, who would wish to belittle such an ideal? If our
economic activities really concerned only the inferior or even more
sordid sides of life, of course we ought to endeavor by all means to
find a way to relieve ourselves from the excessive care for material
ends and, leaving them to be cared for by some piece of utilitarian
machinery, set our minds free for the higher things of life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the assurance people derive from this belief that the
power which is exercised over economic life is a power over matters of
secondary importance only, and which makes them take lightly the threat
to the freedom of our economic pursuits, is altogether unwarranted. It
is largely a consequence of the erroneous belief that there are purely
economic ends separate from the other ends of life. Yet, apart from the
pathological case of the miser, there is no such thing. The ultimate
ends of the activities of reasonable beings are never economic. Strictly
speaking, there is no “economic motive” but only economic factors
conditioning our striving for other ends. What in ordinary language is
misleadingly called the “economic motive” means merely the desire for
general opportunity, the desire for power to achieve unspecified ends.3
If we strive for money, it is because it offers us the widest choice in
enjoying the fruits of our efforts. Because in modern society it is
through the limitation of our money incomes that we are made to feel the
restrictions which our relative poverty still imposes upon us, many have
come to hate money as the symbol of these restrictions. But this is to
mistake for the cause the medium through which a force makes itself
felt. It would be much truer to say that money is one of the greatest
instruments of freedom ever invented by man. It is money which in
existing society opens an astounding range of choice to the poor man—a
range greater than that which not many generations ago was open to the
wealthy. We shall better understand the significance of this service of
money if we consider what it would really mean if, as so many socialists
characteristically propose, the “pecuniary motive” were largely
displaced by “noneconomic incentives.” If all rewards, instead of being
offered in money, were offered in the form of public distinctions or
privileges, positions of power over other men, or better housing or
better food, opportunities for travel or education, this would merely
mean that the recipient would no longer be allowed to choose and that
whoever fixed the reward determined not only its size but also the
particular form in which it should be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Once we realize that there is no separate economic motive and that an
economic gain or economic loss is merely a gain or a loss where it is
still in our power to decide which of our needs or desires shall be
affected, it is also easier to see the important kernel of truth in the
general belief that economic matters affect only the less important ends
of life and to understand the contempt in which “merely” economic
considerations are often held. In a sense this is quite justified in a
market economy—but only in such a free economy. So long as we can freely
dispose over our income and all our possessions, economic loss will
always deprive us only of what we regard as the least important of the
desires we were able to satisfy. A “merely” economic loss is thus one
whose effect we can still make fall on our less important needs, while
when we say that the value of something we have lost is much greater
than its economic value, or that it cannot even be estimated in economic
terms, this means that we must bear the loss where it falls. And
similarly with an economic gain. Economic changes, in other words,
usually affect only the fringe, the “margin,” of our needs. There are
many things which are more important than anything which economic gains
or losses are likely to affect, which for us stand high above the
amenities and even above many of the necessities of life which are
affected by the economic ups and downs. Compared with them, the “filthy
lucre,” the question whether we are economically somewhat worse or
better off, seems of little importance. This makes many people believe
that anything which, like economic planning, affects only our economic
interests cannot seriously interfere with the more basic values of
life.</p>
<p>This, however, is an erroneous conclusion. Economic values are less
important to us than many things precisely because in economic matters
we are free to decide what to us is more, and what less, important. Or,
as we might say, because in the present society it is we who have to
solve the economic problems of our lives. To be controlled in our
economic pursuits means to be always controlled unless we declare our
specific purpose. Or, since when we declare our specific purpose we
shall also have to get it approved, we should really be controlled in
everything.</p>
<p>The question raised by economic planning is, therefore, not merely
whether we shall be able to satisfy what we regard as our more or less
important needs in the way we prefer. It is whether it shall be we who
decide what is more, and what is less, important for us, or whether this
is to be decided by the planner. Economic planning would not affect
merely those of our marginal needs that we have in mind when we speak
contemptuously about the merely economic. It would, in effect, mean that
we as individuals should no longer be allowed to decide what we regard
as marginal.</p>
<p>The authority directing all economic activity would control not
merely the part of our lives which is concerned with inferior things; it
would control the allocation of the limited means for all our ends. And
whoever controls all economic activity controls the means for all our
ends and must therefore decide which are to be satisfied and which not.
This is really the crux of the matter. Economic control is not merely
control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest;
it is the control of the means for all our ends. And whoever has sole
control of the means must also determine which ends are to be served,
which values are to be rated higher and which lower—in short, what men
should believe and strive for. Central planning means that the economic
problem is to be solved by the community instead of by the individual;
but this involves that it must also be the community, or rather its
representatives, who must decide the relative importance of the
different needs.</p>
<p>The so-called economic freedom which the planners promise us means
precisely that we are to be relieved of the necessity of solving our own
economic problems and that the bitter choices which this often involves
are to be made for us. Since under modern conditions we are for almost
everything dependent on means which our fellow-men provide, economic
planning would involve direction of almost the whole of our life. There
is hardly an aspect of it, from our primary needs to our relations with
our family and friends, from the nature of our work to the use of our
leisure, over which the planner would not exercise his “conscious
control.”4</p>
<p>The power of the planner over our private lives would be no less
complete if he chose not to exercise it by direct control of our
consumption. Although a planned society would probably to some extent
employ rationing and similar devices, the power of the planner over our
private lives does not depend on this and would be hardly less effective
if the consumer were nominally free to spend his income as he pleased.
The source of this power over all consumption which in a planned society
the authority would possess would be its control over production.</p>
<p>Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact
that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to
another. But if we face a monopolist we are at his mercy. And an
authority directing the whole economic system would be the most powerful
monopolist conceivable. While we need probably not be afraid that such
an authority would exploit this power in the manner in which a private
monopolist would do so, while its purpose would presumably not be the
extortion of maximum financial gain, it would have complete power to
decide what we are to be given and on what terms. It would not only
decide what commodities and services were to be available and in what
quantities; it would be able to direct their distribution between
districts and groups and could, if it wished, discriminate between
persons to any degree it liked. If we remember why planning is advocated
by most people, can there be much doubt that this power would be used
for the ends of which the authority approves and to prevent the pursuits
of ends which it disapproves?</p>
<p>The power conferred by the control of production and prices is almost
unlimited. In a competitive society the prices we have to pay for a
thing, the rate at which we can get one thing for another, depend on the
quantities of other things of which by taking one, we deprive the other
members of society. This price is not determined by the conscious will
of anybody. And if one way of achieving our ends proves too expensive
for us, we are free to try other ways. The obstacles in our path are not
due to someone’s disapproving of our ends but to the fact that the same
means are also wanted elsewhere. In a directed economy, where the
authority watches over the ends pursued, it is certain that it would use
its powers to assist some ends and to prevent the realization of others.
Not our own view, but somebody else’s, of what we ought to like or
dislike would determine what we should get. And since the authority
would have the power to thwart any efforts to elude its guidance, it
would control what we consume almost as effectively as if it directly
told us how to spend our income.</p>
<p>Not only in our capacity as consumers, however, and not even mainly
in that capacity, would the will of the authority shape and “guide” our
daily lives. It would do so even more in our position as producers.
These two aspects of our lives cannot be separated; and as for most of
us the time we spend at our work is a large part of our whole lives, and
as our job usually also determines the place where and the people among
whom we live, some freedom in choosing our work is, probably, even more
important for our happiness than freedom to spend our income during the
hours of leisure.</p>
<p>No doubt it is true that even in the best of worlds this freedom will
be very limited. Few people ever have an abundance of choice of
occupation. But what matters is that we have some choice, that we are
not absolutely tied to a particular job which has been chosen for us, or
which we may have chosen in the past, and that if one position becomes
quite intolerable, or if we set our heart on another, there is almost
always a way for the able, some sacrifice at the price of which he may
achieve his goal. Nothing makes conditions more unbearable than the
knowledge that no effort of ours can change them; and even if we should
never have the strength of mind to make the necessary sacrifice, the
knowledge that we could escape if we only strove hard enough makes many
otherwise intolerable positions bearable.</p>
<p>This is not to say that in this respect all is for the best in our
present world, or has been so in the most liberal past, and that there
is not much that could be done to improve the opportunities of choice
open to the people. Here as elsewhere the state can do a great deal to
help the spreading of knowledge and information and to assist mobility.
But the point is that the kind of state action which really would
increase opportunity is almost precisely the opposite of the “planning”
which is now generally advocated and practiced. Most planners, it is
true, promise that in the new planned world free choice of occupation
will be scrupulously preserved or even increased. But there they promise
more than they can possibly fulfill. If they want to plan, they must
control the entry into the different trades and occupations, or the
terms of remuneration, or both. In almost all known instances of
planning, the establishment of such controls and restrictions was among
the first measures taken. If such control were universally practiced and
exercised by a single planning authority, one needs little imagination
to see what would become of the “free choice of occupation” promised.
The “freedom of choice” would be purely fictitious, a mere promise to
practice no discrimination where in the nature of the case
discrimination must be practiced, and where all one could hope would be
that the selection would be made on what the authority believed to be
objective grounds.</p>
<p>There would be little difference if the planning authority confined
itself to fixing the terms of employment and tried to regulate numbers
by adjusting these terms. By prescribing the remuneration, it would no
less effectively bar groups of people from entering many trades than by
specifically excluding them. A rather plain girl who badly wants to
become a saleswoman, a weakly boy who has set his heart on a job where
his weakness handicaps him, as well as in general the apparently less
able or less suitable are not necessarily excluded in a competitive
society; if they value the position sufficiently they will frequently be
able to get a start by a financial sacrifice and will later make good
through qualities which at first are not so obvious. But when the
authority fixes the remunerations for a whole category and the selection
among the candidates is made by an objective test, the strength of their
desire for the job will count for very little. The person whose
qualifications are not of the standard type, or whose temperament is not
of the ordinary kind, will no longer be able to come to special
arrangements with an employer whose dispositions will fit in with his
special needs: the person who prefers irregular hours or even a
happy-go-lucky existence with a small and perhaps uncertain income to a
regular routine will no longer have the choice. Conditions will be
without exception what in some measure they inevitably are in a large
organization—or rather worse, because there will be no possibility of
escape. We shall no longer be free to be rational or efficient only when
and where we think it worth while; we shall all have to conform to the
standards which the planning authority must fix in order to simplify its
task. To make this immense task manageable, it will have to reduce the
diversity of human capacities and inclinations to a few categories of
readily interchangeable units and deliberately to disregard minor
personal differences.</p>
<p>Although the professed aim of planning would be that man should cease
to be a mere means, in fact—since it would be impossible to take account
in the plan of individual likes and dislikes—the individual would more
than ever become a mere means, to be used by the authority in the
service of such abstractions as the “social welfare” or the “good of the
community.”</p>
<p>That in a competitive society most things can be had at a
price—though it is often a cruelly high price we have to pay—is a fact
the importance of which can hardly be overrated. The alternative is not,
however, complete freedom of choice, but orders and prohibitions which
must be obeyed and, in the last resort, the favor of the mighty.</p>
<p>It is significant of the confusion prevailing on all these subjects
that it should have become a cause for reproach that in a competitive
society almost everything can be had at a price. If the people who
protest against having the higher values of life brought into the “cash
nexus” really mean that we should not be allowed to sacrifice our lesser
needs in order to preserve the higher values, and that the choice should
be made for us, this demand must be regarded as rather peculiar and
scarcely testifies to great respect for the dignity of the individual.
That life and health, beauty and virtue, honor and peace of mind, can
often be preserved only at considerable material cost, and that somebody
must make the choice, is as undeniable as that we all are sometimes not
prepared to make the material sacrifices necessary to protect those
higher values against all injury.</p>
<p>To take only one example: We could, of course, reduce casualties by
automobile accidents to zero if we were willing to bear the cost—if in
no other way—by abolishing automobiles. And the same is true of
thousands of other instances in which we are constantly risking life and
health and all the fine values of the spirit, of ourselves and of our
fellow-men, to further what we at the same time contemptuously describe
as our material comfort. Nor can it be otherwise, since all our ends
compete for the same means; and we could not strive for anything but
these absolute values if they were on no account to be endangered.</p>
<p>That people should wish to be relieved of the bitter choice which
hard facts often impose upon them is not surprising. But few want to be
relieved through having the choice made for them by others. People just
wish that the choice should not be necessary at all. And they are only
too ready to believe that the choice is not really necessary, that it is
imposed upon them merely by the particular economic system under which
we live. What they resent is, in truth, that there is an economic
problem.</p>
<p>In their wishful belief that there is really no longer an economic
problem people have been confirmed by irresponsible talk about
“potential plenty”— which, if it were a fact, would indeed mean that
there is no economic problem which makes the choice inevitable. But
although this snare has served socialist propaganda under various names
as long as socialism has existed, it is still as palpably untrue as it
was when it was first used over a hundred years ago. In all this time
not one of the many people who have used it has produced a workable plan
of how production could be increased so as to abolish even in western
Europe what we regard as poverty—not to speak of the world as a whole.
The reader may take it that whoever talks about potential plenty is
either dishonest or does not know what he is talking about.5 Yet it is
this false hope as much as anything which drives us along the road to
planning.</p>
<p>While the popular movement still profits by this false belief, the
claim that a planned economy would produce a substantially larger output
than the competitive system is being progressively abandoned by most
students of the problem. Even a good many economists with socialist
views who have seriously studied the problems of central planning are
now content to hope that a planned society will equal the efficiency of
a competitive system; they advocate planning no longer because of its
superior productivity but because it will enable us to secure a more
just and equitable distribution of wealth. This is, indeed, the only
argument for planning which can be seriously pressed. It is indisputable
that if we want to secure a distribution of wealth which conforms to
some predetermined standard, if we want consciously to decide who is to
have what, we must plan the whole economic system. But the question
remains whether the price we should have to pay for the realization of
somebody’s ideal of justice is not bound to be more discontent and more
oppression than was ever caused by the much-abused free play of economic
forces.</p>
<p>We should be seriously deceiving ourselves if for these apprehensions
we sought comfort in the consideration that the adoption of central
planning would merely mean a return, after a brief spell of a free
economy, to the ties and regulations which have governed economic
activity through most ages, and that therefore the infringements of
personal liberty need not be greater than they were before the age of
laissez faire. This is a dangerous illusion. Even during the periods of
European history when the regimentation of economic life went furthest,
it amounted to little more than the creation of a general and
semipermanent framework of rules within which the individual preserved a
wide free sphere. The apparatus of control then available would not have
been adequate to impose more than very general directions. And even
where the control was most complete it extended only to those activities
of a person through which he took part in the social division of labor.
In the much wider sphere in which he then still lived on his own
products, he was free to act as he chose.</p>
<p>The situation is now entirely different. During the liberal era the
progressive division of labor has created a situation where almost every
one of our activities is part of a social process. This is a development
which we cannot reverse, since it is only because of it that we can
maintain the vastly increased population at anything like present
standards. But, in consequence, the substitution of central planning for
competition would require central direction of a much greater part of
our lives than was ever attempted before. It could not stop at what we
regard as our economic activities, because we are now for almost every
part of our lives dependent on somebody else’s economic activities.6 The
passion for the “collective satisfaction of our needs,” with which our
socialists have so well prepared the way for totalitarianism, and which
wants us to take our pleasures as well as our necessities at the
appointed time and in the prescribed form, is, of course, partly
intended as a means of political education. But it is also the result of
the exigencies of planning, which consists essentially in depriving us
of choice, in order to give us whatever fits best into the plan and that
at a time determined by the plan.</p>
<p>It is often said that political freedom is meaningless without
economic freedom. This is true enough, but in a sense almost opposite
from that in which the phrase is used by our planners. The economic
freedom which is the prerequisite of any other freedom cannot be the
freedom from economic care which the socialists promise us and which can
be obtained only by relieving the individual at the same time of the
necessity and of the power of choice; it must be the freedom of our
economic activity which, with the right of choice, inevitably also
carries the risk and the responsibility of that right.</p>

source, may be found in Walter Lippmann, “The Collectivist Movement in
Practice,” Atlantic Monthly, vol. 158, December 1936, p. 729.
Accountant, freelance writer, and prolific author Stuart Chase
(1888–1985) was a popular writer in the interwar years. Among his many
books on economics were The Tragedy of Waste (New York: Macmillan, 1925)
and A New Deal (New York: Macmillan, 1934). —Ed.)</p>
<p>3 Cf. Lionel Robbins, The Economic Causes of War (London: J. Cape,
1939), Appendix. (British economist Lionel Robbins (1898–1984) was
Hayek’s close friend and colleague at the London School of Economics. In
his appendix, Robbins discusses the meaning of the term “economic
causation,” and concludes “The causes of war are to be regarded as
economic if the objective is purely instrumental to securing for some
person or persons a greater command of resources in general. . . . They
are to be regarded as non-economic if the objective is not instrumental
to anything further—if it is definitely an end in itself rather than
means for a number of ends.” Op. cit., p. 118. —Ed.)</p>
<p>4 The extent of the control over all life that economic control
confers is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of foreign
exchanges. Nothing would at first seem to affect private life less than
a state control of the dealings in foreign exchange, and most people
will regard its introduction with complete indifference. Yet the
experience of most Continental countries has taught thoughtful people to
regard this step as the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism
and the suppression of individual liberty. It is, in fact, the complete
delivery of the individual to the tyranny of the state, the final
suppression of all means of escape—not merely for the rich but for
everybody. Once the individual is no longer free to travel, no longer
free to buy foreign books or journals, once all the means of foreign
contact can be restricted to those of whom official opinion approves or
for whom it is regarded as necessary, the effective control of opinion
is much greater than that ever exercised by any of the absolutist
governments of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>
<p>5 To justify these strong words, the following conclusions may be
quoted at which Colin Clark, one of the best known among the younger
economic statisticians and a man of undoubted progressive views and a
strictly scientific outlook, has arrived in his The Conditions of
Economic Progress (London: Macmillan, 1940), pp. 3–4: The “oft-repeated
phrases about poverty in the midst of plenty, and the problems of
production having already been solved if only we understood the problem
of distribution, turn out to be the most untruthful of all modern
clichés. . . . The under-utilisation of productive capacity is a
question of considerable importance only in the U.S.A., though in
certain years also it has been of some importance in Great Britain,
Germany and France, but for most of the world it is entirely subsidiary
to the more important fact that, with productive resources fully
employed, they can produce so little. The age of plenty will still be a
long while in coming. . . . If preventable unemployment were eliminated
throughout the trade cycle, this would mean a distinct improvement in
the standard of living of the population of the U.S.A., but from the
standpoint of the world as a whole it would only make a small
contribution towards the much greater problem of raising the real income
of the bulk of the world population to anything like a civilised
standard.” (British statistician and economist Colin Clark (1905–1989)
taught and held government positions in England, the United States, and
Australia. Active in the Labour party in the 1920s and early 1930s
(hence his “undoubted progressive views”), he was a pioneer in the
estimation of national income statistics. —Ed.)</p>
<p>6 It is no accident that in the totalitarian countries, be it Russia
or Germany or Italy, the question of how to organize the people’s
leisure has become a problem of planning. The Germans have even invented
for this problem the horrible and self-contradictory name of
Freizeitgestaltung (literally: the shaping of the use made of the
people’s free time), as if it were still “free time” when it has to be
spent in the way ordained by authority.</p>
