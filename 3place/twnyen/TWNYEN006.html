<h4 id="two">TWO</h4>
<p>THE GREAT UTOPIA</p>
<p>What has always made the state a hell on earth has been precisely
that man has tried to make it his heaven. —Hölderlin1</p>
<p>That socialism has displaced liberalism as the doctrine held by the
great majority of progressives does not simply mean that people had
forgotten the warnings of the great liberal thinkers of the past about
the consequences of collectivism. It has happened because they were
persuaded of the very opposite of what these men had predicted. The
extraordinary thing is that the same socialism that was not only early
recognized as the gravest threat to freedom, but quite openly began as a
reaction against the liberalism of the French Revolution, gained general
acceptance under the flag of liberty. It is rarely remembered now that
socialism in its beginnings was frankly authoritarian. The French
writers who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no doubt that
their ideas could be put into practice only by a strong dictatorial
government. To them socialism meant an attempt to “terminate the
revolution” by a deliberate reorganization of society on hierarchical
lines and by the imposition of a coercive “spiritual power.” Where
freedom was concerned, the founders of socialism made no bones about
their intentions. Freedom of thought they regarded as the root-evil of
nineteenth-century society, and the first of modern planners,
Saint-Simon, even predicted that those who did not obey his proposed
planning boards would be “treated as cattle.”2</p>
<p>Only under the influence of the strong democratic currents preceding
the revolution of 1848 did socialism begin to ally itself with the
forces of freedom. But it took the new “democratic socialism” a long
time to live down the suspicions aroused by its antecedents. Nobody saw
more clearly than Tocqueville that democracy as an essentially
individualist institution stood in an irreconcilable conflict with
socialism:</p>
<p>“Democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom,” he said in
1848; “socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible value to
each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a mere number.
Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word: equality.
But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty,
socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude.”3</p>
<p>To allay these suspicions and to harness to its cart the strongest of
all political motives—the craving for freedom—socialism began
increasingly to make use of the promise of a “new freedom.” The coming
of socialism was to be the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm
of freedom. It was to bring “economic freedom,” without which the
political freedom already gained was “not worth having.” Only socialism
was capable of effecting the consummation of the age-long struggle for
freedom, in which the attainment of political freedom was but a first
step.</p>
<p>The subtle change in meaning to which the word “freedom” was
subjected in order that this argument should sound plausible is
important. To the great apostles of political freedom the word had meant
freedom from coercion, freedom from the arbitrary power of other men,
release from the ties which left the individual no choice but obedience
to the orders of a superior to whom he was attached. The new freedom
promised, however, was to be freedom from necessity, release from the
compulsion of the circumstances which inevitably limit the range of
choice of all of us, although for some very much more than for others.
Before man could be truly free, the “despotism of physical want” had to
be broken, the “restraints of the economic system” relaxed.</p>
<p>Freedom in this sense is, of course, merely another name for power4
or wealth. Yet, although the promises of this new freedom were often
coupled with irresponsible promises of a great increase in material
wealth in a socialist society, it was not from such an absolute conquest
of the niggardliness of nature that economic freedom was expected. What
the promise really amounted to was that the great existing disparities
in the range of choice of different people were to disappear. The demand
for the new freedom was thus only another name for the old demand for an
equal distribution of wealth. But the new name gave the socialists
another word in common with the liberals, and they exploited it to the
full. And, although the word was used in a different sense by the two
groups, few people noticed this and still fewer asked themselves whether
the two kinds of freedom promised could really be combined.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the promise of greater freedom has become
one of the most effective weapons of socialist propaganda and that the
belief that socialism would bring freedom is genuine and sincere. But
this would only heighten the tragedy if it should prove that what was
promised to us as the Road to Freedom was in fact the High Road to
Servitude. Unquestionably, the promise of more freedom was responsible
for luring more and more liberals along the socialist road, for blinding
them to the conflict which exists between the basic principles of
socialism and liberalism, and for often enabling socialists to usurp the
very name of the old party of freedom. Socialism was embraced by the
greater part of the intelligentsia as the apparent heir of the liberal
tradition: therefore it is not surprising that to them the idea of
socialism’s leading to the opposite of liberty should appear
inconceivable.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the old apprehensions of the unforeseen
consequences of socialism have once more been strongly voiced from the
most unexpected quarters. Observer after observer, in spite of the
contrary expectation with which he approached his subject, has been
impressed with the extraordinary similarity in many respects of the
conditions under “fascism” and “communism.” While “progressives” in
England and elsewhere were still deluding themselves that communism and
fascism represented opposite poles, more and more people began to ask
themselves whether these new tyrannies were not the outcome of the same
tendencies. Even communists must have been somewhat shaken by such
testimonies as that of Max Eastman, Lenin’s old friend, who found
himself compelled to admit that “instead of being better, Stalinism is
worse than fascism, more ruthless, barbarous, unjust, immoral,
antidemocratic, unredeemed by any hope or scruple,” and that it is
“better described as superfascist”; and when we find the same author
recognizing that “Stalinism is socialism, in the sense of being an
inevitable although unforeseen political accompaniment of the
nationalization and collectivization which he had relied upon as part of
his plan for erecting a classless society,”5 his conclusion clearly
achieves wider significance.</p>
<p>Mr. Eastman’s case is perhaps the most remarkable, yet he is by no
means the first or the only sympathetic observer of the Russian
experiment to form similar conclusions. Several years earlier W. H.
Chamberlin, who in twelve years in Russia as an American correspondent
had seen all his ideals shattered, summed up the conclusions of his
studies there and in Germany and Italy in the statement that “socialism
is certain to prove, in the beginning at least, the road NOT to freedom,
but to dictatorship and counter-dictatorships, to civil war of the
fiercest kind. Socialism achieved and maintained by democratic means
seems definitely to belong to the world of utopias.”6 Similarly a
British writer, F. A. Voigt, after many years of close observation of
developments in Europe as a foreign correspondent, concludes that
“Marxism has led to Fascism and National Socialism, because, in all
essentials, it is Fascism and National Socialism.”7 And Walter Lippmann
has arrived at the conviction that “the generation to which we belong is
now learning from experience what happens when men retreat from freedom
to a coercive organization of their affairs. Though they promise
themselves a more abundant life, they must in practice renounce it; as
the organized direction increases, the variety of ends must give way to
uniformity. That is the nemesis of the planned society and the
authoritarian principle in human affairs.”8</p>
<p>Many more similar statements from people in a position to judge might
be selected from publications of recent years, particularly from those
by men who as citizens of the now totalitarian countries have lived
through the transformation and have been forced by their experience to
revise many cherished beliefs. We shall quote as one more example a
German writer who expresses the same conclusion perhaps more justly than
those already quoted.</p>
<p>“The complete collapse of the belief in the attainability of freedom
and equality through Marxism,” writes Peter Drucker, “has forced Russia
to travel the same road toward a totalitarian, purely negative,
non-economic society of unfreedom and inequality which Germany has been
following. Not that communism and fascism are essentially the same.
Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion, and
it has proved as much an illusion in Stalinist Russia as in pre-Hitler
Germany.”9</p>
<p>No less significant is the intellectual history of many of the Nazi
and Fascist leaders. Everyone who has watched the growth of these
movements in Italy10 or in Germany has been struck by the number of
leading men, from Mussolini downward (and not excluding Laval and
Quisling), who began as socialists and ended as Fascists or Nazis.11 And
what is true of the leaders is even more true of the rank and file of
the movement. The relative ease with which a young communist could be
converted into a Nazi or vice versa was generally known in Germany, best
of all to the propagandists of the two parties. Many a university
teacher during the 1930s has seen English and American students return
from the Continent uncertain whether they were communists or Nazis and
certain only that they hated Western liberal civilization.</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that in Germany before 1933, and in Italy
before 1922, communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more frequently
with each other than with other parties. They competed for the support
of the same type of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the
heretic. But their practice showed how closely they are related. To
both, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common and
whom they could not hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type.
While to the Nazi the communist, and to the communist the Nazi, and to
both the socialist, are potential recruits who are made of the right
timber, although they have listened to false prophets, they both know
that there can be no compromise between them and those who really
believe in individual freedom.</p>
<p>Lest this be doubted by people misled by official propaganda from
either side, let me quote one more statement from an authority that
ought not to be suspect. In an article under the significant title of
“The Rediscovery of Liberalism,” Professor Eduard Heimann, one of the
leaders of German religious socialism, writes: “Hitlerism proclaims
itself as both true democracy and true socialism, and the terrible truth
is that there is a grain of truth for such claims—an infinitesimal
grain, to be sure, but at any rate enough to serve as a basis for such
fantastic distortions. Hitlerism even goes so far as to claim the role
of protector of Christianity, and the terrible truth is that even this
gross misinterpretation is able to make some impression. But one fact
stands out with perfect clarity in all the fog: Hitler has never claimed
to represent true liberalism. Liberalism then has the distinction of
being the doctrine most hated by Hitler.”12 It should be added that this
hatred had little occasion to show itself in practice merely because, by
the time Hitler came to power, liberalism was to all intents and
purposes dead in Germany. And it was socialism that had killed it.</p>
<p>While to many who have watched the transition from socialism to
fascism at close quarters the connection between the two systems has
become increasingly obvious, in the democracies the majority of people
still believe that socialism and freedom can be combined. There can be
no doubt that most socialists here still believe profoundly in the
liberal ideal of freedom and that they would recoil if they became
convinced that the realization of their program would mean the
destruction of freedom. So little is the problem yet seen, so easily do
the most irreconcilable ideals still live together, that we can still
hear such contradictions in terms as “individualist socialism” seriously
discussed. If this is the state of mind which makes us drift into a new
world, nothing can be more urgent than that we should seriously examine
the real significance of the evolution that has taken place elsewhere.
Although our conclusions will only confirm the apprehensions which
others have already expressed, the reasons why this development cannot
be regarded as accidental will not appear without a rather full
examination of the main aspects of this transformation of social life.
That democratic socialism, the great utopia of the last few generations,
is not only unachievable, but that to strive for it produces something
so utterly different that few of those who now wish it would be prepared
to accept the consequences, many will not believe until the connection
has been laid bare in all its aspects.</p>

in Griechenland. Sämtliche Werke, vol. 3 (Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer

reads, “Immerhin hat das den Staat zur Hölle gemacht, daß ihn der Mensch
zu seinem Himmel machen wollte.” —Ed.)</p>
<p>2 (See Henri Saint-Simon, “Letters from an Inhabitant of Geneva to
his Contemporaries,” in Henri Saint-Simon (1760–1825): Selected Writings
on Science, Industry and Social Organization, trans. and ed. Keith
Taylor (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1975), p. 78, where Saint-Simon
says, “Every man who fails to obey this commandment will be regarded and
treated by others as an animal.” The social reformer Claude Henri de
Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon (1760–1825) was a founder of French
socialism. In his account of the origins of “scientism” and of “the
abuse of reason,” Hayek characterized Saint-Simon as “a megalomaniac
visionary.” See F. A. Hayek, “The Counter-Revolution of Science,” in The
Counter-Revolution of Science: Studies in the Abuse of Reason, op. cit.,
p. 222. The sentence containing the passage that Hayek quotes was
apparently deleted by Saint-Simon’s disciples from some later versions
of the tract. —Ed.)</p>

constituante dans la discussion de projet de constitution (12 Septembre
1848) sur la question du droit au travail,” Oeuvres complètes d’Alexis
de Tocqueville, vol. 9 (Paris: Michel Lévy Frères, 1866), p. 546. (The
original passage reads, “La démocratie étend la sphère de l’indépendance
individuelle, le socialisme la resserre. La démocratie donne toute sa
valeur possible à chaque homme, le socialisme fait de chaque homme un
agent, un instrument, un chiffre. La démocratie et le socialisme ne se
tiennent que par un mot, l’égalité; mais remarquez la différence: la
démocratie veut l’égalité dans la liberté, et le socialisme veut
l’égalité dans la gêne et dans la servitude.” —Ed.)</p>
<p>4 The characteristic confusion of freedom with power, which we shall
meet again and again throughout this discussion, is too big a subject to
be thoroughly examined here. As old as socialism itself, it is so
closely allied with it that almost seventy years ago a French scholar,
discussing its Saint-Simonian origins, was led to say that this theory
of liberty “est à elle seule tout le socialisme” (Paul Janet,
Saint-Simon et le Saint-Simonisme (Paris: G. Baillière et cie., 1878),
p. 26 n.). The most explicit defender of this confusion is,
significantly, the leading philosopher of American left-wingism, John
Dewey, according to whom “liberty is the effective power to do specific
things” so that “the demand for liberty is demand for power.” See John
Dewey, “Liberty and Social Control,” The Social Frontier, vol. 2,
November 1935, p. 41.</p>
<p>5 Max Eastman, Stalin’s Russia and the Crisis in Socialism (New York:
W. W. Norton, 1940), the quoted passages are found on p. 82, p. 82, and
p. 154, respectively. (Hayek originally listed the quotations as all
appearing on p. 82. The American Max Eastman (1883–1969) was the editor
and publisher of the radical organ The Masses. He traveled to the Soviet
Union after the Russian Revolution and married a Russian woman. By the
1930s he had become disillusioned with the Soviet experiment, believing
that the original purpose of Lenin’s revolution had been subverted by
Stalin. As noted in my introduction, p. 19, Eastman condensed The Road
to Serfdom for Reader’s Digest. —Ed.)</p>

Christian Science Monitor. Though initially sympathetic to the
revolutionary cause, he quickly became disillusioned with Stalinism.

<p>7 F. A. Voigt, Unto Caesar (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1938),
p. 95. (The English journalist and author Frederick Augustus Voigt
(1892–1957) was the Berlin correspondent for the Manchester Guardian
during the interwar years. I could not locate the passage cited in
Voigt’s book, though the following lines, taken from p. 35, express
similar sentiments: “Marxism would be a phenomenon of little more than
historical interest, seeing that it has failed even it its principal
stronghold, were it not so closely akin to National Socialism. National
Socialism would have been inconceivable without Marxism.” Voigt notes
similarities between Marxism and National Socialism as well as between
the persons of Lenin and Hitler in his book. —Ed.)</p>

Totalitarianism (New York: The John Day Co., 1939), pp. 245–246. (In the

found as p. 230. Vienna-born American management consultant Peter
Drucker (1909–2005) taught at Bennington College and New York University
before his appointment as professor of social sciences at the Claremont
Graduate School, now Claremont Graduate University, in California.

<p>10 An illuminating account of the intellectual history of many of the
Fascist leaders will be found in Robert Michels (himself a former
Marxist Fascist), Sozialismus und Fascismus als politische Strö-mungen

Italien (Munich: Meyer and Jessen, 1925), 264–66, 311–12.</p>

Pétain’s deputy and subsequently as prime minister during the Vichy
regime. He was executed as a collaborator following the liberation.
Norwegian diplomat Vidkun Quisling (1887–1945) formed the Nasjonal
Samlung party, modeled on the German National Socialist party, in 1933,
and served as the puppet prime minister during the occupation of Norway.
His name has become synonymous with collaboration. Quisling was tried
and executed at war’s end. —Ed.)</p>
<p>12 Eduard Heimann, “The Rediscovery of Liberalism,” Social Research,
vol. 8, November 1941, p. 479. It deserves to be recalled in this
connection that, whatever may have been his reasons, Hitler thought it
expedient to declare in one of his public speeches as late as February,
1941, that “basically National Socialism and Marxism are the same.”
Compare the article, “Herr Hitler’s Speech of February 24,” Bulletin of
International News (published by the Royal Institute of International
Affairs), vol. 18, March 8, 1941, p. 269. (Eduard Heimann (1889–1967)
taught at the University of Hamburg from 1925 to 1933, when he fled
Germany and took a position at the New School for Social Research in New
York. —Ed.)</p>
