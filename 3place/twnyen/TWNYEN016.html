<h4 id="twelve">TWELVE</h4>
<p>THE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZIISM</p>
<p>All antiliberal forces are combining against everything that is
liberal.</p>
<p>—A. Moeller van den Bruck1</p>
<p>It is a common mistake to regard National Socialism as a mere revolt
against reason, an irrational movement without intellectual background.
If that were so, the movement would be much less dangerous than it is.
But nothing could be further from the truth or more misleading. The
doctrines of National Socialism are the culmination of a long evolution
of thought, a process in which thinkers who have had great influence far
beyond the confines of Germany have taken part. Whatever one may think
of the premises from which they started, it cannot be denied that the
men who produced the new doctrines were powerful writers who left the
impress of their ideas on the whole of European thought. Their system
was developed with ruthless consistency. Once one accepts the premises
from which it starts, there is no escape from its logic. It is simply
collectivism freed from all traces of an individualist tradition which
might hamper its realization.</p>
<p>Though in this development German thinkers have taken the lead, they
were by no means alone. Thomas Carlyle and Houston Stewart Chamberlain,
Auguste Comte and Georges Sorel, are as much a part of that continuous
development as any Germans.2 The development of this strand of thought
within Germany has been well traced recently by R. D. Butler in his
study of The Roots of National Socialism.3 But, although its persistence
there through a hundred and fifty years in almost unchanged and ever
recurring form, which emerges from that study, is rather frightening, it
is easy to exaggerate the importance these ideas had in Germany before
1914. They were only one strand of thought among a people then perhaps
more varied in its views than any other. And they were on the whole
represented by a small minority and held in as great contempt by the
majority of Germans as they were in other countries.</p>
<p>What, then, caused these views held by a reactionary minority finally
to gain the support of the great majority of Germans and practically the
whole of her youth? It was not merely the defeat, the suffering, and the
wave of nationalism which led to their success. Still less was the
cause, as so many people wish to believe, a capitalist reaction against
the advance of socialism. On the contrary, the support which brought
these ideas to power came precisely from the socialist camp. It was
certainly not through the bourgeoisie, but rather through the absence of
a strong bourgeoisie, that they were helped to power.</p>
<p>The doctrines which had guided the ruling elements in Germany for the
past generation were opposed not to the socialism in Marxism but to the
liberal elements contained in it, its internationalism and its
democracy. And as it became increasingly clear that it was just these
elements which formed obstacles to the realization of socialism, the
socialists of the Left approached more and more to those of the Right.
It was the union of the anticapitalist forces of the Right and of the
Left, the fusion of radical and conservative socialism, which drove out
from Germany everything that was liberal.</p>
<p>The connection between socialism and nationalism in Germany was close
from the beginning. It is significant that the most important ancestors
of National Socialism—Fichte, Rodbertus, and Lassalle—are at the same
time acknowledged fathers of socialism.4 While theoretical socialism in
its Marxist form was directing the German labor movement, the
authoritarian and nationalist element receded for a time into the
background. But not for long.5 From 1914 onward there arose from the
ranks of Marxist socialism one teacher after another who led, not the
conservatives and reactionaries, but the hardworking laborer and
idealist youth into the National Socialist fold. It was only thereafter
that the tide of nationalist socialism attained major importance and
rapidly grew into the Hitlerian doctrine. The war hysteria of 1914,
which, just because of the German defeat, was never fully cured, is the
beginning of the modern development which produced National Socialism,
and it was largely with the assistance of old socialists that it rose
during this period.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first, and in some ways the most characteristic,
representative of this development is the late Professor Werner Sombart,
whose notorious Händler und Helden (“Merchants and Heroes”) appeared in
1915.6 Sombart had begun as a Marxian socialist and, as late as 1909,
could assert with pride that he had devoted the greater part of his life
to fighting for the ideas of Karl Marx. He had done as much as any man
to spread socialist ideas and anticapitalist resentment of varying
shades throughout Germany; and if German thought became penetrated with
Marxian elements in a way that was true of no other country until the
Russian revolution, this was in a large measure due to Sombart. At one
time he was regarded as the outstanding representative of the persecuted
socialist intelligentsia, unable, because of his radical views, to
obtain a university chair. And even after the last war the influence,
inside and outside Germany, of his work as a historian, which remained
Marxist in approach after he had ceased to be a Marxist in politics, was
most extensive and is particularly noticeable in the works of many of
the English and American planners.</p>
<p>In his war book this old socialist welcomed the “German War” as the
inevitable conflict between the commercial civilization of England and
the heroic culture of Germany. His contempt for the “commercial” views
of the English people, who had lost all warlike instincts, is unlimited.
Nothing is more contemptible in his eyes than the universal striving
after the happiness of the individual; and what he describes as the
leading maxim of English morals: be just “that it may be well with thee
and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land” is to him “the most
infamous maxim which has ever been pronounced by a commercial mind.”7
The “German idea of the state,” as formulated by Fichte, Lassalle, and
Rodbertus, is that the state is neither founded nor formed by
individuals, nor an aggregate of individuals, nor is its purpose to
serve any interest of individuals. It is a Volksgemeinschaft in which
the individual has no rights but only duties.8 Claims of the individual
are always an outcome of the commercial spirit. “The ideas of
1789”—liberty, equality, fraternity—are characteristically commercial
ideals which have no other purpose but to secure certain advantages to
individuals.</p>
<p>Before 1914 all the true German ideals of a heroic life were in
deadly danger before the continuous advance of English commercial
ideals, English comfort, and English sport. The English people had not
only themselves become completely corrupted, every trade-unionist being
sunk in the “morass of comfort,” but they had begun to infect all other
peoples. Only the war had helped the Germans to remember that they were
really a people of warriors, a people among whom all activities and
particularly all economic activities were subordinated to military ends.
Sombart knew that the Germans were held in contempt by other people
because they regard war as sacred—but he glories in it. To regard war as
inhuman and senseless is a product of commercial views. There is a life
higher than the individual life, the life of the people and the life of
the state, and it is the purpose of the individual to sacrifice himself
for that higher life. War is to Sombart the consummation of the heroic
view of life, and the war against England is the war against the
opposite ideal, the commercial ideal of individual freedom and of
English comfort, which in his eyes finds its most contemptible
expression in—the safety razors found in the English trenches.</p>
<p>If Sombart’s outburst was at the time too much even for most Germans,
another German professor arrived at essentially the same ideas in a more
moderate and more scholarly, but for that reason even more effective,
form. Professor Johann Plenge was as great an authority on Marx as
Sombart. His book on Marx und Hegel marks the beginning of the modern
Hegel renaissance among Marxian scholars; and there can be no doubt
about the genuinely socialist nature of the convictions with which he
started. Among his numerous war publications the most important is a
small but at the time widely discussed book with the significant title,
1789 and 1914: The Symbolic Years in the History of the Political Mind.9
It is devoted to the conflict between the “Ideas of 1789,” the ideal of
freedom, and the “Ideas of 1914,” the ideal of organization.</p>
<p>Organization is to him, as to all socialists who derive their
socialism from a crude application of scientific ideals to the problems
of society, the essence of socialism. It was, as he rightly emphasizes,
the root of the socialist movement at its inception in early
nineteenth-century France. Marx and Marxism have betrayed this basic
idea of socialism by their fanatic but utopian adherence to the abstract
idea of freedom. Only now was the idea of organization again coming into
its own, elsewhere, as witnessed by the work of H. G. Wells (by whose
Future in America Professor Plenge was profoundly influenced, and whom
he describes as one of the outstanding figures of modern socialism), but
particularly in Germany, where it is best understood and most fully
realized.10 The war between England and Germany is therefore really a
conflict between two opposite principles. The “Economic World War” is
the third great epoch of spiritual struggle in modern history. It is of
equal importance with the Reformation and the bourgeois revolution of
liberty. It is the struggle for the victory of the new forces born out
of the advanced economic life of the nineteenth century: socialism and
organization.</p>
<p>“Because in the sphere of ideas Germany was the most convinced
exponent of all socialist dreams, and in the sphere of reality she was
the most powerful architect of the most highly organized economic
system.—In us is the twentieth century. However the war may end, we are
the exemplary people. Our ideas will determine the aims of the life of
humanity.—World History experiences at present the colossal spectacle
that with us a new great ideal of life penetrates to final victory,
while at the same time in England one of the World-Historical principles
finally collapses.”11</p>
<p>The war economy created in Germany in 1914 “is the first realization
of a socialist society and its spirit the first active, and not merely
demanding, appearance of a socialist spirit. The needs of the war have
established the socialist idea in German economic life, and thus the
defense of our nation produced for humanity the idea of 1914, the idea
of German organization, the people’s community (Volksgemeinschaft) of
national socialism.12 . . . Without our really noticing it the whole of
our political life in state and industry has risen to a higher stage.
State and economic life form a new unity.13 . . . The feeling of
economic responsibility which characterizes the work of the civil
servant pervades all private activity.”14 The new German corporative
constitution of economic life, which Professor Plenge admits is not yet
ripe or complete, “is the highest form of life of the state which has
ever been known on earth.”15</p>
<p>At first Professor Plenge still hoped to reconcile the ideal of
liberty and the ideal of organization, although largely through the
complete but voluntary submission of the individual to the whole. But
these traces of liberal ideas soon disappear from his writings. By 1918
the union between socialism and ruthless power politics had become
complete in his mind. Shortly before the end of the war he exhorted his
compatriots in the socialist journal Die Glocke in the following
manner:</p>
<p>“It is high time to recognize the fact that socialism must be power
policy, because it is to be organization. Socialism has to win power: it
must never blindly destroy power. And the most important and critical
question for socialism in the time of war of peoples is necessarily
this: what people is pre-eminently summoned to power, because it is the
exemplary leader in the organization of peoples?”16</p>
<p>And he forecast all the ideas which were finally to justify Hitler’s
New Order: “Just from the point of view of socialism, which is
organization, is not an absolute right of self-determination of the
peoples the right of individualistic economic anarchy? Are we willing to
grant complete self-determination to the individual in economic life?
Consistent socialism can accord to the people a right to incorporation
only in accordance with the real distribution of forces historically
determined.”</p>
<p>The ideals which Plenge expressed so clearly were especially popular
among, and perhaps even derive from, certain circles of German
scientists and engineers who, precisely as is now so loudly demanded by
their English and American counterparts, clamored for the centrally
planned organization of all aspects of life. Leading among these was the
famous chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, one of whose pronouncements on this
point has achieved a certain celebrity. He is reported to have stated
publicly that “Germany wants to organize Europe which up to now still
lacks organization. I will explain to you now Germany’s great secret:
we, or perhaps the German race, have discovered the significance of
organization. While the other nations still live under the regime of
individualism, we have already achieved that of organization.”17</p>
<p>Ideas very similar to these were current in the offices of the German
raw-material dictator, Walther Rathenau, who, although he would have
shuddered had he realized the consequences of his totalitarian
economics, yet deserves a considerable place in any fuller history of
the growth of Nazi ideas.18 Through his writings he has probably, more
than any other man, determined the economic views of the generation
which grew up in Germany during and immediately after the last war; and
some of his closest collaborators were later to form the backbone of the
staff of Göring’s Five-Year Plan administration. Very similar also was
much of the teaching of another former Marxist, Friedrich Naumann, whose
Mitteleuropa reached probably the greatest circulation of any war book
in Germany.19</p>
<p>But it was left to an active socialist politician, a member of the
Left wing of the social-democratic party in the Reichstag, to develop
these ideas most fully and to spread them far and wide. Paul Lensch had
already in earlier books described the war as “the flight of the English
bourgeoisie before the advance of socialism” and explained how different
were the socialist ideal of freedom and the English conception.20 But
only in his third and most successful war book, his Three Years of World
Revolution, were his characteristic ideas, under the influence of
Plenge, to achieve full development.21 Lensch bases his argument on an
interesting and in many respects accurate historical account of how the
adoption of protection by Bismarck had made possible in Germany a
development toward that industrial concentration and cartelization
which, from his Marxist standpoint, represented a higher state of
industrial development.</p>
<p>“The result of Bismarck’s decision of the year 1879 was that Germany
took on the role of the revolutionary; that is to say, of a state whose
position in relation to the rest of the world is that of a
representative of a higher and more advanced economic system. Having
realized this, we should perceive that in the present World Revolution
Germany represents the revolutionary, and her greatest antagonist,
England, the counter-revolutionary side. This fact proves how little the
constitution of a country, whether it be liberal and republican or
monarchic and autocratic, affects the question whether, from the point
of view of historical development, that country is to be regarded as
liberal or not. Or, to put it more plainly, our conceptions of
Liberalism, Democracy, and so forth, are derived from the ideas of
English Individualism, according to which a state with a weak government
is a liberal state, and every restriction upon the freedom of the
individual is conceived as the product of autocracy and
militarism.”22</p>
<p>In Germany, the “historically appointed representative” of this
higher form of economic life, “the struggle for socialism has been
extraordinarily simplified, since all the prerequisite conditions of
Socialism had already become established there. And hence it was
necessarily a vital concern of any socialist party that Germany should
triumphantly hold her own against her enemies, and thereby be able to
fulfill her historic mission of revolutionizing the world. Hence the war
of the Entente against Germany resembled the attempt of the lower
bourgeoisie of the pre-capitalistic age to prevent the decline of their
own class.”23</p>
<p>That organization of capital, Lensch continues, “which began
unconsciously before the war, and which during the war has been
continued consciously, will be systematically continued after the war.
Not through any desire for any arts of organization nor yet because
socialism has been recognized as a higher principle of social
development. The classes who are today the practical pioneers of
socialism are, in theory, its avowed opponents, or, at any rate, were so
up to a short time ago. Socialism is coming, and in fact has to some
extent already arrived, since we can no longer live without it.”24</p>
<p>The only people who still oppose this tendency are the liberals.
“This class of people, who unconsciously reason from English standards,
comprises the whole educated German bourgeoisie. Their political notions
of ‘freedom’ and ‘civic right,’ of constitutionalism and
parliamentarianism, are derived from that individualistic conception of
the world, of which English Liberalism is a classical embodiment, and
which was adopted by the spokesmen of the German bourgeoisie in the
fifties, sixties, and seventies of the nineteenth century. But these
standards are old-fashioned and shattered, just as old-fashioned English
Liberalism has been shattered by this war. What has to be done now is to
get rid of these inherited political ideas and to assist the growth of a
new conception of State and Society. In this sphere also Socialism must
present a conscious and determined opposition to individualism. In this
connection it is an astonishing fact that, in the so-called
‘reactionary’ Germany, the working classes have won for themselves a
much more solid and powerful position in the life of the state than is
the case either in England or in France.”25</p>
<p>Lensch follows this up with a consideration which again contains much
truth and which deserves to be pondered:</p>
<p>“Since the Social Democrats, by the aid of this [universal] Suffrage,
occupied every post which they could obtain in the Reichstag, the State
Parliament, the municipal councils, the courts for the settlement of
trade disputes, the sick funds, and so forth, they penetrated very
deeply into the organism of the state; but the price which they had to
pay for this was that the state, in its turn, exercised a profound
influence upon the working classes. To be sure, as the result of
strenuous socialistic labors for fifty years, the state is no longer the
same as it was in the year 1867, when universal suffrage first came into
operation; but then, Social Democracy, in its turn, is no longer the
same as it was at the time. The state has undergone a process of
socialization, and Social Democracy has undergone a process of
nationalization.”26</p>
<p>Plenge and Lensch in turn have provided the leading ideas for the
immediate masters of National Socialism, particularly Oswald Spengler
and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, to mention only the two best-known
names.27 Opinions may differ in how far the former can be regarded as a
socialist. But that in his tract on Prussianism and Socialism, which
appeared in 1920, he merely gave expression to ideas widely held by
German socialists will now be evident.28 A few specimens of his argument
will suffice. “Old Prussian spirit and socialist conviction, which today
hate each other with the hatred of brothers, are one and the same.”29
The representatives of Western civilization in Germany, the German
liberals, are “the invisible English army which after the Battle of
Jena, Napoleon left behind on German soil.”30 To Spengler, men like
Harden-berg and Humboldt and all the other liberal reformers were
“English.”31 But this “English” spirit will be turned out by the German
revolution which began in 1914.</p>
<p>“The three last nations of the Occident have aimed at three forms of
existence, represented by famous watchwords: Freedom, Equality,
Community. They appear in the political forms of liberal
Parliamentarianism, social Democracy, and authoritarian socialism.32 . .
. The German, more correctly, Prussian, instinct is: the power belongs
to the whole. . . . Everyone is given his place. One commands or obeys.
This is, since the eighteenth century, authoritarian socialism,
essentially illiberal and anti-democratic, in so far as English
Liberalism and French Democracy are meant.33 . . . There are in Germany
many hated and ill-reputed contrasts, but liberalism alone is
contemptible on German soil.34</p>
<p>“The structure of the English nation is based on the distinction
between rich and poor, that of the Prussian on that between command and
obedience. The meaning of class distinction is accordingly fundamentally
different in the two countries.”35</p>
<p>After pointing out the essential difference between the English
competitive system and the Prussian system of “economic administration”
and after showing (consciously following Lensch) how since Bismarck the
deliberate organization of economic activity had progressively assumed
more socialist forms, Spengler continues:</p>
<p>“In Prussia there existed a real state in the most ambitious meaning
of the word. There could be, strictly speaking, no private persons.
Everybody who lived within the system that worked with the precision of
a clockwork, was in some way a link in it. The conduct of public
business could therefore not be in the hands of private people, as is
supposed by Parliamentarianism. It was an Amt and the responsible
politician was a civil servant, a servant of the whole.”36</p>
<p>The “Prussian idea” requires that everybody should become a state
official—that all wages and salaries be fixed by the state. The
administration of all property, in particular, becomes a salaried
function. The state of the future will be a Beamtenstaat. But “the
decisive question not only for Germany, but for the world, which must be
solved by Germany for the world is: Is in the future trade to govern the
state, or the state to govern trade? In the face of this question
Prussianism and Socialism are the same. . . . Prussianism and Socialism
combat the England in our midst.”37</p>
<p>It was only a step from this for the patron saint of National
Socialism, Moeller van den Bruck, to proclaim World War I a war between
liberalism and socialism: “We have lost the war against the West.
Socialism has lost it against Liberalism.”38 As with Spengler,
liberalism is, therefore, the archenemy. Moeller van den Bruck glories
in the fact that “there are no liberals in Germany today; there are
young revolutionaries, there are young conservatives. But who would be a
liberal? . . . Liberalism is a philosophy of life from which German
youth now turns with nausea, with wrath, with quite peculiar scorn, for
there is none more foreign, more repugnant, more opposed to its
philosophy. German youth today recognizes the liberal as the
archenemy.”39 Moeller van den Bruck’s Third Reich was intended to give
the Germans a socialism adapted to their nature and undefiled by Western
liberal ideas. And so it did.</p>
<p>These writers were by no means isolated phenomena. As early as 1922 a
detached observer could speak of a “peculiar and, on a first glance,
surprising phenomenon” then to be observed in Germany: “The fight
against the capitalistic order, according to this view, is a
continuation of the war against the Entente with the weapons of the
spirit and of economic organization, the way which leads to practical
socialism, a return of the German people to their best and noblest
traditions.”40</p>
<p>Fight against liberalism in all its forms, liberalism that had
defeated Germany, was the common idea which united socialists and
conservatives in one common front. At first it was mainly in the German
Youth Movement, almost entirely socialist in inspiration and outlook,
where these ideas were most readily accepted and the fusion of socialism
and nationalism completed. In the later twenties and until the advent to
power of Hitler a circle of young men gathered round the journal Die Tat
and, led by Ferdinand Fried, became the chief exponent of this tradition
in the intellectual sphere.41 Fried’s Ende des Kapitalismus is perhaps
the most characteristic product of this group of Edelnazis, as they were
known in Germany, and is particularly disquieting because of its
resemblance to so much of the literature which we see in England and the
United States today, where we can watch the same drawing together of the
socialists of the Left and the Right and nearly the same contempt of all
that is liberal in the old sense. “Conservative Socialism” (and, in
other circles, “Religious Socialism”) was the slogan under which a large
number of writers prepared the atmosphere in which “National Socialism”
succeeded. It is “conservative socialism” which is the dominant trend
among us now. Had the war against the Western powers “with the weapons
of the spirit and of economic organization” not almost succeeded before
the real war began?</p>

<p>4 [German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) taught at
Jena, Berlin, and Erlangen, and in 1810 became the first rector of the
new University of Berlin. In 1807–08 he delivered a series of patriotic
lectures aimed at fostering German nationalism in opposition to
Napoleon; his philosophical categories anticipated the Nazi concept of
the Herrenvolk. German economist and politician Johann Karl Rodbertus
(1805–1875) is known as a founder of scientific socialism; he proposed a
program that would gradually lead to a socialist state within the German
Empire. German political author and pamphleteer Ferdinand Lassalle
(1825–1864) founded the Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein (Universal
German Workingmen’s Association), a forerunner of the Social Democratic
party. —Ed.]</p>
<p>5 And only partially. In 1892 one of the leaders of the
social-democratic party, August Bebel, was able to tell Bismarck that
“the Imperial Chancellor can rest assured that German Social Democracy
is a sort of preparatory school for militarism”! [Ferdinand August Bebel

1916). Historian and political thinker Johann Plenge (1874–1963) taught

Plenge also supported a revival of sociology, a science that he thought
could be used to train the executives who would lead large-scale

<p>18 [German industrialist and politician Walther Rathenau (1867–1922)
brought his expertise as a former director of the electricity cartel to
assist him in setting up raw materials procurement for the German
Ministry of War during the First World War. In an influential pamphlet
published after the war he argued for the socialization of the economy
by the continuation of wartime planning in peace time. A progressive
internationalist, and also a Jew, Rathenau was assassinated in 1922 soon
after becoming Foreign Minister. For Rathenau’s influence on Hayek, see
F. A. Hayek, Hayek on Hayek, op. cit., p. 47. —Ed.]</p>
<p>19 A good summary of Naumann’s views, as characteristic of the German
combination of socialism and imperialism as any we quote in the text,
will be found in R. D. Butler, The Roots of National Socialism, op.
cit., pp. 203–209. [Hayek refers to Freidrich Naumann, Mitteleuropa
(Berlin: G. Reimer, 1915). The book was translated by Christabel
Meredith as Central Europe (New York: A. A. Knopf, 1917; reprinted,
Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1971). Journalist, author, and political leader
Friedrich Naumann (1860–1919) founded the German Democratic Party at the
end of World War I. In his book, Naumann envisioned an economic and
political reorganization of central Europe under German-Prussian
hegemony. —Ed.]</p>
<p>20 [German economist and journalist Paul Lensch (1873–1926) was,
before the war, associated with the Marxist wing of the German Social
Democratic party, but he moved increasingly toward the right during the
war. His criticisms of the party led to his ouster in 1922. Hayek
probably here refers to Lensch’s Die deutsche Sozialdemokratie under der
Weltkrieg: eine politische Studie (Berlin: Singer, 1915) and Das
englische Weltreich (Berlin: Singer, 1915). —Ed.]</p>

point of view of historical development, that country is to be regarded
as revolutionary or not.” —Ed.]</p>

<p>27 The same applies to many others of the intellectual leaders of the
generation which has produced naziism, such as Othmar Spann, Hans
Freyer, Carl Schmitt, and Ernst Jünger. On these compare the interesting
study by Aurel Kolnai, The War against the West (London: V. Gollancz,
1938), which suffers, however, from the defect that, by confining itself
to the postwar period when these ideals had already been taken over by
the nationalists, it overlooks their socialist creators. [Historian and
critic Arthur Moeller van den Bruck’s (1876–1925) book Das dritte Reich
(“The Third Reich”), originally published in 1923, profoundly influenced
Adolf Hitler. In the book, an excerpt from which provided the quotation
that introduces this chapter, Moeller van den Bruck criticized such
ideologies as socialism, liberalism, and democracy, and called for the
formation of a new German self-consciousness and for the institution of
an authoritarian state with strict central control of the economy.
German philosopher of history Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), another
critic of liberal parliamentary democracy, foretold the inevitable decay
of European culture, which would be replaced by a new age of Caesarism
(analogous to the replacement of Greek culture by Roman, the latter
being “uninspired, barbaric, disciplined, practical, Protestant,
Prussian”—p. 26), in his book The Decline of the West, translated by
Charles Francis Atkinson, 2 vols. (New York: A. A. Knopf, 1926–1928).
The Austrian sociologist-economist Othmar Spann (1878–1950) taught at
the University of Vienna, where Hayek was among his students. The
prophet of “intuitive universalism,” which prepared the way for
Austro-Fascism, he attacked democracy, liberalism, socialism, and
individualism in his lectures. For more on Spann, and Hayek’s reaction
to him, see Caldwell, Hayek’s Challenge, op. cit., pp. 137–39. German
philosopher and sociologist Hans Freyer (1887–1969) was another
intellectual forerunner of the Nazis. In his book Revolution von rechts
(“Revolution on the Right”), published in 1931, he called for an end to
class struggles and, through educational “reforms,” the emergence of a
German nationalist “state of the people.” In his writings the German
author and essayist Ernst Jünger (1895–1998) glorified the aesthetic,
spiritual, and heroic aspects of war, and called for the German nation
to embrace a militaristic ethos and organization. His firsthand account
of trench warfare during World War I, In Stahlgewittern, is available as
Storm of Steel, translated by Michael Hofmann (New York: Penguin Books,
2004). For more on the jurist Carl Schmitt, see chapter 6, note 5.

August, Fürst von Hardenberg (1750–1822) oversaw the abolition of
serfdom, extensive reform of the Prussian military, and, with Heinrich
Stein, reform of the Prussian system of education. For more on Humboldt,
see the author’s introduction, note 4. —Ed.]</p>
<p>32Ibid., p. 14. This Spenglerian formula finds its echo in an
often-quoted statement of Schmitt, the leading Nazi expert on
constitutional law, according to which the evolution of government
proceeds “in three dialectic stages: from the absolute state of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the neutral state of the
liberal nineteenth century to the totalitarian state in which state and
society are identical.” See Carl Schmitt, Der Hüter der Verfassung

The writer mentions as further examples the philosopher Max Scheler,
preaching “the socialist world mission of Germany,” and the Marxist K.
Korsch, writing on the spirit of the new Volksgemeinschaft, as arguing
in the same vein. [German philosopher Max Scheler (1874–1928), who wrote
on ethics, religion, metaphysics, and the place of the person in
society, was affiliated with Husserl’s phenomenological movement. During
the First World War he gave propaganda lectures for the government.
Marxist journalist and author Karl Korsch (1886–1961) was a leading
member of the Communist Party of Germany from 1920–1926, writing
frequently for its newspapers and editing its theoretical journal, Die
Inter-nationale. He was expelled from the party on charges of
revisionism in 1926, and left Germany in 1934, eventually settling in
the United States. —Ed.]</p>

organ Die Tat (translated variously as “Action” or “The Deed”) the group
opposed parliamentarian democracy and capitalism, and called for an
autarkic, planned national economy. —Ed.]</p>
