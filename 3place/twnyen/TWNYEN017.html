<p>THE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST</p>
<p>When authority presents itself in the guise of organization, it
develops charms fascinating enough to convert communities of free people
into totalitarian States. —The Times (London)1</p>
<p>Probably it is true that the very magnitude of the outrages committed
by the totalitarian governments, instead of increasing the fear that
such a system might one day arise in more enlightened countries, has
rather strengthened the assurance that it cannot happen here. When we
look to Nazi Germany, the gulf which separates us seems so immense that
nothing that happens there can possess relevance for any possible
development here. And the fact that the difference has steadily become
greater seems to refute any suggestion that we may be moving in a
similar direction. But let us not forget that fifteen years ago the
possibility of such a thing’s happening in Germany would have appeared
just as fantastic, not only to nine-tenths of the Germans themselves,
but also to the most hostile foreign observers (however wise they may
now pretend to have been).</p>
<p>As suggested earlier in these pages, however, it is not the present
Germany but the Germany of twenty or thirty years ago to which
conditions in the democracies show an ever increasing resemblance. There
are many features which were then regarded as “typically German” and
which are now equally familiar in England, for instance, and many
symptoms that point to a further development in the same direction. We
have already mentioned the most significant—the increasing similarity
between the economic views of the Right and Left and their common
opposition to the liberalism that used to be the common basis of most
English politics. We have the authority of Mr. Harold Nicolson for the
statement that, during the last Conservative government, among the
backbenchers of the Conservative party “the most gifted . . . were all
socialists at heart”;2 and there can be little question that, as in the
days of the Fabians, many socialists have more sympathy with the
Conservatives than with the Liberals.3 There are many other features
closely related to this. The increasing veneration for the state, the
admiration of power, and of bigness for bigness’ sake, the enthusiasm
for “organization” of everything (we now call it “planning”), and that
“inability to leave anything to the simple power of organic growth,”
which even von Treitschke deplored in the Germans sixty years ago, are
all scarcely less marked in England now than they were in Germany.4</p>
<p>How far in the last twenty years England has traveled on the German
path is brought home to one with extraordinary vividness if one now
reads some of the more serious discussions of the differences between
British and German views on political and moral issues which appeared in
England during the last war. It is probably true to say that then the
British public had, in general, a truer appreciation of these
differences than it has now; but while the people of England were then
proud of their distinctive tradition, there are few of the political
views then regarded as characteristically English of which the majority
of her people do not now seem half-ashamed, if they do not positively
repudiate them. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the more
typically English a writer on political or social problems then appeared
to the world, the more is he today forgotten in his own country. Men
like Lord Morley or Henry Sidgwick, Lord Acton or A. V. Dicey, who were
then admired in the world at large as outstanding examples of the
political wisdom of liberal England, are to the present generation
largely obsolete Victorians.5 Perhaps nothing shows this change more
clearly than that, while there is no lack of sympathetic treatment of
Bismarck in contemporary English literature, the name of Gladstone is
rarely mentioned by the younger generation without a sneer over his
Victorian morality and naïve utopianism.6</p>
<p>I wish I could in a few paragraphs adequately convey the alarming
impression gained from the perusal of a few of the English works on the
ideas dominating the Germany of the last war, where almost every word
could be applied to the views most conspicuous in current English
literature. I shall merely quote one brief passage by Lord Keynes,
describing in 1915 the “nightmare” which he found expounded in a typical
German work of that period: he describes how, according to a German
author, “even in peace industrial life must remain mobilised. This is
what he means by speaking of the ‘militarisation of our industrial life’
(the title of the work reviewed). Individualism must come to an end
absolutely. A system of regulations must be set up, the object of which
is not the greater happiness of the individual (Professor Jaffé is not
ashamed to say this in so many words), but the strengthening of the
organised unity of the state for the object of attaining the maximum
degree of efficiency (Leistungsfähigkeit), the influence of which on
individual advantage is only indirect.—This hideous doctrine is
enshrined in a sort of idealism. The nation will grow into a ‘closed
unity’ and will become, in fact, what Plato declared it should be—‘Der
Mensch im Grossen.’ In particular, the coming peace will bring with it a
strengthening of the idea of State action in industry. . . . Foreign
investment, emigration, the industrial policy which in recent years had
regarded the whole world as a market, are too dangerous. The old order
of industry, which is dying to-day, is based on Profit; and the new
Germany of the twentieth-century Power without consideration of Profit
is to make an end of that system of Capitalism, which came over from
England one hundred years ago.”7 Except that no English author has yet
to my knowledge dared openly to disparage individual happiness, is there
a passage in this which is not mirrored in much of contemporary English
literature?</p>
<p>And, undoubtedly, not merely the ideas which in Germany and elsewhere
prepared totalitarianism but also many of the principles of
totalitarianism itself are what exercises an increasing fascination in
many other countries. Although few people, if anybody, in England would
probably be ready to swallow totalitarianism whole, there are few single
features which have not yet been advised by somebody or other. Indeed,
there is scarcely a leaf out of Hitler’s book which somebody or other in
England or America has not recommended us to take and use for our own
purposes. This applies particularly to many people who are undoubtedly
Hitler’s mortal enemies because of one special feature in his system. We
should never forget that the anti-Semitism of Hitler has driven from his
country, or turned into his enemies, many people who in every respect
are confirmed totalitarians of the German type.8</p>
<p>No description in general terms can give an adequate idea of the
similarity of much of current English political literature to the works
which destroyed the belief in Western civilization in Germany and
created the state of mind in which naziism could become successful. The
similarity is even more one of the temper with which the problems are
approached than of the specific arguments used—a similar readiness to
break all cultural ties with the past and to stake everything on the
success of a particular experiment. As was also true in Germany, most of
the works which are preparing the way for a totalitarian course in the
democracies are the product of sincere idealists and often of men of
considerable intellectual distinction. So, although it is invidious to
single out particular persons as illustrations where similar views are
advocated by hundreds of others, I see no other way of demonstrating
effectively how far this development has actually advanced. I shall
deliberately choose as illustrations authors whose sincerity and
disinterestedness are above suspicion. But though I hope in this way to
show how the views from which totalitarianism springs are now rapidly
spreading here, I stand little chance of conveying successfully the
equally important similarity in the emotional atmosphere. An extensive
investigation into all the subtle changes in thought and language would
be necessary to make explicit what one readily enough recognizes as
symptoms of a familiar development. Through meeting the kind of people
who talk about the necessity of opposing “big” ideas to “small” ones and
of replacing the old “static” or “partial” thinking by the new “dynamic”
or “global” way, one learns to recognize that what at first appears
sheer nonsense is a sign of the same intellectual attitude with whose
manifestations we can alone concern ourselves here.</p>
<p>My first examples are two works by a gifted scholar which in the past
few years have attracted much attention. There are, perhaps, few other
instances in contemporary English literature where the influence of the
specific German ideas with which we are concerned is so marked as in
Professor E. H. Carr’s books on the Twenty Years’ Crisis and the
Conditions of Peace.9</p>
<p>In the first of these two books Professor Carr frankly confessed
himself an adherent of “the ‘historical school’ of realists (which) had
its home in Germany and (whose) development can be traced through the
great names of Hegel and Marx.”10 A realist, he explains, is one “who
makes morality a function of politics” and who “cannot logically accept
any standard of value save that of fact.”11 This “realism” is
contrasted, in truly German fashion, with the “utopian” thought dating
from the eighteenth century “which was essentially individualist in that
it made the human conscience the final court of appeal.”12 But the old
morals with their “abstract general principles” must disappear because
“the empiricist treats the concrete case on its individual merits.”13 In
other words, nothing but expediency matters, and we are even assured
that “the rule pacta sunt servanda is not a moral principle.”14 That
without abstract general principles merit becomes solely a matter of
arbitrary opinion and that international treaties, if they are not
morally binding, have no meaning whatever does not seem to worry
Professor Carr.</p>
<p>According to Professor Carr, indeed, although he does not explicitly
say so, it appears that England fought the last war on the wrong side.
Anyone who rereads now the statements of British war aims of twenty-five
years ago and compares them with Professor Carr’s present views will
readily see that what were then believed to be the German views are now
those of Professor Carr, who would presumably argue that the different
views then professed in this country were merely a product of British
hypocrisy. How little difference he is able to see between the ideals
held in this country and those practiced by present-day Germany is best
illustrated by his assertion that “it is true that when a prominent
National Socialist asserts that ‘anything that benefits the German
people is right, anything that harms them is wrong’ he is merely
propounding the same identification of national interest with universal
right which has already been established for English-speaking countries
by (President) Wilson, Professor Toynbee, Lord Cecil, and many
others.”15</p>
<p>Since Professor Carr’s books are devoted to international problems,
it is mainly in that field that their characteristic tendency becomes
apparent. But from the glimpses one gets of the character of the future
society which he contemplates, it appears also to be quite on the
totalitarian model. Sometimes one even wonders whether the resemblance
is accidental or deliberate. Does Professor Carr, for example, realize,
when he asserts that “we can no longer find much meaning in the
distinction familiar to nineteenth-century thought between ‘society’ and
‘state,’” that this is precisely the doctrine of Professor Carl Schmitt,
the leading Nazi theoretician of totalitarianism and, in fact, the
essence of the definition of totalitarianism which that author has given
to that term which he himself had introduced?16 Or that the view that,
“the mass production of opinion is the corollary of the mass production
of goods” and that, therefore, “the prejudice which the word propaganda
still exerts in many minds today is closely parallel to the prejudice
against control of industry and trade”17 is really an apology for a
regimentation of opinion of the kind practiced by the Nazis?</p>
<p>In his more recent Conditions of Peace Professor Carr answers with an
emphatic affirmative the question with which we concluded the last
chapter:</p>
<p>“The victors lost the peace, and Soviet Russia and Germany won it,
because the former continued to preach, and in part to apply, the once
valid, but now disruptive ideals of the rights of nations and laissez
faire capitalism, whereas the latter, consciously or unconsciously borne
forward on the tide of the twentieth century, were striving to build up
the world in larger units under centralized planning and control.”18</p>
<p>Professor Carr completely makes his own the German battle cry of the
socialist revolution of the East against the liberal West in which
Germany was the leader: “The revolution which began in the last war,
which has been the driving force of every significant political movement
in the last twenty years . . . a revolution against the predominant
ideas of the nineteenth century: liberal democracy, national
self-determination and laissez faire economics.”19 As he himself rightly
says, “it was almost inevitable that this challenge to
nineteenth-century beliefs which she had never really shared should find
in Germany one of its strongest protagonists.”20 With all the fatalistic
belief of every pseudo-historian since Hegel and Marx, this development
is represented as inevitable: “We know the direction in which the world
is moving, and we must bow to it or perish.”21</p>
<p>The conviction that this trend is inevitable is characteristically
based on familiar economic fallacies—the presumed necessity of the
general growth of monopolies in consequence of technological
developments, the alleged “potential plenty,” and all the other popular
catchwords which appear in works of this kind. Professor Carr is not an
economist, and his economic argument generally will not bear serious
examination. But neither this nor his belief characteristically held at
the same time, that the importance of the economic factor in social life
is rapidly decreasing, prevents him from basing on economic arguments
all his predictions about the inevitable developments or from presenting
as his main demands for the future “the reinterpretation in
predominantly economic terms of the democratic ideals of ‘equality’ and
‘liberty’”!22</p>
<p>Professor Carr’s contempt for all the ideas of liberal economists
(which he insists on calling nineteenth-century ideas, though he knows
that Germany “had never really shared” them and had already in the
nineteenth century practiced most of the principles he now advocates) is
as profound as that of any of the German writers quoted in the last
chapter. He even takes over the German thesis, originated by Friedrich
List, that free trade was a policy dictated solely by, and appropriate
only to, the special interests of England in the nineteenth century.23
Now, however, “the artificial production of some degree of autarchy is a
necessary condition of orderly social existence.”24 To bring about a
“return to a more dispersed and generalized world trade . . . by a
‘removal of trade barriers’ or by a resuscitation of the laissez faire
principles of the nineteenth century” is “unthinkable.”25 The future
belongs to Grossraumwirtschaft of the German kind: “The result which we
desire can be won only by a deliberate reorganization of European life
such as Hitler has undertaken”!26</p>
<p>After all this one is hardly surprised to find a characteristic
section headed “The Moral Functions of War,” in which Professor Carr
condescendingly pities “the well-meaning people (especially in
English-speaking countries) who, steeped in the nineteenth-century
tradition, persist in regarding war as senseless and devoid of purpose,”
and rejoices in the “sense of meaning and purpose” which war, “the most
powerful instrument of social solidarity,” creates.27 This is all very
familiar—but it was not in the works of English scholars that one
expected to find these views.</p>
<p>Possibly we have not yet given enough attention to one feature of the
intellectual development in Germany during the last hundred years which
is now in an almost identical form making its appearance in the
English-speaking countries: the scientists’ agitating for a “scientific”
organization of society. The ideal of a society organized “through and
through” from the top has in Germany been considerably furthered by the
quite unique influence which her scientific and technological
specialists were allowed to exercise on the formation of social and
political opinions. Few people remember that in the modern history of
Germany the political professors have played a role comparable to that
of the political lawyers in France.28 The influence of these
scientist-politicians was of late years not often on the side of
liberty: the “intolerance of reason” so frequently conspicuous in the
scientific specialist, the impatience with the ways of the ordinary man
so characteristic of the expert, and the contempt for anything which was
not consciously organized by superior minds according to a scientific
blueprint were phenomena familiar in German public life for generations
before they became of significance in England. And perhaps no other
country provides a better illustration of the effects on a nation of a
general and thorough shift of the greater part of its educational system
from the “humanities” to the “realities” than Germany between 1840 and
1940.29</p>
<p>The way in which, in the end, with few exceptions, her scholars and
scientists put themselves readily at the service of the new rulers is
one of the most depressing and shameful spectacles in the whole history
of the rise of National Socialism.30 It is well known that particularly
the scientists and engineers, who had so loudly claimed to be the
leaders on the march to a new and better world, submitted more readily
than almost any other class to the new tyranny.31</p>
<p>The role which the intellectuals played in the totalitarian
transformation of society was prophetically foreseen in another country
by Julien Benda, whose Trahison des clercs assumes new significance when
one now re-reads it, fifteen years after it has been written.32 There is
particularly one passage in that work which deserves to be well pondered
and kept in mind when we come to consider certain examples of the
excursions of British scientists into politics. It is the passage in
which M. Benda speaks of the “superstition of science held to be
competent in all domains, including that of morality; a superstition
which, I repeat, is an acquisition of the nineteenth century. It remains
to discover whether those who brandish this doctrine believe in it or
whether they simply want to give the prestige of a scientific appearance
to passions of their hearts, which they perfectly know are nothing but
passions. It is to be noted that the dogma that history is obedient to
scientific laws is preached especially by partisans of arbitrary
authority. This is quite natural, since it eliminates the two realities
they most hate, i.e., human liberty and the historical action of the
individual.”33</p>
<p>We have already had occasion to mention one English product of this
kind, a work in which, on a Marxist background, all the characteristic
idiosyncrasies of the totalitarian intellectual, a hatred of almost
everything which distinguishes Western civilization since the
Renaissance, is combined with an approval of the methods of
Inquisition.34 We do not wish to consider here such an extreme case and
shall take a work which is more representative and which has achieved
considerable publicity. C. H. Waddington’s little book under the
characteristic title, The Scientific Attitude, is as good an example as
any of a class of literature which is actively sponsored by the
influential British weekly Nature and which combines claims for greater
political power for the scientists with an ardent advocacy of wholesale
“planning.”35 Though not quite so outspoken in his contempt for freedom
as Mr. Crowther, Dr. Waddington is hardly more reassuring. He differs
from most of the writers of the same kind in that he clearly sees and
even emphasizes that the tendencies he describes and supports inevitably
lead to a totalitarian system. Yet apparently this appears to him
preferable to what he describes as “the present ferocious monkey-house
civilization.”36</p>
<p>Dr. Waddington’s claim that the scientist is qualified to run a
totalitarian society is based mainly on his thesis that “science can
pass ethical judgment on human behavior”—a claim to the elaboration of
which by Dr. Waddington Nature has given considerable publicity.37 It
is, of course, a thesis which has long been familiar to the German
scientist-politicians and which has justly been singled out by J.
Benda.38 For an illustration of what this means we do not need to go
outside Dr. Waddington’s book. Freedom, he explains, “is a very
troublesome concept for the scientist to discuss, partly because he is
not convinced that, in the last analysis, there is such a thing.”39
Nevertheless, we are told that “science recognizes” this and that kind
of freedom, but “the freedom to be odd and unlike one’s neighbor is not
. . . a scientific value.”40 Apparently the “harlot humanities,” about
which Dr. Waddington has to say many uncomplimentary things, have
gravely misled us in teaching us tolerance!41</p>
<p>That when it comes to social and economic questions this book on the
“scientific attitude” is anything but scientific is what one has learned
to expect of this kind of literature. We find again all the familiar
clichés and baseless generalizations about “potential plenty” and the
inevitable tendency toward monopoly, though the “best authorities”
quoted in support of these contentions prove on examination to be mostly
political tracts of questionable scientific standing, while the serious
studies of the same problems are conspicuously neglected.42</p>
<p>As in almost all works of this type, Dr. Waddington’s convictions are
largely determined by his belief in “inevitable historical tendencies”
which science is presumed to have discovered and which he derives from
“the profound scientific philosophy” of Marxism, whose basic notions are
“almost, if not quite, identical with those underlying the scientific
approach to nature”43 and which his “competence to judge” tells
Dr. Waddington are an advance on anything which has gone before.44 Thus
Dr. Waddington, though he finds it “difficult to deny that England now
is a worse country to live in than it was” in 1913,45 looks forward to
an economic system which “will be centralized and totalitarian in the
sense that all aspects of the economic development of large regions are
consciously planned as an integrated whole.”46 And for his facile
optimism that in this totalitarian system freedom of thought will be
preserved, his “scientific attitude” has no better counsel than the
conviction that “there must be very valuable evidence about questions
which one does not need to be an expert to understand,” such as, for
example, whether it is possible “to combine totalitarianism with freedom
of thought.”47</p>
<p>A fuller survey of the various tendencies toward totalitarianism in
England would have to give considerable attention to the various
attempts to create some kind of middle-class socialism bearing, no doubt
unknown to their authors, an alarming resemblance to similar
developments in pre-Hitler Germany.48 If we were concerned here with
political movements proper, we should have to consider such new
organizations as the “Forward-March” or “Common-Wealth” movement of Sir
Richard Acland, the author of Unser Kampf, or the activities of the
“1941 Committee” of Mr. J. B. Priestley, at one time associated with the
former.49 But, though it would be unwise to disregard the symptomatic
significance of such phenomena as these, they can hardly yet be counted
as important political forces. Apart from the intellectual influences
which we have illustrated by two instances, the impetus of the movement
toward totalitarianism comes mainly from the two great vested interests:
organized capital and organized labor. Probably the greatest menace of
all is the fact that the policies of these two most powerful groups
point in the same direction.</p>
<p>They do this through their common, and often concerted, support of
the monopolistic organization of industry; and it is this tendency which
is the great immediate danger. While there is no reason to believe that
this movement is inevitable, there can be little doubt that if we
continue on the path we have been treading, it will lead us to
totalitarianism.</p>
<p>This movement is, of course, deliberately planned mainly by the
capitalist organizers of monopolies, and they are thus one of the main
sources of this danger. Their responsibility is not altered by the fact
that their aim is not a totalitarian system but rather a sort of
corporative society in which the organized industries would appear as
semi-independent and self-governing “estates.” But they are as
shortsighted as were their German colleagues in believing that they will
be allowed not only to create but also for any length of time to run
such a system. The decisions which the managers of such an organized
industry would constantly have to make are not decisions which any
society will long leave to private individuals. A state which allows
such enormous aggregations of power to grow up cannot afford to let this
power rest entirely in private control. Nor is the belief any less
illusory that in such conditions the entrepreneurs will be long allowed
to enjoy the favored position which in a competitive society is
justified by the fact that, of the many who take the risks, only a few
achieve the success the chances of which make the risk worth taking. It
is not surprising that entrepreneurs should like to enjoy both the high
income which in a competitive society the successful ones among them
gain and the security of the civil servant. So long as a large sector of
private industry exists side by side with the government-run industry,
great industrial talent is likely to command high salaries even in
fairly secure positions. But while the entrepreneurs may well see their
expectations borne out during a transition stage, it will not be long
before they will find, as their German colleagues did, that they are no
longer masters but will in every respect have to be satisfied with
whatever power and emoluments the government will concede them.</p>
<p>Unless the argument of this book has been completely misunderstood,
the author will not be suspected of any tenderness toward the
capitalists if he stresses here that it would nevertheless be a mistake
to put the blame for the modern movement toward monopoly exclusively or
mainly on that class. Their propensity in this direction is neither new
nor would it by itself be likely to become a formidable power. The fatal
development was that they have succeeded in enlisting the support of an
ever increasing number of other groups and, with their help, in
obtaining the support of the state.</p>
<p>In some measure the monopolists have gained this support either by
letting other groups participate in their gains or, and perhaps even
more frequently, by persuading them that the formation of monopolies was
in the public interest. But the change in public opinion, which through
its influence on legislation and judicature50 has been the most
important factor to make this development possible, is more than
anything the result of the propaganda against competition by the Left.
Very frequently even measures aimed against the monopolists in fact
serve only to strengthen the power of monopoly. Every raid on the gains
of monopoly, be it in the interest of particular groups or of the state
as a whole, tends to create new vested interests which will help to
bolster up monopoly. A system in which large privileged groups profit
from the gains of monopoly may be politically much more dangerous, and
monopoly in such a system certainly is much more powerful, than in one
where the profits go to a limited few. But though it should be clear
that, for example, the higher wages which the monopolist is in a
position to pay are just as much the result of exploitation as his own
profit, and are just as certain to make poorer not only all the
consumers but still more all other wage-earners, not merely those who
benefit from it but the public generally nowadays accept the ability to
pay higher wages as a legitimate argument in favor of monopoly.51</p>
<p>There is serious reason for doubt whether even in those cases where
monopoly is inevitable the best way of controlling it is to put it in
the hands of the state. If only a single industry were in question, this
might well be so. But, when we have to deal with many different
monopolistic industries, there is much to be said for leaving them in
different private hands rather than combining them under the single
control of the state. Even if railways, road and air transport, or the
supply of gas and electricity were all inevitably monopolies, the
consumer is unquestionably in a much stronger position so long as they
remain separate monopolies than when they are “coordinated” by a central
control. Private monopoly is scarcely ever complete and even more rarely
of long duration or able to disregard potential competition. But a state
monopoly is always a state-protected monopoly—protected against both
potential competition and effective criticism. It means in most
instances that a temporary monopoly is given the power to secure its
position for all time—a power almost certain to be used. Where the power
which ought to check and control monopoly becomes interested in
sheltering and defending its appointees, where for the government to
remedy an abuse is to admit responsibility for it, and where criticism
of the actions of monopoly means criticism of the government, there is
little hope of monopoly becoming the servant of the community. A state
which is entangled in all directions in the running of monopolistic
enterprise, while it would possess crushing power over the individual,
would yet be a weak state in so far as its freedom in formulating policy
is concerned. The machinery of monopoly becomes identical with the
machinery of the state, and the state itself becomes more and more
identified with the interests of those who run things than with the
interests of the people in general.</p>
<p>The probability is that wherever monopoly is really inevitable the
plan which used to be preferred by Americans, of a strong state control
over private monopolies, if consistently pursued, offers a better chance
of satisfactory results than state management. This would at least seem
to be so where the state enforces a stringent price control which leaves
no room for extraordinary profits in which others than the monopolists
can participate. Even if this should have the effect (as it sometimes
had with American public utilities) that the services of the
monopolistic industries would become less satisfactory than they might
be, this would be a small price to pay for an effective check on the
powers of monopoly. Personally, I should much prefer to have to put up
with some such inefficiency than have organized monopoly control my ways
of life. Such a method of dealing with monopoly, which would rapidly
make the position of the monopolist the least eligible among
entrepreneurial positions, would also do as much as anything to reduce
monopoly to the spheres where it is inevitable and to stimulate the
invention of substitutes which can be provided competitively. Only make
the position of the monopolist once more that of the whipping boy of
economic policy, and you will be surprised how quickly most of the abler
entrepreneurs will rediscover their taste for the bracing air of
competition!</p>
<p>The problem of monopoly would not be difficult as it is if it were
only the capitalist monopolist whom we have to fight. But, as has
already been said, monopoly has become the danger that it is, not
through the efforts of a few interested capitalists, but through the
support they have obtained from those whom they have let share in their
gains, and from the many more whom they have persuaded that in
supporting monopoly they assist in the creation of a more just and
orderly society. The fatal turning-point in the modern development was
when the great movement which can serve its original ends only by
fighting all privilege, the labor movement, came under the influence of
anti-competition doctrines and became itself entangled in the strife for
privilege. The recent growth of monopoly is largely the result of a
deliberate collaboration of organized capital and organized labor where
the privileged groups of labor share in the monopoly profits at the
expense of the community and particularly at the expense of the poorest,
those employed in the less-well-organized industries and the
unemployed.</p>
<p>It is one of the saddest spectacles of our time to see a great
democratic movement support a policy which must lead to the destruction
of democracy and which meanwhile can benefit only a minority of the
masses who support it.52 Yet it is this support from the Left of the
tendencies toward monopoly which make them so irresistible and the
prospects of the future so dark. So long as labor continues to assist in
the destruction of the only order under which at least some degree of
independence and freedom has been secured to every worker, there is
indeed little hope for the future. The labor leaders who now proclaim so
loudly that they have “done once and for all with the mad competitive
system”53 are proclaiming the doom of the freedom of the individual.
There is no other possibility than either the order governed by the
impersonal discipline of the market or that directed by the will of a
few individuals; and those who are out to destroy the first are
wittingly or unwittingly helping to create the second. Even though some
workmen will perhaps be better fed, and all will no doubt be more
uniformly dressed in that new order, it is permissible to doubt whether
the majority of English workmen will in the end thank the intellectuals
among their leaders who have presented them with a socialist doctrine
which endangers their personal freedom.</p>
<p>To anyone who is familiar with the history of the major Continental
countries in the last twenty-five years, the study of the recent program
of the Labour party in England, now committed to the creation of a
“planned society,” is a most depressing experience. To “any attempt to
restore traditional Britain” there is opposed a scheme which not only in
general outline but also in detail and even wording is indistinguishable
from the socialist dreams which dominated German discussion twenty-five
years ago. Not only demands, like those of the resolution, adopted on
Professor Laski’s motion, which requires the retention in peacetime of
the “measures of government control needed for mobilizing the national
resources in war” but all the characteristic catchwords, such as the
“balanced economy,” which Professor Laski now demands for Great Britain,
or the “community consumption” toward which production is to be
centrally directed, are bodily taken over from the German ideology.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago there was perhaps still some excuse for holding
the naïve belief that “a planned society can be a far more free society
than the competitive laissez faire order it has come to replace.”54 But
to find it once more held after twenty-five years of experience and the
re-examination of the old beliefs to which this experience has led, and
at a time when we are fighting the results of those very doctrines, is
tragic beyond words. That the great party which in Parliament and public
opinion has largely taken the place of the progressive parties of the
past should have ranged itself with what, in the light of all past
development, must be regarded as a reactionary movement, is the decisive
change which has taken place in our time and the source of the mortal
danger to everything a liberal must value. That the advances of the past
should be threatened by the traditionalist forces of the Right is a
phenomenon of all ages which need not alarm us. But if the place of the
opposition, in public discussion as well as in Parliament, should become
lastingly the monopoly of a second reactionary party, there would,
indeed, be no hope left.</p>

<p>8 Especially when we consider the proportion of former socialists who
have become Nazis it is important to remember that the true significance
of this ratio is seen only if we compare it, not with the total number
of former socialists, but with the number of those whose conversion
would not in any case have been prevented by their ancestry. In fact,
one of the surprising features of the political emigration from Germany
is the comparatively small number of refugees from the Left who are not
“Jews” in the German sense of the term. How often do we not hear
eulogies of the German system prefaced by some statement such as the
following with which at a recent conference an enumeration of the
“features of the totalitarian technique of economic mobilization which
are worth thinking about” was introduced: “Herr Hitler is not my
ideal—far from it. There are very pressing personal reasons why Herr
Hitler should not be my ideal, but . . .”</p>

<p>30 The servility of the scientists to the powers-that-be appeared
early in Germany, hand in hand with the great development of
state-organized science, which today is the subject of so much eulogy
abroad. One of the most famous of German scientists, the physiologist,
Emil du Bois-Raymond, was not ashamed, in an oration delivered in 1870
in his double capacity of rector of the University of Berlin and
president of the Prussian Academy of Science, to proclaim that “we, the
University of Berlin, quartered opposite the King’s palace, are, by the
deed of our foundation, the intellectual bodyguard of the House of
Hohenzollern,” in A Speech on the German War (London: Bentley, 1870),
p. 31.—It is remarkable that du Bois-Reymond should have thought it
advisable to issue an English edition of this oration. (German
physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896) taught at Berlin, and is
known as the discoverer of neuro-electricity. —Ed.)</p>
<p>31 It will suffice to quote one foreign witness: Robert A. Brady, in
his study of The Spirit and Structure of German Fascism (London: V.
Gollancz, 1937), pp. 76–77, concludes his detailed account of the
development in the German academic world with the statement that “the
scientist, per se, is hence, perhaps, the most easily used and
‘coordinated’ of all the especially trained people in modern society.
The Nazis, to be true, fired a good many University professors, and
dismissed a good many scientists from research laboratories. But the
professors were primarily among the social sciences where there was more
common awareness of and a more persistent criticism of the Nazi
programmes, and not among the natural sciences where thinking is
supposed to be most rigorous. Those dismissed in this latter field were
primarily Jewish or exceptions to the generalisations made above,
because of the equally uncritical acceptance of beliefs running contrary
to Nazi views.— Consequently the Nazis were able to ‘coordinate’
scholars and scientists with relative ease, and hence to throw behind
their elaborate propaganda the seeming weight of the bulk of German
learned opinion and support.”</p>
<p>32 (Hayek refers to Julien Benda, La Trahison des Clercs (Paris: B.
Grasset, 1927). French author and philosopher Julien Benda (1867–1956)
began his career writing about the Dreyfuss affair. In his most famous
book, Benda argued that in past ages intellectuals (clercs) engaged in a
disinterested search for universal truths; they searched for ideals that
transcended the needs of the state or society in which they lived. In
recent times, however, intellectuals have become more and more the
handmaiden of political and national causes. As a result of this
betrayal of the clercs, extremist political passions had recently become
more universal, coherent, continuous, and preponderant. —Ed.)</p>
<p>33 (Hayek quotes from the English translation of Benda’s book. See
Julien Benda, The Betrayal of the Intellectuals, trans. Richard
Aldington (New York: William Morrow, 1928; reprinted, Boston: Beacon,
1955), p. 182. The original 1928 translation carried the title, The
Treason of the Intellectuals, but “betrayal,” chosen for the reprinted
version, conveys Benda’s argument better than the more literal
“treason.” —Ed.)</p>

Conrad Hal Waddington (1905–1975) made contributions to evolutionary
theory and also authored a number of popular texts on science. During
the early days of the war the editors of Nature frequently endorsed the
use of scientific planning both for the war effort and beyond, as I
noted in my introduction, pp. 11–12. —Ed.)</p>

contained further exchanges between Waddington and various others. All
of this was ultimately collected in the book by C. H. Waddington et al.,
Science and Ethics (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1942). —Ed.)</p>
<p>38 ( Julien Benda, The Betrayal of the Intellectuals, op. cit., more
than once blames German scholars for initiating the betrayal of the
clercs and for making it more likely that others would follow. Thus he
states, on pp. 42–43, “The nationalist ‘clerk’ is essentially a German
invention. . . . It is undeniable that from the moment when Germany had
a Mommsen, France especially was bound to have a Barrès, under penalty
of finding herself in a position of great inferiority in nationalist
fanaticism. . . .” —Ed.)</p>

<p>48 Another element which after this war is likely to strengthen the
tendencies in this direction will be some of the men who during the war
have tasted the powers of coercive control and will find it difficult to
reconcile themselves with the humbler roles they will then have to play.
Though after the last war men of this kind were not so numerous as they
will probably be in the future, they exercised even then a not
inconsiderable influence on the economic policy of this country. It was
in the company of some of these men that as long as ten or twelve years
ago I first experienced in this country the then still unusual sensation
of being suddenly transported into what I had learned to regard as a
thoroughly “German” intellectual atmosphere. (“Ten or twelve years”
earlier Hayek had just joined the faculty at the London School of
Economics. As noted in my introduction, pp. 3–4, Hayek expanded on the
claim that certain then-common views among the British public were
reminiscent of those held earlier in Germany in his inaugural lecture,
“The Trend of Economic Thinking,” op. cit. —Ed.)</p>
<p>49 (Sir Richard Acland, Bt. (1906–1990) formed the socialist
Commonwealth Party in 1942 together with the English writer and
political commentator John Boynton Priestly (1894–1984). The party found
little success at the polls and was dissolved in 1945. Priestly was the
chairman of the “Committee of 1941,” of which Acland was a member. The
Committee called for more comprehensive central planning during the war
effort, and for its continuation after the war concluded. Acland was the
author of both Unser Kampf: Our Struggle (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1940)
and The Forward March (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1941). In the
latter he argued that, in the new age of plenty toward which we are
marching, men feel that they must serve a higher cause and participate
in something greater than themselves. Acland outlined a new “service
economy” in which this can occur. —Ed.)</p>

and the Law: An Economist’s Reflections on the Crofter Case,” Modern Law
Review, vol. 6, April 1943, pp. 97–111.</p>
<p>51 Even more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable tenderness which
many socialists are likely to show toward the rentier bondholders to
whom monopolist organization of industry frequently guarantees secure
incomes. That their blind enmity to profits should lead people to
represent effortless fixed income as socially or ethically more
desirable than profits, and to accept even monopoly to secure such a
guaranteed income to, for example, railway bondholders, is one of the
most extraordinary symptoms of the perversion of values which has taken
place during the last generation.</p>
<p>52 (Hayek refers here to the British Labour Party’s policies as
enunciated in the Labour Party pamphlet, The Old World and the New
Society: A Report on the Problems of War and Peace Reconstruction, op.
cit., or in Harold Laski’s address before the Labour Party Conference in
1942. —Ed.)</p>
<p>53 Professor H. J. Laski, “A Planned Economic Democracy,” The Labour
Party Report of the 41st Annual Conference, op. cit., p. 111. It
deserves to be noted that, according to Professor Laski, it is “this mad
competitive system which spells poverty for all peoples, and war as
outcome of that poverty”—a curious reading of the history of the last
hundred and fifty years. (Hayek refers to Laski’s address on May 26,
1942, in support of a resolution, found on p. 110, that reads, “This
Conference affirms that there must be no return after the war to an
unplanned competitive society, which inevitably produces economic
insecurity, industrial inefficiency, and social inequality. It notes
that the pressure of war has already necessitated far-reaching
Government control of industry, central planning of the nation’s
economic life, and the subordination of many private interests to the
common good, and urges that this process be carried further in order to
achieve swift and total victory. It declares that measures of Government
control needed for mobilising the national resources in war are no less
necessary for securing their best use in peace, and must therefore be
maintained after final victory is won. It regards the socialisation of
the basic industries and services of the country, and the planning of
production for community consumption, as the only lasting foundation for
a just and prosperous economic order in which political democracy and
personal liberty can be combined with a reasonable standard of living
for all citizens.</p>
<p>“The Conference therefore affirms that it is urgent to undertake
without delay the necessary preparation for the vital changes here
proposed.” The resolution as stated was passed by the assembly.
