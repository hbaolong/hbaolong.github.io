<h4 id="three">THREE</h4>
<p>INDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM</p>
<p>The socialists believe in two things which are absolutely different
and perhaps even contradictory: freedom and organization. —Élie
Halévy1</p>
<p>Before we can progress with our main problem, an obstacle has yet to
be surmounted. A confusion largely responsible for the way in which we
are drifting into things which nobody wants must be cleared up. This
confusion concerns nothing less than the concept of socialism itself. It
may mean, and is often used to describe, merely the ideals of social
justice, greater equality, and security, which are the ultimate aims of
socialism. But it means also the particular method by which most
socialists hope to attain these ends and which many competent people
regard as the only methods by which they can be fully and quickly
attained. In this sense socialism means the abolition of private
enterprise, of private ownership of the means of production, and the
creation of a system of “planned economy” in which the entrepreneur
working for profit is replaced by a central planning body.</p>
<p>There are many people who call themselves socialists, although they
care only about the first, who fervently believe in those ultimate aims
of socialism but neither care nor understand how they can be achieved,
and who are merely certain that they must be achieved, whatever the
cost. But to nearly all those to whom socialism is not merely a hope but
an object of practical politics, the characteristic methods of modern
socialism are as essential as the ends themselves. Many people, on the
other hand, who value the ultimate ends of socialism no less than the
socialists refuse to support socialism because of the dangers to other
values they see in the methods proposed by the socialists. The dispute
about socialism has thus become largely a dispute about means and not
about ends—although the question whether the different ends of socialism
can be simultaneously achieved is also involved.</p>
<p>This would be enough to create confusion. And the confusion has been
further increased by the common practice of denying that those who
repudiate the means value the ends. But this is not all. The situation
is still more complicated by the fact that the same means, the “economic
planning” which is the prime instrument of socialist reform, can be used
for many other purposes. We must centrally direct economic activity if
we want to make the distribution of income conform to current ideas of
social justice. “Planning,” therefore, is wanted by all those who demand
that “production for use” be substituted for production for profit. But
such planning is no less indispensable if the distribution of incomes is
to be regulated in a way which to us appears to be the opposite of just.
Whether we should wish that more of the good things of this world should
go to some racial élite, the Nordic men, or the members of a party or an
aristocracy, the methods which we shall have to employ are the same as
those which could insure an equalitarian distribution.</p>
<p>It may, perhaps, seem unfair to use the term “socialism” to describe
its methods rather than its aims, to use for a particular method a term
which for many people stands for an ultimate ideal. It is probably
preferable to describe the methods which can be used for a great variety
of ends as collectivism and to regard socialism as a species of that
genus. Yet, although to most socialists only one species of collectivism
will represent true socialism, it must always be remembered that
socialism is a species of collectivism and that therefore everything
which is true of collectivism as such must apply also to socialism.
Nearly all the points which are disputed between socialists and liberals
concern the methods common to all forms of collectivism and not the
particular ends for which socialists want to use them; and all the
consequences with which we shall be concerned in this book follow from
the methods of collectivism irrespective of the ends for which they are
used. It must also not be forgotten that socialism is not only by far
the most important species of collectivism or “planning” but that it is
socialism which has persuaded liberal-minded people to submit once more
to that regimentation of economic life which they had overthrown
because, in the words of Adam Smith, it puts governments in a position
where “to support themselves they are obliged to be oppressive and
tyrannical.”2</p>
<p>The difficulties caused by the ambiguities of the common political
terms are not yet over if we agree to use the term “collectivism” so as
to include all types of “planned economy,” whatever the end of planning.
The meaning of this term becomes somewhat more definite if we make it
clear that we mean that sort of planning which is necessary to realize
any given distributive ideals. But, as the idea of central economic
planning owes its appeal largely to this very vagueness of its meaning,
it is essential that we should agree on its precise sense before we
discuss its consequences.</p>
<p>“Planning” owes its popularity largely to the fact that everybody
desires, of course, that we should handle our common problems as
rationally as possible and that, in so doing, we should use as much
foresight as we can command. In this sense everybody who is not a
complete fatalist is a planner, every political act is (or ought to be)
an act of planning, and there can be differences only between good and
bad, between wise and foresighted and foolish and shortsighted planning.
An economist, whose whole task is the study of how men actually do and
how they might plan their affairs, is the last person who could object
to planning in this general sense. But it is not in this sense that our
enthusiasts for a planned society now employ this term, nor merely in
this sense that we must plan if we want the distribution of income or
wealth to conform to some particular standard. According to the modern
planners, and for their purposes, it is not sufficient to design the
most rational permanent framework within which the various activities
would be conducted by different persons according to their individual
plans. This liberal plan, according to them, is no plan—and it is,
indeed, not a plan designed to satisfy particular views about who should
have what. What our planners demand is a central direction of all
economic activity according to a single plan, laying down how the
resources of society should be “consciously directed” to serve
particular ends in a definite way.</p>
<p>The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is,
therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently
between the various possible organizations of society; it is not a
dispute on whether we ought to employ foresight and systematic thinking
in planning our common affairs. It is a dispute about what is the best
way of so doing. The question is whether for this purpose it is better
that the holder of coercive power should confine himself in general to
creating conditions under which the knowledge and initiative of
individuals are given the best scope so that they can plan most
successfully; or whether a rational utilization of our resources
requires central direction and organization of all our activities
according to some consciously constructed “blueprint.” The socialists of
all parties have appropriated the term “planning” for planning of the
latter type, and it is now generally accepted in this sense. But though
this is meant to suggest that this is the only rational way of handling
our affairs, it does not, of course, prove this. It remains the point on
which the planners and the liberals disagree.</p>
<p>It is important not to confuse opposition against this kind of
planning with a dogmatic laissez faire attitude. The liberal argument is
in favor of making the best possible use of the forces of competition as
a means of coordinating human efforts, not an argument for leaving
things just as they are. It is based on the conviction that, where
effective competition can be created, it is a better way of guiding
individual efforts than any other. It does not deny, but even
emphasizes, that, in order that competition should work beneficially, a
carefully thought-out legal framework is required and that neither the
existing nor the past legal rules are free from grave defects. Nor does
it deny that, where it is impossible to create the conditions necessary
to make competition effective, we must resort to other methods of
guiding economic activity. Economic liberalism is opposed, however, to
competition’s being supplanted by inferior methods of coordinating
individual efforts. And it regards competition as superior not only
because it is in most circumstances the most efficient method known but
even more because it is the only method by which our activities can be
adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of
authority. Indeed, one of the main arguments in favor of competition is
that it dispenses with the need for “conscious social control” and that
it gives the individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects of a
particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages
and risks connected with it.</p>
<p>The successful use of competition as the principle of social
organization precludes certain types of coercive interference with
economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very
considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of
government action. But there is good reason why the negative
requirements, the points where coercion must not be used, have been
particularly stressed. It is necessary in the first instance that the
parties in the market should be free to sell and buy at any price at
which they can find a partner to the transaction and that anybody should
be free to produce, sell, and buy anything that may be produced or sold
at all. And it is essential that the entry into the different trades
should be open to all on equal terms and that the law should not
tolerate any attempts by individuals or groups to restrict this entry by
open or concealed force. Any attempt to control prices or quantities of
particular commodities deprives competition of its power of bringing
about an effective coordination of individual efforts, because price
changes then cease to register all the relevant changes in circumstances
and no longer provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily true, however, of measures merely restricting
the allowed methods of production, so long as these restrictions affect
all potential producers equally and are not used as an indirect way of
controlling prices and quantities. Though all such controls of the
methods of production impose extra costs (i.e., make it necessary to use
more resources to produce a given output), they may be well worth while.
To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances or to require
special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require
certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation
of competition. The only question here is whether in the particular
instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs which
they impose. Nor is the preservation of competition incompatible with an
extensive system of social services—so long as the organization of these
services is not designed in such a way as to make competition
ineffective over wide fields.</p>
<p>It is regrettable, though not difficult to explain, that in the past
much less attention has been given to the positive requirements of a
successful working of the competitive system than to these negative
points. The functioning of a competition not only requires adequate
organization of certain institutions like money, markets, and channels
of information—some of which can never be adequately provided by private
enterprise—but it depends, above all, on the existence of an appropriate
legal system, a legal system designed both to preserve competition and
to make it operate as beneficially as possible. It is by no means
sufficient that the law should recognize the principle of private
property and freedom of contract; much depends on the precise definition
of the right of property as applied to different things. The systematic
study of the forms of legal institutions which will make the competitive
system work efficiently has been sadly neglected; and strong arguments
can be advanced that serious shortcomings here, particularly with regard
to the law of corporations and of patents, not only have made
competition work much less effectively than it might have done but have
even led to the destruction of competition in many spheres.</p>
<p>There are, finally, undoubted fields where no legal arrangements can
create the main condition on which the usefulness of the system of
competition and private property depends: namely, that the owner
benefits from all the useful services rendered by his property and
suffers for all the damages caused to others by its use. Where, for
example, it is impracticable to make the enjoyment of certain services
dependent on the payment of a price, competition will not produce the
services; and the price system becomes similarly ineffective when the
damage caused to others by certain uses of property cannot be
effectively charged to the owner of that property. In all these
instances there is a divergence between the items which enter into
private calculation and those which affect social welfare; and, whenever
this divergence becomes important, some method other than competition
may have to be found to supply the services in question. Thus neither
the provision of signposts on the roads nor, in most circumstances, that
of the roads themselves can be paid for by every individual user. Nor
can certain harmful effects of deforestation, of some methods of
farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories be confined to the owner
of the property in question or to those who are willing to submit to the
damage for an agreed compensation. In such instances we must find some
substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism. But the fact that
we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority
where the conditions for the proper working of competition cannot be
created does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can
be made to function.</p>
<p>To create conditions in which competition will be as effective as
possible, to supplement it where it cannot be made effective, to provide
the services which, in the words of Adam Smith, “though they may be in
the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of
such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expense to any
individual or small number of individuals”— these tasks provide, indeed,
a wide and unquestioned field for state activity.3 In no system that
could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing. An
effective competitive system needs an intelligently designed and
continuously adjusted legal framework as much as any other. Even the
most essential prerequisite of its proper functioning, the prevention of
fraud and deception (including exploitation of ignorance), provides a
great and by no means yet fully accomplished object of legislative
activity.</p>
<p>The task of creating a suitable framework for the beneficial working
of competition had, however, not yet been carried very far when states
everywhere turned from it to that of supplanting competition by a
different and irreconcilable principle. The question was no longer one
of making competition work and of supplementing it but of displacing it
altogether. It is important to be quite clear about this: the modern
movement for planning is a movement against competition as such, a new
flag under which all the old enemies of competition have rallied. And
although all sorts of interests are now trying to reestablish under this
flag privileges which the liberal era swept away, it is socialist
propaganda for planning which has restored to respectability among
liberal-minded people opposition to competition and which has
effectively lulled the healthy suspicion which any attempt to smother
competition used to arouse.4 What in effect unites the socialists of the
Left and the Right is this common hostility to competition and their
common desire to replace it by a directed economy. Though the terms
“capitalism” and “socialism” are still generally used to describe the
past and the future forms of society, they conceal rather than elucidate
the nature of the transition through which we are passing.</p>
<p>Yet, though all the changes we are observing tend in the direction of
a comprehensive central direction of economic activity, the universal
struggle against competition promises to produce in the first instance
something in many respects even worse, a state of affairs which can
satisfy neither planners nor liberals: a sort of syndicalist or
“corporative” organization of industry, in which competition is more or
less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent
monopolies of the separate industries. This is the inevitable first
result of a situation in which the people are united in their hostility
to competition but agree on little else. By destroying competition in
industry after industry, this policy puts the consumer at the mercy of
the joint monopolist action of capitalists and workers in the best
organized industries. Yet, although this is a state of affairs which in
wide fields has already existed for some time, and although much of the
muddled (and most of the interested) agitation for planning aims at it,
it is not a state which is likely to persist or can be rationally
justified. Such independent planning by industrial monopolies would, in
fact, produce effects opposite to those at which the argument for
planning aims. Once this stage is reached, the only alternative to a
return to competition is the control of the monopolies by the state—a
control which, if it is to be made effective, must become progressively
more complete and more detailed. It is this stage we are rapidly
approaching. When, shortly before the war, a weekly magazine pointed out
that there were many signs that British leaders, at least, were growing
accustomed to thinking in terms of national development by controlled
monopolies, this was probably a true estimate of the position as it then
existed.5 Since then this process has been greatly accelerated by the
war, and its grave defects and dangers will become increasingly obvious
as time goes on.</p>
<p>The idea of complete centralization of the direction of economic
activity still appalls most people, not only because of the stupendous
difficulty of the task, but even more because of the horror inspired by
the idea of everything being directed from a single center. If we are,
nevertheless, rapidly moving toward such a state, this is largely
because most people still believe that it must be possible to find some
middle way between “atomistic” competition and central direction.
Nothing, indeed, seems at first more plausible, or is more likely to
appeal to reasonable people, than the idea that our goal must be neither
the extreme decentralization of free competition nor the complete
centralization of a single plan but some judicious mixture of the two
methods. Yet mere common sense proves a treacherous guide in this field.
Although competition can bear some admixture of regulation, it cannot be
combined with planning to any extent we like without ceasing to operate
as an effective guide to production. Nor is “planning” a medicine which,
taken in small doses, can produce the effects for which one might hope
from its thoroughgoing application. Both competition and central
direction become poor and inefficient tools if they are incomplete; they
are alternative principles used to solve the same problem, and a mixture
of the two means that neither will really work and that the result will
be worse than if either system had been consistently relied upon. Or, to
express it differently, planning and competition can be combined only by
planning for competition but not by planning against competition.</p>
<p>It is of the utmost importance to the argument of this book for the
reader to keep in mind that the planning against which all our criticism
is directed is solely the planning against competition—the planning
which is to be substituted for competition. This is the more important,
as we cannot, within the scope of this book, enter into a discussion of
the very necessary planning which is required to make competition as
effective and beneficial as possible. But as in current usage “planning”
has become almost synonymous with the former kind of planning, it will
sometimes be inevitable for the sake of brevity to refer to it simply as
planning, even though this means leaving to our opponents a very good
word meriting a better fate.</p>

<p>4 Of late, it is true, some academic socialists, under the spur of
criticism and animated by the same fear of the extinction of freedom in
a centrally planned society, have devised a new kind of “competitive
socialism” which they hope will avoid the difficulties and dangers of
central planning and combine the abolition of private property with the
full retention of individual freedom. Although some discussion of this
new kind of socialism has taken place in learned journals, it is hardly
likely to recommend itself to practical politicians. If it ever did, it
would not be difficult to show (as the author has attempted
elsewhere—see Economica 1940) that these plans rest on a delusion and
suffer from an inherent contradiction. It is impossible to assume
control over all the productive resources without also deciding for whom
and by whom they are to be used. Although under this so-called
“competitive socialism” the planning by the central authority would take
somewhat more roundabout forms, its effects would not be fundamentally
different, and the element of competition would be little more than a
sham. [Hayek refers to his paper “Socialist Calculation: The Competitive
‘Solution,’” op. cit. In the paper, Hayek reviews and criticizes
proposals found in H. D. Dickinson, Economics of Socialism (London:
