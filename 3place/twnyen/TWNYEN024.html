<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>The Road to Serfdom is F. A. Hayek’s most well-known book, but its
origins were decidedly inauspicious. It began as a memo to the director
of the London School of Economics, Sir William Beveridge, written by
Hayek in the early 1930s and disputing the then-popular claim that
fascism represented the dying gasp of a failed capitalist system. The
memo grew into a magazine article, and parts of it were supposed to be
incorporated into a much larger book, but during World War II he decided
to bring it out separately. Though Hayek had no problem getting
Routledge to publish the book in England, three American publishing
houses rejected the manuscript before the University of Chicago Press
finally accepted it.</p>
<p>The book was written for a British audience, so the director of the
Press, Joseph Brandt, did not expect it to be a big seller in the
States. Brandt hoped to get the well-known New York Herald Tribune
journalist and author Walter Lippmann to write the foreword, noting in
an internal memo that if he did, it might sell between two and three
thousand copies. Otherwise, he estimated, it might sell nine hundred.
Unfortunately, Lippmann was busy with his own work and so turned him
down, as did the 1940 Republican presidential candidate Wendell Wilkie,
whose 1943 book One World had been a best-seller.1 John Chamberlain, the
book review editor for the New York Times, was ultimately recruited for
the job.</p>
<p>One hopes for his sake that Brandt was not the sort who bet money on
his hunches. Since its first publication in 1944, the University of
Chicago Press estimates that more than 350,000 copies of The Road to
Serfdom have been sold. Routledge added many thousands more, but we do
not know how many exactly: that press was unable to come up with any
reliable numbers. There is also no good count on the number of copies
that appeared in translation, not least because a portion were samizdat
copies produced and distributed behind the Iron Curtain during the cold
war.2</p>
<p>Not everyone, of course, liked (or likes) the book. The
intelligentsia, particularly in the United States, greeted its
publication with condescension and, occasionally, vitriol. Then a
diplomat in the British Embassy in Washington, Isaiah Berlin wrote to a
friend in April 1945 that he was “still reading the awful Dr. Hayek.”3
The economist Gardiner Means did not have Berlin’s fortitude; after
reading 50 pages he reported to William Benton of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica that he “couldn’t stomach any more.”4 The philosopher Rudolf
Carnap, writing to Hayek’s friend Karl Popper, apparently could not
muster even the stamina of Means: “I was somewhat surprised to see your
acknowledgement of von Hayek. I have not read his book myself; it is
much read and discussed in this country, but praised mostly by the
protagonists of free enterprise and unrestricted capitalism, while all
leftists regard him as a reactionary.”5</p>
<p>Those who, like Carnap, have not read Hayek but think that they
already know what he is all about should be prepared for some surprises.
Those on the left might preview their reading with a peek at chapter 3,
where Hayek expounds on some of the government intervention that he was
prepared to accept, at least in 1944.6 Those on the right might want to
have a look at his distinction between a liberal and a conservative in
his 1956 foreword to the American paperback edition. Both will be
surprised by what they find.</p>
<p>In this introduction I trace the origins of Hayek’s little book,
summoning up the context in which it was produced and showing how it
gradually came to its final form. The reactions, both positive and
negative, that ultimately turned it into a cultural icon will then be
documented. Because it is a controversial work, I will comment upon some
of the most persistent criticisms that have been levied against it. Not
all of these, I argue, are warranted: Hayek’s book may have been widely,
but it was not always carefully, read. In my conclusion I will reflect
briefly on its lasting messages.7</p>
<p>Prelude: The British, Naziism, and Socialism</p>
<p>Friedrich A. Hayek, a young economist from Vienna, came to the London
School of Economics (LSE) in early 1931 to deliver four lectures on
monetary theory, later published as the book Prices and Production.8 The
topic was timely—Britain’s economy, stagnant through the 1920s, had only
gotten worse with the onset of the depression—and the presentation was
erudite, if at times hard to follow, owing to Hayek’s accent. On the
basis of the lectures Hayek was offered a visiting professorship that
began in the Michaelmas (fall) 1931 term, and a year later he was
appointed to the Tooke Chair of Economic Science and Statistics. He
would remain at the LSE until after the war.</p>
<p>The summer before Hayek arrived to teach was a traumatic one in
Britain and across Europe. In addition to the deepening economic
depression, financial crises on the continent led to a gold drain in
Britain, and ultimately to the collapse of the Labour government, the
abandoning of the gold standard, and, in autumn, the imposition of
protectionist tariffs. Hayek’s entrance onto the London stage was itself
accompanied by no little controversy. In August 1931 he caused a stir
with the publication of the first half of a review of John Maynard
Keynes’s new book, A Treatise on Money, which drew a heated reply from
Keynes a few months later. His battle with Keynes and, later, with
Keynes’s compatriot Piero Sraffa, would occupy no small amount of
Hayek’s attention during the 1931–32 academic year.9</p>
<p>By the following year, however, Hayek had secured his chair, and for
his inaugural lecture, delivered on March 1, 1933, he turned to a new
subject.10 He began with the following question: Why were economists,
whose advice was often so useful, increasingly regarded by the general
public as out of step with the times during the perilous years that had
followed the last war? To answer it Hayek drew upon intellectual
history. He claimed that public opinion was unduly influenced by an
earlier generation of economists who, by criticizing a theoretical
approach to the social sciences, had undermined the credibility of
economic reasoning in general. Once that had been accomplished, people
felt free to propose all manner of utopian solutions to the problem of
the depression, solutions that any serious study of economics would show
were infeasible. Toward the end of his talk Hayek cited the new
enthusiasm for socialist planning in Britain as an example of such
misguided ideas. The economists who had paved the way for these errors
were members of the German Historical School, advisors to Bismarck in
the last decades of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Hayek’s choice of the German Historical School economists was
significant on a number of levels. First, the German Historical School
had before the war been the chief rival of the Austrian School of
Economics, of which Hayek was a member.11 Next, though the German
Historical School economists were conservative imperialists,
cheerleaders for a strong German Reich and opponents of German social
democracy, they also were the architects of numerous social welfare
reforms. Bismarck embraced these reforms while at the same time
repressing the socialists; indeed, the reforms were designed at least in
part to undermine the socialist position and thereby strengthen the
Empire. Hayek probably hoped that his audience would see certain
parallels to the present day. Only a month before Adolf Hitler, who
detested democracy and favored instead the reconstitution of another
(third) Reich, had become Chancellor of the Weimar Republic. Within days
he had convinced President Hindenburg to sign a decree prohibiting
meetings and publications that could endanger public security, a measure
aimed squarely at the communists and socialists. The morning before
Hayek’s address the world had learned that the Reichstag building had
been set on fire and burned; the Nazis were quick to blame the act on
the communists and used it to justify further acts of repression. A half
century before, Bismarck had used an attempt on the Emperor’s life to
put his own anti-socialist laws in place.</p>
<p>After Hayek’s speech the situation in Germany continued to
deteriorate. In March there were wholesale arrests of communists and
harassment of the social democratic leadership. Opposition newspapers
were closed, constitutional protections swept away, and a notorious
“enabling law” passed that gave Hitler virtually dictatorial powers. On
April 1 a nationwide boycott against German Jews was called, and later
in the month action against the trade unions began. In May students on
university campuses across Germany held book-burning celebrations,
cleansing their libraries of suspect volumes. One such event was staged
in the Berlin Opernplatz on May 10, 1933, and the martial songs and
speeches of the participants were broadcast live across Germany. It was
a horrific spring.</p>
<p>Hayek’s criticisms of socialism in his address were not well
received. He would later recall that, following the talk, “one of the
more intelligent students had the cheek to come to see me for the sole
purpose of telling me that, though hitherto admired by the students, I
had wholly destroyed my reputation by taking, in this lecture, a clearly
anti-socialist position.”12 But even more disquieting for Hayek was the
interpretation of events in Germany that was emerging among the British
intelligentsia. Certain prominent members of the German industrial class
had initially supported Hitler’s rise, and others had acquiesced in it.
This, together with the Nazi party’s evident persecution of the left,
led many in Britain to see Naziism as either a capitalist-inspired
movement or, alternatively (if one were a Marxist, and believed that
capitalism was doomed to collapse), as a last-ditch attempt by the
bourgeoisie to deny the inexorable triumph of socialism. As Hayek
recalled, his director at the LSE was one of the ones propagating such
an interpretation:</p>
<p>A very special situation arose in England, already in 1939, that
people were seriously believing that National Socialism was a capitalist
reaction against socialism. It’s difficult to believe now, but the main
exponent whom I came across was Lord Beveridge. He was actually
convinced that these National Socialists and capitalists were reacting
against socialism. So I wrote a memorandum for Beveridge on this
subject, then turned it into a journal article. . . .13</p>
<p>In his reminiscence Hayek got the date wrong: given his reference in
his memorandum to the Berlin student demonstration, and given that it
carries the date “Spring 1933,” he probably wrote it in May or early
June of that year. The memo, titled “Nazi-Socialism,” is reproduced for
the first time in the appendix of this volume.14 In it, Hayek rebuts the
standard account with the claim that National Socialism is a “genuine
socialist movement.”15 In support of this interpretation he notes its
antagonism to liberalism, its restrictive economic policy, the socialist
background of some of its leaders, and its antirationalism. The success
of the Nazis was not, he asserted, due to a reactionary desire on the
part of the Germans to return to the prewar order, but rather
represented a culmination of antiliberal tendencies that had grown since
Bismarck’s time. In short, socialism and Naziism both grew out of the
antiliberal soil that the German Historical School economists had
tended. He added the chilling warning that many other countries were
following, though at a distance, the same process of development.
Finally, Hayek contended that “the inherent logic of collectivism makes
it impossible to confine it to a limited sphere” and hinted at how
collective action must lead to coercion, but he did not develop this key
idea in any detail.16</p>
<p>As Hayek noted in his reminiscence, he ultimately turned his 1933
memo into a magazine article, published in April 1938, titled “Freedom
and the Economic System.” The following year he came out with an
expanded version in the form of a public policy pamphlet.17 If one
compares the two articles one can trace an accretion of ideas that would
later appear in The Road to Serfdom. In the 1938 version, though he
continued to stress the links between fascism and socialism, Hayek began
to expand on what he saw as the fatal flaw of socialist planning—namely,
that it “presupposes a much more complete agreement on the relative
importance of the different ends than actually exists, and that, in
consequence, in order to be able to plan, the planning authority must
impose upon the people that detailed code of values which is lacking.”18
He followed with a much fuller exposition of why even democratic
planning, if it were to be successfully carried out, eventually requires
the authorities to use a variety of means, from propaganda to coercion,
to implement the plan.</p>
<p>In the 1939 version still more ideas were added. Hayek there drew a
contrast between central planning and the planning of a general system
of rules that occurs under liberalism; he noted how the price system is
a mechanism for coordinating knowledge; and he made several observations
concerning economic policy under a liberal regime.19 All of these ideas
would be incorporated into The Road to Serfdom.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Hayek had developed some of his new arguments in the
course of fighting a battle against socialism during the middle years of
the decade. On the other hand, some of the arguments were not actually
new at all. Another debate on the feasibility of socialism had taken
place immediately following the First World War, and Hayek’s mentor,
Ludwig von Mises, had contributed a key argument. This earlier
controversy had taken place in mostly German-language publications. When
Hayek came to England and encountered similar arguments in favor of
planning being made by his academic colleagues and in the press, he
decided to educate them about the earlier discussion. In 1935 he
published the edited volume, Collectivist Economic Planning: Critical
Studies on the Possibilities of Socialism.20 The book contained
translations of articles by others, including von Mises’s seminal piece
“Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth,” as well as
introductory and concluding essays by Hayek.21 In the former Hayek
reviewed the earlier Continental debates on socialism; in his concluding
essay, titled “The Present State of the Debate,” he identified and
assessed a number of more recent proposals, among them the idea of
reintroducing competition within a socialist state, dubbed
“pseudo-competition” by Hayek, which later came to be called “market
socialism.”22 This drew a response from the socialist camp, the most
prominent being that of the Polish émigré economist Oskar Lange, whose
defense of market socialism in a journal article was later reprinted in
a book, On the Economic Theory of Socialism.23 Hayek would respond in
turn to Lange and to another proponent of socialism, H. D. Dickinson, in
a book review a few years later.24</p>
<p>Hayek’s three essays constitute the written record of his early
economic arguments against socialism. But the battle was also taking
place in the classrooms (and doubtless spilling over into the senior
commons room, as well) at the LSE. Beginning in the 1933–34 summer term
(which ran from late April through June) Hayek began offering a class
entitled “Problems of a Collectivist Economy.” The socialist response
was immediate: the next year students could also enroll in a class
titled “Economic Planning in Theory and Practice,” taught first by Hugh
Dalton and in later years by Evan Durbin.25 According to the LSE
calendar, during the 1936–37 summer term students could hear Hayek from
5 to 6 pm and Durbin from 6 to 7 pm each Thursday night! This may have
proved to be too much: the next year their classes were placed in the
same time slot on successive days, Durbin on Wednesdays and Hayek on
Thursdays.</p>
<p>By the time that World War II was beginning, then, Hayek had
criticized, in a book, a journal, and in the classroom, a variety of
socialist proposals put forth by his fellow economists. The Road to
Serfdom is in many respects a continuation of this work, but it is
important to recognize that it also goes beyond the academic debates. By
the end of the decade there were many other voices calling for the
transformation, sometimes radical, of society. A few held a
corporativist view of the good society that bordered on fascism; others
sought a middle way; still others were avowedly socialist—but one thing
all agreed on, that scientific planning was necessary if Britain was to
survive.</p>
<p>Thus in their two volume work Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?
Fabian socialists Sidney and Beatrice Webb praised the “Cult of Science”
that they had discovered on their visits to the Soviet Union, and held
out the hope that scientific planning on a massive scale was the
appropriate medicine to aid Britain in its recovery from the
depression.26 The sociologist Karl Mannheim, who fled Frankfurt in 1933
and ultimately gained a position on the LSE faculty, warned that only by
adopting a comprehensive system of economic planning could Britain avoid
the fate of central Europe. For Mannheim, planning was inevitable; the
only question was whether it was going to be totalitarian or democratic.
These economists were joined by other highly respected public
intellectuals, from natural scientists to politicians.27</p>
<p>If planning was the word on everyone’s lips, very few were clear
about exactly what it was to entail. The situation was well captured by
Hayek’s friend and LSE colleague Lionel Robbins, who in 1937 wrote:</p>
<p>“Planning” is the grand panacea of our age. But unfortunately its
meaning is highly ambiguous. In popular discussion it stands for almost
any policy which it is wished to present as desirable. . . . When the
average citizen, be he Nazi or Communist or Summer School Liberal, warms
to the statement that “What the world needs is planning,” what he really
feels is that the world needs that which is satisfactory.28</p>
<p>As Robbins’s passage suggests, planners were to be found all along
the political spectrum. Sorting out exactly what planning implied for a
complex society was to be yet another major theme in Hayek’s coming
work.</p>
<p>By 1939, in short, most of the elements for Hayek’s book were
present. But its form was not yet in place. When he was not fighting
against socialist planners, Hayek had spent much of the rest of his time
in the 1930s exhausting himself writing and rewriting a major
theoretical work in economics, ultimately published in 1941 as The Pure
Theory of Capital.29 That project was finally winding down in August
1939. In a letter to his old university friend Fritz Machlup, Hayek
spoke of a new project, one that, through a study of the relationship
between scientific method and social problems, would provide a
systematic investigation of intellectual history and reveal the
fundamental principles of social development of the last one hundred
years (from Saint-Simon to Hitler).30 This was to become Hayek’s Abuse
of Reason project, and from it would emerge The Road to Serfdom.</p>
<p>Hayek’s War Effort</p>
<p>On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and two days later
England and France declared war. Within a week, Hayek had sent a letter
to the director general of the British Ministry of Information offering
his services to aid with any propaganda campaign that might be directed
at the German-speaking countries. He enclosed a memo with various
suggestions about how to proceed. Hayek proposed a campaign with a
historical dimension, one that demonstrated that the principles of
liberty that England and France stood for were the same as those that
had been enunciated by the great German poets and thinkers of the past,
but showing that these had been eclipsed by “the distorted view of
history, on which they have been brought up during the last sixty
years,” that is, since Bismarck’s time.31 Hayek’s efforts had little
effect; in a letter from a staff member dated December 30th his offer to
help was politely but firmly turned down.</p>
<p>Once the war began in earnest the next May most of his colleagues
from the LSE had been called to duty in various government departments.
Though he was naturalized as a British subject in 1938, as an émigré
Hayek was not offered a post, so he spent the war teaching his classes
and writing. Hayek was clearly frustrated that the British government
had no place for him, complaining in a letter to Machlup that he was
“getting really annoyed by the refusal to use a person like myself on
any useful work. . . .”32 By this time, however, Hayek’s intellectual
history was well under way. In his letter to Machlup, Hayek provided an
outline of the book, noting that “(t)he second part would of course be
an elaboration of the central argument of my pamphlet on Freedom and the
Economic System.”33 The first part of the book would be called “Hubris,”
the second, “Nemesis.”</p>
<p>Hayek worked on the Abuse of Reason project for the rest of 1940,
completing a number of historical chapters and beginning some others on
methodology.34 Toward the end of the year, though, he began transforming
the last part of the book into what would become The Road to Serfdom, a
book that he initially envisioned as coming out “as a sixpence Penguin
volume.”35 Why did Hayek decide to abandon his larger historical
endeavor—he never completed the Abuse of Reason project—to focus on a
shorter, more popular, and admittedly “political” tract? We will
probably never have a definitive answer, but certain plausible reasons
stand out. Were the Allies to lose the war, western civilization in
Europe itself would be the cost. But Hayek was also worried about what
would transpire if the Allies won.</p>
<p>Mobilization for war requires a massive reallocation of resources
away from the production of peacetime consumer goods and capital toward
the production of war materials. Factories are commandeered, their
machines retooled for wartime production, and decisions about what to
produce are made at the center. With fewer consumer goods being
produced, the prospect of inflation looms (particularly harmful during
wartime, because it hurts debtors, just when the government is trying to
convince its citizens to become debtors by buying war bonds). To avoid
inflation further intervention is necessary, and the standard policy
response is to fix prices and institute a system of rationing. This
essentially does away with a freely adjusting price system for basic
consumer goods. Bluntly put, during war the market system is more or
less abandoned, as many parts of the economy are placed under central
control. Hayek’s fear was that socialists would want to continue such
controls in peacetime.</p>
<p>There was precedence for such a fear. Even before the First World War
had begun, the philosopher Otto Neurath had been touting the doctrine of
“war economy” in Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk’s economics seminar in Vienna,
much to the chagrin of seminar participant Ludwig von Mises. Neurath
claimed that central planning under wartime conditions provided an
exemplar for how to run an economy in peacetime. His and others’
proposals for the socialization of the postwar economy provoked Mises to
formulate his initial critique of socialist planning. Interestingly,
Neurath was still on the scene when Hayek was writing: when hostilities
started in earnest Neurath had fled Holland and would spend the war in
Oxford.36</p>
<p>The British were not Continental socialists, but still, the danger
signs were there. Clearly, the nearly universal sentiment among the
intelligentsia in the 1930s that a planned system represented “the
middle way” between a failed capitalism and totalitarianisms of the left
and right was worrisome. The writings of what Hayek called the “men (and
women!) of science” could not be ignored. Look at this message from the
weekly magazine Nature, taken from an editorial that carried the title
“Science and the National War Effort”:</p>
<p>The contribution of science to the war effort should be a major one,
for which the Scientific Advisory Committee may well be largely
responsible. Moreover, the work must not cease with the end of the war.
It does not follow that an organization which is satisfactory under the
stress of modern warfare will serve equally well in time of peace; but
the principle of the immediate concern of science in formulating policy
and in other ways exerting a direct and sufficient influence on the
course of government is one to which we must hold fast. Science must
seize the opportunity to show that it can lead mankind onward to a
better form of society.37</p>
<p>The very next week readers of Nature would find similar sentiments
echoed in Barbara Wootton’s review of a book on Marxism: “The whole
approach to social and political questions is still pre-scientific.
Until we have renounced tribal magic in favour of the detached and
relentless accuracy characteristic of science the unconquered social
environment will continue to make useless and dangerous our astonishing
conquest of the material environment.”38 Progressive opinion was united
behind the idea that science was to be enlisted to reconstruct society
along more rational lines.</p>
<p>There were also more overtly political forces to be reckoned with,
forces whose hopes for the postwar world became increasingly clear as
the conflict began to turn in favor of the allies. In early 1942 the
Labour Party issued a pamphlet, The Old World and the New Society, that
laid out the principles for reconstruction after the war. Here are some
of its key claims:</p>
<p>There must be no return to the unplanned competitive world of the
inter-War years, in which a privileged few were maintained at the
expense of the common good . . .</p>
<p>A planned society must replace the old competitive system . . .</p>
<p>The basis for our democracy must be planned production for community
use . . .</p>
<p>As a necessary prerequisite to the reorganization of society, the
main Wartime controls in industry and agriculture should be maintained
to avoid the scramble for profits which followed the last war.39</p>
<p>These ideas were incorporated into a resolution proposed by Harold
Laski and passed at the Party Conference on May 26, 1942. In his speech
defending the resolution, Laski noted that “Nationalization of the
essential instruments of production before the war ends, the maintenance
of control over production and distribution after the war—this is the
spearhead of this resolution.”40</p>
<p>Party boilerplate is one thing, concrete plans as how to carry it out
are quite another. A start at the latter was made in the famous
Beveridge Report.41</p>
<p>The story of how Hayek’s former director at the LSE came to chair the
Interdepartmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services is
not without interest. The committee was originally set up in early 1941
to respond to trade union complaints about the mishmash of government
programs then in existence to provide for unemployment benefits, sick
pay, pensions, and the like. The Treasury, busy trying to finance the
war, did not want a comprehensive review, fearing it would only lead to
recommendations for further expenditures. They pushed for the
appointment of a “safe” chairman who would do a patch-up job, and made
sure that the committee was staffed principally with equally safe
middle-level civil servants. But then the Minister of Labour Ernest
Bevin intervened, and ultimately prevailed in having Beveridge appointed
to chair the committee, his motivation being, according to one account,
to get “the pushy Beveridge at last out of his Ministry”!42</p>
<p>By December 1941 Beveridge had received only one of the 127 pieces of
evidence that his committee would ultimately collect, but this did not
deter him from circulating a paper that contained most of the main
points that would be contained in the final report. Beveridge turned out
to be anything but safe. His proposals provided the foundations for the
postwar British welfare state, including the provision of family
allowances, comprehensive social insurance, universal health care
coverage, and a government obligation to maintain full employment.</p>
<p>Though the Treasury was horrified at the projected cost of the plan,
over the course of 1942 Beveridge, through public appearances, radio
talks, and the like, managed to leak to the press the broad outlines of
the report, thereby building up popular support and undermining the
ability of the government to either ignore or dismiss it. He was
successful as impresario: when the 299-page government document was
finally released on December 2, 1942, the line for it at the government
bookshop was said to have been over a mile long.43 It ultimately sold
about a half a million copies, influencing policy not just in Britain,
but worldwide. (In America, an edition that was “reproduced
photographically from the English edition” to ensure a speedy delivery
was quickly made available and sold about fifty thousand copies.)44</p>
<p>The Beveridge Report was an immediate success. The British economy
had been stagnant throughout the interwar period, and no one wanted a
return to such deprivation. The common sacrifices that the war
necessitated bred a feeling that all should similarly share more equally
in the reconstruction to come. Universal medical provision was itself
virtually a fact of life during the first few years of the war,
certainly for anyone injured by aerial bombing or whose work was tied to
the war effort—and whose work was not, in one way or another? The war,
then, was transforming the climate, and Beveridge’s hope—and he was not
alone—was to build on this transformation in the future.45 Indeed, the
first of the “Three Guiding Principles of Recommendations” with which he
began his report made the link explicit: “Now, when the war is
abolishing landmarks of every kind, is the opportunity for using
experience in a clear field. A revolutionary moment in the world’s
history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.”46</p>
<p>Having come to his majority in interwar Vienna, Hayek doubtless
experienced an intense and disquieting sense of déjà vu on reading such
words. In his book he sought to reverse the trends that were everywhere
evident in Britain. Making the economic case against socialist planning
was not enough. He needed to remind the British of their liberal
democratic heritage, to contrast it with the collectivist or
corporativist authoritarian modes of social organization promoted by its
enemies, and finally, to make clear (notwithstanding the rhetoric of
“planning for freedom”) that the actual implementation of a centrally
planned society would be inimical to liberty.</p>
<p>Finding an American Publisher</p>
<p>In a letter dated August 8, 1942, Hayek asked Fritz Machlup, who was
by then in Washington at the Office of Alien Property Custodian, for his
help in securing an American publisher. Machlup’s wartime letters to
Hayek may have helped him to realize that his message might be needed as
an antidote in the States as well as in Britain: “If you talk here with
people over 40 years of age— except Hansen—they sound sane and
relatively conservative. It is the generation brought up by Keynes and
Hansen, which is blind to the political implications of their economic
views.”47 By summer’s end Hayek sent Machlup a typescript that included
all but the final three substantive chapters, two of which would deal
with his recommendations for the postwar period. He would mail these to
his friend over the course of the next year.48</p>
<p>Machlup’s first stop was Macmillan, but they turned him down.49
Machlup later reported to Hayek what they said in their letter:
“Frankly, we are doubtful of the sale which we could secure for it, and
I personally cannot but feel that Professor Hayek is a little outside
the stream of much present-day thought, both here and in England.”50
Machlup’s next move was, at Hayek’s request, to send the (by now
completed) typescript to Walter Lippmann, who would promote it to
Little, Brown. This was done, but they also declined, on the grounds
that “the exposition was too difficult for the general reader.”51
Machlup then turned to Henry Gideonse, by now the President of Brooklyn
College, but who previously had served as the editor of the series of
public policy pamphlets in which “Freedom and the Economic System” had
appeared. Gideonse took the manuscript with his strong endorsement to
Ordway Tead, the economics editor at Harper and Brothers. This
initiative also failed. In a sentence that in some ways exemplifies his
own complaint, Tead explained why Harper would not publish it: “I do
feel that the volume is labored, is over-written and that he can say all
that he has to say in about half the space.”52</p>
<p>Nearly a year had gone by and Machlup’s search for an American
publisher had yielded nothing. It was at this point that Aaron Director
came to the rescue.53 Director worked alongside Machlup in Washington,
and had read the typescript in the summer of 1943. In October, Director
wrote to fellow Chicago economists Frank Knight and Henry Simons to see
if the University of Chicago Press might want to consider publishing it.
Though he never received an answer, apparently Knight did recommend that
the Press have a look. Toward the end of the next month Director sent
the galley proofs from the English edition (which had arrived in the
interim) to Chicago, asking for an immediate decision.54</p>
<p>The Press complied, asking Knight to evaluate the manuscript. In his
reader’s report, dated December 10, 1943, the irascible Chicago
professor provided a decidedly lukewarm endorsement. He began the report
by calling the book “a masterly performance of the job it undertakes”
and admitted that he was sympathetic to its main conclusions. But he
followed this with a two-page discussion of the book’s weaknesses,
concluding that, “’(i)n sum, the book is an able piece of work, but
limited in scope and somewhat one-sided in treatment. I doubt whether it
would have a very wide market in this country, or would change the
position of many readers.”55</p>
<p>Knight’s distinctly ambivalent report could easily have resulted in
the Press rejecting the manuscript. Instead, Acting Editor John T.
McNeill took it to mean that it was worthy of further consideration. On
December 14 he asked another Chicago economist, Jacob Marschak, to
provide a second reader’s report. Marschak, a socialist, was far more
complimentary, writing six days later that “Hayek’s book may start in
this country a more scholarly kind of debate. . . . It is written with
the passion and the burning clarity of a great doctrinaire. . . . This
book cannot be bypassed.”56 Based on the two reports, the publication
committee at the Press decided to undertake an American edition. The
acceptance letter to Hayek was dated December 28, 1943.</p>
<p>There were still details to be settled, and Machlup acted in Hayek’s
behalf concerning most of these, even to the point of accepting
Chicago’s offer for Hayek in early January—it was nearly a month later
when Hayek finally got the news.57 One major decision was to completely
reset the type, this because in the British edition Hayek frequently
referred to England as “this country.”58 Two other changes were
suggested by the Press, but both were rejected. The first was to change
the name to Socialism: The Road to Serfdom. Both Machlup and Hayek
thought that the proposed title was misleading, because socialism was
only one of a subset of doctrines the book criticized. Central planning
could be undertaken by parties on the right as well as the left; this
was Hayek’s point when he dedicated the book to socialists of all
parties. The other proposal was to eliminate the aphorisms with which
Hayek began each chapter. Hayek was sufficiently appalled by the latter
suggestion that he followed up his letter of protest with a cable
reading “Cannot consent to omission of quotations from Road to
Serfdom.”59 The quotations were retained, including one from David Hume
on the title page. Inexplicably, a quotation from Tocqueville that
appeared on the title page of the British edition was dropped from the
original American one, and in some of the later reprints the Hume
quotation was moved off of the title page to the following one. Both
have been restored to their rightful place on the title page in the
current edition.60</p>
<p>Publication: From Minor Hit to Cultural Icon</p>
<p>The Road to Serfdom appeared on March 10, 1944, in England. The
initial print run was 2,000 copies, and due to the strong demand (it
sold out in about a month’s time) a second printing of 2,500 was
immediately ordered. That one quickly sold out as well, but nothing
further could be done until a new paper quota was announced in July.
Paper shortages would plague British production of the book for the
duration and beyond.61 July also saw the publication of an Australian
edition.62</p>
<p>The American edition, with a run of 2,000 copies, came out on
September 18, 1944, a Monday, though advance copies had been sent to
reviewers earlier. Henry Hazlitt’s laudatory front page review appeared
in the next Sunday’s New York Times Book Review section, and another
graced the pages of the Herald Tribune. By September 28 a second and
third printing had been ordered, bringing the total to 17,000 copies.63
The Press had a minor hit on its hands.</p>
<p>At the end of October a letter arrived at the Press that would help
turn it into a major hit and a cultural icon. On the recommendation of
Henry Gideonse, the Press had sent a copy of the book to Max Eastman,
then a “roving editor” for The Reader’s Digest. Eastman liked it so much
that he asked the owner and editor-in-chief, DeWitt Wallace, for
permission to do a condensation.64 This appeared in April 1945, and it
carried with it an offer of reprints, available through the
Book-of-the-Month Club, for a nickel apiece. (Bulk orders were also
possible: if one wanted 1,000 copies, it cost 8.) The Reader’s Digest
had at the time a circulation of about 8,750,000, and over a million of
the reprints were eventually printed and distributed.65</p>
<p>Hayek arrived in the States in the beginning of April 1945 for a
five-week lecture tour to promote his book. He crossed the Atlantic by
boat, and while he was in transit the Reader’s Digest issue appeared.
Though the tour was initially envisioned to consist of academic lectures
before various university departments of economics, by the time he
arrived the tour had been turned over to a professional organization
(the National Concerts and Artists Corporation) that had added a number
of public appearances. The first event, a lecture sponsored by the Town
Hall Club in New York, drew an overflow crowd of more than 3,000
listeners and was broadcast over the radio. Hayek was initially
overwhelmed by the idea of speaking to such large, popular audiences,
but, as he later recounted, he eventually warmed to the task.66</p>
<p>But it is also clear (and quite understandable, given his
personality) that Hayek was a bit embarrassed by all the adulation,
especially from those who might have gotten their only knowledge of his
views from a 20-page condensation (or worse, from the cartoon edition
that had appeared in the February 1945 issue of Look magazine).67 He
seemed particularly worried about being misinterpreted. Thus in a
Chicago newspaper under a banner that read in part “Friedrich Hayek
Comments on Uses to Which His Book Has Been Put” he stated, “I was at
first a bit puzzled and even alarmed when I found that a book written in
no party spirit and not meant to support any popular philosophy should
have been so exclusively welcomed by one party and so thoroughly
excoriated by the other.”68 He repeatedly emphasized in his talks before
business groups that he was not against government intervention per se:
“I think what is needed is a clear set of principles which enables us to
distinguish between the legitimate fields of government activities and
the illegitimate fields of government activity. You must cease to argue
for and against government activity as such.”69</p>
<p>He also feared that certain parts of his message would be ignored.
For example, businessmen who might be quite eager to get “government off
of our backs” might be equally eager to demand that the government
protect their industries from foreign competition. Responding to a
question about tariffs in a discussion following his speech in
Washington, DC, Hayek bluntly asserted: “If you have any comprehension
of my philosophy at all, you must know that one thing I stand for above
all else is free trade throughout the world.” The man offering the
anecdote added that, with that, “the temperature of the room went down
at least 10 degrees.”70</p>
<p>The trip to the United States gave Hayek his “15 minutes of fame,”
but it was also important for more substantive reasons. On the trip he
first encountered Mr. Harold Luhnow, a Kansas City businessman who was
interested in funding a study of how to foster an effective competitive
order in the United States. After subsequent negotiations it was agreed
that the study would be undertaken at the University of Chicago, and
though it was never completed, the project helped to bring together in
one place the various principals who would help create the “Chicago
School of Economics”—Aaron Director, Milton Friedman, and, later, George
Stigler. These men would all attend, in 1947, the first meeting of the
Mont Pèlerin Society, an international society of scholars founded by
Hayek whose goal was “to contribute to the preservation and improvement
of the free society.”71 A few years later Hayek would himself emigrate
from London to the University of Chicago, though there he would join the
Committee on Social Thought rather than the Economics Department.72</p>
<p>If Hayek was surprised by the enthusiastic reception of the book in
some quarters, he was likely equally surprised at how it was savaged in
others. Hayek had expected criticism, of course, and as an academic was
looking forward to it, for it would mean that people were engaging his
arguments.73 He doubtless had in mind the sort of response he received
from the English socialist Barbara Wootton, whose “courteous and frank”
work Hayek mentioned in his 1956 foreword to the American paperback
edition.74 And indeed, with the exception of some Labour Party
politicians, Hayek’s challengers in Britain by and large took his views
seriously, and responded to them accordingly.75</p>
<p>The situation was different in the United States. The worst of the
lot, Herman Finer’s scabrous Road to Reaction, was also picked out for
mentioning by Hayek in the 1956 foreword. The overarching message of the
book was evident in its very first sentence: “Friedrich A. Hayek’s The
Road to Serfdom constitutes the most sinister offensive against
democracy to emerge from a democratic country for many decades.”76
According to Finer, Hayek’s call for constitutionalism and advocacy of
the rule of law was indicative of his antidemocratic biases, the “very
essence” of Hayek’s argument being “the idea that democracy is dangerous
and ought to be limited.”77 Toward the end of the book (published, we
remember, in 1945) we find Finer remarking on “the thoroughly Hitlerian
contempt for the democratic man so perfectly expressed by Hayek.”78
Other pundits of the day took different tacks: George Soule, for
example, was quick to label him “the darling of the Chamber of
Commerce.”79 The left-leaning PM newspaper launched an exposé showing
how business interests promoted the “selling” of Hayek’s message. The
author’s concluding sentences capture well many people’s perception of
the reception of the book in America: “Hayek’s book—and the Look and
Reader’s Digest treatments of it—gave big business a wonderful
opportunity to spread distrust and fear of the New Deal. Big business
seized the opportunity.”80</p>
<p>Perhaps recognizing that nothing sells like controversy, the Press
sent Hayek a copy of Finer’s book when it appeared in December 1945, and
asked whether he might want to add a new chapter to the end of the next
edition of The Road to Serfdom, in which he would reply to his critics.
Hayek worked on such a postscript on and off over the next few years. A
partially completed draft, dated 1948, exists in his archives, and
elements of this would ultimately be incorporated into the 1956
foreword.81 It is notable, and characteristic, that Hayek’s response
there was not to lash out at his critics, but rather to try to explain
the differences in the receptions he received in England and the United
States, again by emphasizing the different experiences that people in
the two countries had had with socialism.82</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that Hayek’s book would have become so widely
known, remembered decades after its original publication, had it not
been for the Reader’s Digest condensation. This allowed Hayek’s message
to reach many more people, and in at least one instance with dramatic
effect: Antony Fisher, the founder of the Institute of Economic Affairs,
and after it a prime mover in the foundation of many other conservative
think tanks, was inspired to wage the war of ideas after having read the
condensation and then speaking with Hayek in his LSE office in the
summer of 1945.83 But the condensation also turned the book into a
symbol for both his admirers and his critics. The sad result is that, as
John Scoon put it, “People still tend to go off half-cocked about it;
why don’t they read it and find out what Hayek actually says!”84 In the
next section some oft-heard criticisms of the book are briefly reviewed
and assessed. We will see that some are less justified than others.</p>
<p>Some Prominent Criticisms</p>
<p>One of the earliest criticisms concerned the historical accuracy of
his claims. A good example is the objection raised by Frank Knight, who
in his reader’s report insisted that German history was far more
complicated than Hayek had portrayed it; that, for example, the
socialist policies in place since Bismarck’s time comprised only one
element in explaining the subsequent trajectory of the country. I doubt
that Hayek would deny this; if he did, he would certainly be on very
shaky ground. Nonetheless, if this part of his thesis seems overstated,
it is only fair to recall the original structure of Hayek’s argument.
The Road to Serfdom was intended to be the final section of a much
larger project, in which Hayek would trace the gradual decline of
liberalism in a number of different countries. Hayek’s specific
arguments about Germany make much more sense within the context of this
larger project. His decision to publish as a separate piece the
conclusion of his work is akin to offering a punch line without the
joke.</p>
<p>We must also remember the sorts of arguments he was trying to
confront with his thesis. As Hayek frequently repeated, many intelligent
and informed people of his day had been taken in by the claim that
National Socialism was the next logical and historical phase of a
collapsing capitalism. His point, one that most would accept today as
evident, was that fascism and communism both represent totalitarian
systems that have much more in common with each other than either does
with the sorts of governments and economic systems that exist under
liberal free market democracies. The Nazis demonized and persecuted the
communists, to be sure, but it was not because they were themselves
capitalists. Hayek simply sought to establish the true
commonalities.</p>
<p>Another oft-voiced complaint was that Hayek’s book was long on
criticism but short on or vague concerning proposed alternatives. After
ten years of economic depression, many people felt that capitalism had
finally breathed its last and that something new had to replace it. What
was Hayek offering? Writing in The New Republic, Alvin Hansen noted that
Hayek distinguished in his book between “good planning” and “bad
planning,” then asked Hayek to inform his readers precisely how he would
draw the line between the two.85 John Maynard Keynes read the book on
the way to the Bretton Woods conference, and delighted Hayek when he
wrote him that it was “a grand book” and that “morally and
philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of
it; and not only in agreement with it, but in a deeply moved
agreement.”86 Keynes went on to say, though, that “You admit here and
there that it is a question of knowing where to draw the line. You agree
that the line has to be drawn somewhere, and that the logical extreme is
not possible. But you give us no guidance whatever as to where to draw
it.”87</p>
<p>Hayek evidently took these criticisms to heart, for in the coming
years he would make two further important contributions to political
philosophy that would refine and extend the arguments made in The Road
to Serfdom. In The Constitution of Liberty he laid out the philosophical
foundations of liberal constitutionalism, wherein a private sphere of
individual activity is defined, the state is granted a monopoly on
coercion, and then is constitutionally limited by the rule of law in its
use of those coercive powers. In the last third of the book Hayek
outlined the specific sorts of government policies that were consistent
with such a political setup.88 In Law, Legislation, and Liberty, Hayek
lamented how western democracies were increasingly circumventing the
spirit of liberal constitutionalism by passing coercive legislation,
typically under the guise of achieving social justice, but in reality
serving well-organized coalitions of special interests. The book also
included a unique proposal for legislative reform aimed at
reestablishing the ideal of a constitutionally constrained liberal
democratic commonwealth.89</p>
<p>A third complaint is that Hayek’s argument against socialism in The
Road to Serfdom is unconvincing because, by failing to address “market
socialism,” it must be viewed as incomplete. Evan Durbin, Hayek’s old
sparring partner at the LSE, was one of the first to enunciate the
argument, chiding Hayek in his review in the Economic Journal for making
“only one reference to the work of those of us who are both practicing
economists and also Socialists, and that in a footnote,” thereby
neglecting “all recent writings on the subject.”90 According to Durbin,
“democratic socialism” need not imply any “rigid programme of
production” but only that “the final responsibility for taking economic
decisions is transferred from the private company or group of
shareholders to the representatives of the community. . . .”91 Durbin’s
“democratic socialism” was a variant of the market socialism (sometimes
also referred to by Hayek as “competitive socialism”) that Oskar Lange
had articulated in On the Economic Theory of Socialism. As was noted
earlier, Hayek had already criticized this doctrine in a review of the
Lange volume published in 1940. It was to this review that Hayek
referred in his long note on market socialism in The Road to
Serfdom.92</p>
<p>Market socialism may sound like an oxymoron, but it is a position
that has seldom failed to intrigue economists seeking “the middle way.”
Market socialists are critics of capitalism, to be sure, but they accept
as a starting premise that perfectly competitive markets have certain
desirable efficiency characteristics. Crucially, however, they deny that
any real world markets resemble those described under perfect
competition. The days of atomistic competition disappeared when cartels
and monopolies began emerging in the late nineteenth century.
Contemporary capitalism, then, lacks the beneficial aspects of
competition, while retaining all of its defects. A planned market
socialist economy would restore true competition with all of its
benefits while simultaneously correcting the myriad social injustices
associated with unfettered capitalism. In Lange’s specific blueprint for
a market socialist society, there exist free markets for both consumer
goods and labor, but (because of public ownership of the means of
production) no market for productive resources. A Central Planning Board
would provide prices, adjusting them up or down (using a
“trial-and-error” method) depending on revealed shortages or
surpluses.</p>
<p>Market socialism is attractive because it seems to combine the best
parts of rival systems: the efficiency of a market-based system and
egalitarian policies aimed at promoting social justice, all combined
within a democratic polity. In his review, Hayek raised a number of
pertinent questions about the details of Lange’s plan, most of which
suggested that though market socialism sounded good, it would not work.
One of his key complaints was that Lange had neglected to say how often
prices would need to be adjusted in his proposed system. This was an
important issue, for even with relatively quick adjustments (something
that Hayek thought would be difficult to sustain) Hayek maintained that
an extensive system of price fixing would still always be playing
catch-up relative to the adjustments that would take place in a market
system, and so would be less efficient. In making his points, Hayek
wrote, famously, that “it is difficult to suppress the suspicion that
this particular proposal has been born out of an excessive preoccupation
with problems of the pure theory of stationary equilibrium.”93 Hayek’s
later and much fuller development of how markets work to coordinate
social and economic activity in a world in which knowledge is
dispersed—a world very different from that described by the theory of
stationary equilibrium—would become one of his central contributions to
economics.</p>
<p>Hayek, then, had already articulated a set of arguments against
market socialism. Why did he relegate them to a note in The Road to
Serfdom? One clue is given by a letter that Lange wrote to Hayek on July
31, 1940, in which he responded to Hayek’s review and tried to clear up
a misunderstanding:</p>
<p>I do not propose price fixing by a real central planning board, as a
practical solution. It was used, in my paper, only as a methodological
device to show how equilibrium prices can be determined by trial and
error even in the absence of a market in the institutional sense of the
word. Practically, I should, of course recommend the determination of
the prices by a thorough market process whenever this is feasible. . .
.94</p>
<p>Hayek might be forgiven if he were to infer from this letter that
Lange had basically accepted his criticisms about the practical
feasibility of market socialism. Though obviously Durbin thought
differently, Hayek felt that market socialism was little more than an
interesting theoretical exercise, the sort of thing that economists like
to play with on the blackboard, but not something to be taken seriously
as practical proposal.</p>
<p>But even more to the point, Hayek did not write The Road to Serfdom
chiefly with theoretical economists like Lange or Durbin in mind. Unlike
such economists, most advocates of “planning” had not even begun to
think through what it meant to have a planned society. For them,
planning itself was, as Robbins had put it, a panacea. It was this vague
but widespread sentiment for which The Road to Serfdom was meant to be
an antidote. Hayek was trying to show his readers that planning,
everyone’s favorite remedy for the ills of the world, might sound good
in theory, but would not work in practice (or, at least, not unless the
western democracies were prepared to accept severe constraints on
personal liberty of the sort on display in the systems against which
they currently were fighting.)</p>
<p>This explains, I think, why Hayek did not bother to lay out the
argument against market socialism in his book. He felt that market
socialism was only a theoretical dream, and that the details of the
argument against it would be out of place in a general book. His
economist readers, he doubtless presumed, were already aware of the
arguments he had made in 1940, arguments he felt had succeeded. If they
weren’t, he reminded them with a note.</p>
<p>As such, one could understand that Hayek felt a bit miffed by
Durbin’s insinuation that he had neglected all the recent work. His
irritation is evident in the unpublished version of his 1948
postscript.</p>
<p>Mr. Durbin . . . is especially pained that I have not taken more
seriously and devoted no more than a note to the interesting schemes of
a competitive socialism which have been put forward in recent years in a
number of learned books and articles. I am quite ready to discuss their
theoretical merits and have in fact done so at some length in an article
quoted in the footnote just referred to. And I shall be very glad to
examine these plans further as soon as there are any signs that they are
taken seriously by, and exercise any practical influence on the politics
of, the socialist parties. But I have yet to find any socialist party
which is willing even to consider using competition as the method for
organizing economic activity, and until this is the case I cannot see
that anyone but the specialist need be bothered with the objections to
those ingenious schemes. But I may perhaps be allowed to add that I
should have more confidence in the genuineness of the desire to
reconcile freedom and socialism by means of a “competitive socialism” if
one of the main advocates of these schemes, Professor Oskar Lange, had
not chosen to become one of the main spokesmen of the Russian point of
view on the Council of the United Nations and if Mr. Durbin were not now
himself a member of the Socialist British Government which is doing most
of the things of which he apparently disapproves.95</p>
<p>Durbin would die in a drowning accident in 1948, which may explain
why this passage was never included in the foreword. Alas, Lange’s
accommodation to the political realities in his native Poland would only
increase through time: he went on to write apologetics for Stalin and,
renouncing his earlier views on market socialism, even went so far as to
forbid their republication in Polish.96</p>
<p>Though Lange and Durbin are gone, the dreams for market socialism
among economic theorists never seem to die, the most recent revival
occurring after the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the last decade of
the last century. Its longevity is easy to explain: for those who seek a
middle way, market socialism is the ideal system. In more recent
discussions, Hayek’s original critique has been substantially bolstered
by additional arguments, some from the economics of information that
identify incentive problems, others from public choice analysis that
identify political obstacles that would confront any such regime.97 But
it is perhaps sufficient to say, as Hayek did in 1948, that until a
real-world example of such an “ingenious scheme” is forthcoming, it is
best considered a theoretical construct of interest only to specialists,
one that has no particular relevance for the world in which we actually
live.</p>
<p>A final criticism has sometimes been called the “inevitability
thesis” or the “slippery slope” argument: Hayek is claimed to have said
that, once a society engages in a little planning, it is doomed to end
up in a totalitarian state. Durbin was among those making this charge,
writing that Hayek believed that “any departure from the practice of
free enterprise, any hope that reason and science may be applied to the
direction of economic activity, any attempt at economic planning, must
lead us remorselessly to serfdom. . . .”98 If Durbin’s statement of the
inevitability thesis seems unusually stark, he was certainly not alone
in thinking that Hayek had said that any expansion of state control over
the economy would necessarily lead to a totalitarian outcome. Those who
so interpreted him spanned the ideological spectrum from Barbara Wootton
to George Stigler.99 Paul Samuelson even expressed the idea
diagrammatically in his principles of economics text, drawing political
freedom on one axis, economic freedom on the other, and a movement down
the curve (slippery slope indeed!) from high to low levels of both being
what Hayek supposedly predicted: “that government modification of
laissez faire must lead inevitably to political serfdom.”100</p>
<p>This interpretation occurred despite Hayek’s frequent protests to the
contrary. Sometimes he objected publicly, as he did in the preface to
the 1976 edition: “It has frequently been alleged that I have contended
that any movement in the direction of socialism is bound to lead to
totalitarianism. Even though this danger exists, this is not what the
book says.”101 In private he could be both more forceful and explicit,
as may be seen in his letter to Paul Samuelson:</p>
<p>I am afraid in glancing through the 11th edition of your Economics I
seem to have discovered the source of the false allegation about my book
The Road to Serfdom which I constantly encounter, most resent and can
only regard as a malicious distortion which has largely succeeded in
discrediting my argument . . . (Y)ou assert that I contend that “each
step away from the market system and towards the social reform of the
welfare state is inevitably a journey that must end in a totalitarian
state” and that “government modification of market laissez faire must
lead inevitably to political serfdom.” . . .</p>
<p>How anyone who has read my book can in good faith say this when ever
since the first edition I say right at the beginning . . . “Nor am I
arguing that these developments are inevitable. If they were, there
would be no point in writing this. They can be prevented if people
realize in time where their efforts may lead. . . .”102</p>
<p>Given the ubiquity of the “inevitability thesis” interpretation among
both his friends and his foes, as well as Hayek’s own insistence that
this was not his argument, it is important to try to figure out exactly
what has given rise to the confusion.</p>
<p>Hayek’s letter to Samuelson allows us to rule out one way of
interpreting the word “inevitability.” Hayek was decidedly not making
the historical claim that, no matter what future moves were made in
Britain and America, there was no turning back, that a socialist future
that would end in totalitarianism was inevitably coming. This kind of
inevitability thesis was, after all, exactly what Hayek was criticizing
in his essay “Scientism and the Study of Society,” when he attacked
historicism, the belief that there were historical laws knowledge of
which allowed one to predict a necessary future.</p>
<p>A more plausible way to read Hayek’s words is to see him as warning
that, unless we change our ways, we are headed down the road to serfdom.
It was certainly part of Hayek’s intent to issue such a warning. He was
in particular afraid that we might embark on such a path without really
realizing it, or, as he put it in his speech before the Economic Club of
Detroit, “the danger is the greater because we may choose the wrong way,
not by deliberation and concerted decision, but because we seem to be
blundering into it.”103 As the title of his fourth chapter makes clear,
some of Hayek’s opponents had made the claim that planning was
“inevitable,” that unless we embraced “planning for freedom” we were
headed toward totalitarianism. Hayek presumably was hoping to stand such
an argument on its head, to show that, rather than the only means of
counteracting totalitarianism, planning itself constituted a significant
step along the way toward the totalitarian state.</p>
<p>Yet another way to read Hayek is to see him as offering a logical
rather than a historical argument. Hayek recognized that “liberal
socialists” value freedom of choice and the honoring of individual
preferences. What he denied was that they could maintain those values
and still carry out their proclaimed program of extensive central
planning. As he succinctly put it, “socialism can be put into practice
only by methods which most socialists disapprove.”104 Even if it were to
begin as a “liberal socialist” experiment (none of the real-world cases
have ever done so, one might add), full-scale planning requires that the
planning authorities take over all production decisions; to be able to
make any decisions at all, they would need to exercise more and more
political control. If one tries to create a truly planned society, one
will not be able to separate out control of the economy from political
control. This was Hayek’s logical argument against planning, one that he
had succinctly articulated in 1939 in “Freedom and the Economic
System.”</p>
<p>In the end agreement that planning is necessary, together with the
inability of the democratic assembly to agree on a particular plan, must
strengthen the demand that the government, or some single individual,
should be given powers to act on their own responsibility. It becomes
more and more the accepted belief that, if one wants to get things done,
the responsible director of affairs must be freed from the fetters of
democratic procedure.105</p>
<p>Now evidently, in the years since he wrote, the countries that Hayek
was most concerned about (the Western European democracies and the
United States), despite the rhetoric of their left-wing politicians, did
not go to anything like complete central planning or full
nationalization of the means of production. For example, though there
was a movement in this direction in Britain directly after the war, it
reached its high point by the late 1940s, and even then only about 20
per cent of British industry was nationalized.</p>
<p>Those who see Hayek as issuing a prediction of an inevitable trend
would view this history as refuting his claim. Those who see him as
providing a warning might consider thanking him for saving them from
disaster. If one confronts Hayek’s logical argument, however, the
subsequent paths of the western European democracies are not really
tests of Hayek’s thesis. To be sure, many of them did develop
substantial welfare states, and Hayek spoke about the separate dangers
of these in his later writings. But the existence of such states, and
whatever successes they may or may not have had, does not undermine
Hayek’s logical argument from The Road to Serfdom: a welfare state is
not socialism.</p>
<p>The proper way to evaluate Hayek’s logical thesis is to ask, How many
actually existing, real-world political systems have fully nationalized
their means of production and preserved both some measure of economic
efficiency and freedom of choice over goods and occupations? Count them
up. Then compare the number with those that nationalized their means of
production and turned to extensive planning and control, and with it the
curtailment of individual liberties. If one agrees that this is the
right test, Hayek’s position is fully vindicated: full socialism can
only be put into practice by using methods of which most socialists
would disapprove.</p>
<p>The Continuing Relevance of The Road to Serfdom</p>
<p>Reading (or perhaps rereading) The Road to Serfdom will be a
pleasurable experience for some, and induce apoplexy in others: it
continues to be a lightning rod, as well as a Rorschach test, revealing
as much about the reader’s prior commitments as it does about Hayek’s
ideas. For younger readers the book may also be a bit of a mystery, for
though it has elements of a general treatise (more on which anon), it
was also very much (as he himself once admitted) a “tract for the
times.”106 Modern readers who are not familiar with the history of the
Third Reich may stumble over names like Julius Streicher or Robert Ley.
And who today still recalls Sir Richard Acland’s “Forward March”
movement, or the Temporary National Economic Committee? As editor, I
have tried to provide brief notes that place these individuals, groups,
and ideas in context, in an effort to make it easier for readers today
to enter the world that Hayek inhabited.</p>
<p>At the same time, the book is also filled with timeless ideas.
Hayek’s immediate objective was to persuade his British audience that
their heritage of liberal democracy under the rule of law should be
viewed as a national treasure rather than an object of scorn, as a
still-vital roadmap for organizing society rather than an embarrassing
relic of times gone by. Though much depends on how one defines one’s
terms, his was a message that invites more than occasional
reexamination.</p>
<p>Another theme, evident perhaps more explicitly in this introduction
than in specific passages in Hayek’s own text, but nonetheless very much
a part of his underlying motivation in writing the book, is Hayek’s
warning concerning the dangers that times of war pose for established
civil societies—for it is during such times when hard-won civil
liberties are most likely to be all-too-easily given up. Even more
troubling, politicians instinctively recognize the seductive power of
war. Times of national emergency permit the invocation of a common cause
and a common purpose. War enables leaders to ask for sacrifices. It
presents an enemy against which all segments of society may unite. This
is true of real war, but because of its ability to unify disparate
groups, savvy politicians from all parties find it effective to invoke
war metaphors in a host of contexts. The war on drugs, the war on
poverty, and the war on terror are but three examples from recent
times.107 What makes these examples even more worrisome than true wars
is that none has a logical endpoint; each may be invoked forever.</p>
<p>Hayek’s message was to be wary of such martial invocations. His
specific fear was that, for a war to be fought effectively, the power
and size of the state must grow. No matter what rhetoric they employ,
politicians and the bureaucracies over which they preside love power,
and power is never easily surrendered once the danger, if there ever was
one, has passed. Though eternal vigilance is sage advice, surely
“wartime” (or when politicians would try to convince us that it is such
a time) is when those who value the preservation of individual liberty
must be most on guard.108</p>
<p>Finally, what one finds in this book, and in all of Hayek’s work, is
a clear recognition of the power of ideas. It was perhaps John Maynard
Keynes who said it best, in the closing chapter of The General
Theory:</p>
<p>the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they
are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than commonly
understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who
believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences,
are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority,
who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some
academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of
vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual
encroachment of ideas.109</p>
<p>Hayek would have offered his immediate assent, adding, perhaps, that
Keynes’s passage carries with it the implication that those who fail to
understand the origins of the ideas do so at their peril. Given the many
years of his life that he spent diligently toiling, the perennial
advocate of causes that most of his contemporaries thought of as lost,
anachronistic, or a return to reaction, perhaps no person better
represents the notion of the power of ideas in the twentieth century
than does F. A. Hayek.</p>

<p>A historiographical note: there is nothing on the “Nazi-Socialism”
manuscript to indicate that it was written for Beveridge. And indeed,
though I have long known of the existence of the manuscript in the Hayek
archives, I assumed it was not the Beveridge memo because it carried a
date of 1933, and, as noted, Hayek seemed to imply that he had given it
to Beveridge in the late 1930s. In the summer of 2004, however, Susan
Howson showed me a copy of the identical memo (though with a newly
inscribed title and missing the date) that she had found in Beveridge’s
papers. This is the basis for the claim that this was indeed the
Beveridge memo.</p>
<p>As such, the 1939 date that Hayek mentions in his reminiscence
appears simply to be an error. The two articles that grew out of the
memo were published in 1938 and 1939, so the memo had to have been
written before 1938. Furthermore, Beveridge left the LSE for Oxford in
1937, so presumably the date was even earlier. My best guess is that, in
his reminiscence, Hayek simply confused the date of the 1939 publication
with the date of the memo. I gratefully acknowledge an anonymous reader
for the University of Chicago Press whose careful scrutiny of the
evidence helped me to reach this conclusion.</p>

work at the Office of Alien Property Custodian. Hayek and Machlup
corresponded frequently, and this allows us to follow Hayek’s activities

off, saying he was busy working on a writing project. This would later
become The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical
Psychology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952). The debate
never took place, as Neurath died in December 1945. The correspondence

<p>45 According to Beveridge’s biographer, “the Social Insurance plan
formed merely an iceberg tip—and in Beveridge’s view perhaps the least
important tip—of the very much more ambitious and far-reaching program
of social reconstruction that he had in his mind at the time . . .
(which) included such possible objectives as the nationalization of land
and housing, national minimum wage legislation, public ownership of up
to 75 per cent of industrial production, a public enterprise board to
direct both public and private investment, and permanent state control
of income, prices, and manpower planning.” See Jose Harris, “Beveridge’s
Social and Political Thought,” in Beveridge and Social Security, op.
cit., p. 29. The changes instituted by the postwar Labour government
would be far less dramatic than what Beveridge privately hoped for, and
the levels of assistance once implemented were less than what he
outlined in his report. But the welfare state was established, and with
it the presumption that the state would be responsible for, and capable
of, maintaining “full employment.”</p>

they would not be able to provide any real marketing for the book. So
Machlup decided to see if he could drum up interest elsewhere.</p>

<p>52 Letter, Ordway Tead to Fritz Machlup, September 25, 1943, Machlup
Papers, box 43, folder 15, Hoover Institution Archives. Tead added that
“Also, it is so completely in the negative vein as to leave the reader
without any clue as to what line to take in thought or policy,” a
complaint others would echo.</p>
<p>53 Aaron Director (1901–2004) did his graduate work in economics at
Chicago, and taught there briefly before leaving for a job at the
Treasury Department in 1933. He also spent some time in the 1930s at the
LSE, where he met Hayek. In 1946 Director joined the Law School faculty
at Chicago, and helped found the law and economics movement during his
tenure there. His sister, Rose, married Milton Friedman.</p>
<p>54 As Press editor John Scoon recounted in a letter dated May 2,
1945, to C. Hartley Grattan, “The idea of the Press’s publishing it in
this country was suggested by a member of the Department of Economics at
the University who had previously known Hayek and his work; almost
simultaneously another friend of the author’s, once at the University
but then in Washington with the government, suggested the book to us and
got us the page proofs.” Scoon’s letter may be found in the University
of Chicago Press collection, box 230, folder 3, University of Chicago
Library. Scoon and Press director Joseph Brandt both joined the Press in
January 1944, so Scoon’s account of the process by which the book came
to Chicago is second hand. Nonetheless, his letter is filled with
interesting information (Milton Friedman also made use of parts of it in
his “Note on Publishing History”), and it is published for the first
time in the appendix.</p>

<p>58 As noted in the editorial foreword, the text of the American
edition serves as the basis for the present edition.</p>
<p>59 In a letter dated June 26, 1944, Hayek explained to editor Scoon
why the quotations were so important: “The whole tone of the chapter is
sometimes determined by the fact that the main idea is summarized in the
quotation at the head, and I sometimes deliberately omit to state a main
conclusion because it is expressed in the quotation. I should it regard
as a major calamity to the book if they have really to be omitted. . .
.” The letter may be found in the University of Chicago Press
collection, box 230, folder 1, University of Chicago Library.</p>
<p>60 An editorial anecdote: the book is filled with quotations of
others, and unfortunately, Hayek often failed to get the quotations
exactly right, even those at the head of his chapters. In a letter dated
February 26, 1944, Hayek asked Machlup to correct one of his quotes,
Acton’s famous line, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.” Unfortunately, even in his correction Hayek got it
wrong, telling Machlup it should read, “Power tends to corrupt, and
absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely”! Machlup dutifully passed
the “correction” on, but presumably the actual quote was sufficiently
famous that the Chicago Press copyeditor caught the error, for the
correct phrasing appeared in the book. The letter is found in the
Machlup Papers, box 43, folder 15, Hoover Institution Archives.</p>
<p>61 As Jeremy Shearmur, “Hayek, The Road to Serfdom, and the British
Conservative Party,” Journal of the History of Economic Thought,
forthcoming, reports, an abridged British edition was published by
Routledge using paper that had been transferred from the allocation
provided to the British Conservative Party. The abridgement was done by
a conservative MP, Commander Archibald James, and in the place of the
title page quotations from Hume and Tocqueville, the abridged edition
carried a quotation from Winston Churchill, the leader of the
Conservative Party!</p>
<p>62 F. A. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom (Sydney: Dymock’s Book Arcade,
Ltd., 1944).</p>
<p>63 For more details on the early history of its publication in
America, see John Scoon’s letter of May 2, 1945 to C. Hartley Grattan,
which is reprinted in the appendix.</p>
<p>64 Hayek mentioned Eastman, who was initially sympathetic to the
Russian Revolution but subsequently recanted, in chapter 2, p. 79. Cf.
the foreword to the 1956 American paperback edition, this volume,
p. 41.</p>
<p>65 Reader’s Digest provided its circulation figures for 1945.
Croswell Bowen, “How Big Business Raised the Battle Cry of ‘Serfdom,’”
PM, Sunday, October 14, 1945, p. 13, estimated the Reader’s Digest
readership at 10 million, and is also the source for the
Book-of-the-Month Club reprint figure. (Newsstand sales may account for
the discrepancy between the circulation and readership figures for the
Reader’s Digest.) In his “Note on Publishing History” Milton Friedman
estimated the reprint figure as 600,000 (rather than “more than one
million”), but this was probably based on John Scoon’s identical
estimate in his letter of May 2, 1945. The number presumably had grown
between May and October when Bowen’s article appeared.</p>
<p>66 Hayek recounts the story of his trip in more detail in Hayek on
Hayek, op. cit., pp. 103–5.</p>
<p>67 Both the Reader’s Digest condensation and the cartoon version from
Look are reprinted in a pamphlet released by the Institute of Economic
Affairs: F. A. Hayek, Reader’s Digest Condensed Version of The Road to
Serfdom, Rediscovered Riches no. 5 (London: IEA Health and Welfare Unit,
1999). The Director of the IEA John Blundell reported to me on February
25, 2005, that in the last year there had been over 40,000 downloads
from their website of a PDF containing the text of the condensed version
of The Road to Serfdom.</p>

<p>72 As Hayek later recounted in Hayek on Hayek, op. cit., p. 103,
“practically all my contacts that led to later visits and finally made
my move to Chicago possible were made during this trip.”</p>
<p>73 In a letter to Machlup dated March 20, 1944, Hayek noted with some
surprise the initial warm reception the book had received in the British
press, then added, “But I hope the attacks will begin soon.” The letter
may be found in the Machlup Papers, box 43, folder 15, Hoover

<p>75 During the 1945 election both Clement Atlee and Hugh Dalton, soon
to be the Labour Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer,
respectively, accused Winston Churchill of getting his ideas from
Friedrich August von (with an emphasis on the “von”) Hayek. In one
speech (later dubbed the “Gestapo” speech), Churchill had predicted that
a Labour victory would lead to a severe restriction on individual
liberties. For more on all this see F. A. Hayek, Hayek on Hayek, op.
cit., pp. 106–7; cf. Jeremy Shearmur, “Hayek, The Road to Serfdom, and
the British Conservative Party,” op. cit.</p>

<p>77 Ibid., p. 36. It is true that Hayek believed that constitutional
limits were essential for protecting individuals against the “tyranny of
the majority.” But he was an opponent of planning, not of democracy. And
indeed, if his arguments are correct, democracy is much more likely to
be preserved under liberal political and economic institutions than
under planning, whatever form it might take.</p>

<p>82 See the foreword to the 1956 American paperback edition, this
volume, pp. 41–42. A perusal of the 1948 “postscript” shows that Hayek’s
initial response was less measured, and apparently even in 1955 the
penultimate draft of the “Foreword” contained some lines about Rexford
Tugwell and Wesley Clair Mitchell that prompted concern from an editor
at the Press. These lines were dropped from the final version. See

fought.</p>

Note that Hayek says “this is not what the book says.” He may have been
implying here that the condensation and cartoon versions of his argument
were at least in part responsible for the widespread misreading of his
message. And indeed, in the condensed version Hayek’s insistence that he
is not describing inevitable tendencies is left out, whereas part of the
following sentence, not emphasized in the original, is set in italics:
“Few recognize that the rise of fascism and naziism (the IEA version
mistakenly replaces naziism with Marxism here) was not a reaction
against the socialist trends of the preceding period but a necessary
outcome of those tendencies.” See F. A. Hayek, Reader’s Digest Condensed
Version of The Road to Serfdom, op. cit., pp. 31–32.</p>
<p>102 Letter, Hayek to Paul Samuelson, December 18, 1980, Hayek Papers,
box 48, folder 5, Hoover Institution Archives. Hayek was wrong to imply
that Samuelson was the source of the misreading, for it was a common
one. The archives also contain Samuelson’s reply, in which he apologized
and promised to try to represent Hayek’s views more accurately in any
future work.</p>

“Impossibility Theorem” in welfare economics.</p>

is being written during George W. Bush’s presidency, one that provides
plentiful additional evidence.</p>
