<p>XPLANNING AND THE RULE OF LAW</p>
<p>Recent studies in the sociology of law once more confirm that the
fundamental principle of formal law by which every case must be judged
according to general rational precepts, which have as few exceptions as
possible and are based on logical subsumptions, obtains only for the
liberal competitive phase of capitalism. —Karl Mannheim1</p>
<p>Nothing distinguishes more clearly conditions in a free country from
those in a country under arbitrary government than the observance in the
former of the great principles known as the Rule of Law. Stripped of all
technicalities, this means that government in all its actions is bound
by rules fixed and announced beforehand—rules which make it possible to
foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive
powers in given circumstances and to plan one’s individual affairs on
the basis of this knowledge.2 Though this ideal can never be perfectly
achieved, since legislators as well as those to whom the administration
of the law is entrusted are fallible men, the essential point, that the
discretion left to the executive organs wielding coercive power should
be reduced as much as possible, is clear enough. While every law
restricts individual freedom to some extent by altering the means which
people may use in the pursuit of their aims, under the Rule of Law the
government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc
action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to
pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of
government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts.</p>
<p>The distinction we have drawn before between the creation of a
permanent framework of laws within which the productive activity is
guided by individual decisions and the direction of economic activity by
a central authority is thus really a particular case of the more general
distinction between the Rule of Law and arbitrary government. Under the
first the government confines itself to fixing rules determining the
conditions under which the available resources may be used, leaving to
the individuals the decision for what ends they are to be used. Under
the second the government directs the use of the means of production to
particular ends. The first type of rules can be made in advance, in the
shape of formal rules which do not aim at the wants and needs of
particular people. They are intended to be merely instrumental in the
pursuit of people’s various individual ends. And they are, or ought to
be, intended for such long periods that it is impossible to know whether
they will assist particular people more than others. They could almost
be described as a kind of instrument of production, helping people to
predict the behavior of those with whom they must collaborate, rather
than as efforts toward the satisfaction of particular needs.</p>
<p>Economic planning of the collectivist kind necessarily involves the
very opposite of this. The planning authority cannot confine itself to
providing opportunities for unknown people to make whatever use of them
they like. It cannot tie itself down in advance to general and formal
rules which prevent arbitrariness. It must provide for the actual needs
of people as they arise and then choose deliberately between them. It
must constantly decide questions which cannot be answered by formal
principles only, and, in making these decisions, it must set up
distinctions of merit between the needs of different people. When the
government has to decide how many pigs are to be raised or how many
busses are to be run, which coal mines are to operate, or at what prices
shoes are to be sold, these decisions cannot be deduced from formal
principles or settled for long periods in advance. They depend
inevitably on the circumstances of the moment, and, in making such
decisions, it will always be necessary to balance one against the other
the interests of various persons and groups. In the end somebody’s views
will have to decide whose interests are more important; and these views
must become part of the law of the land, a new distinction of rank which
the coercive apparatus of government imposes upon the people.</p>
<p>The distinction we have just used between formal law or justice and
substantive rules is very important and at the same time most difficult
to draw precisely in practice. Yet the general principle involved is
simple enough. The difference between the two kinds of rules is the same
as that between laying down a Rule of the Road, as in the Highway Code,
and ordering people where to go; or, better still, between providing
signposts and commanding people which road to take. The formal rules
tell people in advance what action the state will take in certain types
of situation, defined in general terms, without reference to time and
place or particular people. They refer to typical situations into which
anyone may get and in which the existence of such rules will be useful
for a great variety of individual purposes. The knowledge that in such
situations the state will act in a definite way, or require people to
behave in a certain manner, is provided as a means for people to use in
making their own plans. Formal rules are thus merely instrumental in the
sense that they are expected to be useful to yet unknown people, for
purposes for which these people will decide to use for them, and in
circumstances which cannot be foreseen in detail. In fact, that we do
not know their concrete effect, that we do not know what particular ends
these rules will further, or which particular people they will assist,
that they are merely given the form most likely on the whole to benefit
all the people affected by them, is the most important criterion of
formal rules in the sense in which we here use this term. They do not
involve a choice between particular ends or particular people, because
we just cannot know beforehand by whom and in what way they will be
used.</p>
<p>In our age, with its passion for conscious control of everything, it
may appear paradoxical to claim as a virtue that under one system we
shall know less about the particular effect of the measures the state
takes than would be true under most other systems and that a method of
social control should be deemed superior because of our ignorance of its
precise results. Yet this consideration is in fact the rationale of the
great liberal principle of the Rule of Law. And the apparent paradox
dissolves rapidly when we follow the argument a little further.</p>
<p>This argument is twofold; the first is economic and can here only
briefly be stated. The state should confine itself to establishing rules
applying to general types of situations and should allow the individuals
freedom in everything which depends on the circumstances of time and
place, because only the individuals concerned in each instance can fully
know these circumstances and adapt their actions to them. If the
individuals are to be able to use their knowledge effectively in making
plans, they must be able to predict actions of the state which may
affect these plans. But if the actions of the state are to be
predictable, they must be determined by rules fixed independently of the
concrete circumstances which can be neither foreseen nor taken into
account beforehand: and the particular effects of such actions will be
unpredictable. If, on the other hand, the state were to direct the
individual’s actions so as to achieve particular ends, its action would
have to be decided on the basis of the full circumstances of the moment
and would therefore be unpredictable. Hence the familiar fact that the
more the state “plans,” the more difficult planning becomes for the
individual.</p>
<p>The second, moral or political, argument is even more directly
relevant to the point under discussion. If the state is precisely to
foresee the incidence of its actions, it means that it can leave those
affected no choice. Wherever the state can exactly foresee the effects
on particular people of alternative courses of action, it is also the
state which chooses between the different ends. If we want to create new
opportunities open to all, to offer chances of which people can make
what use they like, the precise results cannot be foreseen. General
rules, genuine laws as distinguished from specific orders, must
therefore be intended to operate in circumstances which cannot be
foreseen in detail, and, therefore, their effect on particular ends or
particular people cannot be known beforehand. It is in this sense alone
that it is at all possible for the legislator to be impartial. To be
impartial means to have no answer to certain questions—to the kind of
questions which, if we have to decide them, we decide by tossing a coin.
In a world where everything was precisely foreseen, the state could
hardly do anything and remain impartial.</p>
<p>Where the precise effects of government policy on particular people
are known, where the government aims directly at such particular
effects, it cannot help knowing these effects, and therefore it cannot
be impartial. It must, of necessity, take sides, impose its valuations
upon people and, instead of assisting them in the advancement of their
own ends, choose the ends for them. As soon as the particular effects
are foreseen at the time a law is made, it ceases to be a mere
instrument to be used by the people and becomes instead an instrument
used by the lawgiver upon the people and for his ends. The state ceases
to be a piece of utilitarian machinery intended to help individuals in
the fullest development of their individual personality and becomes a
“moral” institution— where “moral” is not used in contrast to immoral
but describes an institution which imposes on its members its views on
all moral questions, whether these views be moral or highly immoral. In
this sense the Nazi or any other collectivist state is “moral,” while
the liberal state is not.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be said that all this raises no serious problem
because in the kind of questions which the economic planner would have
to decide he need not and should not be guided by his individual
prejudices but could rely on the general conviction of what is fair and
reasonable. This contention usually receives support from those who have
experience of planning in a particular industry and who find that there
is no insuperable difficulty about arriving at a decision which all
those immediately interested will accept as fair. The reason why this
experience proves nothing is, of course, the selection of the
“interests” concerned when planning is confined to a particular
industry. Those most immediately interested in a particular issue are
not necessarily the best judges of the interests of society as a whole.
To take only the most characteristic case: when capital and labor in an
industry agree on some policy of restriction and thus exploit the
consumers, there is usually no difficulty about the division of the
spoils in proportion to former earnings or on some similar principle.
The loss which is divided between thousands or millions is usually
either simply disregarded or quite inadequately considered. If we want
to test the usefulness of the principle of “fairness” in deciding the
kind of issues which arise in economic planning, we must apply it to
some question where the gains and the losses are seen equally clearly.
In such instances it is readily recognized that no general principle
such as fairness can provide an answer. When we have to choose between
higher wages for nurses or doctors and more extensive services for the
sick, more milk for children and better wages for agricultural workers,
or between employment for the unemployed or better wages for those
already employed, nothing short of a complete system of values in which
every want of every person or group has a definite place is necessary to
provide an answer.</p>
<p>In fact, as planning becomes more and more extensive, it becomes
regularly necessary to qualify legal provisions increasingly by
reference to what is “fair” or “reasonable”; this means that it becomes
necessary to leave the decision of the concrete case more and more to
the discretion of the judge or authority in question. One could write a
history of the decline of the Rule of Law, the disappearance of the
Rechtsstaat, in terms of the progressive introduction of these vague
formulas into legislation and jurisdiction, and of the increasing
arbitrariness and uncertainty of, and the consequent disrespect for, the
law and the judicature, which in these circumstances could not but
become an instrument of policy.3 It is important to point out once more
in this connection that this process of the decline of the Rule of Law
had been going on steadily in Germany for some time before Hitler came
into power and that a policy well advanced toward totalitarian planning
had already done a great deal of the work which Hitler completed.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that planning necessarily involves deliberate
discrimination between particular needs of different people, and
allowing one man to do what another must be prevented from doing. It
must lay down by a legal rule how well off particular people shall be
and what different people are to be allowed to have and do. It means in
effect a return to the rule of status, a reversal of the “movement of
progressive societies” which, in the famous phrase of Sir Henry Maine,
“has hitherto been a movement from status to contract.”4 Indeed, the
Rule of Law, more than the rule of contract, should probably be regarded
as the true opposite of the rule of status. It is the Rule of Law, in
the sense of the rule of formal law, the absence of legal privileges of
particular people designated by authority, which safeguards that
equality before the law which is the opposite of arbitrary
government.</p>
<p>A necessary, and only apparently paradoxical, result of this is that
formal equality before the law is in conflict, and in fact incompatible,
with any activity of the government deliberately aiming at material or
substantive equality of different people, and that any policy aiming
directly at a substantive ideal of distributive justice must lead to the
destruction of the Rule of Law. To produce the same result for different
people, it is necessary to treat them differently. To give different
people the same objective opportunities is not to give them the same
subjective chance. It cannot be denied that the Rule of Law produces
economic inequality—all that can be claimed for it is that this
inequality is not designed to affect particular people in a particular
way. It is very significant and characteristic that socialists (and
Nazis) have always protested against “merely” formal justice, that they
have always objected to a law which had no views on how well off
particular people ought to be,5 and that they have always demanded a
“socialization of the law,” attacked the independence of judges, and at
the same time given their support to all such movements as the
Freirechtsschule which undermined the Rule of Law.</p>
<p>It may even be said that for the Rule of Law to be effective it is
more important that there should be a rule applied always without
exceptions than what this rule is. Often the content of the rule is
indeed of minor importance, provided the same rule is universally
enforced. To revert to a former example: it does not matter whether we
all drive on the left- or on the right-hand side of the road so long as
we all do the same. The important thing is that the rule enables us to
predict other people’s behavior correctly, and this requires that it
should apply to all cases—even if in a particular instance we feel it to
be unjust.</p>
<p>The conflict between formal justice and formal equality before the
law, on the one hand, and the attempts to realize various ideals of
substantive justice and equality, on the other, also accounts for the
widespread confusion about the concept of “privilege” and its consequent
abuse. To mention only the most important instance of this abuse—the
application of the term “privilege” to property as such. It would indeed
be privilege if, for example, as has sometimes been the case in the
past, landed property were reserved to members of the nobility. And it
is privilege if, as is true in our time, the right to produce or sell
particular things is reserved to particular people designated by
authority. But to call private property as such, which all can acquire
under the same rules, a privilege, because only some succeed in
acquiring it, is depriving the word “privilege” of its meaning.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of the particular effects, which is the
distinguishing characteristic of the formal laws of a liberal system, is
also important because it helps us to clear up another confusion about
the nature of this system: the belief that its characteristic attitude
is inaction of the state. The question whether the state should or
should not “act” or “interfere” poses an altogether false alternative,
and the term “laissez faire” is a highly ambiguous and misleading
description of the principles on which a liberal policy is based. Of
course, every state must act and every action of the state interferes
with something or other. But that is not the point. The important
question is whether the individual can foresee the action of the state
and make use of this knowledge as a datum in forming his own plans, with
the result that the state cannot control the use made of its machinery
and that the individual knows precisely how far he will be protected
against interference from others, or whether the state is in a position
to frustrate individual efforts. The state controlling weights and
measures (or preventing fraud and deception in any other way) is
certainly acting, while the state permitting the use of violence, for
example, by strike pickets, is inactive. Yet it is in the first case
that the state observes liberal principles and in the second that it
does not. Similarly with respect to most of the general and permanent
rules which the state may establish with regard to production, such as
building regulations or factory laws: these may be wise or unwise in the
particular instance, but they do not conflict with liberal principles so
long as they are intended to be permanent and are not used to favor or
harm particular people. It is true that in these instances there will,
apart from the long-run effects which cannot be predicted, also be
short-run effects on particular people which may be clearly known. But
with this kind of laws the short-run effects are in general not (or at
least ought not to be) the guiding consideration. As these immediate and
predictable effects become more important compared with the long-run
effects, we approach the border line where the distinction, however
clear in principle, becomes blurred in practice.</p>
<p>The Rule of Law was consciously evolved only during the liberal age
and is one of its greatest achievements, not only as a safeguard but as
the legal embodiment of freedom. As Immanuel Kant put it (and Voltaire
expressed it before him in very much the same terms), “Man is free if he
needs to obey no person but solely the laws.”6 As a vague ideal it has,
however, existed at least since Roman times, and during the last few
centuries it has never been so seriously threatened as it is today. The
idea that there is no limit to the powers of the legislator is in part a
result of popular sovereignty and democratic government. It has been
strengthened by the belief that, so long as all actions of the state are
duly authorized by legislation, the Rule of Law will be preserved. But
this is completely to misconceive the meaning of the Rule of Law. This
rule has little to do with the question whether all actions of
government are legal in the juridical sense. They may well be and yet
not conform to the Rule of Law. The fact that someone has full legal
authority to act in the way he does gives no answer to the question
whether the law gives him power to act arbitrarily or whether the law
prescribes unequivocally how he has to act. It may well be that Hitler
has obtained his unlimited powers in a strictly constitutional manner
and that whatever he does is therefore legal in the juridical sense. But
who would suggest for that reason that the Rule of Law still prevails in
Germany?</p>
<p>To say that in a planned society the Rule of Law cannot hold is,
therefore, not to say that the actions of the government will not be
legal or that such a society will necessarily be lawless. It means only
that the use of the government’s coercive powers will no longer be
limited and determined by pre-established rules. The law can, and to
make a central direction of economic activity possible must, legalize
what to all intents and purposes remains arbitrary action. If the law
says that such a board or authority may do what it pleases, anything
that board or authority does is legal—but its actions are certainly not
subject to the Rule of Law. By giving the government unlimited powers,
the most arbitrary rule can be made legal; and in this way a democracy
may set up the most complete despotism imaginable.7</p>
<p>If, however, the law is to enable authorities to direct economic
life, it must give them powers to make and enforce decisions in
circumstances which cannot be foreseen and on principles which cannot be
stated in generic form. The consequence is that, as planning extends,
the delegation of legislative powers to diverse boards and authorities
becomes increasingly common. When before the last war, in a case to
which the late Lord Hewart has recently drawn attention, Mr. Justice
Darling said that “Parliament had enacted only last year that the Board
of Agriculture in acting as they did should be no more impeachable than
Parliament itself,” this was still a rare thing.8 It has since become an
almost daily occurrence. Constantly the broadest powers are conferred on
new authorities which, without being bound by fixed rules, have almost
unlimited discretion in regulating this or that activity of the
people.</p>
<p>The Rule of Law thus implies limits to the scope of legislation: it
restricts it to the kind of general rules known as formal law and
excludes legislation either directly aimed at particular people or at
enabling anybody to use the coercive power of the state for the purpose
of such discrimination. It means, not that everything is regulated by
law, but, on the contrary, that the coercive power of the state can be
used only in cases defined in advance by the law and in such a way that
it can be foreseen how it will be used. A particular enactment can thus
infringe the Rule of Law. Anyone ready to deny this would have to
contend that whether the Rule of Law prevails today in Germany, Italy,
or Russia depends on whether the dictators have obtained their absolute
power by constitutional means.9</p>
<p>Whether, as in some countries, the main applications of the Rule of
Law are laid down in a bill of rights or in a constitutional code, or
whether the principle is merely a firmly established tradition, matters
comparatively little. But it will readily be seen that, whatever form it
takes, any such recognized limitations of the powers of legislation
imply the recognition of the inalienable right of the individual,
inviolable rights of man.</p>
<p>It is pathetic but characteristic of the muddle into which many of
our intellectuals have been led by the conflicting ideals in which they
believe that a leading advocate of the most comprehensive central
planning like H. G. Wells should at the same time write an ardent
defense of the rights of man.10 The individual rights which Mr. Wells
hopes to preserve would inevitably obstruct the planning which he
desires. To some extent he seems to realize the dilemma, and we find
therefore the provisions of his proposed “Declaration of the Rights of
Man” so hedged about with qualifications that they lose all
significance. While, for instance, his declaration proclaims that every
man “shall have the right to buy and sell without any discriminatory
restrictions anything which may be lawfully bought and sold,” which is
admirable, he immediately proceeds to make the whole provision nugatory
by adding that it applies only to buying and selling “in such quantities
and with such reservations as are compatible with the common welfare.”11
But since, of course, all restrictions ever imposed upon buying or
selling anything are supposed to be necessary in the interest of the
“common welfare,” there is really no restriction which this clause
effectively prevents and no right of the individual that is safeguarded
by it.</p>
<p>Or, to take another basic clause, the declaration states that every
man “may engage in any lawful occupation” and that “he is entitled to
paid employment and to a free choice whenever there is any variety of
employment open to him.”12 It is not stated, however, who is to decide
whether a particular employment is “open” to a particular person, and
the added provision that “he may suggest employment for himself and have
his claim publicly considered, accepted or dismissed,”13 shows that
Mr. Wells is thinking in terms of an authority which decides whether a
man is “entitled” to a particular position—which certainly means the
opposite of free choice of occupation. And how in a planned world
“freedom of travel and migration” is to be secured when not only the
means of communication and currencies are controlled but also the
location of industries planned, or how the freedom of the press is to be
safeguarded when the supply of paper and all the channels of
distribution are controlled by the planning authority, are questions to
which Mr. Wells provides as little answer as any other planner.</p>
<p>In this respect much more consistency is shown by the more numerous
reformers who, ever since the beginning of the socialist movement, have
attacked the “metaphysical” idea of individual rights and insisted that
in a rationally ordered world there will be no individual rights but
only individual duties. This, indeed, has become the much more common
attitude of our so-called “progressives,” and few things are more
certain to expose one to the reproach of being a reactionary than if one
protests against a measure on the grounds that it is a violation of the
rights of the individual. Even a liberal paper like the Economist was a
few years ago holding up to us the example of the French, of all people,
who had learned the lesson that “democratic government no less than
dictatorship must always (sic) have plenary powers in posse, without
sacrificing their democratic and representative character. There is no
restrictive penumbra of individual rights that can never be touched by
government in administrative matters whatever the circumstances. There
is no limit to the power of ruling which can and should be taken by a
government freely chosen by the people and can be fully and openly
criticised by an opposition.”14</p>
<p>This may be inevitable in wartime, when, of course, even free and
open criticism is necessarily restricted. But the “always” in the
statement quoted does not suggest that the Economist regards it as a
regrettable wartime necessity. Yet as a permanent institution this view
is certainly incompatible with the preservation of the Rule of Law, and
it leads straight to the totalitarian state. It is, however, the view
which all those who want the government to direct economic life must
hold.</p>
<p>How even a formal recognition of individual rights, or of the equal
rights of minorities, loses all significance in a state which embarks on
a complete control of economic life, has been amply demonstrated by the
experience of the various Central European countries. It has been shown
there that it is possible to pursue a policy of ruthless discrimination
against national minorities by the use of recognized instruments of
economic policy without ever infringing the letter of the statutory
protection of minority rights. This oppression by means of economic
policy was greatly facilitated by the fact that particular industries or
activities were largely in the hands of a national minority, so that
many a measure aimed ostensibly against an industry or class was in fact
aimed at a national minority. But the almost boundless possibilities for
a policy of discrimination and oppression provided by such apparently
innocuous principles as “government control of the development of
industries” have been amply demonstrated to all those desirous of seeing
how the political consequences of planning appear in practice.</p>

<p>2 According to the classical exposition by A. V. Dicey in
Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution, 8th
ed. (London: Macmillan and Co., 1915), p. 198, the Rule of Law “means,
in the first place, the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular
law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes the
existence of arbitrariness, of prerogative, or even of wide
discretionary authority on the part of government.” Largely as a result
of Dicey’s work the term has, however, in England acquired a narrower
technical meaning which does not concern us here. The wider and older
meaning of the concept of the rule or reign of law, which in England had
become an established tradition which was more taken for granted than
discussed, has been most fully elaborated, just because it raised what
were new problems there, in the early nineteenth-century discussion in
Germany about the nature of the Rechtsstaat. (For more on the latter
tradition, see F. A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, op. cit.,
chapter 13. —Ed.)</p>
<p>3 (Hayek discusses the decline of the rule of law in The Constitution
of Liberty, op. cit., chapter 16. —Ed.)</p>
<p>4 (Sir Henry Maine, Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early
History of Society and Its Relation to Modern Ideas. Fourth American
edition from the Tenth London edition. (New York: Henry Holt, 1906),
p. 165. English jurist and historian Sir Henry Maine (1822–1888), from
1877 the Whewell professor of international law at Cambridge, wrote
extensively on the origins and growth of legal and social institutions.
The line is taken from the final sentence of chapter 5, titled
“Primitive Society and Ancient Law.” —Ed.)</p>
<p>5 It is therefore not altogether false when the legal theorist of
National Socialism, Carl Schmitt, opposes to the liberal Rechststaat
(i.e., the Rule of Law) the National Socialist ideal of the gerechte
Staat (“the just state”)—only that the sort of justice which is opposed
to formal justice necessarily implies discrimination between persons.
(German jurist Carl Schmitt (1888–1985) was a critic of liberal
parliamentarianism and defender of the authoritarian state. In the 1930s
he attempted to reconcile his views with those of the Nazis, offering
legal justifications of their takeover of the government and defending
the Nuremberg Laws that excluded Jews from public and social life.
Though he lost favor with the Nazis by 1936, outside of Germany he was
often viewed as the legal theorist of National Socialism. Hayek also
refers to the Freirechtsschule, which is the German term for “legal
realism,” a doctrine that holds that instinct rather than rule-following
is the actual basis of judicial interpretation of the law. —Ed.)</p>
<p>6 (I was unable to locate the quotation attributed to Kant, but for
the other, Hayek refers to François Marie Arouet de Voltaire, Oeuvres
Complète de Voltaire, vol. 23 (Paris: Garnier, 1879), p. 526, where
Voltaire writes, “La liberté consiste à ne dépendre que des lois.”
—Ed.)</p>
<p>7 The conflict is thus not, as it has often been misconceived in
nineteenth century discussions, one between liberty and law. As John
Locke had already made clear, there can be no liberty without law. The
conflict is between different kinds of law—law so different that it
should hardly be called by the same name: one is the law of the Rule of
Law, general principles laid down beforehand, the “rules of the game”
which enable individuals to foresee how the coercive apparatus of the
state will be used, or what he and his fellow-citizens will be allowed
to do, or made to do, in stated circumstances. The other kind of law
gives in effect the authority power to do what it thinks fit to do. Thus
the Rule of Law could clearly not be preserved in a democracy that
undertook to decide every conflict of interests not according to rules
previously laid down but “on its merits.” (Locke described the state of
nature as “a state of perfect freedom.” He went on to say, however, that
men form civil societies and submit themselves to laws in order better
to preserve their liberty and property. See John Locke, Two Treatises of
Government, ed. Peter Laslett (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1988), Treatise 2, chapters 4, 9. —Ed.)</p>
<p>8 (English jurist Charles John, First Baron Darling (1849–1936)
served as a conservative MP, a judge, and a member of several royal
commissions. For more on Lord Hewart, see the foreword to the 1956
American paperback edition, note 25. —Ed.)</p>
<p>9 Another illustration of an infringement of the Rule of Law by
legislation is the case of the bill of attainder, familiar in the
history of England. The form which the Rule of Law takes in criminal law
is usually expressed by the Latin tag nulla poena sine lege—no
punishment without a law expressly prescribing it. The essence of this
rule is that the law must have existed as a general rule before the
individual case arose to which it is to be applied. Nobody would argue
that, when in a famous case in Henry VIII’s reign Parliament resolved
with respect to the Bishop of Rochester’s cook that “the said Richard
Rose shall be boiled to death without having the advantage of his
clergy,” this act was performed under the Rule of Law. But while the
Rule of Law had become an essential part of criminal procedure in all
liberal countries, it cannot be preserved in totalitarian regimes.
There, as E. B. Ashton has well expressed it, the liberal maxim is
replaced by the principles nullum crimen sire poena—no “crime” must
remain without punishment, whether the law explicitly provides for it or
not. “The rights of the state do not end with punishing law breakers.
The community is entitled to whatever may seem necessary to the
protection of its interests—of which observance of the law, as it
stands, is only one of the more elementary requirements.” See E. B.
Ashton, The Fascist: His State and His Mind, op. cit., p. 127. What is
an infringement of “the interests of the community” is, of course,
decided by the authorities. (Hayek incorrectly listed Ashton’s quote as
being found on p. 119, not 127. —Ed.)</p>
<p>10 (English novelist H. G. Wells (1866–1946) is best remembered today
for such science fiction classics as The Time Machine and The War of the
Worlds. In his day he was also known for his biting social satires,
contributions to popular history, and involvement with numerous
progressive causes. In 1939 he drafted a “Declaration of the Rights of
Man” that was published in The Daily Herald and other newspapers, and
which elicited much commentary. Some of these ideas were later worked
into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was adopted by the
UN General Assembly in December 1948. Wells’s “Declaration” was
reprinted under the title “Ten Points for World Peace,” Current History,
vol. 51, March 1940, pp. 16–18, from which subsequent citations are
taken. —Ed.)</p>
