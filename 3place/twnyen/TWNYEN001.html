<h4 id="editorial-foreword">EDITORIAL FOREWORD</h4>
<p>The first volume in The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek was the last
book that Hayek wrote, The Fatal <strong>Conceit</strong>. It was the
first volume in two respects: it was volume 1 in the series, and it was
the first published, in 1988. The founding general editor was the
philosopher W. W. Bartley III, and he initially
<strong>envisioned</strong> that the series would contain twenty-two
volumes—at least, that was what was noted in the material describing the
planned series in The <strong>Fatal Conceit</strong>. Wisely, Bartley
added the proviso that “the plan is provisional.” It is now anticipated
that there will be nineteen volumes in all, but the original proviso
still applies.</p>
<ul>
<li>《Fatal
Conceit》，“致命的自负”，取自弗里德里希·哈耶克于1988年出版的一本书的书名。</li>
</ul>
<p>Much has happened since 1988. A second volume produced under
Bartley’s editorship was published in 1991, but it was a posthumous
contribution, Bartley having succumbed to cancer in February 1990. Soon
thereafter Stephen Kresge took over the position of general editor, and
under him five more volumes were produced. The volumes in the series did
not appear in numerical order: to date, volumes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10
have been published.</p>
<p>In spring 2002 Stephen Kresge asked me whether I might be interested
in becoming the next general editor. I was, and after the Hayek family
and representatives from the University of Chicago Press and Routledge
all signed off, my work began. The first year or so was taken up with
getting editorial material shifted from California to North Carolina,
rethinking the ordering of the volumes, establishing relationships with
existing and potential volume editors, and seeking funds to support the
project.</p>
<p>The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents—The Definitive Edition is the
first volume to appear under the new general editorship. Others are on
the way. I anticipate fairly steady progress over the next few years as
the project moves toward completion.</p>
<p>In the first volume Bill Bartley briefly stated the editorial policy
for the series as follows: “The texts of subsequent volumes will be
published in corrected, revised and annotated form” and “essays which
exist in slightly variant forms, or in several different languages, will
be published always in English or in English translation, and only in
their most complete and finished form unless some variation, or the
timing thereof, is of theoretical or historical significance.” These
policies will continue to be followed in the present volume and those to
come.</p>
<p>For The Road to Serfdom the following editorial decisions were made.
The British edition came out in March 1944, and the American in
September of that year. The text for the American edition was reset,
principally to replace phrases like “this country” with “England.”
Because the American edition is accordingly clearer (that is, it does
not presume that the reader knows that “this country” refers to
England), it was chosen for the text. Accordingly, “American English” is
used throughout—in this regard this volume differs from others in the
series, in which “British English” has mainly been used. Typographical
errors were silently corrected, except where Hayek provided an incorrect
citation. In those cases the correction is made and noted. At many
points in the book Hayek quotes others, and his quotations do not always
exactly duplicate the original. However, only when his misquoting might
affect the meaning of the passage is this noted; in any event, what
Hayek originally wrote stands.</p>
<p>Each volume in The Collected Works is intended to be a definitive
presentation of Hayek’s work. As such, when the University of Chicago
Press proposed that we add the subtitle “The Definitive Edition” I
initially resisted, thinking it in-appropriate to single out this volume
from the rest. The Road to Serfdom is unique, however, in that it is the
only piece of Hayek’s work to go through numerous editions: the original
one in 1944, another in 1956 to which Hayek added a foreword, a 1976
edition to which he added a new preface, and the 1994 50th anniversary
edition which carried an introduction by Milton Friedman. The subtitle
was added, and I hope that this will always be considered the definitive
edition. History suggests, however, that it may not be the last one.</p>
<p>Many have been involved in helping me get started as the new general
editor. I owe a special debt to Mrs. Dorothy Morris of the Morris
Foundation, Little Rock, who provided me with the “seed money” needed to
initiate a search for additional funding for the project. As has been
documented in forewords to preceding volumes in the series, Dorothy’s
husband Walter Morris was instrumental in the creation of The Collected
Works project, and the Morris Foundation has been constant in its
support throughout the years. I first sought financial support for the
project at the Mont Pèlerin meetings in London in October 2002, and John
Blundell of the Institute of Economic Affairs provided me both advice on
how to proceed and assistance in arranging for a fellowship to help
defray the costs of attendance. The meeting ultimately led me to David
Kennedy and Ingrid Gregg of the Earhart Foundation, and to Emilio
Pacheco of the Liberty Fund and the Pierre F. and Enid Goodrich
Foundation. These organizations have provided the lion’s share of
support for the project. Finally, Stephen Kresge has been an advisor,
mentor, sounding board, and friend throughout the very long transition
from second to third general editor, and beyond. To all of them my most
sincere thanks.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank the following people and organizations for
granting their permission to reproduce materials and quote from letters:
Mr. Frank B. Knight for permission to reproduce Frank Knight’s reader’s
report on The Road to Serfdom; Dr. Thomas Marschak for permission to
reproduce Jacob Marschak’s reader’s report on The Road to Serfdom;
Mr. David Michaelis for permission to quote from Ordway Tead’s letter of
September 25, 1943, to Fritz Machlup; and the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace for permission to quote from materials contained
in the Hoover Institution Archives.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Emily
Wilcox and Jason Schenker in preparing the manuscript.</p>
