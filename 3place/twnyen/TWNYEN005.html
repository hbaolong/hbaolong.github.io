<p>THE ABANDONED ROAD</p>
<p>A program whose basic thesis is, not that the system of free
enterprise for profit has failed in this generation, but that it has not
yet been tried.</p>
<p>—F. D. Roosevelt1</p>
<p>When the course of civilization takes an unexpected turn—when,
instead of the continuous progress which we have come to expect, we find
ourselves threatened by evils associated by us with past ages of
barbarism—we naturally blame anything but ourselves. Have we not all
striven according to our best lights, and have not many of our finest
minds incessantly worked to make this a better world? Have not all our
efforts and hopes been directed toward greater freedom, justice, and
prosperity? If the outcome is so different from our aims— if, instead of
freedom and prosperity, bondage and misery stare us in the face—is it
not clear that sinister forces must have foiled our intentions, that we
are the victims of some evil power which must be conquered before we can
resume the road to better things? However much we may differ when we
name the culprit—whether it is the wicked capitalist or the vicious
spirit of a particular nation, the stupidity of our elders, or a social
system not yet, although we have struggled against it for half a
century, fully overthrown—we all are, or at last were until recently,
certain of one thing: that the leading ideas which during the last
generation have become common to most people of good will and have
determined the major changes in our social life cannot have been wrong.
We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of
our civilization except one: that the present state of the world may be
the result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some
of our most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly
different from those which we expected.</p>
<p>While all our energies are directed to bring this war to a victorious
conclusion, it is sometimes difficult to remember that even before the
war the values for which we are now fighting were threatened here and
destroyed elsewhere. Though for the time being the different ideals are
represented by hostile nations fighting for their existence, we must not
forget that this conflict has grown out of a struggle of ideas within
what, not so long ago, was a common European civilization and that the
tendencies which have culminated in the creation of the totalitarian
systems were not confined to the countries which have succumbed to them.
Though the first task must now be to win the war, to win it will only
gain us another opportunity to face the basic problems and to find a way
of averting the fate which has overtaken kindred civilizations.</p>
<p>Now, it is somewhat difficult to think of Germany and Italy, or of
Russia, not as different worlds but as products of a development of
thought in which we have shared; it is, at least so far as our enemies
are concerned, easier and more comforting to think that they are
entirely different from us and that what happened there cannot happen
here. Yet the history of these countries in the years before the rise of
the totalitarian system showed few features with which we are not
familiar. The external conflict is a result of a transformation of
European thought in which others have moved so much faster as to bring
them into irreconcilable conflict with our ideals, but which has not
left us unaffected.</p>
<p>That a change of ideas and the force of human will have made the
world what it is now, though men did not foresee the results, and that
no spontaneous change in the facts obliged us thus to adapt our thought
is perhaps particularly difficult for the Anglo-Saxon nations to see,
just because in this development they have, fortunately for them, lagged
behind most of the European peoples. We still think of the ideals which
guide us, and have guided us for the past generation, as ideals only to
be realized in the future and are not aware how far in the last
twenty-five years they have already transformed not only the world but
also our own countries. We still believe that until quite recently we
were governed by what are vaguely called nineteenth-century ideas or the
principle of laissez faire. Compared with some other countries, and from
the point of view of those impatient to speed up the change, there may
be some justification for such belief. But although until 1931 England
and America had followed only slowly on the path on which others had
led, even by then they had moved so far that only those whose memory
goes back to the years before the last war know what a liberal world has
been like.2</p>
<p>The crucial point of which our people are still so little aware is,
however, not merely the magnitude of the changes which have taken place
during the last generation but the fact that they mean a complete change
in the direction of the evolution of our ideas and social order. For at
least twenty-five years before the specter of totalitarianism became a
real threat, we had progressively been moving away from the basic ideas
on which Western civilization has been built. That this movement on
which we have entered with such high hopes and ambitions should have
brought us face to face with the totalitarian horror has come as a
profound shock to this generation, which still refuses to connect the
two facts. Yet this development merely confirms the warnings of the
fathers of the liberal philosophy which we still profess. We have
progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which
personal and political freedom has never existed in the past. Although
we had been warned by some of the greatest political thinkers of the
nineteenth century, by Tocqueville and Lord Acton, that socialism means
slavery, we have steadily moved in the direction of socialism.3 And now
that we have seen a new form of slavery arise before our eyes, we have
so completely forgotten the warning that it scarcely occurs to us that
the two things may be connected.4</p>
<p>How sharp a break not only with the recent past but with the whole
evolution of Western civilization the modern trend toward socialism
means becomes clear if we consider it not merely against the background
of the nineteenth century but in a longer historical perspective. We are
rapidly abandoning not the views merely of Cobden and Bright, of Adam
Smith and Hume, or even of Locke and Milton,5 but one of the salient
characteristics of Western civilization as it has grown from the
foundations laid by Christianity and the Greeks and Romans. Not merely
nineteenth- and eighteenth-century liberalism, but the basic
individualism inherited by us from Erasmus and Montaigne, from Cicero
and Tacitus, Pericles and Thucydides, is progressively
relinquished.6</p>
<p>The Nazi leader who described the National Socialist revolution as a
counter-Renaissance spoke more truly than he probably knew. It was the
decisive step in the destruction of that civilization which modern man
had built up from the age of the Renaissance and which was, above all,
an individualist civilization. Individualism has a bad name today, and
the term has come to be connected with egotism and selfishness.7 But the
individualism of which we speak in contrast to socialism and all other
forms of collectivism has no necessary connection with these. Only
gradually in the course of this book shall we be able to make clear the
contrast between the two opposing principles. But the essential features
of that individualism which, from elements provided by Christianity and
the philosophy of classical antiquity, was first fully developed during
the Renaissance and has since grown and spread into what we know as
Western civilization—are the respect for the individual man qua man,
that is, the recognition of his own views and tastes as supreme in his
own sphere, however narrowly that may be circumscribed, and the belief
that it is desirable that men should develop their own individual gifts
and bents. “Freedom” and “liberty” are now words so worn with use and
abuse that one must hesitate to employ them to express the ideals for
which they stood during that period. “Tolerance” is, perhaps, the only
word which still preserves the full meaning of the principle which
during the whole of this period was in the ascendant and which only in
recent times has again been in decline, to disappear completely with the
rise of the totalitarian state.</p>
<p>The gradual transformation of a rigidly organized hierarchic system
into one where men could at least attempt to shape their own life, where
man gained the opportunity of knowing and choosing between different
forms of life, is closely associated with the growth of commerce. From
the commercial cities of northern Italy the new view of life spread with
commerce to the west and north, through France and the southwest of
Germany to the Low Countries and the British Isles, taking firm root
wherever there was no despotic political power to stifle it. In the Low
Countries and Britain it for a long time enjoyed its fullest development
and for the first time had an opportunity to grow freely and to become
the foundation of the social and political life of these countries. And
it was from there that in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
it again began to spread in a more fully developed form to the West and
East, to the New World and to the center of the European continent,
where devastating wars and political oppression had largely submerged
the earlier beginnings of a similar growth.8</p>
<p>During the whole of this modern period of European history the
general direction of social development was one of freeing the
individual from the ties which had bound him to the customary or
prescribed ways in the pursuit of his ordinary activities. The conscious
realization that the spontaneous and uncontrolled efforts of individuals
were capable of producing a complex order of economic activities could
come only after this development had made some progress. The subsequent
elaboration of a consistent argument in favor of economic freedom was
the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which had been the
undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest result of the unchaining of individual energies
was the marvelous growth of science which followed the march of
individual liberty from Italy to England and beyond. That the inventive
faculty of man had been no less in earlier periods is shown by the many
highly ingenious automatic toys and other mechanical contrivances
constructed while industrial technique still remained stationary and by
the development in some industries which, like mining or watch-making,
were not subject to restrictive controls. But the few attempts toward a
more extended industrial use of mechanical inventions, some
extraordinarily advanced, were promptly suppressed, and the desire for
knowledge was stifled, so long as the dominant views were held to be
binding for all: the beliefs of the great majority on what was right and
proper were allowed to bar the way of the individual innovator. Only
since industrial freedom opened the path to the free use of new
knowledge, only since everything could be tried—if somebody could be
found to back it at his own risk—and, it should be added, as often as
not from outside the authorities officially entrusted with the
cultivation of learning, has science made the great strides which in the
last hundred and fifty years have changed the face of the world.</p>
<p>As is so often true, the nature of our civilization has been seen
more clearly by its enemies than by most of its friends: “the perennial
Western malady, the revolt of the individual against the species,” as
that nineteenth-century totalitarian, Auguste Comte, has described it,
was indeed the force which built our civilization.9 What the nineteenth
century added to the individualism of the preceding period was merely to
make all classes conscious of freedom, to develop systematically and
continuously what had grown in a haphazard and patchy manner, and to
spread it from England and Holland over most of the European
continent.</p>
<p>The result of this growth surpassed all expectations. Wherever the
barriers to the free exercise of human ingenuity were removed, man
became rapidly able to satisfy ever widening ranges of desire. And while
the rising standard soon led to the discovery of very dark spots in
society, spots which men were no longer willing to tolerate, there was
probably no class that did not substantially benefit from the general
advance. We cannot do justice to this astonishing growth if we measure
it by our present standards, which themselves result from this growth
and now make many defects obvious. To appreciate what it meant to those
who took part in it, we must measure it by the hopes and wishes men held
when it began: and there can be no doubt that its success surpassed
man’s wildest dreams, that by the beginning of the twentieth century the
workingman in the Western world had reached a degree of material
comfort, security, and personal independence which a hundred years
before had seemed scarcely possible.</p>
<p>What in the future will probably appear the most significant and
far-reaching effect of this success is the new sense of power over their
own fate, the belief in the unbounded possibilities of improving their
own lot, which the success already achieved created among men. With the
success grew ambition—and man had every right to be ambitious. What had
been an inspiring promise seemed no longer enough, the rate of progress
far too slow; and the principles which had made this progress possible
in the past came to be regarded more as obstacles to speedier progress,
impatiently to be brushed away, than as the conditions for the
preservation and development of what had already been achieved.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a
stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for
all. The fundamental principle that in the ordering of our affairs we
should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of
society, and resort as little as possible to coercion, is capable of an
infinite variety of applications. There is, in particular, all the
difference between deliberately creating a system within which
competition will work as beneficially as possible and passively
accepting institutions as they are. Probably nothing has done so much
harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on
certain rough rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez faire.
Yet, in a sense, this was necessary and unavoidable. Against the
innumerable interests which could show that particular measures would
confer immediate and obvious benefits on some, while the harm they
caused was much more indirect and difficult to see, nothing short of
some hard-and-fast rule would have been effective. And since a strong
presumption in favor of industrial liberty had undoubtedly been
established, the temptation to present it as a rule which knew no
exceptions was too strong always to be resisted.</p>
<p>But, with this attitude taken by many popularizers of the liberal
doctrine, it was almost inevitable that, once their position was
penetrated at some points, it should soon collapse as a whole. The
position was further weakened by the inevitably slow progress of a
policy which aimed at a gradual improvement of the institutional
framework of a free society. This progress depended on the growth of our
understanding of the social forces and the conditions most favorable to
their working in a desirable manner. Since the task was to assist, and
where necessary to supplement, their operation, the first requisite was
to understand them. The attitude of the liberal toward society is like
that of the gardener who tends a plant and, in order to create the
conditions most favorable to its growth, must know as much as possible
about its structure and the way it functions.</p>
<p>No sensible person should have doubted that the crude rules in which
the principles of economic policy of the nineteenth century were
expressed were only a beginning—that we had yet much to learn and that
there were still immense possibilities of advancement on the lines on
which we had moved. But this advance could come only as we gained
increasing intellectual mastery of the forces of which we had to make
use. There were many obvious tasks, such as our handling of the monetary
system and the prevention or control of monopoly, and an even greater
number of less obvious but hardly less important tasks to be undertaken
in other fields, where there could be no doubt that the governments
possessed enormous powers for good and evil; and there was every reason
to expect that, with a better understanding of the problems, we should
some day be able to use these powers successfully.</p>
<p>But while the progress toward what is commonly called “positive”
action was necessarily slow, and while for the immediate improvement
liberalism had to rely largely on the gradual increase of wealth which
freedom brought about, it had constantly to fight proposals which
threatened this progress. It came to be regarded as a “negative” creed
because it could offer to particular individuals little more than a
share in the common progress—a progress which came to be taken more and
more for granted and was no longer recognized as the result of the
policy of freedom. It might even be said that the very success of
liberalism became the cause of its decline. Because of the success
already achieved, man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the
evils still with him which now appeared both unbearable and
unnecessary.10</p>
<p>Because of the growing impatience with the slow advance of liberal
policy, the just irritation with those who used liberal phraseology in
defense of antisocial privileges, and the boundless ambition seemingly
justified by the material improvements already achieved, it came to pass
that toward the turn of the century the belief in the basic tenets of
liberalism was more and more relinquished. What had been achieved came
to be regarded as a secure and imperishable possession, acquired once
and for all. The eyes of the people became fixed on the new demands, the
rapid satisfaction of which seemed to be barred by the adherence to the
old principles. It became more and more widely accepted that further
advance could be expected not along the old lines within the general
framework which had made past progress possible but only by a complete
remodeling of society. It was no longer a question of adding to or
improving the existing machinery but of completely scrapping and
replacing it. And, as the hope of the new generation came to be centered
on something completely new, interest in and understanding of the
functioning of the existing society rapidly declined; and, with the
decline of the understanding of the way in which the free system worked,
our awareness of what depended on its existence also decreased.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss how this change in outlook was
fostered by the uncritical transfer to the problems of society of habits
of thought engendered by the preoccupation with technological problems,
the habits of thought of the natural scientist and the engineer, and how
these at the same time tended to discredit the results of the past study
of society which did not conform to their prejudices and to impose
ideals of organization on a sphere to which they are not appropriate.11
All we are here concerned to show is how completely, though gradually
and by almost imperceptible steps, our attitude toward society has
changed. What at every stage of this process of change had appeared a
difference of degree only has in its cumulative effect already brought
about a fundamental difference between the older liberal attitude toward
society and the present approach to social problems. The change amounts
to a complete reversal of the trend we have sketched, an entire
abandonment of the individualist tradition which has created Western
civilization.</p>
<p>According to the views now dominant, the question is no longer how we
can make the best use of the spontaneous forces found in a free society.
We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced
unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism
of the market by collective and “conscious” direction of all social
forces to deliberately chosen goals. The difference cannot be better
illustrated than by the extreme position taken in a widely acclaimed
book on whose program of so-called “planning for freedom” we shall have
to comment yet more than once. “We have never had to set up and direct,”
writes Dr. Karl Mannheim, “the entire system of nature as we are forced
to do today with society. . . . Mankind is tending more and more to
regulate the whole of its social life, although it has never attempted
to create a second nature.”12</p>
<p>It is significant that this change in the trend of ideas has
coincided with a reversal of the direction in which ideas have traveled
in space. For over two hundred years English ideas had been spreading
eastward. The rule of freedom which had been achieved in England seemed
destined to spread throughout the world. By about 1870 the reign of
these ideas had probably reached its easternmost expansion. From then
onward it began to retreat, and a different set of ideas, not really new
but very old, began to advance from the East. England lost her
intellectual leadership in the political and social sphere and became an
importer of ideas. For the next sixty years Germany became the center
from which the ideas destined to govern the world in the twentieth
century spread east and west. Whether it was Hegel or Marx, List or
Schmoller, Sombart or Mannheim, whether it was socialism in its more
radical form or merely “organization” or “planning” of a less radical
kind, German ideas were everywhere readily imported and German
institutions imitated.13</p>
<p>Although most of the new ideas, and particularly socialism, did not
originate in Germany, it was in Germany that they were perfected and
during the last quarter of the nineteenth and the first quarter of the
twentieth century that they reached their fullest development. It is now
often forgotten how very considerable was the lead which Germany had
during this period in the development of the theory and practice of
socialism; that a generation before socialism became a serious issue in
this country, Germany had a large socialist party in her parliament and
that until not very long ago the doctrinal development of socialism was
almost entirely carried on in Germany and Austria, so that even today
Russian discussion largely carries on where the Germans left off. Most
English and American socialists are still unaware that the majority of
the problems they begin to discover were thoroughly discussed by German
socialists long ago.14</p>
<p>The intellectual influence which German thinkers were able to
exercise during this period on the whole world was supported not merely
by the great material progress of Germany but even more by the
extraordinary reputation which German thinkers and scientists had earned
during the preceding hundred years when Germany had once more become an
integral and even leading member of the common European civilization.
But it soon served to assist the spreading from Germany of ideas
directed against the foundations of that civilization. The Germans
themselves—or at least those among them who spread these ideas—were
fully aware of the conflict: what had been the common heritage of
European civilization became to them, long before the Nazis, “Western”
civilization—where “Western” was no longer used in the old sense of
Occident but had come to mean west of the Rhine. “Western” in this sense
was liberalism and democracy, capitalism and individualism, free trade
and any form of internationalism or love of peace.</p>
<p>But in spite of the ill-concealed contempt of an ever increasing
number of Germans for those “shallow” Western ideals, or perhaps because
of it, the people of the West continued to import German ideas and were
even induced to believe that their own former convictions had merely
been rationalizations of selfish interests, that free trade was a
doctrine invented to further British interests, and that the political
ideals of England and America were hopelessly outmoded and a thing to be
ashamed of.</p>
<p>1 (Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Recommendations to the Congress to Curb
Monopolies and the Concentration of Economic Power,” The Continuing
Struggle for Liberalism, vol. 7 of The Public Papers and Addresses of
Franklin D. Roosevelt (New York: Macmillan, 1941), p. 320. The address
was delivered on April 29, 1938. Roosevelt lamented in the speech the
concentration of power, or “collectivism,” in corporate America, and
called for a reintroduction of a “democratic competitive order” through
additional federal regulation of business. Hayek was more hopeful at
this time for the future path of the United States relative to Britain
regarding free enterprise. For more on this, see his remarks in
“Planning, Science, and Freedom,” Nature, vol. 143, November 15, 1941,
pp. 581–82, reprinted as chapter 10 of F. A. Hayek, Socialism and War:
Essays, Documents, Reviews, op. cit., p. 219. —Ed.)</p>
<p>2 Even in that year the Macmillan Report could already speak of “the
change of outlook of the government of this country in recent times, its
growing preoccupation, irrespective of party, with the management of the
life of the people” and add that “Parliament finds itself increasingly
engaged in legislation which has for its conscious aim the regulation of
the day-to-day affairs of the community and now intervenes in matters
formerly thought to be entirely outside its scope.” This could be said
before, later in the same year, England finally took the headlong plunge
and, in the short space of the inglorious years 1931–39, transformed its
economic system beyond recognition. (Hayek refers to the Committee on
Finance and Industry Report, Cmd. 3897 (London: HMSO, 1931). The two
passages Hayek quotes from are found on pages 4 and 4–5, respectively.
The Committee, chaired by the British jurist Hugo Pattison Macmillan
(1873–1952), was charged with discovering the causes behind and
formulating remedies for England’s depressed economy; it also served as
a venue in which J. M. Keynes challenged the “Treasury View.” —Ed.)</p>
<p>3 (For more on Acton and Tocqueville, see the foreword to the 1956
American paperback edition, notes 10 and 22, respectively. —Ed.)</p>
<p>4 Even much more recent warnings which have proved dreadfully true
have been almost entirely forgotten. It is not yet thirty years since
Hilaire Belloc, in a book which explains more of what has happened since
in Germany than most works written after the event, explained that “the
effect of Socialist doctrine on Capitalist society is to produce a third
thing different from either of its two begetters—to wit, the Servile
State.” (French-born British writer and poet Hilaire Belloc (1870–
1953), friend to G. K. Chesterton and writer of children’s verse, was
also the author of The Servile State (1912; 2nd ed., London and
Edinburgh: T. N. Foulis, 1913; reprinted, Indianapolis: Liberty
Classics, 1977), from which the quote is drawn (p. 32). —Ed.)</p>
<p>5 (English politicians Richard Cobden (1804–1865) and John Bright
(1811–1889), both prominent members of the Anti-Corn Law League, were
persistent advocates for free trade in nineteenth-century England.
Scottish political economist Adam Smith (1723–1790) extolled the system
of natural liberty and decried mercantilist restrictions on trade in his
classic work, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations. Scottish philosopher and historian (and close friend of Adam
Smith) David Hume (1711–1776) was the author of A Treatise of Human
Nature, a central work in the empiricist tradition in British
philosophy, and of the multivolume History of England. English
philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), another member of the British
empiricist tradition, enunciated the theory of the social contract in
his Two Treatises of Government. English poet John Milton (1608–1674),
author of Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, also wrote pamphlets in
support of the Commonwealth and of freedom of the press. —Ed.)</p>
<p>6 (Renaissance humanist and cosmopolitan scholar Desiderius Erasmus
(1466–1536), “Erasmus of Rotterdam,” was the author of In Praise of
Folly. French writer Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1533–1592) introduced
the essay as a literary form. In his essays he embraced a skeptical
attitude toward what could be known and criticized those who held views
dogmatically. Roman statesman and man of letters Marcus Tullius Cicero
(106–43 BC) was famed for his oratorical skills; his Philippics against
Mark Antony ultimately cost him his life. In his Annals and Histories,
Roman historian Publius Tacitus (ca. 55–ca. 120) chronicled the Roman
Empire in the first century. Under the reign of Athenian statesman
Pericles (490–429 BC), architecture, sculpture, and theater in Athens
flourished. Greek historian Thucydides (ca. 460–ca. 400 BC) was the
author of History of the Peloponnesian War. —Ed.)</p>
<p>7 (Hayek criticized the view that individualism is necessarily
associated with egoism and selfishness in his article, “Individualism:
True and False,” op. cit. —Ed.)</p>
<p>8 The most fateful of these developments, pregnant with consequences
not yet extinct, was the subjection and partial destruction of the
German bourgeoisie by the territorial princes in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. (Hayek’s readers would have seen analogies between
his historical references and the destruction of the influence of the
bourgeoisie in Germany after World War I, when hyperinflation wiped out
the savings of middle-class German bondholders and helped pave the way
for Hitler’s rise. The extermination of the kulaks as Stalin
consolidated his power was another analogue. —Ed.)</p>
<p>9 (Auguste Comte, Système de Politique Positive (1851–1854), vol. 4
(Paris: Librairie Positiviste, 1912), pp. 368–69. French philosopher and
social theorist Auguste Comte (1798–1857) claimed that there are three
stages of knowledge—the theological, metaphysical, and positive—with
positive being the highest. Positive knowledge had been obtained in many
natural sciences, and Comte argued that positivism should be introduced
in the study of society. Hayek explicated and criticized Comte’s views
in his essays “The Counter-Revolution of Science” and “Comte and Hegel,”
op. cit. —Ed.)</p>
<p>10 (Hayek makes a similar argument in “The Trend of Economic
Thinking,” op. cit. —Ed.)</p>
<p>11 The author has made an attempt to trace the beginning of this
development in two series of articles on “Scientism and the Study of
Society” and “The Counter-Revolution of Science,” which appeared in
Economica, 1941–44. (Revisions of these essays appear in The
Counter-Revolution of Science: Studies in the Abuse of Reason, op. cit.,
on pp. 17–182 and 183–363, respectively. —Ed.)</p>
<p>12 Karl Mannheim, Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction:
Studies in Modern Social Structure (London: Kegan Paul, 1940),
pp. 175–176. (Hungarian-born sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893–1947)
taught at Heidelberg and Frankfurt before fleeing to the LSE in 1933.
Having been among the first academics dismissed under Hitler’s
“Restoration of Civil Service Act” in March 1933, he was invited as a
visiting professor under the auspices of the Academic Freedom Committee
set up by Beveridge and his LSE colleagues. For more on this, see Ralf
Darendorf, LSE: A History of the London School of Economics and
Political Science, 1895–1995 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995),
pp. 286–87. Mannheim is remembered today chiefly for his contributions
to the sociology of knowledge. —Ed.)</p>
<p>13 (German idealist philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
(1770–1831) articulated the dialectical method in describing the
evolution of consciousness and progression of history, which the
revolutionary social theorist Karl Marx (1818–1883) placed within a
materialist framework to predict the inevitable collapse of capitalism.
In his book National System of Political Economy, German-born political
economist Friedrich List (1789–1846) advocated trade protectionism. Many
of his policy recommendations were also endorsed by the German
historical school economists, of whom Gustav Schmoller (1838–1917) was a
leader. Schmoller engaged in a Methoden-streit, or battle over methods,
with Austrian School founder Carl Menger. Historian of the development
of capitalism Werner Sombart (1863–1941) was perhaps the last of the
historical school economists. Hayek would view his move from left-wing
socialism toward anticapitalism of the fascist variety as exemplifying a
natural tendency. —Ed.)</p>
<p>14 (For more on the German socialist tradition, see M. C. Howard and
J. E. King, A History of Marxian Economics, Vol. I 1883–1914 (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1989). One of Hayek’s goals in editing the
volume, Collectivist Economic Planning, op. cit., was to inform his
English readers of some key documents critical of the German-language
socialist literature. —Ed.)</p>
