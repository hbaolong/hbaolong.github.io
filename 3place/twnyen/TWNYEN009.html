<h4 id="five">FIVE</h4>
<p>PLANNING AND DEMOCRACY</p>
<p>The statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what
manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself
with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could
safely be trusted to no council and senate whatever, and which would
nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and
presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it. —Adam Smith1</p>
<p>The common features of all collectivist systems may be described, in
a phrase ever dear to socialists of all schools, as the deliberate
organization of the labors of society for a definite social goal. That
our present society lacks such “conscious” direction toward a single
aim, that its activities are guided by the whims and fancies of
irresponsible individuals, has always been one of the main complaints of
its socialist critics.</p>
<p>In many ways this puts the basic issue very clearly. And it directs
us at once to the point where the conflict arises between individual
freedom and collectivism. The various kinds of collectivism, communism,
fascism, etc., differ among themselves in the nature of the goal toward
which they want to direct the efforts of society. But they all differ
from liberalism and individualism in wanting to organize the whole of
society and all its resources for this unitary end and in refusing to
recognize autonomous spheres in which the ends of the individuals are
supreme. In short, they are totalitarian in the true sense of this new
word which we have adopted to describe the unexpected but nevertheless
inseparable manifestations of what in theory we call collectivism.</p>
<p>The “social goal,” or “common purpose,” for which society is to be
organized is usually vaguely described as the “common good,” the
“general welfare,” or the “general interest.” It does not need much
reflection to see that these terms have no sufficiently definite meaning
to determine a particular course of action. The welfare and the
happiness of millions cannot be measured on a single scale of less and
more. The welfare of a people, like the happiness of a man, depends on a
great many things that can be provided in an infinite variety of
combinations. It cannot be adequately expressed as a single end, but
only as a hierarchy of ends, a comprehensive scale of values in which
every need of every person is given its place. To direct all our
activities according to a single plan presupposes that every one of our
needs is given its rank in an order of values which must be complete
enough to make it possible to decide among all the different courses
which the planner has to choose. It presupposes, in short, the existence
of a complete ethical code in which all the different human values are
allotted their due place.</p>
<p>The conception of a complete ethical code is unfamiliar, and it
requires some effort of imagination to see what it involves. We are not
in the habit of thinking of moral codes as more or less complete. The
fact that we are constantly choosing between different values without a
social code prescribing how we ought to choose does not surprise us and
does not suggest to us that our moral code is incomplete. In our society
there is neither occasion nor reason why people should develop common
views about what should be done in such situations. But where all the
means to be used are the property of society and are to be used in the
name of society according to a unitary plan, a “social” view about what
ought to be done must guide all decisions. In such a world we should
soon find that our moral code is full of gaps.</p>
<p>We are not concerned here with the question whether it would be
desirable to have such a complete ethical code. It may merely be pointed
out that up to the present the growth of civilization has been
accompanied by a steady diminution of the sphere in which individual
actions are bound by fixed rules. The rules of which our common moral
code consists have progressively become fewer and more general in
character. From the primitive man, who was bound by an elaborate ritual
in almost every one of his daily activities, who was limited by
innumerable taboos, and who could scarcely conceive of doing things in a
way different from his fellows, morals have more and more tended to
become merely limits circumscribing the sphere within which the
individual could behave as he liked. The adoption of a common ethical
code comprehensive enough to determine a unitary economic plan would
mean a complete reversal of this tendency.</p>
<p>The essential point for us is that no such complete ethical code
exists. The attempt to direct all economic activity according to a
single plan would raise innumerable questions to which the answer could
be provided only by a moral rule, but to which existing morals have no
answer and where there exists no agreed view on what ought to be done.
People will have either no definite views or conflicting views on such
questions, because in the free society in which we have lived there has
been no occasion to think about them and still less to form common
opinions about them.</p>
<p>Not only do we not possess such an all-inclusive scale of values: it
would be impossible for any mind to comprehend the infinite variety of
different needs of different people which compete for the available
resources and to attach a definite weight to each. For our problem it is
of minor importance whether the ends for which any person cares
comprehend only his own individual needs, or whether they include the
needs of his closer or even those of his more distant fellows—that is,
whether he is egoistic or altruistic in the ordinary senses of these
words. The point which is so important is the basic fact that it is
impossible for any man to survey more than a limited field, to be aware
of the urgency of more than a limited number of needs. Whether his
interests center round his own physical needs, or whether he takes a
warm interest in the welfare of every human being he knows, the ends
about which he can be concerned will always be only an infinitesimal
fraction of the needs of all men.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental fact on which the whole philosophy of
individualism is based. It does not assume, as is often asserted, that
man is egoistic or selfish or ought to be. It merely starts from the
indisputable fact that the limits of our powers of imagination make it
impossible to include in our scale of values more than a sector of the
needs of the whole society, and that, since, strictly speaking, scales
of value can exist only in individual minds, nothing but partial scales
of values exist—scales which are inevitably different and often
inconsistent with each other. From this the individualist concludes that
the individuals should be allowed, within defined limits, to follow
their own values and preferences rather than somebody else’s; that
within these spheres the individual’s system of ends should be supreme
and not subject to any dictation by others. It is this recognition of
the individual as the ultimate judge of his ends, the belief that as far
as possible his own views ought to govern his actions, that forms the
essence of the individualist position.</p>
<p>This view does not, of course, exclude the recognition of social
ends, or rather of a coincidence of individual ends which makes it
advisable for men to combine for their pursuit. But it limits such
common action to the instances where individual views coincide; what are
called “social ends” are for it merely identical ends of many
individuals—or ends to the achievement of which individuals are willing
to contribute in return for the assistance they receive in the
satisfaction of their own desires. Common action is thus limited to the
fields where people agree on common ends. Very frequently these common
ends will not be ultimate ends to the individuals but means which
different persons can use for different purposes. In fact, people are
most likely to agree on common action where the common end is not an
ultimate end to them but a means capable of serving a great variety of
purposes.</p>
<p>When individuals combine in a joint effort to realize ends they have
in common, the organizations, like the state, that they form for this
purpose are given their own system of ends and their own means. But any
organization thus formed remains one “person” among others, in the case
of the state much more powerful than any of the others, it is true, yet
still with its separate and limited sphere in which alone its ends are
supreme. The limits of this sphere are determined by the extent to which
the individuals agree on particular ends; and the probability that they
will agree on a particular course of action necessarily decreases as the
scope of such action extends. There are certain functions of the state
on the exercise of which there will be practical unanimity among its
citizens; there will be others on which there will be agreement of a
substantial majority; and so on, until we come to fields where, although
each individual might wish the state to act in some way, there will be
almost as many views about what the government should do as there are
different people.</p>
<p>We can rely on voluntary agreement to guide the action of the state
only so long as it is confined to spheres where agreement exists. But
not only when the state undertakes direct control in fields where there
is no such agreement is it bound to suppress individual freedom. We can
unfortunately not indefinitely extend the sphere of common action and
still leave the individual free in his own sphere. Once the communal
sector, in which the state controls all the means, exceeds a certain
proportion of the whole, the effects of its actions dominate the whole
system. Although the state controls directly the use of only a large
part of the available resources, the effects of its decisions on the
remaining part of the economic system become so great that indirectly it
controls almost everything. Where, as was, for example, true in Germany
as early as 1928, the central and local authorities directly control the
use of more than half the national income (according to an official
German estimate then, 53 per cent),2 they control indirectly almost the
whole economic life of the nation. There is, then, scarcely an
individual end which is not dependent for its achievement on the action
of the state, and the “social scale of values” which guides the state’s
action must embrace practically all individual ends.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see what must be the consequences when
democracy embarks upon a course of planning which in its execution
requires more agreement than in fact exists. The people may have agreed
on adopting a system of directed economy because they have been
convinced that it will produce great prosperity. In the discussions
leading to the decision, the goal of planning will have been described
by some such term as “common welfare,” which only conceals the absence
of real agreement on the ends of planning. Agreement will in fact exist
only on the mechanism to be used. But it is a mechanism which can be
used only for a common end; and the question of the precise goal toward
which all activity is to be directed will arise as soon as the executive
power has to translate the demand for a single plan into a particular
plan. Then it will appear that the agreement on the desirability of
planning is not supported by agreement on the ends the plan is to serve.
The effect of the people’s agreeing that there must be central planning,
without agreeing on the ends, will be rather as if a group of people
were to commit themselves to take a journey together without agreeing
where they want to go: with the result that they may all have to make a
journey which most of them do not want at all. That planning creates a
situation in which it is necessary for us to agree on a much larger
number of topics than we have been used to, and that in a planned system
we cannot confine collective action to the tasks on which we can agree
but are forced to produce agreement on everything in order that any
action can be taken at all, is one of the features which contributes
more than most to determining the character of a planned system.</p>
<p>It may be the unanimously expressed will of the people that its
parliament should prepare a comprehensive economic plan, yet neither the
people nor its representatives need therefore be able to agree on any
particular plan. The inability of democratic assemblies to carry out
what seems to be a clear mandate of the people will inevitably cause
dissatisfaction with democratic institutions. Parliaments come to be
regarded as ineffective “talking shops,” unable or incompetent to carry
out the tasks for which they have been chosen. The conviction grows that
if efficient planning is to be done, the direction must be “taken out of
politics” and placed in the hands of experts—permanent officials or
independent autonomous bodies.</p>
<p>The difficulty is well known to socialists. It will soon be half a
century since the Webbs began to complain of “the increased incapacity
of the House of Commons to cope with its work.”3 More recently,
Professor Laski has elaborated the argument:</p>
<p>“It is common ground that the present parliamentary machine is quite
unsuited to pass rapidly a great body of complicated legislation. The
National Government, indeed, has in substance admitted this by
implementing its economy and tariff measures not by detailed debate in
the House of Commons but by a wholesale system of delegated legislation.
A Labour Government would, I presume, build upon the amplitude of this
precedent. It would confine the House of Commons to the two functions it
can properly perform: the ventilation of grievances and the discussion
of general principles of its measures. Its Bills would take the form of
general formulae conferring wide powers on the appropriate government
departments; and those powers would be exercised by Order in Council
which could, if desired, be attacked in the House by means of a vote of
no confidence. The necessity and value of delegated legislation has
recently been strongly reaffirmed by the Donoughmore Committee; and its
extension is inevitable if the process of socialisation is not to be
wrecked by the normal methods of obstruction which existing
parliamentary procedure sanctions.”</p>
<p>And to make it quite clear that a socialist government must not allow
itself to be too much fettered by democratic procedure, Professor Laski
at the end of the same article raised the question “whether in a period
of transition to Socialism, a Labour Government can risk the overthrow
of its measures as a result of the next general election”—and left it
significantly unanswered.4</p>
<p>It is important clearly to see the causes of this admitted
ineffectiveness of parliaments when it comes to a detailed
administration of the economic affairs of a nation. The fault is neither
with the individual representatives nor with parliamentary institutions
as such but with the contradictions inherent in the task with which they
are charged. They are not asked to act where they can agree, but to
produce agreement on everything—the whole direction of the resources of
the nation. For such a task the system of majority decision is, however,
not suited. Majorities will be found where it is a choice between
limited alternatives; but it is a superstition to believe that there
must be a majority view on everything. There is no reason why there
should be a majority in favor of any one of the different possible
courses of positive action if their number is legion. Every member of
the legislative assembly might prefer some particular plan for the
direction of economic activity to no plan, yet no one plan may appear
preferable to a majority to no plan at all.</p>
<p>Nor can a coherent plan be achieved by breaking it up into parts and
voting on particular issues. A democratic assembly voting and amending a
comprehensive economic plan clause by clause, as it deliberates on an
ordinary bill, makes nonsense. An economic plan, to deserve the name,
must have a unitary conception. Even if a parliament could, proceeding
step by step, agree on some scheme, it would certainly in the end
satisfy nobody. A complex whole in which all the parts must be most
carefully adjusted to each other cannot be achieved through a compromise
between conflicting views. To draw up an economic plan in this fashion
is even less possible than, for example, successfully to plan a military
campaign by democratic procedure. As in strategy it would become
inevitable to delegate the task to the experts.</p>
<p>Yet the difference is that, while the general who is put in charge of
a campaign is given a single end to which, for the duration of the
campaign, all the means under his control have to be exclusively
devoted, there can be no such single goal given to the economic planner,
and no similar limitation of the means imposed upon him. The general has
not got to balance different independent aims against each other; there
is for him only one supreme goal. But the ends of an economic plan, or
of any part of it, cannot be defined apart from the particular plan. It
is the essence of the economic problem that the making of an economic
plan involves the choice between conflicting or competing ends—different
needs of different people. But which ends do so conflict, which will
have to be sacrificed if we want to achieve certain others, in short,
which are the alternatives between which we must choose, can only be
known to those who know all the facts; and only they, the experts, are
in a position to decide which of the different ends are to be given
preference. It is inevitable that they should impose their scale of
preferences on the community for which they plan.</p>
<p>This is not always clearly recognized, and delegation is usually
justified by the technical character of the task. But this does not mean
that only the technical detail is delegated, or even that the inability
of parliaments to understand the technical detail is the root of the
difficulty.5 Alterations in the structure of civil law are no less
technical and no more difficult to appreciate in all their implications;
yet nobody has yet seriously suggested that legislation there should be
delegated to a body of experts. The fact is that in these fields
legislation does not go beyond general rules on which true majority
agreement can be achieved, while in the direction of economic activity
the interests to be reconciled are so divergent that no true agreement
is likely to be reached in a democratic assembly.</p>
<p>It should be recognized, however, that it is not the delegation of
law-making power as such which is so objectionable. To oppose delegation
as such is to oppose a symptom instead of the cause and, as it may be a
necessary result of other causes, to weaken the case. So long as the
power that is delegated is merely the power to make general rules, there
may be very good reasons why such rules should be laid down by local
rather than by the central authority. The objectionable feature is that
delegation is so often resorted to because the matter in hand cannot be
regulated by general rules but only by the exercise of discretion in the
decision of particular cases. In these instances delegation means that
some authority is given power to make with the force of law what to all
intents and purposes are arbitrary decisions (usually described as
“judging the case on its merits”).</p>
<p>The delegation of particular technical tasks to separate bodies,
while a regular feature, is yet only the first step in the process
whereby a democracy which embarks on planning progressively relinquishes
its powers. The expedient of delegation cannot really remove the causes
which make all the advocates of comprehensive planning so impatient with
the impotence of democracy. The delegation of particular powers to
separate agencies creates a new obstacle to the achievement of a single
coordinated plan. Even if, by this expedient, a democracy should succeed
in planning every sector of economic activity, it would still have to
face the problem of integrating these separate plans into a unitary
whole. Many separate plans do not make a planned whole—in fact, as the
planners ought to be the first to admit, they may be worse than no plan.
But the democratic legislature will long hesitate to relinquish the
decisions on really vital issues, and so long as it does so it makes it
impossible for anyone else to provide the comprehensive plan. Yet
agreement that planning is necessary, together with the inability of
democratic assemblies to produce a plan, will evoke stronger and
stronger demands that the government or some single individual should be
given powers to act on their own responsibility. The belief is becoming
more and more widespread that, if things are to get done, the
responsible authorities must be freed from the fetters of democratic
procedure.</p>
<p>The cry for an economic dictator is a characteristic stage in the
movement toward planning. It is now several years since one of the most
acute of foreign students of England, the late Élie Halévy, suggested
that, “if you take a composite photograph of Lord Eustace Percy, Sir
Oswald Mosley, and Sir Stafford Cripps, I think you would find this
common feature—you would find them all agreeing to say: ‘We are living
in economic chaos and we cannot get out of it except under some kind of
dictatorial leadership.’”6 The number of influential public men whose
inclusion would not materially alter the features of the “composite
photograph” has since grown considerably.</p>
<p>In Germany, even before Hitler came into power, the movement had
already progressed much further. It is important to remember that, for
some time before 1933, Germany had reached a stage in which it had, in
effect, had to be governed dictatorially. Nobody could then doubt that
for the time being democracy had broken down and that sincere democrats
like Brüning were no more able to govern democratically than Schleicher
or von Papen.7 Hitler did not have to destroy democracy; he merely took
advantage of the decay of democracy and at the critical moment obtained
the support of many to whom, though they detested Hitler, he yet seemed
the only man strong enough to get things done.</p>
<p>The argument by which the planners usually try to reconcile us with
this development is that, so long as democracy retains ultimate control,
the essentials of democracy are not affected. Thus Karl Mannheim
writes:</p>
<p>“The only [sic] way in which a planned society differs from that of
the nineteenth century is that more and more spheres of social life, and
ultimately each and all of them, are subjected to state control. But if
a few controls can be held in check by parliamentary sovereignty, so can
many. . . . In a democratic state sovereignty can be boundlessly
strengthened by plenary powers without renouncing democratic
control.”8</p>
<p>This belief overlooks a vital distinction. Parliament can, of course,
control the execution of tasks where it can give definite directions,
where it has first agreed on the aim and merely delegates the
working-out of the detail. The situation is entirely different when the
reason for the delegation is that there is no real agreement on the
ends, when the body charged with the planning has to choose between ends
of whose conflict parliament is not even aware, and when the most that
can be done is to present to it a plan which has to be accepted or
rejected as a whole. There may and probably will be criticism; but as no
majority can agree on an alternative plan, and the parts objected to can
almost always be represented as essential parts of the whole, it will
remain quite ineffective. Parliamentary discussion may be retained as a
useful safety valve and even more as a convenient medium through which
the official answers to complaints are disseminated. It may even prevent
some flagrant abuses and successfully insist on particular shortcomings
being remedied. But it cannot direct. It will at best be reduced to
choosing the persons who are to have practically absolute power. The
whole system will tend toward that plebiscitarian dictatorship in which
the head of the government is from time to time confirmed in his
position by popular vote, but where he has all the powers at his command
to make certain that the vote will go in the direction he desires.</p>
<p>It is the price of democracy that the possibilities of conscious
control are restricted to the fields where true agreement exists and
that in some fields things must be left to chance. But in a society
which for its functioning depends on central planning this control
cannot be made dependent on a majority’s being able to agree; it will
often be necessary that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the
people, because this minority will be the largest group able to agree
among themselves on the question at issue. Democratic government has
worked successfully where, and so long as, the functions of government
were, by a widely accepted creed, restricted to fields where agreement
among a majority could be achieved by free discussion; and it is the
great merit of the liberal creed that it reduced the range of subjects
on which agreement was necessary to one on which it was likely to exist
in a society of free men. It is now often said that democracy will not
tolerate “capitalism.” If “capitalism” means here a competitive system
based on free disposal over private property, it is far more important
to realize that only within this system is democracy possible. When it
becomes dominated by a collectivist creed, democracy will inevitably
destroy itself.</p>
<p>We have no intention, however, of making a fetish of democracy. It
may well be true that our generation talks and thinks too much of
democracy and too little of the values which it serves. It cannot be
said of democracy, as Lord Acton truly said of liberty, that it “is not
a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political
end. It is not for the sake of a good public administration that it is
required, but for the security in the pursuit of the highest objects of
civil society, and of private life.”9 Democracy is essentially a means,
a utilitarian device for safeguarding internal peace and individual
freedom. As such it is by no means infallible or certain. Nor must we
forget that there has often been much more cultural and spiritual
freedom under an autocratic rule than under some democracies—and it is
at least conceivable that under the government of a very homogeneous and
doctrinaire majority democratic government might be as oppressive as the
worst dictatorship. Our point, however, is not that dictatorship must
inevitably extirpate freedom but rather that planning leads to
dictatorship because dictatorship is the most effective instrument of
coercion and the enforcement of ideals and, as such, essential if
central planning on a large scale is to be possible. The clash between
planning and democracy arises simply from the fact that the latter is an
obstacle to the suppression of freedom which the direction of economic
activity requires. But in so far as democracy ceases to be a guaranty of
individual freedom, it may well persist in some form under a
totalitarian regime. A true “dictatorship of the proletariat,” even if
democratic in form, if it undertook centrally to direct the economic
system, would probably destroy personal freedom as completely as any
autocracy has ever done.</p>
<p>The fashionable concentration on democracy as the main value
threatened is not without danger. It is largely responsible for the
misleading and unfounded belief that, so long as the ultimate source of
power is the will of the majority, the power cannot be arbitrary. The
false assurance which many people derive from this belief is an
important cause of the general unawareness of the dangers which we face.
There is no justification for the belief that, so long as power is
conferred by democratic procedure, it cannot be arbitrary; the contrast
suggested by this statement is altogether false: it is not the source
but the limitation of power which prevents it from being arbitrary.
Democratic control may prevent power from becoming arbitrary, but it
does not do so by its mere existence. If democracy resolves on a task
which necessarily involves the use of power which cannot be guided by
fixed rules, it must become arbitrary power.</p>

<p>4 H. J. Laski, “Labour and the Constitution,” New Statesman and
Nation, N.S., no. 81, September 10, 1932, p. 277. In a book Democracy in
Crisis (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1933),
p. 87 in which Professor Laski later elaborated these ideas, his
determination that parliamentary democracy must not be allowed to form
an obstacle to the realization of socialism is even more plainly
expressed: not only would a socialist government “take vast powers and
legislate under them by ordinance and decree” and “suspend the classic
formulae of normal opposition” but the “continuance of parliamentary
government would depend on its [i.e., the Labour government’s]
possession of guarantees from the Conservative Party that its work of
transformation would not be disrupted by repeal in the event of its
defeat at the polls”!</p>
<p>As Professor Laski invokes the authority of the Donoughmore
Committee, it may be worth recalling that Professor Laski was a member
of that committee and presumably one of the authors of its report. [The
Donoughmore Committee on Ministers’ Powers was set up to investigate the
implications of the expansion of delegated legislation; that is,
legislation that is enacted by ministers in order to carry out primary
legislation that is passed by Parliament. Hayek makes further reference
to its findings in the next note. —Ed.]</p>
<p>5 It is instructive in this connection briefly to refer to the
government document in which in recent years these problems have been
discussed. As long as thirteen years ago, that is before England finally
abandoned economic liberalism, the process of delegating legislative
powers had already been carried to a point where it was felt necessary
to appoint a committee to investigate “what safeguards are desirable or
necessary to secure the sovereignty of Law.” In its report the
Donoughmore Committee (Report of the [Lord Chancellor’s] Committee in
Ministers’ Powers, Cmd. 4060 [1932]) showed that even at that date
Parliament had resorted “to the practice of wholesale and indiscriminate
delegation” but regarded this (it was before we had really glanced into
the totalitarian abyss!) as an inevitably and relatively innocuous
development. And it is probably true that delegation as such need not be
a danger to freedom. The interesting point is why delegation had become
necessary on such a scale. First place among the causes enumerated in
the report is given to the fact that “Parliament nowadays passes so many
laws every year” and that “much of the detail is so technical as to be
unsuitable for Parliamentary discussion.” But if this were all there
would be no reason why the detail should not be worked out before rather
than after Parliament passes a law. What is probably in many cases a
much more important reason why, “if Parliament were not willing to
delegate law-making power, Parliament would be unable to pass the kind
and quantity of legislation which public opinion requires” is innocently
revealed in the little sentence that “many of the laws affect people’s
lives so closely that elasticity is essential”! What does this mean if
not conferment of arbitrary power—power limited by no fixed principles
and which in the opinion of Parliament cannot be limited by definite and
unambiguous rules?</p>
<p>6 Élie Halévy, “Socialism and the Problem of Democratic
Parliamentarianism,” International Affairs, vol. 13, July 1934, p. 501.
[The article was an address given on April 24, 1934, at Chatham House,
which since 1920 has been the base for the Royal Institute of
International Affairs. French historian Élie Halévy (1870–1937) was the
author of The Growth of Philosophical Radicalism, which traced the
emergence of British utilitarianism, and The Era of Tyrannies, from
which Hayek drew the opening quotation that begins chapter 3. English
statesman Lord Eustace Percy (1887–1958) wrote such books as Democracy
on Trial and The Heresy of Democracy. English politician Sir Oswald
Mosley (1896–1980) began as a conservative, then switched to the Labour
party, becoming an MP and a member of the 1929 Labour government, and
finally resigned to become the leader of the British Union of Fascists.
Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps (1889–1952) veered increasingly to
the left in the 1930s, and was ultimately ousted from the party in 1939
for his activities with the Popular Front. Percy, Mosley, and Cripps,
then, represented different ends of the political spectrum, yet as Hayek
and Halévy noted, they had on certain issues expressed very similar
views. —Ed.]</p>
<p>7 [German statesman Heinrich Brüning (1885–1970) was the chancellor
of Germany from 1930 to 1932, when he was forced to resign by the Nazis.
He left Germany two years later. Franz von Papen (1879–1969) took over
as chancellor in 1932, and under Hitler served briefly as
vice-chancellor, and later as ambassador to Austria and to Turkey. Kurt
von Schleicher (1882–1934) succeeded von Papen as chancellor, but Hitler
seized power from him in 1933. He and his wife were tried on trumped up
charges and executed by the Nazis the next year. —Ed.]</p>
