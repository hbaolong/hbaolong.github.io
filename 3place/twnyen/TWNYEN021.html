<p>RELATED DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>Nazi-Socialism1</p>
<p>Spring 1933</p>
<p>Incomprehensible as the recent events in Germany must seem to anyone
who has known that country chiefly in the democratic post-war years, any
attempt fully to understand these developments must treat them as the
culmination of tendencies which date back to a period long before the
Great War. Nothing could be more superficial than to consider the forces
which dominate the Germany of today as reactionary—in the sense that
they want a return to the social and economic order of 1914. The
persecution of the Marxists, and of democrats in general, tends to
obscure the fundamental fact that National Socialism is a genuine
socialist movement, whose leading ideas are the final fruit of the
anti-liberal tendencies which have been steadily gaining ground in
Germany since the later part of the Bismarckian era, and which led the
majority of the German intelligentsia first to “socialism of the chair”
and later to Marxism in its social-democratic or communist form.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why the socialist character of National
Socialism has been quite generally unrecognized, is, no doubt, its
alliance with the nationalist groups which represent the great
industries and the great landowners. But this merely proves that these
groups too—as they have since learnt to their bitter
disappointment—have, at least partly, been mistaken as to the nature of
the movement. But only partly because— and this is the most
characteristic feature of modern Germany—many capitalists are themselves
strongly influenced by socialistic ideas, and have not sufficient belief
in capitalism to defend it with a clear conscience. But, in spite of
this, the German entrepreneur class have manifested almost incredible
short-sightedness in allying themselves with a movement of whose strong
anti-capitalistic tendencies there should never have been any doubt.</p>
<p>A careful observer must always have been aware that the opposition of
the Nazis to the established socialist parties, which gained them the
sympathy of the entrepreneur, was only to a very small extent directed
against their economic policy. What the Nazis mainly objected to was
their internationalism and all the aspects of their cultural programme
which were still influenced by liberal ideas. But the accusations
against the social-democrats and the communists which were most
effective in their propaganda were not so much directed against their
programme as against their supposed practice— their corruption and
nepotism, and even their alleged alliance with “the golden International
of Jewish Capitalism.”</p>
<p>It would, indeed, hardly have been possible for the Nationalists to
advance fundamental objections to the economic policy of the other
socialist parties when their own published programme differed from these
only in that its socialism was much cruder and less rational. The famous
25 points drawn up by Herr Feder,2 one of Hitler’s early allies,
repeatedly endorsed by Hitler and recognised by the by-laws of the
National-Socialist party as the immutable basis of all its actions,
which together with an extensive commentary is circulating throughout
Germany in many hundreds of thousands of copies, is full of ideas
resembling those of the early socialists. But the dominant feature is a
fierce hatred of anything capitalistic—individualistic profit seeking,
large scale enterprise, banks, joint-stock companies, department stores,
“international finance and loan capital,” the system of “interest
slavery” in general; the abolition of these is described as the
“(indecipherable) of the programme, around which everything else turns.”
It was to this programme that the masses of the German people, who were
already completely under the influence of collectivist ideas, responded
so enthusiastically.</p>
<p>That this violent anti-capitalistic attack is genuine—and not a mere
piece of propaganda becomes as clear from the personal history of the
intellectual leaders of the movement as from the general milieu from
which it springs. It is not even denied that many of the young men who
today play a prominent part in it have previously been communists or
socialists. And to any observer of the literary tendencies which made
the German intelligentsia ready to join the ranks of the new party, it
must be clear that the common characteristic of all the politically
influential writers—in many cases free from definite party
affiliations—was their anti-liberal and anti-capitalist trend. Groups
like that formed around the review “Die Tat” have made the phrase “the
end of capitalism” an accepted dogma to most young Germans.3</p>
<p>That the movement is more anti-liberal than anything else is closely
connected with another important aspect of it—the anti-rational,
mystical and romantic sentiment, which has been growing for years among
the youth of Germany. The protest against “liberal intellectualism”
which was recently so strongly voiced by the students of the University
of Berlin, was not an isolated aberration but a true expression of the
feeling of great masses of the people.4 It would be too long a story to
go into all the different intellectual sources of these anti-rational
tendencies in art and literature which have all converged—often to the
amazement and consternation of their originators—in the Nazi movement.
But it must be said that here again the main influence which destroyed
the belief in the universality and unity of human reason was Marx’
teaching of the class-conditioned nature of our thinking, of the
difference between bourgeois and proletarian logic, which needed only to
be applied to other social groups such as nations or races, to supply
the weapon now used against rationalism as such. How completely this
Marxian idea has permeated German thought can be seen from the fact
that, during the past few years, it has actually been promoted, as
“sociology of knowledge” to the rank of a new branch of learning.5 It is
obvious that, from this intellectual relativism, which denied the
existence of truths which could be recognised independently of race,
nation, or class, there was only a step to the position which puts
sentiment above rational thinking.</p>
<p>That anti-liberalism and anti-rationalism are so intimately bound up
with one another is easy to understand, and is, in fact, inevitable. If
rule by force by some privileged group is to be justified, its
superiority has to be accepted for it cannot be proved. But what is less
easily understood—thought of immense importance—is the fact illustrated
by German and Russian developments that the anti-liberalism which, when
confined to the economic field, today has the sympathy of almost all the
rest of the world, leads inevitably to a reign of universal compulsion,
to intolerance and the suppression of intellectual freedom. The inherent
logic of collectivism makes it impossible to confine it to a limited
sphere. Beyond certain limits collective action in the interest of all
can only be made possible if all can be coerced into accepting as their
common interest what those in power take it to be. At that point,
coercion must extend to the individuals’ ultimate aims and ideas and
must attempt to bring everyone’s Weltanschauung into line with the ideas
of the rulers.</p>
<p>The collectivist and anti-individualist character of German National
Socialism is not much modified by the fact that it is not a proletarian
but a middle class socialism, and that it is, in consequence, inclined
to favour the small artisan and shop keeper and to set the limit up to
which it recognises private property somewhat higher than does
communism. In the first instance, it will probably nominally recognise
private property in general. But private initiative will probably be
hedged about with restrictions on competition so that little freedom
will remain. Artisans, shop-keepers and professional men will, in all
likelihood, be organised in guilds, like those of the mediaeval crafts,
which will regulate their activities. In the case of the wealthier
capitalists, state control and restriction of income will leave little
more than the name of property, even while the intention of correcting
the undue accumulation of wealth in the hands of individuals has not yet
been carried out. Even at the present moment, state commissioners have
been put in charge of many important industries and, if the more radical
wing of the party has its way, the same is likely to happen in many
other cases.6 At the present time, when the National Socialist party has
grown to such an enormous size, and accordingly embraces elements with
very divergent views, it is, of course, difficult to say which view will
predominate. But if, as seems increasingly probable, the more radical
views on economic policy hold the field, it will mean that the scare of
Russian communism has driven the German people unawares into something
which differs from communism in little but name. Indeed, it is more than
probable that the real meaning of the German revolution is that the long
dreaded expansion of communism into the heart of Europe has taken place
but is not recognised because the fundamental similarity of methods and
ideas is hidden by the difference in the phraseology and the privileged
groups. For the present, the German people have reacted against the
treatment received from the community of democratic and capitalistic
countries by leaving that community.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, would be less justifiable than that the nations of
western Europe should look down on the German people because they have
fallen victims to which, in this country, seems a kind of barbarism.
What must be realised is that this is only the ultimate and necessary
outcome of a process of development in which the other nations have been
for a long time steadily following Germany—albeit at a considerable
distance. The gradual extension of the field of state activity, the
increase in restrictions on international movements of both men and
goods, sympathy with central economic planning and the widespread
playing with dictatorship ideas, all tend in this direction. In Germany,
where these things had gone furthest, an intellectual reaction, which
will now hardly survive, had been definitely under way. The fact that
the character of the present movement is so generally misjudged makes it
seem likely that the reaction in other countries will speed up, rather
than weaken, the operation of these tendencies which lead in the
direction in which Germany is now going. So far, there seems little
prospect that the reversal of these intellectual tendencies elsewhere
will come in time to prevent other countries from following Germany in
this last step also.</p>
<p>Reader’s Report by Frank Knight 7</p>
<p>December 10, 1943</p>
<p>To: General Editor and Committee on Publication, University of
Chicago Press From: Frank H. Knight</p>
<p>The Road to Serfdom, by F. A. Hayek, is a masterly performance of the
job it undertakes. That job is to show by general and historical
reasoning, the latter primarily with reference to the course of events
in Germany, two things: first, that any such policy as socialism, or
planned economy, will inevitably lead to totalitarianism and
dictatorship; and second that such a social order will inevitably fall
under the control of “the worst” individuals. The argument is naturally
political rather than economic, except in the indirect sense that the
problems solved, the functions performed, by the open-market system of
organization are economic and they cannot be solved, or performed by
government under a free political order, nor the open-market system
itself maintained under a democratic political regime. There is little
or no economic theory in the book. The fifteen short chapters ably
describe the old liberalism and contrast it with current tendencies
which are virtually antithetical and discuss such problems as
individualism, democracy, the rule of law, security and freedom, the
place of truth in political and social life, the relation between
material conditions and ideal ends, and the problem of international
order.</p>
<p>When I say that the argument is well stated, compact and conclusive,
I should add that the position defended is in accord with my conviction
before reading this work. Highly intelligent opinion can be found
against this view and it might be well to get a report from someone who
holds this contrary position. Such persons are to be found in this
faculty and in the Economics Department.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of desirability of publishing the book in this
country, I may note some grounds for doubt. The author is an Austrian
refugee, a very able economist, who has been a professor at the London
School of Economics since the middle thirties. He writes from a
distinctly English point of view, and frequently uses the expression
“this country” with that reference. While there is some treatment of
American conditions, and citation of American writings, this is
secondary in scope and emphasis. This fact in itself might limit the
appeal in “this country” to a fairly cultivated, even academic, circle
of readers. Moreover, the whole discussion is pitched at a quite high
intellectual and scholarly level and the amount of knowledge of central
European conditions and history assumed is rather large for even the
educated American audience. It is hardly a “popular” book from this
point of view.</p>
<p>In addition, there are limitations in connection with the treatment
itself, both as to the theoretical and the historical argument. In the
latter connection, the work is essentially negative. It hardly considers
the problem of alternatives, and inadequately recognizes the necessity,
as well as political inevitability, of a wide range of governmental
activity in relation to economic life in the future. It deals only with
the simpler fallacies, unreasonable demands and romantic prejudices
which underlie the popular clamor for governmental control in place of
free enterprise. It does not discuss the problems set by the serious
shortcomings of an economic system based on the degree of economic
freedom which was regarded as desirable and was allowed, say, around the
turn of the century. And it does not attack fallacies in a very dramatic
way, in comparison with the character of the thinking and argument on
which they are actually based.</p>
<p>The author’s treatment of the course of events leading to the Nazi
dictatorship in Germany also strikes me as open to attack on the ground
of over-simplification. He practically attributes everything to the
Socialist movement and state paternalism toward labor and industry,
including the cultivation of an attitude of contempt for business
enterprise, in comparison with esteem for bureaucratic status on a
salary. He explicitly relegates the militaristic tradition to a minor
role. It seems to me that there are many factors in German history which
would call for consideration in a balanced treatment. One thinks of the
late survival of feudalism, retarding of national unification and
industrialization, and the special circumstances surrounding these
changes and the establishment of responsible government after the first
World War. These last surely had much to do with the breakdown of
parliamentarism, an undoubted fact and a vital factor in the
establishment of the Hitler regime. I recall only a brief mention of
anti-Semitism, which has a long history in Germany. These matters do not
in my own mind invalidate the author’s general conclusion but they
weaken the argument as a presentation of his case.</p>
<p>In sum, the book is an able piece of work, but limited in scope and
somewhat one-sided in treatment. I doubt whether it would have a very
wide market in this country, or would change the position of many
readers.</p>
<p>Reader’s Report by Jacob Marschak 8</p>
<p>December 20, 1943</p>
<p>The current discussion between advocates and adversaries of free
enterprise has not been conducted so far on a very high level. Hayek’s
book may start in this country a more scholarly kind of debate.</p>
<p>The book will appeal to friends of free enterprise and give them new
material: Hayek’s interpretation of the modern English scene (labor and
industrial monopolist driving jointly toward a collective economy) will
be new to all American readers except those who have read or listened to
William Benton’s impressions; while Hayek’s German background enables
him to give new support to the contention that socialism is the father
of Nazism.</p>
<p>Those who are not convinced in advance of Hayek’s thesis will
probably learn from his argument even more than those who are. Hayek
(Chapter IV) has a wholesome contempt for the quasi-scientific method of
“trends,” “waves of tomorrow.” Those who love planning because they love
the inevitable will, perhaps, after reading Hayek revise either their
faith or their tastes. Perhaps they will start to think in terms of ends
and means instead of in prophecies.</p>
<p>It is true that Hayek himself gives little food for such concrete
thinking. As he says himself at the end of the book (pages 177, 179)9
the book is almost exclusively critical not constructive. Its technique
is black-and-white. It is impatient of compromises (page 31). It is
written with the passion and the burning clarity of a great doctrinaire.
Hayek has the sincerity of one who has had the vision of a danger which
the others have not seen. He warns his fellowmen with loving
impatience.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the best chapters of the book are negative or formal.
There is an excellent and truly inspiring chapter on the “Rule of Law”
(Chapter VI); but Hayek has little to say as to how the Rule of Law
(i.e., the avoidance of administrative decisions ad hoc) might be
applied to create instruments for mitigating unemployment by monetary
means, or for combating monopolists. On such points he gives only vague
hints (page 90, 147). Since in this country the terms “plan” and
“socialism” have often been used to include monetary and fiscal
policies, social security, and even progressive income tax the American
reader will possibly expect from Hayek a more concrete demarcation
between what the book calls “planning in the good sense” and the
(undesirable) planning proper. In fact, the non-economic chapters (that
on “The End of Truth,” for example) are more impressive than the
economic ones.</p>
<p>Those who read Walter Lippmann, Stuart Chase,10 or the Fortune’s
discussions on the postwar world will also read Hayek. He is often less
concrete than Lippmann or Chase; but his thinking is somewhat sharper,
just because it is more abstract. Hayek’s style is readable and
occasionally inspiring.</p>
<p>This book cannot be by-passed.</p>
<p>J. Marschak</p>
<p>Foreword to the 1944 American Edition by John Chamberlain</p>
<p>The shibboleths of our times are expressed in a variety of terms:
“full employment,” “planning,” “social security,” “freedom from want.”
The facts of our times suggest that none of these things can be had when
they are made conscious objects of government policy. They are the
fool’s-gold words. In Italy they debauched a people and led to death
under the burning African suns. In Russia there was the first Five-Year
Plan; there was also the liquidation of the three million kulaks. In
Germany there was full employment between 1935 and 1939; but six hundred
thousand Jews are now deprived of their property, scattered to the ends
of the earth, or lying in mass graves in the Polish forests. And in
America the pump never quite filled up after the successive primings;
war alone saved the politicians of “full employment.”</p>
<p>To date, only a handful of writers has dared to trace a connection
between our shibboleths and the terror that haunts the modern world.
Among these writers is F. A. Hayek, an Austrian economist now living in
England. Having watched the congealing of the German, the Italian, and
the Danubian social and economic systems, Hayek is horrified to see the
English succumbing by degrees to the controlled-economy ideas of the
German Walter Rathenau, the Italian syndicalists—yes, and Adolf Hitler,
who had the courage to draw conclusions from the less forthright statism
of his predecessors.11 This book of Hayek’s—The Road to Serfdom—is a
warning, a cry in a time of hesitation. It says to the British and by
implication to Americans: Stop, look and listen.</p>
<p>The Road to Serfdom is sober, logical, severe. It does not make for
ingratiating reading. But the logic is incontestable: “full employment,”
“social security,” and “freedom from want” cannot be had unless they
come as by-products of a system that releases the free energies of
individuals. When “society” and the “good of the whole” and “the
greatest good of the greatest number” are made the overmastering
touchstones of state action, no individual can plan his own existence.
For the state “planners” must arrogate to themselves the right to move
in on any sector of the economic system if the good of “society” or the
“general welfare” is paramount. If the rights of the individual get in
the way, the rights of the individual must go.</p>
<p>The threat of state “dynamism” results in a vast, usually unconscious
fear among all producing interests that still retain a conditional
freedom of action. And the fear affects the springs of action. Men must
try to outguess the government as yesterday they tried to outguess the
market. But there is this difference; the market factors obeyed at least
relatively objective laws, while governments are subject to a good deal
of whim. One can stake one’s future on a judgment that reckons with
inventories, market saturation points, the interest rate, the trend
curves of buyers’ desires. But how can an individual outguess a
government whose aim is to suspend the objective laws of the market
whenever and wherever it wishes to do so in the name of “planning”?
Shrewdly, Peter Drucker once remarked that the “planners” are all
improvisers.12 They create not certainty but uncertainty—for
individuals. And, as Hayek demonstrates, the end result of this
uncertainty is civil war, or the dictatorship that averts civil war.</p>
<p>The alternative to “planning” is the “rule of law.” Hayek is no
devotee of laissez faire; he believes in a design for an enterprise
system. Design is compatible with minimum-wage standards, health
standards, a minimum amount of compulsory social insurance. It is even
compatible with certain types of government investment. But the point is
that the individual must know, in advance, just how the rules are going
to work. He cannot plan his own business, his own future, even his own
family affairs, if the “dynamism” of a central planning authority hangs
over his head.</p>
<p>In some respects Hayek is more “English” than the modern English. He
belongs, with modifications, to the great Manchester line, not to the
school of the Webbs.13 It may be that he is also more “American” than
the modern Americans. If so, one can only wish for the widest possible
United States audience for The Road to Serfdom.</p>

<p>Letter from John Scoon to C. Hartley Grattan14</p>
<p>Hayek: THE ROAD TO SERFDOM</p>
<p>May 2, 1945</p>
<p>Mr. C. Hartley Grattan</p>
<p>6 White Hall Road</p>
<p>Tuckahoe, New York</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Grattan:</p>
<p>I have been in the office about five minutes a day since I returned
to Chicago, or you certainly would have heard from me before this. The
reviews were sent to you over a week ago, however, and for your purposes
they tell the main story.</p>
<p>THE ROAD TO SERFDOM came to us in December 1943, was read by two
scholarly readers outside of the Press, and was approved by our
Publications Committee (made up of faculty members from various
departments of the University) at the end of that month. It was in page
proofs when we first saw it, and about to be published by Routledge in
England. The idea of the Press’s publishing it in this country was
suggested by a member of the Department of Economics at the University
who had previously known Hayek and his work;15 almost simultaneously
another friend of the author’s,16 once at the University but then in
Washington with the government, suggested the book to us and got us the
page proofs.</p>
<p>The first report, a copy of which I am enclosing marked “A,” was from
a man who is very reliable, pretty middle-of-the-road in his political
stand, and respected by both sides. He says in his report that he was on
Hayek’s side in this matter even before reading the book, so he
recommended that we get another report from the opposition. This we did,
and the report labeled “B” came from one of the most definitely
“progressive” economists in the country, whose name you would recognize
immediately if it were not our long-standing policy never to reveal
readers’ names. In other words, we simply could not have given the book
a more objective trial: we didn’t know a thing about it at that time, so
we got reports from two opposing points of view and then laid them
before a committee composed of thirteen men of differing shades of
opinion. They approved publication of the book by the Press.</p>
<p>That was all before Mr. Brandt and I came to the Press at the
beginning of January, 1944. We found this project in the vault with many
others, part of the probable program for the year just beginning then.
As the Press started to make up its new list, THE ROAD TO SERFDOM looked
far from world-shaking. Then we read the page proofs ourselves, and
decided to ask the author to be specific about the book’s application to
the United States, explicitly mentioning this country where he included
it in his thought instead of slanting the book directly at an audience
limited to England—“making no promises as to publication which might
influence his judgment on this point,” my memo read. It went on to say:
“If he agrees, let’s take it on. It will stir up trouble, but the author
has a point and evidently has had excellent experience.” (I should
explain here that the committee’s “approval” of a manuscript is not
mandatory, so the question of publication had not yet been completely
decided.)</p>
<p>This process was agreed upon by all parties, and we, a colleague of
the author’s,17 and Mr. Hayek himself all set to work suggesting
possible revisions. Specific changes were eventually agreed upon,
Mr. Hayek of course having the final say about what was added, what was
deleted, and the specific wording in each spot. Meanwhile we at the
Press were worrying about a possible new title, the sort of sales the
book would have (it was taken on purely as a scholarly work, and we knew
it would either fall pretty flat or catch on very widely), and how best
to introduce this work by a foreign author without much of a name in
this country. After much conferring we decided to leave the title (a
paraphrase of Bertrand Russell’s ROADS TO FREEDOM),18 to ask John
Chamberlain to write an introduction to the book, and to have a first
printing of 2,000 copies. This figure was definitely influenced by the
competition the book faced in the previously published OMNIPOTENT
GOVERNMENT, by Ludwig Von Mises, Hayek’s one-time teacher in
Vienna.19</p>
<p>About the time the contract for American rights was signed—the
beginning of April—we began to hear about the book in England, which had
been published there on March 10. The first printing in England was only
2,000, but it was sold out in about a month. It began to be quoted in
Parliament and in newspapers, and a few newspapers over here began
mentioning it now and then—but of course we were still uncertain as to
how it would appeal to the United States. As a matter of fact, right up
until publication date we couldn’t get a bookstore even in New York
excited about the book, although Joe Margolies, of Brentano’s, did allow
it some sales possibilities.</p>
<p>Into June the author was correcting our proofs, and publication,
which we had hoped for in July, was delayed until September 18, by which
time the English edition was in its third printing. We sent out more
advance copies and review copies than usual, and from the response we
knew that the book would have a good chance of catching on: the first
review that we saw was Orville Prescott’s in the NEW YORK TIMES of
September 20, which was neutral and called it “this sad and angry little
book,” but by the time we had seen Henry Hazlitt’s front page review in
the Sunday TIMES BOOK REVIEW we had ordered a second printing of 5,000
copies. In a few days we had requests for German, Spanish, Dutch and
other translation rights, and on September 27 we ordered a third
printing of 5,000 copies, upping it to 10,000 the next day. Requests for
magazine rights came from several sources, but the READER’S DIGEST was
first and made the best offer.</p>
<p>By the first week of October many stores were out of stock and we had
a tremendous and intricate job of printing, binding, shipping and
allotting to customers in both this country and Canada—by this time we
had made an arrangement with Routledge to take care of Canadian orders
too. From the start there was great enthusiasm for the book but the
sales went by ups and downs and our advertising agency had a real
headache getting space at the right times. A few book programs on the
radio boosted the book, toward the end of October, but we knew that its
sales would fall off after Christmas so we began casting about for
something to do with it this year. Mr. Brandt got the idea of bringing
Mr. Hayek over here; he called the departments of economics at several
universities about the possibility, and all were very enthusiastic. As
soon as definite arrangements had been made and it became known that
Mr. Hayek was coming to this country, organizations and individuals of
all sorts overwhelmed us with efforts to get hold of him and we had to
turn the trip over to the National Concert and Artists Corporation.</p>
<p>The rest of the story you know. The book, now in its seventh
printing, has sold nearly 50,000, but orders are coming in so fast that
we don’t know the exact total. Actually it has had one of the most
eccentric sales careers a book ever had, and it has been very difficult
to know what to do next with it: the DIGEST condensation caused a great
spurt, but the spurt did not hold—very likely because of the
Book-of-the-Month Club’s distribution of the condensation, which has now
reached a figure above 600,000.</p>
<p>Bitterness about the book has increased as time has gone by, rising
to new heights as the book has made more of an impression. (People still
tend to go off half-cocked about it; why don’t they read it and find out
what Hayek actually says!) You also know how the author feels about
this: one of his regrets is that in a way his conclusions are down on
paper, but not the process by which he arrived at them, and we are all
wondering whether some day we should not bring out a fully annotated
edition of the book. (This edition is being used as collateral reading
in political science and similar courses at a number of universities.)
Meanwhile Hayek has many other projects on hand, none of which we should
talk about now.</p>
<p>I hope that this will suffice for your needs—I have gathered the
material out of the files and may have lost something in perspective. If
there is anything more that you would like to know, we will try to
supply it.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Introduction to the 1994 Edition by Milton Friedman</p>
<p>This book has become a true classic: essential reading for everyone
who is seriously interested in politics in the broadest and least
partisan sense, a book whose central message is timeless, applicable to
a wide variety of concrete situations. In some ways it is even more
relevant to the United States today than it was when it created a
sensation on its original publication in 1944.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of a century ago (1971), I wrote an introduction to
a new German edition of The Road to Serfdom that illustrates how
timeless Hayek’s message is. That introduction is equally relevant to
this fiftieth anniversary edition of Hayek’s classic. Rather than
plagiarize myself, I herewith quote it in full before adding a few
additional comments.</p>
<p>“Over the years, I have made it a practice to inquire of believers in
individualism how they came to depart from the collectivist orthodoxy of
our times. For years, the most frequent answer was a reference to the
book for which I have the honor of writing this introduction. Professor
Hayek’s remarkable and vigorous tract was a revelation particularly to
the young men and women who had been in the armed forces during the war.
Their recent experience had enhanced their appreciation of the value and
meaning of individual freedom. In addition, they had observed a
collectivist organization in action. For them, Hayek’s predictions about
the consequences of collectivism were not simply hypothetical
possibilities but visible realities that they had themselves experienced
in the military.</p>
<p>“On rereading the book before writing this introduction, I was again
impressed with what a magnificent book it is—subtle and closely reasoned
yet lucid and clear, philosophical and abstract yet also concrete and
realistic, analytical and rational yet animated by high ideals and a
vivid sense of mission. Little wonder that it had so great an influence.
I was impressed also that its message is no less needed today than it
was when it first appeared—on this more later. But its message may not
be as immediate or as persuasive to today’s youth as to the young men
and women who read it when it first appeared. The problems of the war
and postwar adjustment that Hayek used to illustrate his timeless
central thesis, and the collectivist jargon of the time that he used to
document his assertions about the intellectual climate, were familiar to
the immediate postwar generation and established an immediate rapport
between author and reader. The same collectivist fallacies are abroad
and on the rise today, but the immediate issues are different and so is
much of the jargon. Today we hear little of ‘central planning,’ of
‘production for use,’ of the need for ‘conscious direction’ of society’s
resources. Instead the talk is of the urban crisis—solvable it is said
only by vastly expanded government programs; of the environmental
crisis—produced it is said by rapacious businessmen who must be forced
to discharge their social responsibility instead of ‘simply’ operating
their enterprises to make the most profit and requiring also, it is
said, vastly expanded government programs; of the consumer crisis—false
values stimulated by the selfsame rapacious businessmen seeking profits
instead of exercising social responsibility and of course also requiring
expanded government programs to protect the consumer, not least from
himself; of the welfare or poverty crisis—here the jargon is still
‘poverty in the midst of plenty,’ though what is now described as
poverty would have been regarded as plenty when that slogan was first
widely used.</p>
<p>“Now as then, the promotion of collectivism is combined with the
profession of individualist values. Indeed, experience with big
government has strengthened this discordant strand. There is wide
protest against the ‘establishment’; an incredible conformity in the
protest against conformity; a widespread demand for freedom to ‘do one’s
own thing,’ for individual lifestyles, for participatory democracy.
Listening to this strand, one might also believe that the collectivist
tide has turned, that individualism is again on the rise. As Hayek so
persuasively demonstrates, these values require an individualistic
society. They can be achieved only in a liberal order (I use the term
liberal, as Hayek does— in the original nineteenth-century sense of
limited government and free markets, not in the corrupted sense it has
acquired in the United States, in which it means almost the opposite),
in which government activity is limited primarily to establishing the
framework within which individuals are free to pursue their own
objectives. The free market is the only mechanism that has ever been
discovered for achieving participatory democracy.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the relation between the ends and the means remains
widely misunderstood. Many of those who profess the most individualistic
objectives support collectivist means without recognizing the
contradiction. It is tempting to believe that social evils arise from
the activities of evil men and that if only good men (like ourselves,
naturally) wielded power, all would be well. That view requires only
emotion and self-praise— easy to come by and satisfying as well. To
understand why it is that ‘good’ men in positions of power will produce
evil, while the ordinary man without power but able to engage in
voluntary cooperation with his neighbors will produce good, requires
analysis and thought, subordinating the emotions to the rational
faculty. Surely that is one answer to the perennial mystery of why
collectivism, with its demonstrated record of producing tyranny and
misery, is so widely regarded as superior to individualism, with its
demonstrated record of producing freedom and plenty. The argument for
collectivism is simple if false; it is an immediate emotional argument.
The argument for individualism is subtle and sophisticated; it is an
indirect rational argument. And the emotional faculties are more highly
developed in most men than the rational, paradoxically or especially
even in those who regard themselves as intellectuals.</p>
<p>“How stands the battle between collectivism and individualism in the
West more than a quarter of a century (now half a century) after the
publication of Hayek’s great tract? The answer is very different in the
world of affairs and in the world of ideas.</p>
<p>“In the world of affairs, those of us who were persuaded by Hayek’s
analysis saw few signs in 1945 of anything but a steady growth of the
state at the expense of the individual, a steady replacement of private
initiative and planning by state initiative and planning. Yet in
practice that movement did not go much farther—not in Britain or in
France or in the United States. And in Germany there was a sharp
reaction away from the totalitarian controls of the Nazi period and a
major move toward a liberal economic policy.</p>
<p>“What produced this unexpected check to collectivism? I believe that
two forces were primarily responsible. First, and this was particularly
important in Britain, the conflict between central planning and
individual liberty that is Hayek’s theme became patent, particularly
when the exigencies of central planning led to the so-called ‘control of
engagements’ order under which the government had the power to assign
people to occupations. The tradition of liberty, the liberal values,
were still sufficiently strong in Britain so that, when the conflict
occurred, central planning was sacrificed rather than individual
liberty. The second force checking collectivism was simply its
inefficiency. Government proved unable to manage enterprises, to
organize resources to achieve stated objectives at reasonable cost. It
became mired in bureaucratic confusion and inefficiency. Widespread
disillusionment set in about the effectiveness of centralized government
in administering programs.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the check to collectivism did not check the growth of
government; rather, it diverted its growth to a different channel. The
emphasis shifted from governmentally administered production activities
to indirect regulation of supposedly private enterprises and even more
to governmental transfer programs, involving extracting taxes from some
in order to make grants to others—all in the name of equality and the
eradication of poverty, but in practice producing an erratic and
contradictory mélange of subsidies to special interest groups. As a
result, the fraction of the national income being spent by governments
has continued to mount.</p>
<p>“In the world of ideas, the outcome has been even less satisfactory
to a believer in individualism. In one respect, this is most surprising.
Experience in the past quarter century has strongly confirmed the
validity of Hayek’s central insight—that coordination of men’s
activities through central direction and through voluntary cooperation
are roads going in very different directions: the first to serfdom, the
second to freedom. That experience has also strongly reinforced a
secondary theme—central direction is also a road to poverty for the
ordinary man; voluntary cooperation, a road to plenty.</p>
<p>“East and West Germany almost provide a controlled scientific
experiment. Here are people of the same blood, the same civilization,
the same level of technical skill and knowledge, torn asunder by the
accidents of warfare, yet adopting radically different methods of social
organization-central direction and the market. The results are crystal
clear. East Germany, not West Germany, had to build a wall to keep its
citizens from leaving. On its side of the wall, tyranny and misery; on
the other side, freedom and affluence.</p>
<p>“In the Middle East, Israel and Egypt offer the same contrast as West
and East Germany. In the Far East, Malaya, Singapore, Thailand, Formosa,
Hong Kong, and Japan—all relying primarily on free markets—are thriving
and their people full of hope; a far call from India, Indonesia, and
Communist China—all relying heavily on central planning. Again it is
Communist China and not Hong Kong that has to guard its borders against
people trying to get out.</p>
<p>“Yet despite this remarkable and dramatic confirmation of Hayek’s
thesis, the intellectual climate of the West, after a brief interlude in
which there were some signs of the resurgence of earlier liberal values,
has again started moving in a direction strongly antagonistic to free
enterprise, competition, private property and limited government. For a
time, Hayek’s description of the ruling intellectual attitudes seemed to
be growing somewhat obsolete. Today, it rings truer than it did a decade
ago. It is hard to know what explains this development. We badly need a
new book by Hayek that will give as clear and penetrating an insight
into the intellectual developments of the past quarter century as The
Road to Serfdom does of earlier developments. Why is it that
intellectual classes everywhere almost automatically range themselves on
the side of collectivism—even while chanting individualist slogans—and
denigrate and revile capitalism? Why is it that the mass media are
almost everywhere dominated by this view?</p>
<p>“Whatever the explanation, the fact of growing intellectual support
of collectivism— and I believe it is a fact—makes Hayek’s book as timely
today as it was when it first appeared. Let us hope that a new edition
in Germany which of all countries should be most receptive to its
message—will have as much influence as the initial edition had in the
United States and the United Kingdom. The battle for freedom must be won
over and over again. The socialists in all parties to whom Hayek
dedicated his book must once again be persuaded or defeated if they and
we are to remain free men.”</p>
<p>The penultimate paragraph of my introduction to the German edition is
the only one that does not ring fully true today. The fall of the Berlin
Wall, the collapse of communism behind the Iron Curtain, and the
changing character of China have reduced the defenders of a Marxian-type
collectivism to a small, hardy band concentrated in Western
universities. Today, there is wide agreement that socialism is a
failure, capitalism a success. Yet this apparent conversion of the
intellectual community to what might be called a Hayekian view is
deceptive. While the talk is about free markets and private property—and
it is more respectable than it was a few decades ago to defend
near-complete laissez-faire—the bulk of the intellectual community
almost automatically favors any expansion of government power so long as
it is advertised as a way to protect individuals from big bad
corporations, relieve poverty, protect the environment, or promote
“equality.” The present discussion of a national program of health care
provides a striking example. The intellectuals may have learned the
words but they do not yet have the tune.</p>
<p>I said at the outset that “in some ways” the message of this book “is
even more relevant to the United States today than it was when it
created a sensation . . . half a century ago.” Intellectual opinion then
was far more hostile to its theme than it appears to be now, but
practice conformed to it far more than it does today. Government in the
post-World War II period was smaller and less intrusive than it is
today. Johnson’s Great Society programs, including Medicare and
Medicaid, and Bush’s Clean Air and Americans with Disabilities acts were
all still ahead, let alone the numerous other extensions of government
that Reagan was only able to slow down, not reverse, in his eight years
in office. Total government spending—federal, state, and local—in the
United States has gone from 25 percent of national income in 1950 to
nearly 45 percent in 1993.</p>
<p>Much the same has been true in Britain, in one sense more
dramatically. The Labour Party, formerly openly socialist, now defends
free private markets; and the Conservative Party, once content to
administer Labour’s socialist policies, has tried to reverse, and to
some extent under Margaret Thatcher succeeded in reversing, the extent
of government ownership and operation. But Thatcher was unable to call
on anything like the reservoir of popular support for liberal values
that led to the withdrawal of the “control of engagements” order shortly
after World War II. And while there has been a considerable amount of
“privatization” there as here, government today spends a larger fraction
of the national income and is more intrusive than it was in 1950.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Atlantic, it is only a little overstated to say
that we preach individualism and competitive capitalism, and practice
socialism.</p>
<p>Note on Publishing History20</p>
<p>Hayek began working on The Road to Serfdom in September 1940, and the
book was first published in England on March 10, 1944. Hayek authorized
his friend Dr. Fritz Machlup, an Austrian refugee who pursued a
distinguished academic career in the United States and was employed, in
1944, at the Office of Alien Property Custodian in Washington, DC, to
sign up the book with an American publisher. Before it was submitted to
the University of Chicago Press the book was turned down in the United
States by three publishers—whether because they believed it would not
sell or, in at least one case, because they considered it “unfit for
publication by a reputable house.”21 Undeterred, Machlup showed the page
proofs of the British edition to Aaron Director, a former member of the
University of Chicago Economics Department who was to return to the
university after the war as an economist in the Law School.
Subsequently, Frank H. Knight, a distinguished economist at the
university, received a set of proofs and presented them to the
University of Chicago Press with Director’s suggestion that the Press
might want to publish the book.</p>
<p>The Press signed a contract with Hayek for American rights in April
1944, after persuading him to make some changes—“to be specific about
the application to the United States . . . instead of slanting the book
directly at an audience limited to England,” as John Scoon, then editor
at the Press, later recalled.</p>
<p>“About the time the contract for American rights was signed—the
beginning of April—we began to hear about the book in England, which had
been published there on March 10. The first printing in England was only
2,000 but it was sold out in about a month. It began to be quoted in
Parliament and in newspapers, and a few newspapers over here began
mentioning it now and then—but of course we were still uncertain as to
how it would appeal to the United States. As a matter of fact, right up
until publication date we couldn’t get a bookstore even in New York
excited about the book.”</p>
<p>The Chicago edition was published on September 18, 1944, in a first
printing of 2,000 copies, with an introduction by John Chamberlain, then
as now a well-known writer and reviewer of books on economic subjects.
“The first review that we saw,” Scoon went on to say, “was Orville
Prescott’s in the New York Times of September 20, which was neutral and
called it ‘this sad and angry little book,’ but by the time we had seen
Henry Hazlitt’s front page review in the Sunday Times Book Review we had
ordered a second printing of 5,000 copies. In a few days we had requests
for German, Spanish, Dutch and other translating rights, and on
September 27 we ordered a third printing of 5,000 copies, upping it to
10,000 the next day. . . .</p>
<p>“By the first week of October many stores were out of stock and we
had a tremendous and intricate job of printing, binding, shipping and
allotting to customers in both this country and Canada. . . . From the
start there was great enthusiasm for the book but the sales went by ups
and downs. . . .</p>
<p>“Bitterness about the book has increased as time has gone by, rising
to new heights as the book has made more of an impression. (People still
tend to go off half-cocked about it; why don’t they read it and find out
what Hayek actually says!)” Scoon’s comment is still true today.</p>
<p>The Reader’s Digest published a condensation in April 1945, and more
than 600,000 copies of the condensed version were subsequently
distributed by the Book of the Month Club.22 In anticipation of the
Digest’s condensation and also of a lecture tour that Hayek was
scheduled to make in the Spring of 1945, the Press tried to arrange for
a large seventh printing. However, a paper shortage limited the press
run to 10,000 and forced the Press to reduce the size of the book to a
pocket-size version. It is a copy from that printing, incidentally, that
is in my personal library.</p>
<p>In the fifty years since its publication, the Press has sold over a
quarter of a million copies, 81,000 in hardback and 175,000 in
paperback. Chicago’s first paperback edition was published in 1956.
Hayek’s son, Laurence, reports that nearly twenty authorized foreign
translations have been published. In addition, underground, unauthorized
translations circulated in Russian, Polish, Czech, and possibly other
languages, when Eastern Europe was behind the Iron Curtain. There is
little doubt that Hayek’s writings, and especially this book, were an
important intellectual source of the disintegration of faith in
communism behind the Iron Curtain, as on our side of it.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall it has been possible to publish the
book openly in the countries and satellites of the former Soviet Union.
I know from a variety of sources that there has been an upsurge of
interest in Hayek, in general, and The Road to Serfdom in particular in
those countries.</p>
<p>Since Hayek’s death in 1992 there has been increasing recognition of
the influence that he exerted in both communist and noncommunist
regimes. His publishers can confidently look forward to continuing sales
of this remarkable book for as long as freedom of the press
prevails—which, despite some erosion since he wrote, is nonetheless more
secure than it would otherwise be precisely because of this book.</p>
