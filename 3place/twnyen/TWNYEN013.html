<p>SECURITY AND FREEDOM</p>
<p>The whole of society will have become a single office and a single
factory with equality of work and equality of pay. —Nikolai Lenin
(1917)1</p>
<p>In a country where the sole employer is the State, opposition means
death by slow starvation. The old principle: who does not work shall not
eat, has been replaced by a new one: who does not obey shall not
eat.</p>
<p>—Leon Trotsky (1937)2</p>
<p>Like the spurious “economic freedom,” and with more justice, economic
security is often represented as an indispensable condition of real
liberty. In a sense this is both true and important. Independence of
mind or strength of character is rarely found among those who cannot be
confident that they will make their way by their own effort. Yet the
idea of economic security is no less vague and ambiguous than most other
terms in this field; and because of this the general approval given to
the demand for security may become a danger to liberty. Indeed, when
security is understood in too absolute a sense, the general striving for
it, far from increasing the chances of freedom, becomes the gravest
threat to it.</p>
<p>It will be well to contrast at the outset the two kinds of security:
the limited one, which can be achieved for all, and which is therefore
no privilege but a legitimate object of desire; and absolute security,
which in a free society cannot be achieved for all and which ought not
to be given as a privilege—except in a few special instances such as
that of the judges, where complete independence is of paramount
importance. These two kinds of security are, first, security against
severe physical privation, the certainty of a given minimum of
sustenance for all; and, second, the security of a given standard of
life, or of the relative position which one person or group enjoys
compared with others; or, as we may put it briefly, the security of a
minimum income and the security of the particular income a person is
thought to deserve. We shall presently see that this distinction largely
coincides with the distinction between the security which can be
provided for all outside of and supplementary to the market system and
the security which can be provided only for some and only by controlling
or abolishing the market.</p>
<p>There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general
level of wealth which ours has attained the first kind of security
should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom.
There are difficult questions about the precise standard which should
thus be assured; there is particularly the important question whether
those who thus rely on the community should indefinitely enjoy all the
same liberties as the rest.3 An incautious handling of these questions
might well cause serious and perhaps even dangerous political problems;
but there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and
clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be
assured to everybody. Indeed, for a considerable part of the population
of England this sort of security has long been achieved.</p>
<p>Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the
individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which,
because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate
provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the
desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their
consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance—
where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks—the case for the
state’s helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance
is very strong. There are many points of detail where those wishing to
preserve the competitive system and those wishing to supercede it by
something different will disagree on the details of such schemes; and it
is possible under the name of social insurance to introduce measures
which tend to make competition more or less ineffective. But there is no
incompatibility in principle between the state’s providing greater
security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom. To the
same category belongs also the increase of security through the state’s
rendering assistance to the victims of such “acts of God” as earthquakes
and floods. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against
which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make
provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly
be taken.</p>
<p>There is, finally, the supremely important problem of combating
general fluctuations of economic activity and the recurrent waves of
large-scale unemployment which accompany them. This is, of course, one
of the gravest and most pressing problems of our time. But, though its
solution will require much planning in the good sense, it does not—or at
least need not—require that special kind of planning which according to
its advocates is to replace the market. Many economists hope, indeed,
that the ultimate remedy may be found in the field of monetary policy,
which would involve nothing incompatible even with nineteenth-century
liberalism. Others, it is true, believe that real success can be
expected only from the skillful timing of public works undertaken on a
very large scale.4 This might lead to much more serious restrictions of
the competitive sphere, and, in experimenting in this direction, we
shall have carefully to watch our step if we are to avoid making all
economic activity progressively more dependent on the direction and
volume of government expenditure. But this is neither the only nor, in
my opinion, the most promising way of meeting the gravest threat to
economic security. In any case, the very necessary efforts to secure
protection against these fluctuations do not lead to the kind of
planning which constitutes such a threat to our freedom.</p>
<p>The planning for security which has such an insidious effect on
liberty is that for security of a different kind. It is planning
designed to protect individuals or groups against diminutions of their
income, which although in no way deserved yet in a competitive society
occur daily, against losses imposing severe hardships having no moral
justification yet inseparable from the competitive system. This demand
for security is thus another form of the demand for a just remuneration—
a remuneration commensurate with the subjective merits and not with the
objective results of a man’s efforts. This kind of security or justice
seems irreconcilable with freedom to choose one’s employment.</p>
<p>In any system which for the distribution of men between the different
trades and occupations relies on their own choice it is necessary that
the remuneration in these trades should correspond to their usefulness
to the other members of society, even if this should stand in no
relation to subjective merit. Although the results achieved will often
be commensurate with efforts and intentions, this cannot always be true
in any form of society. It will particularly not be true in the many
instances where the usefulness of some trade or special skill is changed
by circumstances which could not be foreseen. We all know the tragic
plight of the highly trained man whose hard-learned skill has suddenly
lost its value because of some invention which greatly benefits the rest
of society. The history of the last hundred years is full of instances
of this kind, some of them affecting hundreds of thousands of people at
a time.</p>
<p>That anyone should suffer a great diminution of his income and bitter
disappointment of all his hopes through no fault of his own, and despite
hard work and exceptional skill, undoubtedly offends our sense of
justice. The demands of those who suffer in this way, for state
interference on their behalf to safeguard their legitimate expectations,
are certain to receive popular sympathy and support. The general
approval of these demands has had the effect that governments everywhere
have taken action, not merely to protect the people so threatened from
severe hardship and privation, but to secure to them the continued
receipt of their former income and to shelter them from the vicissitudes
of the market.5</p>
<p>C.rtainty of a given income can, however, not be given to all if any
freedom in the choice of one’s occupation is to be allowed. And, if it
is provided for some, it becomes a privilege at the expense of others
whose security is thereby necessarily diminished. That security of an
invariable income can be provided for all only by the abolition of all
freedom in the choice of one’s employment is easily shown. Yet, although
such a general guaranty of legitimate expectation is often regarded as
the ideal to be aimed at, it is not a thing which is seriously
attempted. What is constantly being done is to grant this kind of
security piecemeal, to this group and to that, with the result that for
those who are left out in the cold the insecurity constantly increases.
No wonder that in consequence the value attached to the privilege of
security constantly increases, the demand for it becomes more and more
urgent, until in the end no price, not even that of liberty, appears too
high.</p>
<p>If those whose usefulness is reduced by circumstances which they
could neither foresee nor control were to be protected against
undeserved loss, and those whose usefulness has been increased in the
same way were prevented from making an unmerited gain, remuneration
would soon cease to have any relation to actual usefulness. It would
depend on the views held by some authority about what a person ought to
have done, what he ought to have foreseen, and how good or bad his
intentions were. Such decisions could not but be to a large extent
arbitrary. The application of this principle would necessarily bring it
about that people doing the same work would receive different
remuneration. The differences in remuneration would then no longer
present an adequate inducement to people to make the changes which are
socially desirable, and it would not even be possible for the
individuals affected to judge whether a particular change is worth the
trouble it causes.</p>
<p>But if the changes in the distribution of men between different
employments, which are constantly necessary in any society, can no
longer be brought about by pecuniary “rewards” and “penalties” (which
have no necessary connection with subjective merit), they must be
brought about by direct orders. When a person’s income is guaranteed, he
can neither be allowed to stay in his job merely because he likes it nor
to choose what other work he would like to do. As it is not he who makes
the gain or suffers the loss dependent on his moving or not moving, the
choice must be made for him by those who control the distribution of the
available income.</p>
<p>The problem of adequate incentives which arises here is commonly
discussed as if it were a problem mainly of the willingness of people to
do their best. But this, although important, is not the whole, nor even
the most important, aspect of the problem. It is not merely that if we
want people to give their best we must make it worth while for them.
What is more important is that if we want to leave them the choice, if
they are to be able to judge what they ought to do, they must be given
some readily intelligible yardstick by which to measure the social
importance of the different occupations. Even with the best will in the
world it would be impossible for anyone intelligently to choose between
various alternatives if the advantages they offered him stood in no
relation to their usefulness to society. To know whether as the result
of a change a man ought to leave a trade and an environment which he has
come to like, and exchange it for another, it is necessary that the
changed relative value of these occupations to society should find
expression in the remunerations they offer.</p>
<p>The problem is, of course, even more important because in the world
as it is men are, in fact, not likely to give their best for long
periods unless their own interests are directly involved. At least for
great numbers some external pressure is needed if they are to give their
best. The problem of incentives in this sense is a very real one, both
in the sphere of ordinary labor and in those of the managerial
activities. The application of the engineering technique to a whole
nation— and this is what planning means—“raises problems of discipline
which are hard to solve,” as has been well described by an American
engineer with great experience in government planning, who has clearly
seen the problem.</p>
<p>“In order to do an engineering job,” he explains, “there ought to be
surrounding the work a comparatively large area of unplanned economic
action. There should be a place from which workers can be drawn, and
when a worker is fired he should vanish from the job and from the
pay-roll. In the absence of such a free reservoir discipline cannot be
maintained without corporal punishment, as with slave labor.”6</p>
<p>In the sphere of executive work the problem of sanctions for
negligence arises in a different but no less serious form. It has been
well said that, while the last resort of a competitive economy is the
bailiff, the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman.7 The
powers the manager of any plant will have to be given will still be
considerable. But no more than in the case of the worker can the
manager’s position and income in a planned system be made to depend
merely on the success or failure of the work under his direction. As
neither the risk nor the gain is his, it cannot be his personal
judgment, but whether he does what he ought to have done according to
some established rule, which must decide. A mistake he “ought” to have
avoided is not his own affair; it is a crime against the community and
must be treated as such. While so long as he keeps to the safe path of
objectively ascertainable duty he may be surer of his income than the
capitalist entrepreneur, the danger which threatens him in case of real
failure is worse than bankruptcy. He may be economically secure so long
as he satisfies his superiors, but this security is bought at the price
of the safety of freedom and life.</p>
<p>The conflict with which we have to deal is, indeed, a quite
fundamental one between two irreconcilable types of social organization,
which, from the most characteristic forms in which they appear, have
often been described as the commercial and the military type of society.
The terms were, perhaps, unfortunate, because they direct attention to
unessentials and make it difficult to see that we face a real
alternative and that there is no third possibility. Either both the
choice and the risk rest with the individual or he is relieved of both.
The army does, indeed, in many ways represent the closest approach
familiar to us to the second type of organization, where work and worker
alike are allotted by authority and where, if the available means are
scanty, everybody is alike put on short-commons. This is the only system
in which the individual can be conceded full economic security and
through the extension of which to the whole of society it can be
achieved for all its members. This security is, however, inseparable
from the restrictions on liberty and the hierarchical order of military
life—it is the security of the barracks.</p>
<p>It is possible, of course, to organize sections of an otherwise free
society on this principle, and there is no reason why this form of life,
with its necessary restrictions on individual liberty, should not be
open to those who prefer it. Indeed, some voluntary labor service on
military lines might well be the best form for the state to provide the
certainty of an opportunity for work and a minimum income for all. That
proposals of this sort have in the past proved so little acceptable is
due to the fact that those who are willing to surrender their freedom
for security have always demanded that if they give up their full
freedom it should also be taken from those not prepared to do so. For
this claim it is difficult to find a justification.</p>
<p>The military type of organization as we know it gives us, however,
only a very inadequate picture of what it would be like if it were
extended to the whole of society. So long as only a part of society is
organized on military lines, the unfreedom of the members of the
military organization is mitigated by the fact that there is still a
free sphere to which they can move if the restrictions become too
irksome. If we want to form a picture of what society would be like if,
according to the ideal which has seduced so many socialists, it was
organized as a single great factory, we have to look to ancient Sparta,
or to contemporary Germany, which, after moving for two or three
generations in this direction, has now so nearly reached it.</p>
<p>In a society used to freedom it is unlikely that many people would be
ready deliberately to purchase security at this price. But the policies
which are now followed everywhere, which hand out the privilege of
security, now to this group and now to that, are nevertheless rapidly
creating conditions in which the striving for security tends to become
stronger than the love of freedom. The reason for this is that with
every grant of complete security to one group the insecurity of the rest
necessarily increases. If you guarantee to some a fixed part of a
variable cake, the share left to the rest is bound to fluctuate
proportionally more than the size of the whole. And the essential
element of security which the competitive system offers, the great
variety of opportunities, is more and more reduced.</p>
<p>Within the market system, security can be granted to particular
groups only by the kind of planning known as restrictionism (which
includes, however, almost all the planning which is actually
practiced!). “Control,” i.e., limitation of output so that prices will
secure an “adequate” return, is the only way in which in a market
economy producers can be guaranteed a certain income. But this
necessarily involves a reduction of opportunities open to others. If the
producer, be he entrepreneur or worker, is to be protected against
underbidding by outsiders, it means that others who are worse off are
precluded from sharing in the relatively greater prosperity of the
controlled industries. Every restriction on the freedom of entry into a
trade reduces the security of all those outside it. And, as the number
of those whose income is secured in this manner increases, the field of
alternative opportunities which are open to anyone who suffers a loss of
income is restricted; and for those unfavorably affected by any change
the chance of avoiding a fatal diminution of their income is
correspondingly diminished. And if, as has become increasingly true, in
each trade in which conditions improve, the members are allowed to
exclude others in order to secure to themselves the full gain in the
form of higher wages or profits, those in the trades where demand has
fallen have nowhere to go, and every change becomes the cause of large
unemployment. There can be little doubt that it is largely a consequence
of the striving for security by these means in the last decades that
unemployment and thus insecurity for large sections of the population
has so much increased.</p>
<p>In England and America such restrictions, especially those affecting
the intermediate strata of society, have assumed important dimensions
only in comparatively recent times, and we have scarcely yet realized
their full consequences. The utter hopelessness of the position of those
who, in a society which has thus grown rigid, are left outside the range
of sheltered occupation, and the magnitude of the gulf which separates
them from the fortunate possessors of jobs for whom protection against
competition has made it unnecessary to budge ever so little to make room
for those without, can be appreciated only by those who have experienced
it. It is not a question of the fortunate ones’ giving up their places,
but merely that they should share in the common misfortune by some
reduction of their incomes, or frequently even merely by some sacrifice
of their prospects of improvement. The protection of their “standard of
life,” of the “fair price,” or the “professional income” to which they
regard themselves as entitled, and in the protection of which they
receive the support of the state, precludes this. In consequence,
instead of prices, wages, and individual incomes, it is now employment
and production which have become subject to violent fluctuations. There
has never been a worse and more cruel exploitation of one class by
another than that of the weaker or less fortunate members of a group of
producers by the well-established which has been made possible by the
“regulation” of competition. Few catchwords have done so much harm as
the ideal of a “stabilization” of particular prices (or wages), which,
while securing the income of some, makes the position of the rest more
and more precarious.</p>
<p>Thus, the more we try to provide full security by interfering with
the market system, the greater the insecurity becomes; and, what is
worse, the greater becomes the contrast between the security of those to
whom it is granted as a privilege and the ever increasing insecurity of
the underprivileged. And the more security becomes a privilege, and the
greater the danger to those excluded from it, the higher will security
be prized. As the number of the privileged increases and the difference
between their security and the insecurity of the others increases, a
completely new set of social values gradually arises. It is no longer
independence but security which gives rank and status, the certain right
to a pension more than confidence in his making good which makes a young
man eligible for marriage, while insecurity becomes the dreaded state of
the pariah in which those who in their youth have been refused admission
to the haven of a salaried position remain for life.</p>
<p>The general endeavor to achieve security by restrictive measures,
tolerated or supported by the state, has in the course of time produced
a progressive transformation of society—a transformation in which, as in
so many other ways, Germany has led and the other countries have
followed. This development has been hastened by another effect of
socialist teaching, the deliberate disparagement of all activities
involving economic risk and the moral opprobrium cast on the gains which
make risks worth taking but which only few can win. We cannot blame our
young men when they prefer the safe, salaried position to the risk of
enterprise after they have heard from their earliest youth the former
described as the superior, more unselfish and disinterested occupation.
The younger generation of today has grown up in a world in which in
school and press the spirit of commercial enterprise has been
represented as disreputable and the making of profit as immoral, where
to employ a hundred people is represented as exploitation but to command
the same number as honorable. Older people may regard this as an
exaggeration of the present state of affairs, but the daily experience
of the university teacher leaves little doubt that, as a result of
anticapitalist propaganda, values have already altered far in advance of
the change in institutions which has so far taken place. The question is
whether, by changing our institutions to satisfy the new demands, we
shall not unwittingly destroy values which we still rate higher.</p>
<p>The change in the structure of society involved in the victory of the
ideal of security over that of independence cannot be better illustrated
than by a comparison of what ten or twenty years ago could still be
regarded as the English and the German type of society. However great
the influence of the army may have been in the latter country, it is a
grave mistake to ascribe what the Englishman regarded as the “military”
character of German society mainly to that influence. The difference
went much deeper than could be explained on that ground, and the
peculiar attributes of German society existed no less in circles in
which the properly military influence was negligible than in those in
which it was strong. It was not so much that at almost all times a
larger part of the German people was organized for war than was true in
other countries, but that the same type of organization was employed for
so many other purposes, which gave German society its peculiar
character. It was that a larger part of the civil life of Germany than
of any other country was deliberately organized from the top, that so
large a proportion of her people did not regard themselves as
independent but as appointed functionaries, which gave her social
structure its peculiar character. Germany had, as the Germans themselves
boasted, for long been a Beamtenstaat in which not only in the civil
service proper but in almost all spheres of life income and status were
assigned and guaranteed by some authority.8</p>
<p>While it is doubtful whether the spirit of freedom can anywhere be
extirpated by force, it is not certain that any people would
successfully withstand the process by which it was slowly smothered in
Germany. Where distinction and rank are achieved almost exclusively by
becoming a salaried servant of the state, where to do one’s assigned
duty is regarded as more laudable than to choose one’s own field of
usefulness, where all pursuits that do not give a recognized place in
the official hierarchy or a claim to a fixed income are regarded as
inferior and even somewhat disreputable, it is too much to expect that
many will long prefer freedom to security. And where the alternative to
security in a dependent position is a most precarious position, in which
one is despised alike for success and for failure, only few will resist
the temptation of safety at the price of freedom. Once things have gone
so far, liberty indeed becomes almost a mockery, since it can be
purchased only by the sacrifice of most of the good things of this
earth. In this state it is little surprising that more and more people
should come to feel that without economic security liberty is “not worth
having” and that they are willing to sacrifice their liberty for
security. But it is disquieting to find Professor Harold Laski employing
the very same argument which has perhaps done more than any other to
induce the German people to sacrifice their liberty.9</p>
<p>There can be no question that adequate security against severe
privation, and the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected
effort and consequent disappointment, will have to be one of the main
goals of policy. But if these endeavors are to be successful and are not
to destroy individual freedom, security must be provided outside the
market and competition be left to function unobstructed. Some security
is essential if freedom is to be preserved, because most men are willing
to bear the risk which freedom inevitably involves only so long as that
risk is not too great. But while this is a truth of which we must never
lose sight, nothing is more fatal than the present fashion among
intellectual leaders of extolling security at the expense of freedom. It
is essential that we should relearn frankly to face the fact that
freedom can be had only at a price and that as individuals we must be
prepared to make severe material sacrifices to preserve our liberty. If
we want to retain this, we must regain the conviction on which the rule
of liberty in the Anglo-Saxon countries has been based and which
Benjamin Franklin expressed in a phrase applicable to us in our lives as
individuals no less than as nations: “Those who would give up essential
liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty
nor safety.”10</p>

arise if mere citizenship of a country confers the right to a standard
of living higher than elsewhere and which ought not to be dismissed too
lightly.</p>

that, without economic security, liberty is not worth having.”</p>
