<h4 id="fifteen">FIFTEEN</h4>
<p>THE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER</p>
<p>Of all checks on democracy, federation has been the most efficacious
and the most congenial. . . . The federal system limits and restrains
the sovereign power by dividing it and by assigning to Government only
certain defined rights. It is the only method of curbing not only the
majority but the power of the whole people. —Lord Acton1</p>
<p>In no other field has the world yet paid so dearly for the
abandonment of nineteenth-century liberalism as in the field where the
retreat began: in international relations. Yet only a small part of the
lesson which experience ought to have taught us has been learned.
Perhaps even more than elsewhere current notions of what is desirable
and practicable are here still of a kind which may well produce the
opposite of what they promise.</p>
<p>The part of the lesson of the recent past which is slowly and
gradually being appreciated is that many kinds of economic planning,
conducted independently on a national scale, are bound in their
aggregate effect to be harmful even from a purely economic point of view
and, in addition, to produce serious international friction. That there
is little hope of international order or lasting peace so long as every
country is free to employ whatever measures it thinks desirable in its
own immediate interest, however damaging they may be to others, needs
little emphasis now. Many kinds of economic planning are indeed
practicable only if the planning authority can effectively shut out all
extraneous influences; the result of such planning is therefore
inevitably the piling-up of restrictions on the movements of men and
goods.</p>
<p>Less obvious but by no means less real are the dangers to peace
arising out of the artificially fostered economic solidarity of all the
inhabitants of any one country and from the new blocs of opposed
interests created by planning on a national scale. It is neither
necessary nor desirable that national boundaries should mark sharp
differences in standards of living, that membership of a national group
should entitle one to a share in a cake altogether different from that
in which members of other groups share. If the resources of different
nations are treated as exclusive properties of these nations as wholes,
if international economic relations, instead of being relations between
individuals, become increasingly relations between whole nations
organized as trading bodies, they inevitably become the source of
friction and envy between whole nations. It is one of the most fatal
illusions that, by substituting negotiations between states or organized
groups for competition for markets or for raw materials, international
friction would be reduced. This would merely put a contest of force in
the place of what can only metaphorically be called the “struggle” of
competition and would transfer to powerful and armed states, subject to
no superior law, the rivalries which between individuals had to be
decided without recourse to force. Economic transactions between
national bodies who are at the same time the supreme judges of their own
behavior, who bow to no superior law, and whose representatives cannot
be bound by any considerations but the immediate interest of their
respective nations, must end in clashes of power.2</p>
<p>If we were to make no better use of victory than to countenance
existing trends in this direction, only too visible before 1939, we
might indeed find that we have defeated National Socialism merely to
create a world of many national socialisms, differing in detail, but all
equally totalitarian, nationalistic, and in recurrent conflict with each
other. The Germans would appear as the disturbers of peace, as they
already do to some people,3 merely because they were the first to take
the path along which all the others were ultimately to follow.</p>
<p>Those who at least partly realize these dangers usually draw the
conclusion that economic planning must be done “internationally,” i.e.,
by some supernational authority. But though this would avert some of the
obvious dangers raised by planning on a national scale, it seems that
those who advocate such ambitious schemes have little conception of the
even greater difficulties and dangers which their proposals create. The
problems raised by a conscious direction of economic affairs on a
national scale inevitably assume even greater dimensions when the same
is attempted internationally. The conflict between planning and freedom
cannot but become more serious as the similarity of standards and values
among those submitted to a unitary plan diminishes. There need be little
difficulty in planning the economic life of a family, comparatively
little in a small community. But, as the scale increases, the amount of
agreement on the order of ends decreases and the necessity to rely on
force and compulsion grows. In a small community common views on the
relative importance of the main tasks, agreed standards of value, will
exist on a great many subjects. But their number will become less and
less the wider we throw the net; and, as there is less community of
views, the necessity to rely on force and coercion increases.</p>
<p>The people of any one country may easily be persuaded to make a
sacrifice in order to assist what they regard as “their” iron industry
or “their” agriculture, or in order that in their country nobody should
sink below a certain level. So long as it is a question of helping
people whose habits of life and ways of thinking are familiar to us, of
correcting the distribution of incomes among, or the working conditions
of, people we can well imagine and whose views on their appropriate
status are fundamentally similar to ours, we are usually ready to make
some sacrifices. But one has only to visualize the problems raised by
economic planning of even an area such as western Europe to see that the
moral bases for such an undertaking are completely lacking. Who imagines
that there exist any common ideals of distributive justice such as will
make the Norwegian fisherman consent to forgo the prospect of economic
improvement in order to help his Portuguese fellow, or the Dutch worker
to pay more for his bicycle to help the Coventry mechanic, or the French
peasant to pay more taxes to assist the industrialization of Italy?</p>
<p>If most people are not willing to see the difficulty, this is mainly
because, consciously or unconsciously, they assume that it will be they
who will settle these questions for the others, and because they are
convinced of their own capacity to do this justly and equitably. The
English people, for instance, perhaps even more than others, begin to
realize what such schemes mean only when it is presented to them that
they might be a minority in the planning authority and that the main
lines of the future economic development of Great Britain might be
determined by a non-British majority. How many people in England would
be prepared to submit to the decision of an international authority,
however democratically constituted, which had power to decree that the
development of the Spanish iron industry must have precedence over
similar development in South Wales, that the optical industry had better
be concentrated in Germany to the exclusion of Great Britain, or that
only fully refined gasoline should be imported to Great Britain and all
the industries connected with refining reserved for the producer
countries?</p>
<p>To imagine that the economic life of a vast area comprising many
different people can be directed or planned by democratic procedure
betrays a complete lack of awareness of the problems such planning would
raise. Planning on an international scale, even more than is true on a
national scale, cannot be anything but a naked rule of force, an
imposition by a small group on all the rest of that sort of standard and
employment which the planners think suitable for the rest. If anything
is certain, it is that Grossraumwirtschaft of the kind at which the
Germans have been aiming can be successfully realized only by a
master-race, a Herrenvolk, ruthlessly imposing its aims and ideas on the
rest. It is a mistake to regard the brutality and the disregard of all
the wishes and ideals of the smaller people shown by the Germans simply
as a sign of their special wickedness; it is the nature of the task they
have assumed which makes these things inevitable. To undertake the
direction of the economic life of people with widely divergent ideals
and values is to assume responsibilities which commit one to the use of
force; it is to assume a position where the best intentions cannot
prevent one from being forced to act in a way which to some of those
affected must appear highly immoral.4</p>
<p>This is true even if we assume the dominant power to be as idealistic
and unselfish as we can possibly conceive. But how small is the
likelihood that it will be unselfish, and how great are the temptations!
I believe the standards of decency and fairness, particularly with
regard to international affairs, to be as high, if not higher, in
England than in any other country. Yet even now we can hear people in
England arguing that victory must be used to create conditions in which
British industry will be able to utilize to the full the particular
equipment which it has built up during the war, that the reconstruction
of Europe must be so directed as to fit in with the special requirements
of the industries of England, and to secure to everybody in the country
the kind of employment for which he thinks himself most fit. The
alarming thing about these suggestions is not that they are made but
that they are made in all innocence and regarded as a matter of course
by decent people who are completely unaware of the moral enormity which
the use of force for such purposes involves.5</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful agent in creating the belief in the
possibility of a single central direction by democratic means of the
economic life of many different peoples is the fatal delusion that if
the decisions were left to the “people,” the community of interest of
the working classes would readily overcome the differences which exist
between the ruling classes. There is every reason to expect that with
world planning the clash of economic interests which arises now about
the economic policy of any one nation would in fact appear in even
fiercer form as a clash of interests between whole peoples which could
be decided only by force. On the questions which an international
planning authority would have to decide, the interests and opinions of
the working classes of the different people will inevitably be as much
in conflict, and there will be even less of a commonly accepted basis
for an equitable settlement than there is with respect to different
classes in any one country. To the worker in a poor country the demand
of his more fortunate colleague to be protected against his low-wage
competition by minimum-wage legislation, supposedly in his interest, is
frequently no more than a means to deprive him of his only chance to
better his conditions by overcoming natural disadvantages by working at
wages lower than his fellows in other countries. And to him the fact
that he has to give the product of ten hours of his labor for the
product of five hours of the man elsewhere who is better equipped with
machinery is as much “exploitation” as that practiced by any
capitalist.</p>
<p>It is fairly certain that in a planned international system the
wealthier and therefore most powerful nations would to a very much
greater degree than in a free economy become the object of hatred and
envy of the poorer ones: and the latter, rightly or wrongly, would all
be convinced that their position could be improved much more quickly if
they were only free to do what they wished. Indeed, if it comes to be
regarded as the duty of the international authority to bring about
distributive justice between the different peoples, it is no more than a
consistent and inevitable development of socialist doctrine that class
strife would become a struggle between the working classes of the
different countries.</p>
<p>There is at present a great deal of muddleheaded talk about “planning
to equalize standards of life.” It is instructive to consider in a
little more detail one of these proposals to see what precisely it
involves. The area for which at the present moment our planners are
particularly fond of drawing up such schemes is the Danube Basin and
southeastern Europe.6 There can be no doubt about the urgent need for
amelioration of economic conditions in this region, from humanitarian
and economic considerations as well as in the interest of the future
peace of Europe, nor that this can be achieved only in a political
setting different from that of the past. But this is not the same thing
as to wish to see economic life in this region directed according to a
single master-plan, to foster the development of the different
industries according to a schedule laid down beforehand in a way which
makes the success of local initiative dependent on being approved by the
central authority and being incorporated in its plan. One cannot, for
example, create a kind of Tennessee Valley Authority for the Danube
Basin without thereby determining beforehand for many years to come the
relative rate of progress of the different races inhabiting this area or
without subordinating all their individual aspirations and wishes to
this task.7</p>
<p>Planning of this kind must of necessity begin by fixing an order of
priorities of the different claims. To plan for the deliberate
equalization of standards of living means that the different claims must
be ranked according to merit, that some must be given precedence over
others, and that the latter must wait their turn—even though those whose
interests are thus relegated may be convinced, not only of their better
right, but also of their ability to reach their goal sooner if they were
only given freedom to act on their own devices. There exists no basis
which allows us to decide whether the claims of the poor Rumanian
peasant are more or less urgent than those of the still poorer Albanian,
or the needs of the Slovakian mountain shepherd greater than those of
his Slovenian colleague. But if the raising of their standards of life
is to be effected according to a unitary plan, somebody must
deliberately balance the merits of all these claims and decide between
them. And once such a plan is put into execution, all the resources of
the planned area must serve that plan—there can be no exemption for
those who feel they could do better for themselves. Once their claim has
been given a lower rank, they will have to work for the prior
satisfaction of the needs of those who have been given preference.</p>
<p>In such a state of affairs everybody will rightly feel that he is
worse off than he might be if some other plan had been adopted and that
it is the decision and the might of the dominant powers which have
condemned him to a place less favorable than he thinks is due to him. To
attempt such a thing in a region peopled by small nations, each of which
believes equally fervently in its own superiority over the others, is to
undertake a task which can be performed only by the use of force. What
it would amount to in practice is that the decisions and power of the
large nations would have to settle whether the standards of the
Macedonian or the Bulgarian peasant should be raised faster, whether the
Czech or the Hungarian miner should more rapidly approach Western
standards. It does not need much knowledge of human nature, and
certainly only a little knowledge of the people of Central Europe, to
see that, whatever the decision imposed, there will be many, probably a
majority, to whom the particular order chosen will appear supreme
injustice and that their common hatred will soon turn against the power
which, however disinterestedly, in fact decides their fate.</p>
<p>Though there are no doubt many people who honestly believe that if
they were allowed to handle the job they would be able to settle all
those problems justly and impartially, and who would be genuinely
surprised to find suspicion and hatred turning against them, they would
probably be the first to apply force when those whom they mean to
benefit prove recalcitrant, and to show themselves quite ruthless in
coercing people in what is presumed to be their own interests. What
these dangerous idealists do not see is that where the assumption of a
moral responsibility involves that one’s moral views should by force be
made to prevail over those dominant in other communities, the assumption
of such responsibility may place one in a position in which it becomes
impossible to act morally. To impose such an impossible moral task on
the victorious nations is a certain way morally to corrupt and discredit
them.</p>
<p>By all means let us assist the poorer people as much as we can in
their own efforts to build up their lives and to raise their standards
of living. An international authority can be very just and contribute
enormously to economic prosperity if it merely keeps order and creates
conditions in which the people can develop their own life; but it is
impossible to be just or to let people live their own life if the
central authority doles out raw materials and allocates markets, if
every spontaneous effort has to be “approved” and nothing can be done
without the sanction of the central authority.</p>
<p>After the discussions in earlier chapters it is hardly necessary to
stress that these difficulties cannot be met by conferring on the
various international authorities “merely” specific economic powers. The
belief that this is a practical solution rests on the fallacy that
economic planning is merely a technical task, which can be solved in a
strictly objective manner by experts, and that the really vital things
would still be left in the hands of the political authorities. Any
international economic authority, not subject to a superior political
power, even if strictly confined to a particular field, could easily
exercise the most tyrannical and irresponsible power imaginable.
Exclusive control of an essential commodity or service (as, for example,
air transport) is in effect one of the most far-reaching powers which
can be conferred on any authority. And as there is scarcely anything
which could not be justified by “technical necessities” which no
outsider could effectively question—or even by humanitarian and possibly
entirely sincere arguments about the needs of some specially ill-favored
group which could not be helped in any other way—there is little
possibility of controlling that power. The kind of organization of the
resources of the world under more or less autonomous bodies, which now
so often finds favor in the most surprising quarters, a system of
comprehensive monopolies recognized by all the national governments, but
subject to none, would inevitably become the worst of all conceivable
rackets—even if those entrusted with their administration should prove
the most faithful guardians of the particular interests placed in their
care.</p>
<p>One need only seriously consider the full implications of such
apparently innocuous proposals, widely regarded as the essential basis
of the future economic order, such as the conscious control and
distribution of the supply of essential raw materials, in order to see
what appalling political difficulties and moral dangers they create. The
controller of the supply of any such raw material as gasoline or timber,
rubber or tin, would be the master of the fate of whole industries and
countries. In deciding whether to allow the supply to increase and the
price or the income of the producers to fall, he would decide whether
some country is to be allowed to start some new industry or whether it
is to be precluded from doing so. While he “protects” the standards of
life of those he regards as specially entrusted to his care, he will
deprive many who are in a much worse position of their best and perhaps
only chance to improve it. If all essential raw materials were thus
controlled, there would indeed be no new industry, no new venture on
which the people of a country could embark without the permission of the
controllers, no plan for development or improvement which could not be
frustrated by their veto. The same is true of international arrangement
for “sharing” of markets and even more so of the control of investment
and the development of natural resources.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe how those who pose as the most hard-boiled
realists, and who lose no opportunity of casting ridicule on the
“utopianism” of those who believe in the possibility of an international
political order, yet regard as more practicable the much more intimate
and irresponsible interference with the lives of the different peoples
which economic planning involves; and believe that, once hitherto
undreamed-of power is given to an international government, which has
just been represented as not even capable of enforcing a simple Rule of
Law, this greater power will be used in so unselfish and so obviously
just a manner as to command general consent. If anything is evident, it
should be that, while nations might abide by formal rules on which they
have agreed, they will never submit to the direction which international
economic planning involves— that while they may agree on the rules of
the game, they will never agree on the order of preference in which the
rank of their own needs and the rate at which they are allowed to
advance is fixed by majority vote. Even if, at first, the peoples
should, under some illusion about the meaning of such proposals, agree
to transfer such powers to an international authority, they would soon
find out that what they have delegated is not merely a technical task
but the most comprehensive power over their very lives.</p>
<p>What is evidently at the back of the minds of the not altogether
unpracticable “realists” who advocate these schemes is that, while the
great powers will be unwilling to submit to any superior authority, they
will be able to use those “international” authorities to impose their
will on the smaller nations within the area in which they exercise
hegemony. There is so much “realism” in this that by thus camouflaging
the planning authorities as “international” it might be easier to
achieve the condition under which international planning is alone
practicable, namely, that it is in effect done by one single predominant
power. This disguise would, however, not alter the fact that for all the
smaller states it would mean a much more complete subjection to an
external power, to which no real resistance would any longer be
possible, than would be involved in the renunciation of a clearly
defined part of political sovereignty.</p>
<p>It is significant that the most passionate advocates of a centrally
directed economic New Order for Europe should display, like their Fabian
and German prototypes, the most complete disregard of the individuality
and of the rights of small nations. The views of Professor Carr, who in
this sphere even more than in that of internal policy is representative
of the trend toward totalitarianism in England, have already made one of
his professional colleagues ask the very pertinent question: “If the
Nazi way with small sovereign states is indeed to become the common
form, what is the war about?”8 Those who have observed how much disquiet
and alarm some recent utterances on these questions in papers as
different as the London Times and the New Statesman9 have caused among
our smaller Allies will have little doubt how much this attitude is even
now resented among our closest friends, and how easy it will be to
dissipate the stock of good will which has been laid up during the war
if these advisers are followed.</p>
<p>Those who are so ready to ride roughshod over the rights of small
states are, of course, right in one thing: we cannot hope for order or
lasting peace after this war if states, large or small, regain
unfettered sovereignty in the economic sphere. But this does not mean
that a new superstate must be given powers which we have not learned to
use intelligently even on a national scale, that an international
authority ought to be given power to direct individual nations how to
use their resources. It means merely that there must be a power which
can restrain the different nations from action harmful to their
neighbors, a set of rules which defines what a state may do, and an
authority capable of enforcing these rules. The powers which such an
authority would need are mainly of a negative kind; it must, above all,
be able to say “No” to all sorts of restrictive measures.</p>
<p>Far from its being true that, as is now widely believed, we need an
international economic authority while the states can at the same time
retain their unrestricted political sovereignty, almost exactly the
opposite is true. What we need and can hope to achieve is not more power
in the hands of irresponsible international economic authorities but, on
the contrary, a superior political power which can hold the economic
interests in check, and in the conflict between them can truly hold the
scales, because it is itself not mixed up in the economic game. The need
is for an international political authority which, without power to
direct the different people what they must do, must be able to restrain
them from action which will damage others.</p>
<p>The powers which must devolve on an international authority are not
the new powers assumed by the states in recent times but that minimum of
powers without which it is impossible to preserve peaceful
relationships, i.e., essentially the powers of the ultra-liberal
“laissez faire” state. And, even more than in the national sphere, it is
essential that these powers of the international authority should be
strictly circumscribed by the Rule of Law. The need for such a
supernational authority becomes indeed greater as the individual states
more and more become units of economic administration, the actors rather
than merely the supervisors of the economic scene, and as therefore any
friction is likely to arise not between individuals but between states
as such.</p>
<p>The form of international government under which certain strictly
defined powers are transferred to an international authority, while in
all other respects the individual countries remain responsible for their
internal affairs, is, of course, that of federation. We must not allow
the numerous ill-considered and often extremely silly claims made on
behalf of a federal organization of the whole world during the height of
the propaganda for “Federal Union” to obscure the fact that the
principle of federation is the only form of association of different
peoples which will create an international order without putting an
undue strain on their legitimate desire for independence.10 Federalism
is, of course, nothing but the application to international affairs of
democracy, the only method of peaceful change man has yet invented. But
it is a democracy with definitely limited powers. Apart from the more
impracticable ideal of fusing different countries into a single
centralized state (the desirability of which is far from obvious), it is
the only way in which the ideal of international law can be made a
reality. We must not deceive ourselves that, in the past, in calling the
rules of international behavior international law, we were doing more
than expressing a pious wish. When we want to prevent people from
killing each other, we are not content to issue a declaration that
killing is undesirable, but we give an authority power to prevent it. In
the same way there can be no international law without a power to
enforce it. The obstacle to the creation of such an international power
was very largely the idea that it need command all the practically
unlimited powers which the modern state possesses. But with the division
of power under the federal system this is by no means necessary.</p>
<p>This division of power would inevitably act at the same time also as
a limitation of the power of the whole as well as of the individual
state. Indeed, many of the kinds of planning which are now fashionable
would probably become altogether impossible.11 But it would by no means
constitute an obstacle to all planning. It is, in fact, one of the main
advantages of federation that it can be so devised as to make most of
the harmful planning difficult while leaving the way free for all
desirable planning. It prevents, or can be made to prevent, most forms
of restrictionism. And it confines international planning to the fields
where true agreement can be reached—not only between the “interests”
immediately concerned but among all those affected. The desirable forms
of planning which can be effected locally and without the need of
restrictive measures are left free and in the hands of those best
qualified to undertake it. It is even to be hoped that within a
federation, where there will no longer exist the same reasons for making
the individual states as strong as possible, the process of
centralization of the past may in some measure be reversed and some
devolution of powers from the state to the local authorities become
possible.</p>
<p>It is worth recalling that the idea of the world at last finding
peace through the absorption of the separate states in large federated
groups and ultimately perhaps in one single federation, far from being
new, was indeed the ideal of almost all the liberal thinkers of the
nineteenth century. From Tennyson, whose much-quoted vision of the
“battle of the air” is followed by a vision of the federation of the
people which will follow their last great fight, right down to the end
of the century the final achievement of a federal organization remained
the ever recurring hope of a next great step in the advance of
civilization.12 Nineteenth-century liberals may not have been fully
aware how essential a complement of their principles a federal
organization of the different states formed;13 but there were few among
them who did not express their belief in it as an ultimate goal.14 It
was only with the approach of our twentieth century that before the
triumphant rise of Realpolitik these hopes came to be regarded as
unpracticable and utopian.</p>
<p>We shall not rebuild civilization on the large scale. It is no
accident that on the whole there was more beauty and decency to be found
in the life of the small peoples, and that among the large ones there
was more happiness and content in proportion as they had avoided the
deadly blight of centralization. Least of all shall we preserve
democracy or foster its growth if all the power and most of the
important decisions rest with an organization far too big for the common
man to survey or comprehend. Nowhere has democracy ever worked well
without a great measure of local self-government, providing a school of
political training for the people at large as much as for their future
leaders. It is only where responsibility can be learned and practiced in
affairs with which most people are familiar, where it is the awareness
of one’s neighbor rather than some theoretical knowledge of the needs of
other people which guides action, that the ordinary man can take a real
part in public affairs because they concern the world he knows. Where
the scope of the political measures becomes so large that the necessary
knowledge is almost exclusively possessed by the bureaucracy, the
creative impulses of the private person must flag. I believe that here
the experience of the small countries like Holland and Switzerland
contains much from which even the most fortunate larger countries like
Great Britain can learn. We shall all be the gainers if we can create a
world fit for small states to live in.</p>
<p>But the small can preserve their independence in the international as
in the national sphere only within a true system of law which guarantees
both that certain rules are invariably enforced and that the authority
which has the power to enforce these cannot use it for any other
purpose. While for its task of enforcing the common law the
supernational authority must be very powerful, its constitution must at
the same time be so designed that it prevents the international as well
as the national authorities from becoming tyrannical. We shall never
prevent the abuse of power if we are not prepared to limit power in a
way which occasionally may also prevent its use for desirable purposes.
The great opportunity we shall have at the end of this war is that the
great victorious powers, by themselves first submitting to a system of
rules which they have the power to enforce, may at the same time acquire
the moral right to impose the same rules upon others.</p>
<p>An international authority which effectively limits the powers of the
state over the individual will be one of the best safeguards of peace.
The international Rule of Law must become a safeguard as much against
the tyranny of the state over the individual as against the tyranny of
the new superstate over the national communities. Neither an omnipotent
superstate nor a loose association of “free nations” but a community of
nations of free men must be our goal. We have long pleaded that it had
become impossible to behave in international affairs as we thought it
desirable because others would not play the game. The coming settlement
will be the opportunity to show that we have been sincere and that we
are prepared to accept the same restrictions on our freedom of action
which in the common interest we think it necessary to impose upon
others.</p>
<p>Wisely used, the federal principle of organization may indeed prove
the best solution of some of the world’s most difficult problems. But
its application is a task of extreme difficulty, and we are not likely
to succeed if in an overambitious attempt we strain it beyond its
capacity. There will probably exist a strong tendency to make any new
international organization all-comprehensive and world-wide; and there
will, of course, be an imperative need for some such comprehensive
organization, some new League of Nations. The great danger is that, if
in the attempt to rely exclusively on this world organization it is
charged with all the tasks which it seems desirable to place in the
hands of an international organization, they will not in fact be
adequately performed. It has always been my conviction that such
ambitions were at the root of the weakness of the League of Nations:
that in the (unsuccessful) attempt to make it world-wide it had to be
made weak and that a smaller and at the same time more powerful League
might have been a better instrument to preserve peace. I believe that
these considerations still hold and that a degree of cooperation could
be achieved between, say, the British Empire and the nations of western
Europe and probably the United States which would not be possible on a
world scale. The comparatively close association which a federal union
represents will not at first be practicable beyond perhaps even as
narrow a region as part of western Europe, though it may be possible
gradually to extend it.</p>
<p>It is true that with the formation of such regional federations the
possibility of war between the different blocs still remains and that,
to reduce this risk as much as possible, we must rely on a larger and
looser association. My point is that the need for some such other
organization should not form an obstacle to a closer association of
those countries which are more similar in their civilization, outlook,
and standards. While we must aim at preventing future wars as much as
possible, we must not believe that we can at one stroke create a
permanent organization which will make all war in any part of the world
entirely impossible. Not only would we be unsuccessful in such an
attempt but we would thereby probably spoil our chances of achieving
success in a more limited sphere. As is true with respect to other great
evils, the measures by which war might be made altogether impossible for
the future may well be worse than even war itself. If we can reduce the
risk of friction likely to lead to war, this is probably all we can
reasonably hope to achieve.</p>

federalism has been the most efficacious and the most congenial.”

<p>2 On all these and on the following points, which can be touched upon
only very briefly, see Professor Lionel Robbins’s Economic Planning and
International Order (London: Macmillan, 1937), passim.</p>
<p>3 See particularly the significant book by James Burnham, The
Managerial Revolution, op. cit.</p>
<p>4 The experience in the colonial sphere, of Great Britain as much as
of any other, has amply shown that even the mild forms of planning which
Englishmen know as colonial development involve, whether they wish it or
not, the imposition of certain values and ideals on those whom they try
to assist. It is, indeed, this experience which has made even the most
internationally minded of colonial experts so very skeptical of the
practicability of an “international” administration of colonies.</p>
<p>5 If anyone should still fail to see the difficulties, or cherish the
belief that with a little good will they can all be overcome, it will
help if he tries to follow the implications of central direction of
economic activity applied on a world scale. Can there be much doubt that
this would mean a more or less conscious endeavor to secure the
dominance of the white man, and would rightly be so regarded by all
other races? Until I find a sane person who seriously believes that the
European races will voluntarily submit to their standard of life and
rate of progress being determined by a world parliament, I cannot regard
such plans as anything but absurd. But this does unfortunately not
preclude that particular measures, which could be justified only if the
principle of world direction were a feasible ideal, are seriously
advocated.</p>

observed in one of the weekly journals, “one had already begun to expect
a touch of the Carr flavour in the New Statesman pages as well as in

<p>10 It is a great pity that the flood of federalist publications which
in recent years has descended upon us has deprived the few important and
thoughtful works among them of the attention they deserved. One which in
particular ought to be carefully consulted when the time comes for the
framing of a new political structure of Europe is Dr. W. Ivor Jennings’s
small book on A Federation for Western Europe (New York: Macmillan, and
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1940). (Both Hayek and Lionel
Robbins were in favor of some form of federation for Europe; see Hayek’s
letters to The Spectator titled “War Aims” and “An Anglo-French
Federation,” reprinted in F. A. Hayek, Socialism and War, op. cit.,
pp. 161–64. —Ed.)</p>
<p>11 See on this the author’s article on “The Economic Conditions of
Inter-state Federalism,” New Commonwealth Quarterly, vol. 5, September
1939, pp. 131–49. (This article was subsequently reprinted in F. A.
Hayek, Individualism and Economic Order, op. cit., pp. 255–72. —Ed.)</p>
<p>12 (Hayek refers to Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s poem “Locksley Hall.” See
The Poetical Works of Alfred Lord Tennyson (Boston and New York:
Houghton Mifflin, 1892), p. 60, where a battle in the heavens is
concluded with the following lines:</p>
<p>Till the war-drum throbb’d no longer,</p>
<p>And the battle flags were furl’d</p>
<p>In the Parliament of man, the Federation</p>
<p>Of the world.</p>
<p>The poem begins with the bitter lament of a young man who had been
separated from his first love, his cousin, who had then gone on to marry
another. There are parallels with Hayek’s own life; see Bruce Caldwell,
Hayek’s Challenge, op. cit., p. 133, note 1. —Ed.)</p>

<p>14 As late as the closing years of the nineteenth century Henry
Sidgwick thought it “not beyond the limits of a sober forecast to
conjecture that some future integration may take place in the West
European states: and if it should take place, it seems probable that the
example of America will be followed, and that the new political
aggregate will be formed on the basis of a federal polity.” See Henry
Sidgwick, The Development of European Polity (London: Macmillan, 1903),
p. 439, published posthumously. (Sidgwick actually said that it is “not
beyond the limits of a sober forecast to conjecture that some further
integration may take place in the West European states. . . .” —Ed.)</p>
