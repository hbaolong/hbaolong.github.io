<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>The purpose of this book has not been to sketch a detailed program of
a desirable future order of society. If with regard to international
affairs we have gone a little beyond its essentially critical task, it
was because in this field we may soon be called upon to create a
framework within which future growth may have to proceed for a long time
to come. A great deal will depend on how we use the opportunity we shall
then have. But, whatever we do, it can only be the beginning of a new,
long, and arduous process in which we all hope we shall gradually create
a world very different from that which we knew during the last quarter
of a century.</p>
<p>It is at least doubtful whether at this stage a detailed blueprint of
a desirable internal order of society would be of much use—or whether
anyone is competent to furnish it. The important thing now is that we
shall come to agree on certain principles and free ourselves from some
of the errors which have governed us in the recent past. However
distasteful such an admission may be, we must recognize that we had
before this war once again reached a stage where it is more important to
clear away the obstacles with which human folly has encumbered our path
and to release the creative energy of individuals than to devise further
machinery for “guiding” and “directing” them—to create conditions
favorable to progress rather than to “plan progress.” The first need is
to free ourselves of that worst form of contemporary obscurantism which
tries to persuade us that what we have done in the recent past was all
either wise or inevitable. We shall not grow wiser before we learn that
much that we have done was very foolish.</p>
<p>If we are to build a better world, we must have the courage to make a
new start—even if that means some reculer pour mieux sauter.1 It is not
those who believe in inevitable tendencies who show this courage, not
those who preach a “New Order” which is no more than a projection of the
tendencies of the last forty years, and who can think of nothing better
than to imitate Hitler. It is, indeed, those who cry loudest for the New
Order who are most completely under the sway of the ideas which have
created this war and most of the evils from which we suffer. The young
are right if they have little confidence in the ideas which rule most of
their elders. But they are mistaken or misled when they believe that
these are still the liberal ideas of the nineteenth century, which, in
fact, the younger generation hardly knows. Though we neither can wish
nor possess the power to go back to the reality of the nineteenth
century, we have the opportunity to realize its ideals—and they were not
mean. We have little right to feel in this respect superior to our
grandfathers; and we should never forget that it is we, the twentieth
century, and not they, who have made a mess of things. If they had not
yet fully learned what was necessary to create the world they wanted,
the experience we have since gained ought to have equipped us better for
the task. If in the first attempt to create a world of free men we have
failed, we must try again. The guiding principle that a policy of
freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy remains
as true today as it was in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>1 (The phrase “reculer pour mieux sauter” is the recommendation to
back up a little before renewing one’s attack. The advice to “Drop back
and punt” might serve as a rough American equivalent. —Ed.)</p>
<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>
<p>The exposition of a point of view which for many years has been
decidedly out of favor suffers from the difficulty that, within the
compass of a few chapters, it is not possible to discuss more than some
aspects of it. For the reader whose outlook has been formed entirely by
the views that have been dominant during the last twenty years this will
scarcely be sufficient to provide the common ground required for
profitable discussion. But although unfashionable, the views of the
author of the present book are not so singular as they may appear to
some readers. His basic outlook is the same as that of a steadily
growing number of writers in many countries whose studies have led them
independently to similar conclusions. The reader who would like to
acquaint himself further with what he may have found an unfamiliar but
not uncongenial climate of opinion may find useful the following list of
some of the more important works of this kind, including several in
which the essentially critical character of the present essay is
supplemented by a fuller discussion of the structure of a desirable
future society. The earliest and still the most important of these works
is that by von Mises, originally published in 1922.</p>

<p>There are also important German and Italian works of a similar
character which, in consideration for their authors, it would be unwise
at present to mention by name.</p>
<p>To this list I add the titles of three books which more than any
others known to me help one to understand the system of ideas ruling our
enemies and the differences which separate their minds from ours,</p>
<p>Ashton, E. B. The Fascist: His State and Mind. London: Putnam,
1937.</p>

and Ward, 1940.</p>
<p>Kantorowicz, H. The Spirit of British Policy and the Myth of the
Encirclement of Germany. New York: Oxford University Press, 1932.</p>
<p>and that of a remarkable recent work on the modern history of Germany
which is not so well known abroad as it deserves:</p>
<p>Schnabel, Franz. Deutsche Geschichte im 19. Jahrhundert. 4 vols.
Freiburg im Breisgau, 1929–37.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best guides through some of our contemporary problems
will still be found in the works of some of the great political
philosophers of the liberal age, Tocque-ville or Lord Acton, and, to go
even further back, Benjamin Constant, Edmund Burke, and The Federalist
papers of Madison, Hamilton, and Jay—generations to whom liberty was
still a problem and a value to be defended, where ours at the same time
takes it for granted and neither realizes whence the danger threatens
nor has the courage to emancipate itself from the doctrines which
endanger it.</p>
