<h4 id="foreword-to-the-1956">FOREWORD TO THE 1956</h4>
<p>AMERICAN PAPERBACK EDITION</p>
<p>Although this book might in some respects have been different if I
had written it in the first instance with American readers primarily in
mind, it has by now made for itself too definite if unexpected a place
in this country to make any rewriting advisable. Its republication in a
new form, however, more than ten years after its first appearance, is
perhaps an appropriate occasion for explaining its original aim and for
a few comments on the altogether unforeseen and in many ways curious
success it has had in this country.</p>
<p>The book was written in England during the war years and was designed
almost exclusively for English readers. Indeed, it was addressed mainly
to a very special class of readers in England. It was in no spirit of
mockery that I dedicated it “To the Socialists of All Parties.” It had
its origin in many discussions which, during the preceding ten years, I
had with friends and colleagues whose sympathies had been inclined
toward the left, and it was in continuation of those arguments that I
wrote The Road to Serfdom.</p>
<p>When Hitler came into power in Germany, I had already been teaching
at the University of London for several years, but I kept in close touch
with affairs on the Continent and was able to do so until the outbreak
of war.1 What I had thus seen of the origins and evolution of the
various totalitarian movements made me feel that English public opinion,
particularly among my friends who held “advanced” views on social
matters, completely misconceived the nature of those movements. Even
before the war I was led by this to state in a brief essay what became
the central argument of this book.2 But after war broke out I felt that
this widespread misunderstanding of the political systems of our
enemies, and soon also of our new ally, Russia, constituted a serious
danger which had to be met by a more systematic effort. Also, it was
already fairly obvious that England herself was likely to experiment
after the war with the same kind of policies which I was convinced had
contributed so much to destroy liberty elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thus this book gradually took shape as a warning to the socialist
intelligentsia of England; with the inevitable delays of wartime
production, it finally appeared there early in the spring of 1944. This
date will, incidentally, also explain why I felt that in order to get a
hearing I had somewhat to restrain myself in my comments on the regime
of our wartime ally3 and to choose my illustrations mainly from
developments in Germany.</p>
<p>It seems that the book appeared at a propitious moment, and I can
feel only gratification at the success it had in England, which, though
very different in kind, was quantitatively no smaller than it was to be
in the United States. On the whole, the book was taken in the spirit in
which it was written, and its argument was seriously examined by those
to whom it was mainly addressed. Excepting only certain of the leading
politicians of the Labour party—who, as if to provide an illustration
for my remarks on the nationalist tendencies of socialism, attacked the
book on the ground that it was written by a foreigner4 — the thoughtful
and receptive manner in which it was generally examined by persons who
must have found its conclusions running counter to their strongest
convictions was deeply impressive.5 The same applies also to the other
European countries where the book eventually appeared; and its
particularly cordial reception by the post-Nazi generation of Germany,
when copies of a translation published in Switzerland at last reached
that country, was one of the unforeseen pleasures I derived from its
publication.</p>
<p>Rather different was the reception the book had in the United States
when it was published here a few months after its appearance in England.
I had given little thought to its possible appeal to American readers
when writing it. It was then twenty years since I had last been in
America as a research student, and during that time I had somewhat lost
touch with the development of American ideas.6 I could not be sure how
far my argument had direct relevance to the American scene, and I was
not in the least surprised when the book was in fact rejected by the
first three publishing houses approached.7 It was certainly most
unexpected when, after the book was brought out by its present
publishers, it soon began to sell at a rate almost unprecedented for a
book of this kind, not intended for popular consumption.8 And I was even
more surprised by the violence of the reaction from both political
wings, by the lavish praise the book received from some quarters no less
than by the passionate hatred it appeared to arouse in others.</p>
<p>C.ntrary to my experience in England, in America the kind of people
to whom this book was mainly addressed seem to have rejected it out of
hand as a malicious and disingenuous attack on their finest ideals; they
appear never to have paused to examine its argument. The language used
and the emotion shown in some of the more adverse criticism the book
received were indeed rather extraordinary.9 But scarcely less surprising
to me was the enthusiastic welcome accorded to the book by many whom I
never expected to read a volume of this type—and from many more of whom
I still doubt whether in fact they ever read it. And I must add that
occasionally the manner in which it was used vividly brought home to me
the truth of Lord Acton’s observation that “at all times sincere friends
of freedom have been rare, and its triumphs have been due to minorities,
that have prevailed by associating themselves with auxiliaries whose
objects often differed from their own; and this association, which is
always dangerous, has sometimes been disastrous.”10</p>
<p>It seems hardly likely that this extraordinary difference in the
reception of the book on the two sides of the Atlantic is due entirely
to a difference in national temperament. I have since become
increasingly convinced that the explanation must lie in a difference of
intellectual situation at the time when it arrived. In England, and in
Europe generally, the problems with which I dealt had long ceased to be
abstract questions. The ideals which I examined had long before come
down to earth, and even their most enthusiastic adherents had already
seen concretely some of the difficulties and unlooked-for results which
their application produced. I was thus writing about phenomena of which
almost all my European readers had some more or less close experience,
and I was merely arguing systematically and consistently what many had
already intuitively felt. There was already a disillusionment about
these ideals under way, which their critical examination merely made
more vocal or explicit.</p>
<p>In the United States, on the other hand, these ideals were still
fresh and more virulent. It was only ten or fifteen years earlier—not
forty or fifty, as in England—that a large part of the intelligentsia
had caught the infection. And, in spite of the experimentation of the
New Deal, their enthusiasm for the new kind of rationally constructed
society was still largely unsoiled by practical experience. What to most
Europeans had in some measure become vieux jeux was to the American
radicals still the glittering hope of a better world which they had
embraced and nourished during the recent years of the Great
Depression.</p>
<p>Opinion moves fast in the United States, and even now it is difficult
to remember how comparatively short a time it was before The Road to
Serfdom appeared that the most extreme kind of economic planning had
been seriously advocated and the model of Russia held up for imitation
by men who were soon to play an important role in public affairs. It
would be easy enough to give chapter and verse for this, but it would be
invidious now to single out individuals. Be it enough to mention that in
1934 the newly established National Planning Board11 devoted a good deal
of attention to the example of planning provided by these four
countries: Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan. Ten years later we had of
course learned to refer to these same countries as “totalitarian,” had
fought a long war with three of them, and were soon to start a “cold
war” with the fourth. Yet the contention of this book that the political
development in those countries had something to do with their economic
policies was then still indignantly rejected by the advocates of
planning in this country. It suddenly became the fashion to deny that
the inspiration of planning had come from Russia and to contend, as one
of my eminent critics put it, that it was “a plain fact that Italy,
Russia, Japan, and Germany all reached totalitarianism by very different
roads.”12</p>
<p>The whole intellectual climate in the United States at the time The
Road to Serfdom appeared was thus one in which it was bound either
profoundly to shock or greatly to delight the members of sharply divided
groups. In consequence, in spite of its apparent success, the book has
not had here the kind of effect I should have wished or which it has had
elsewhere. It is true that its main conclusions are today widely
accepted. If twelve years ago it seemed to many almost sacrilege to
suggest that fascism and communism are merely variants of the same
totalitarianism which central control of all economic activity tends to
produce, this has become almost a commonplace. It is now even widely
recognized that democratic socialism is a very precarious and unstable
affair, riven with internal contradictions and everywhere producing
results most distasteful to many of its advocates.</p>
<p>For this sobered mood the lessons of events and more popular
discussions of the problem13 are certainly more responsible than this
book. Nor was my general thesis as such original when it was published.
Although similar but earlier warnings may have been largely forgotten,
the dangers inherent in the policies which I criticized had been pointed
out again and again. Whatever merits this book possesses consist not in
the reiteration of this thesis but in the patient and detailed
examination of the reasons why economic planning will produce such
unlooked-for results and of the process by which they come about.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I rather hope that the time may now be
more favorable in America for a serious consideration of the true
argument of the book than it was when it first appeared. I believe that
what is important in it still has to render its service, although I
recognize that the hot socialism against which it was mainly
directed—that organized movement toward a deliberate organization of
economic life by the state as the chief owner of the means of
production— is nearly dead in the Western world. The century of
socialism in this sense probably came to an end around 1948. Many of its
illusions have been discarded even by its leaders, and elsewhere as well
as in the United States the very name has lost much of its attraction.
Attempts will no doubt be made to rescue the name for movements which
are less dogmatic, less doctrinaire, and less systematic. But an
argument applicable solely against those clear-cut conceptions of social
reform which characterized the socialist movements of the past might
today well appear as tilting against windmills.</p>
<p>Yet though hot socialism is probably a thing of the past, some of its
conceptions have penetrated far too deeply into the whole structure of
current thought to justify complacency. If few people in the Western
world now want to remake society from the bottom according to some ideal
blueprint, a great many still believe in measures which, though not
designed completely to remodel the economy, in their aggregate effect
may well unintentionally produce this result. And, even more than at the
time when I wrote this book, the advocacy of policies which in the long
run cannot be reconciled with the preservation of a free society is no
longer a party matter. That hodgepodge of ill-assembled and often
inconsistent ideals which under the name of the Welfare State has
largely replaced socialism as the goal of the reformers needs very
careful sorting out if its results are not to be very similar to those
of full-fledged socialism. This is not to say that some of its aims are
not both practicable and laudable. But there are many ways in which we
can work toward the same goal, and in the present state of opinion there
is some danger that our impatience for quick results may lead us to
choose instruments which, though perhaps more efficient for achieving
the particular ends, are not compatible with the preservation of a free
society. The increasing tendency to rely on administrative coercion and
discrimination where a modification of the general rules of law might,
perhaps more slowly, achieve the same object, and to resort to direct
state controls or to the creation of monopolistic institutions where
judicious use of financial inducements might evoke spontaneous efforts,
is still a powerful legacy of the socialist period which is likely to
influence policy for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Just because in the years ahead of us political ideology is not
likely to aim at a clearly defined goal but toward piecemeal change, a
full understanding of the process through which certain kinds of
measures can destroy the bases of an economy based on the market and
gradually smother the creative powers of a free civilization seems now
of the greatest importance. Only if we understand why and how certain
kinds of economic controls tend to paralyze the driving forces of a free
society, and which kinds of measures are particularly dangerous in this
respect, can we hope that social experimentation will not lead us into
situations none of us want.</p>
<p>It is as a contribution to this task that this book is intended. I
hope that at least in the quieter atmosphere of the present it will be
received as what it was meant to be, not as an exhortation to resistance
against any improvement or experimentation, but as a warning that we
should insist that any modification in our arrangements should pass
certain tests (described in the central chapter on the Rule of Law)
before we commit ourselves to courses from which withdrawal may be
difficult.</p>
<p>The fact that this book was originally written with only the British
public in mind does not appear to have seriously affected its
intelligibility for the American reader. But there is one point of
phraseology which I ought to explain here to forestall any
misunderstanding. I use throughout the term “liberal” in the original,
nineteenth-century sense in which it is still current in Britain. In
current American usage it often means very nearly the opposite of this.
It has been part of the camouflage of leftish movements in this country,
helped by the muddleheadedness of many who really believe in liberty,
that “liberal” has come to mean the advocacy of almost every kind of
government control. I am still puzzled why those in the United States
who truly believe in liberty should not only have allowed the left to
appropriate this almost indispensable term but should even have assisted
by beginning to use it themselves as a term of opprobrium. This seems to
be particularly regrettable because of the consequent tendency of many
true liberals to describe themselves as conservatives.</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that in the struggle against the believers in
the all-powerful state the true liberal must sometimes make common cause
with the conservative, and in some circumstances, as in contemporary
Britain, he has hardly any other way of actively working for his ideals.
But true liberalism is still distinct from conservatism, and there is
danger in the two being confused.14 Conservatism, though a necessary
element in any stable society, is not a social program; in its
paternalistic, nationalistic, and power-adoring tendencies it is often
closer to socialism than true liberalism; and with its traditionalistic,
anti-intellectual, and often mystical propensities it will never, except
in short periods of disillusionment, appeal to the young and all those
others who believe that some changes are desirable if this world is to
become a better place. A conservative movement, by its very nature, is
bound to be a defender of established privilege and to lean on the power
of government for the protection of privilege. The essence of the
liberal position, however, is the denial of all privilege, if privilege
is understood in its proper and original meaning of the state granting
and protecting rights to some which are not available on equal terms to
others.</p>
<p>Perhaps a further word of apology is required for my allowing this
book to reappear in entirely unchanged form after the lapse of almost
twelve years. I have many times tried to revise it, and there are
numerous points I should like to explain at greater length or to state
more cautiously or to fortify by more illustration and proof. But all
attempts at rewriting only proved that I could never again produce as
short a book covering as much of the field; and it seems to me that,
whatever other merits it may have, its relative brevity is its greatest.
I have thus been forced to the conclusion that whatever I want to add to
the argument I must attempt in separate studies. I have begun to do so
in various essays, some of which provide a more searching discussion of
certain philosophical and economic issues on which the present book only
touches.15 On the special question of the roots of the ideas here
criticized and of their connection with some of the most powerful and
impressive intellectual movements of this age, I have commented in
another volume.16 And before long I hope to supplement the all-too-brief
central chapter of this book by a more extensive treatment of the
relation between equality and justice.17</p>
<p>There is one particular topic, however, on which the reader will with
justice expect me to comment on this occasion, yet which I could even
less treat adequately without writing a new book. Little more than a
year after The Road to Serfdom first appeared, Great Britain had a
socialist government which remained in power for six years. And the
question of how far this experience has confirmed or refuted my
apprehensions is one which I must try to answer at least briefly. If
anything, this experience has strengthened my concern and, I believe I
may add, has taught the reality of the difficulties I pointed out to
many for whom an abstract argument would never have carried conviction.
Indeed, it was not long after the Labour government came into power that
some of the issues which my critics in America dismissed as bogeys
became in Great Britain main topics of political discussion. Soon even
official documents were gravely discussing the danger of totalitarianism
raised by the policy of economic planning. There is no better
illustration of the manner in which the inherent logic of their policies
drove an unwilling socialist government into the kind of coercion it
disliked than the following passage in the Economic Survey for 1947
(which the Prime Minister presented to Parliament in February of that
year) and its sequel:</p>
<p>There is an essential difference between totalitarian and democratic
planning. The former subordinates all individual desires and preferences
to the demand of the State. For this purpose, it uses various methods of
compulsion upon the individual which deprive him of his freedom of
choice. Such methods may be necessary even in a democratic country
during the extreme emergency of a great war. Thus the British people
gave their war time Government the power to direct labour. But in normal
times the people of a democratic country will not give up their freedom
of choice to their Government. A democratic Government must therefore
conduct its economic planning in a manner which preserves the maximum
possible freedom of choice to the individual citizen.18</p>
<p>The interesting point about this profession of laudable intentions is
that six months later the same government found itself in peacetime
forced to put the conscription of labor back on the statute book.19 It
hardly diminishes the significance of this when it is pointed out that
the power was in fact never used because, if it is known that the
authorities have power to coerce, few will wait for actual coercion. But
it is rather difficult to see how the government could have persisted in
its illusions when in the same document it claims that it was now for
“the Government to say what is the best use for the resources in the
national interest” and to “lay down the economic task for the nation: it
must say which things are the most important and what the objectives of
policy ought to be.”20</p>
<p>Of course, six years of socialist government in England have not
produced anything resembling a totalitarian state. But those who argue
that this has disproved the thesis of The Road to Serfdom have really
missed one of its main points: that the most important change which
extensive government control produces is a psychological change, an
alteration in the character of the people. This is necessarily a slow
affair, a process which extends not over a few years but perhaps over
one or two generations. The important point is that the political ideals
of a people and its attitude toward authority are as much the effect as
the cause of the political institutions under which it lives. This
means, among other things, that even a strong tradition of political
liberty is no safeguard if the danger is precisely that new institutions
and policies will gradually undermine and destroy that spirit. The
consequences can of course be averted if that spirit reasserts itself in
time and the people not only throw out the party which has been leading
them further and further in the dangerous direction but also recognize
the nature of the danger and resolutely change their course. There is
not yet much ground to believe that the latter has happened in
England.</p>
<p>Yet the change undergone by the character of the British people, not
merely under its Labour government but in the course of the much longer
period during which it has been enjoying the blessings of a
paternalistic welfare state, can hardly be mistaken. These changes are
not easily demonstrated but are clearly felt if one lives in the
country. In illustration, I will cite a few significant passages from a
sociological survey dealing with the impact of the surfeit of regulation
on the mental attitudes of the young. It is concerned with the situation
before the Labour government came into power, in fact, about the time
this book was first published, and deals mainly with the effects of
those wartime regulations which the Labour government made
permanent:</p>
<p>It is above all in the city that the province of the optional is felt
as dwindling away to nothing. At school, in the place of work, on the
journey to and fro, even in the very equipment and provisioning of the
home, many of the activities normally possible to human beings are
either forbidden or enjoined. Special agencies, called Citizen’s Advice
Bureaus, are set up to steer the bewildered through the forest of rules,
and to indicate to the persistent the rare clearings where a private
person may still make a choice. . . . [The town lad] is conditioned not
to lift a finger without referring mentally to the book of words first.
A time-budget of an ordinary city youth for an ordinary working day
would show that he spends great stretches of his waking hours going
through motions that have been predetermined for him by directives in
whose framing he has had no part, whose precise intention he seldom
understands, and of whose appropriateness he cannot judge. . . . The
inference that what the city lad needs is more discipline and tighter
control is too hasty. It would be nearer the mark to say that he is
suffering from an overdose of control already. . . . Surveying his
parents and his older brothers or sisters he finds them as regulation
bound as himself. He sees them so acclimatised to that state that they
seldom plan and carry out under their own steam any new social excursion
or enterprise. He thus looks forward to no future period at which a
sinewy faculty of responsibility is likely to be of service to himself
or others. . . . [The young people] are obliged to stomach so much
external and, as it seems to them, meaningless control that they seek
escape and recuperation in an absence of discipline as complete as they
can make it.21</p>
<p>Is it too pessimistic to fear that a generation grown up under these
conditions is unlikely to throw off the fetters to which it has grown
used? Or does this description not rather fully bear out Tocqueville’s
prediction of the “new kind of servitude” when</p>
<p>after having thus successively taken each member of the community in
its powerful grasp, and fashioned him at will, the supreme power then
extends its arm over the whole community. It covers the surface of
society with a network of small complicated rules, minute and uniform,
through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters
cannot penetrate to rise above the crowd. The will of man is not
shattered but softened, bent and guided; men are seldom forced by it to
act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does
not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it
compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each
nation is reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid and
industrial animals, of which government is the shepherd.—I have always
thought that servitude of the regular, quiet, and gentle kind which I
have just described might be combined more easily than is commonly
believed with some of the outward forms of freedom and that it might
even establish itself under the wing of the sovereignty of the
people.22</p>
<p>What Tocqueville did not consider was how long such a government
would remain in the hands of benevolent despots when it would be so much
more easy for any group of ruffians to keep itself indefinitely in power
by disregarding all the traditional decencies of political life.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should also remind the reader that I have never accused the
socialist parties of deliberately aiming at a totalitarian regime or
even suspected that the leaders of the old socialist movements might
ever show such inclinations. What I have argued in this book, and what
the British experience convinces me even more to be true, is that the
unforeseen but inevitable consequences of socialist planning create a
state of affairs in which, if the policy is to be pursued, totalitarian
forces will get the upper hand. I explicitly stress that “socialism can
be put into practice only by methods of which most socialists
disapprove” and even add that in this “the old socialist parties were
inhibited by their democratic ideals” and that “they did not possess the
ruthlessness required for the performance of their chosen task.”23 I am
afraid the impression one gained under the Labour government was that
these inhibitions were if anything weaker among the British socialists
than they had been among their German fellow-socialists twenty-five
years earlier. Certainly the German Social Democrats, in the comparable
period of the 1920s, under equally or more difficult economic
conditions, never approached as closely to totalitarian planning as the
British Labour government has done.</p>
<p>Since I cannot here examine the effect of these policies in detail, I
will rather quote the summary judgments of other observers who may be
less suspect of preconceived opinions. Some of the most damning, in
fact, come from men who not long before had themselves been members of
the Labour party. Thus Mr. Ivor Thomas, in a book apparently intended to
explain why he left that party, comes to the conclusion that “from the
point of view of fundamental human liberties there is little to choose
between communism, socialism, and national socialism. They all are
examples of the collectivist or totalitarian state . . . in its
essentials not only is completed socialism the same as communism but it
hardly differs from fascism.”24</p>
<p>The most serious development is the growth of a measure of arbitrary
administrative coercion and the progressive destruction of the cherished
foundation of British liberty, the Rule of Law, for exactly the reasons
here discussed in chapter 6. This process had of course started long
before the last Labour government came into power and had been
accentuated by the war. But the attempts at economic planning under the
Labour government carried it to a point which makes it doubtful whether
it can be said that the Rule of Law still prevails in Britain. The “New
Despotism” of which a Lord Chief Justice had warned Britain as long as
twenty-five years ago is, as The Economist recently observed, no longer
a mere danger but an established fact.25 It is a despotism exercised by
a thoroughly conscientious and honest bureaucracy for what they
sincerely believe is the good of the country. But it is nevertheless an
arbitrary government, in practice free from effective parliamentary
control; and its machinery would be as effective for any other than the
beneficent purposes for which it is now used. I doubt whether it was
much exaggerated when recently an eminent British jurist, in a careful
analysis of these trends, came to the conclusions that “in Britain
to-day, we live on the edge of dictatorship. Transition would be easy,
swift, and it could be accomplished with complete legality. Already so
many steps have been taken in this direction, due to the completeness of
power possessed by the Government of the day, and the absence of any
real check such as the terms of a written constitution or the existence
of an effective second chamber, that those still to be taken are small
in comparison.”26</p>
<p>For a more detailed analysis of the economic policies of the British
Labour government and its consequences I cannot do better than refer the
reader to Professor John Jewkes’s Ordeal by Planning (London: Macmillan
&amp; Co., 1948). It is the best discussion known to me of a concrete
instance of the phenomena discussed in general terms in this book. It
supplements it better than anything I could add here and spells out a
lesson which is of significance far beyond Great Britain.</p>
<p>It seems now unlikely that, even when another Labour government
should come into power in Great Britain, it would resume the experiments
in large-foreword scale nationalization and planning. But in Britain, as
elsewhere in the world, the defeat of the onslaught of systematic
socialism has merely given those who are anxious to preserve freedom a
breathing space in which to re-examine our ambitions and to discard all
those parts of the socialist inheritance which are a danger to a free
society. Without such a revised conception of our social aims, we are
likely to continue to drift in the same direction in which outright
socialism would merely have carried us a little faster.</p>
<p>F. A. Hayek</p>
<p>1 [Hayek was a visiting professor in the Economics Department at the
London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) during the
1931–32 academic year, at the end of which he was appointed to the Tooke
Chair of Economic Science and Statistics. The chair was founded at
King’s College, London, in 1859, the year after Thomas Tooke died. In
1919 the chair was transferred from King’s to the LSE, both of which
were then part of the University of London. Though Hayek’s appointment
was technically with the University of London, his teaching took place
at the LSE. —Ed.]</p>

<p>5 The most representative example of British criticism of the book
from a left-wing point of view is probably Mrs. Barbara Wootton’s
courteous and frank study, Freedom under Planning, op. cit. It is often
quoted in the United States as an effective refutation of my argument,
though I cannot help feeling that more than one reader must have gained
the impression that, as one American reviewer expressed it, “it seems
substantially to confirm Hayek’s thesis.” See Chester I. Barnard,
“Review of Freedom under Planning,” Southern Economic Journal, vol. 12,
January 1946, p. 290.</p>

May 1924. —Ed.]</p>
<p>7 I did not know then, as has since been admitted by a person
advising one of the firms, that this appears to have been due not to any
doubts of the success of the book but to political prejudice, which went
to the extent of representing the book as “unfit for publication by a
reputable house.” See on this the statement by William Miller quoted by
W. T. Couch in “The Sainted Book Burners,” The Freeman, vol. 5, April
1955, p. 423, and also William Miller, The Book Industry: A Report of
the Public Library Inquiry of the Social Science Research Council (New
York: Columbia University Press, 1949), p. 12. [The first printing of
Miller’s book on the book industry contained the following sentence:
“That university presses have done this is suggested by the publication
and promotion by the University of Chicago Press a few years ago of
Friedrich A. von Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom, a sensational book
previously rejected by at least one notable trade house which was quite
aware of its sales possibilities.” What university presses “had done”
was to try to increase their profits by looking for profitable
best-sellers, regardless of quality. W. T. Couch, then director of the
University of Chicago Press, sent Miller a letter on October 7, 1949,
stating that Miller had his facts wrong. Couch provided documentary
evidence that the Press did not expect a big market for the book, and
demanded a retraction of the sentence from subsequent printings of
Miller’s book. In his reply to Couch, Miller acquiesced to the removal
of the offending lines in subsequent printings, but also called Hayek’s
book “a despicable performance” and went on to make the statements,
reproduced by Couch in his article in The Freeman, that Hayek alludes to
in his note. —Ed.]</p>
<p>8 Not a little of this was due to the publication of a condensation
of this book in the Reader’s Digest, and I should like to pay here to
the editors of this journal a public testimony to the extremely skillful
manner in which this was done without my assistance. It is inevitable
that the compression of a complex argument to a fraction of its original
length produces some oversimplification, but that it was done without
distortion and better than I could have done it myself is a remarkable
achievement. [Hayek discusses this episode at more length in Hayek on
Hayek, op. cit., 104–5; cf. my introduction to this volume, pp. 18–22.

<p>9 To any reader who would like to see a specimen of abuse and
invective which is probably unique in contemporary academic discussion I
recommend a reading of Professor Herman Finer’s Road to Reaction, op.
cit. [Hayek briefly considered filing a libel suit, and ultimately sent
Finer a letter breaking off relations with him. For more on the Finer

England, and founder-editor of the Cambridge Modern History, to which he

interested in the psychology of a planning bureaucracy. [The Economist
article Hayek refers to is, “What Is the Public Interest?” vol. 171,
June 19, 1954, pp. 951–52. The article notes how, in 1937, the Air
Ministry bought against the opposition of its owners a tract of land for
a bombing range. The land, part of three farms, was located in Crichel
Down, Dorset. After the war the land was transferred to other government
ministries and ultimately upgraded and sold to a new buyer. During the
whole period the original owners tried unsuccessfully to buy or rent
their land back. The episode was taken by The Economist as providing
“evidence to confirm a suspicion that has been growing on the general
public for some time past—that the bureaucracy in Britain has grown
arrogantly careless of the rights of the subject” (p. 951). The Lord
Chief Justice Hayek refers to in the text is Gordon Hewart, First Baron
of Bury (1870–1943), who held the position from 1922–1940. In his book
The New Despotism (London: Ernest Benn, Ltd., 1929; reprinted, Westport,
CT: Greenwood Press, 1975), Hewart criticized Acts of Parliament whose
provisions give broad discretion to the ministers and departments that
are responsible for carrying them out, discretion that enables them to
interpret the Acts as they see fit, without review or meaningful appeal,
and even to amend the Acts themselves. Hewart believed that this had
“the effect of placing a large and increasing field of departmental
authority beyond the reach of the ordinary law” (p. 11). —Ed.]</p>

<p>PREFACE TO THE 1976 EDITION</p>
<p>This book, written in my spare time from 1940 to 1943, while my mind
was still mainly occupied with problems of pure economic theory, has
unexpectedly become for me the starting point of more than thirty years’
work in a new field. This first attempt in the new direction was caused
by my annoyance with the complete misinterpretation in English
“progressive” circles of the character of the Nazi movement, an
annoyance which led me from a memorandum to the then director of the
London School of Economics, Sir William Beveridge, through an article in
the Contemporary Review for 1938, which at the request of Professor
Harry G. Gideonse of the University of Chicago I enlarged for
publication in his Public Policy Pamphlets,1 and which, finally and
reluctantly, when I found that all my more competent British colleagues
were preoccupied with more urgent problems of the conduct of the war, I
expanded into this tract for the times. In spite of the wholly
unexpected success of the book—in the case of the initially
not-contemplated American edition even greater than in that of the
British one—I felt for a long time not altogether happy about it. Though
I had frankly declared at the outset of the book that it was a political
one, I was made to feel by most of my fellow social scientists that I
had used my abilities on the wrong side, and I was myself uncomfortable
about the possibility that in going beyond technical economics I might
have exceeded my competence. I will not speak here about the fury which
the book caused in certain circles, or of the curious difference between
its reception in Great Britain and that in the United States—about that
I did say something twenty years ago in the Preface to the first
American paperback edition. Just to indicate the character of a
widespread reaction, I will mention merely that one well-known
philosopher, who shall be nameless, wrote to another to reproach him for
having lauded this scandalous book, which “of course [he] had not
read”!2</p>
<p>But though I tried hard to get back to economics proper, I could not
free myself of the feeling that the problems on which I had so
undesignedly embarked were more challenging and important than those of
economic theory, and that much that I had said in my first sketch needed
clarification and elaboration. When I wrote the book, I had by no means
sufficiently freed myself from all the prejudices and superstitions
dominating general opinion, and even less had I learned to avoid all the
prevalent confusions of terms and concepts of which I have since become
very conscious. And the discussion of the consequences of socialist
policies which the book attempts is of course not complete without an
adequate account of what an appropriately run market order requires and
can achieve. It was to the latter problem that the further work I have
since done in the field was mainly devoted. The first result of these
efforts of explaining the nature of an order of freedom was a
substantial book called The Constitution of Liberty (1960) in which I
essentially attempted to restate and make more coherent the doctrines of
classical nineteenth-century liberalism. The awareness that such a
restatement left certain important questions unanswered led me then to a
further effort to provide my own answers in a work of three volumes
entitled Law, Legislation, and Liberty, of which the first volume
appeared in 1973.3</p>
<p>In the last twenty years, I have, I believe, learned much about the
problems discussed in this book, though I don’t think I ever reread the
book during this time. Having done so now for the purpose of this
Preface, I feel no longer apologetic, but for the first time am rather
proud of it—and not least of the insight which made me dedicate it “To
the Socialists of All Parties.” Indeed, though I have in the interval
learned much that I did not know when I wrote it, I was now often
surprised by how much I did already see at the beginning of my efforts
that later work has confirmed; and though my later efforts will, I hope,
be more rewarding to the expert, I am now prepared unhesitatingly to
recommend this early book to the general reader who wants a simple and
nontechnical introduction to what I believe is still one of the most
ominous questions which we have to solve.</p>
<p>The reader will probably ask whether this means that I am still
prepared to defend all the main conclusions of this book, and the answer
to this is on the whole affirmative. The most important qualification I
must add is that during the interval of time terminology has changed and
for this reason what I say in the book may be misunderstood. At the time
I wrote, socialism meant unambiguously the nationalization of the means
of production and the central economic planning which this made possible
and necessary. In this sense Sweden, for instance, is today very much
less socialistically organized than Great Britain or Austria, though
Sweden is commonly regarded as much more socialistic. This is due to the
fact that socialism has come to mean chiefly the extensive
redistribution of incomes through taxation and the institutions of the
welfare state. In the latter kind of socialism the effects I discuss in
this book are brought about more slowly, indirectly, and imperfectly. I
believe that the ultimate outcome tends to be very much the same,
although the process by which it is brought about is not quite the same
as that described in this book.</p>
<p>It has frequently been alleged that I have contended that any
movement in the direction of socialism is bound to lead to
totalitarianism. Even though this danger exists, this is not what the
book says. What it contains is a warning that unless we mend the
principles of our policy, some very unpleasant consequences will follow
which most of those who advocate these policies do not want.</p>
<p>Where I now feel I was wrong in this book is chiefly in that I rather
under-stressed the significance of the experience of communism in
Russia—a fault which is perhaps pardonable when it is remembered that
when I wrote, Russia was our wartime ally—and that I had not wholly
freed myself from all the current interventionist superstitions, and in
consequence still made various concessions which I now think
unwarranted. And I certainly was not yet fully aware how bad things
already were in some respects. I still regarded it, for example, as a
rhetorical question when I asked, If Hitler had obtained his unlimited
powers in a strictly constitutional manner, “who would suggest that the
Rule of Law still prevailed in Germany?” only to discover later that
professors Hans Kelsen and Harold J. Laski, and probably many other
socialist lawyers and political scientists following these influential
authors, had maintained precisely this.4 Quite generally, further study
of the contemporary trends of thought and institutions has, if anything,
increased my alarm and concern. And both the influence of socialist
ideas and the naïve trust in the good intentions of the holders of
totalitarian power have markedly increased since I wrote this book.</p>
<p>I have long resented being more widely known by what I regarded as a
pamphlet for the time than by my strictly scientific work. After
reexamining what I wrote then in the light of some thirty years’ further
study of the problems then raised, I no longer do so. Though the book
may contain much that I could not, when I wrote it, have convincingly
demonstrated, it was a genuine effort to find the truth which I believe
has produced insights that will help even those who disagree with me to
avoid grave dangers.</p>
