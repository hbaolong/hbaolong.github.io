<h4 id="planning-for-uncertainty">2. Planning for uncertainty</h4>
<p>Uncertainty – in the economy, society, politics – has become so great
as to render futile, if not counterproductive, the kind of planning most
companies still practise: forecasting based on probabilities.</p>
<p>Unique events, such as the Perot phenomenon or the dissolution of the
Soviet Empire, have no probability. Yet executives have to make
decisions that commit to the future current resources of time and money.
Worse, they have to make decisions not to commit resources – to forgo
the future. The lengths of such commitments are steadily growing: in
strategy and technology, marketing, manufacturing, employee development,
in the time it takes to bring a new plant on stream or in the years
until a commitment to a store location pays for itself. Every such
commitment is based on assumptions about the future. To arrive at them,
traditional planning asks ‘What is most likely to happen?’ Planning for
uncertainty asks, instead, ‘What has already happened that will create
the future?’</p>
<p>The first place to look is in demographics. Nearly everybody who will
be in the labour force of the developed countries in the year 2010 is
already alive today. There have been two revolutionary changes in the
workforce of developed countries: the explosion of advanced education
and the rush of women into careers outside the home. Both are
accomplished facts. The shift from blue-collar labour to knowledge and
service workers as the centres of population gravity is irrevocable. But
so is the ageing of both the workforce and population.</p>
<p>Business people need to ask: ‘What do these accomplished facts mean
for our business? What opportunities do they create? What threats? What
changes do they demand – in the way the business is organized and run,
in our goals, in our products, in our services, in our policies? And
what changes do they make possible and likely to be advantageous?’</p>
<p>The next question is: ‘What changes in industry and market structure,
in basic values (e.g. the emphasis on the environment), and in science
and technology have already occurred but have yet to have full impact?’
It is commonly believed that innovations create changes – but very few
do. Successful innovations exploit changes that have already happened.
They exploit the time lag – in science, often twenty-five or thirty
years – between the change itself and its perception and acceptance.
During that time the exploiter of the change rarely faces much, if any,
competition. The other people in the industry still operate on the basis
of yesterday’s reality. And once such a change has happened, it usually
survives even extreme turbulence.</p>
<p>The First World War, the Depression, and the Second World War had no
impact on such trends except to accelerate them. Examples are the shift
of freight traffic from railways to roads, the shift to the telephone as
a primary carrier of communications over distance, and the shift to the
hospital as the centre of sickness care.</p>
<p>Closely related are the next questions: ‘What are the trends in
economic and societal structure? And how do they affect our business?’
Since 1900, the unit of labour needed for an additional unit of
manufacturing output has been going down steadily at a compound rate of
about 1 per cent a year. Since the end of the Second World War the unit
of raw materials needed for an additional unit of manufacturing output
has been decreasing at the same rate. Since around 1950, the unit of
energy needed for an additional unit of manufacturing output has also
been going down steadily at that rate too. But from the 1880s, since the
telephone and Frederick Winslow Taylor’s Principles of Scientific
Management, the amounts of information and knowledge needed for each
additional unit of output have been going up steadily at a compound rate
of 1 per cent a year – the rate at which businesses have added educated
people to their payrolls.</p>
<p>Indeed, the computer may well have been a response to this
information explosion rather than its cause. Similar structural trends
can be found in most industries and markets. They do not make the
‘weather’ for an industry or a company – they create the ‘climate’. Over
any short-term period their effects are slight. But in the not-so-long
run these structural trends are of far greater importance than the
short-term fluctuations to which economists, politicians, and executives
give all their attention.</p>
<p>Whoever exploits structural trends is almost certain to succeed. It
is hard, however, to fight them in the short run and almost hopeless in
the long run. When such a structural trend peters out or when it
reverses itself (which is fairly rare), those who continue as before
face extinction and those who change fast face opportunity.</p>
<p>The most important structural trends are those that many executives
have never heard of: the distribution of consumers’ disposable income.
They are particularly important in a time of uncertainty like today’s.
At such a time, these trends tend to change – and to change fast.</p>
<p>For the past one hundred years most of the tremendous increase in
wealth-producing capacity and personal incomes – a fiftyfold increase in
the developed countries – has been spent on greater leisure, on health
care, and on education. These three, in other words, were the dominant
growth areas of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Will they continue in that role? For leisure the answer is almost
certainly ’no‘. Health-care spending as a percentage of consumer income
is more than likely to be capped in the next decade despite the increase
in the number of old people and the advances in medicine. Education
should continue its growth – but primarily as education of already
well-educated adults, while changing from the most labour-intensive of
major industries to one of the most highly capital-intensive ones. What
challenges – to a company’s policies, products, markets, goals – do such
changes present? What opportunities?</p>
<p>These are macroeconomic trends. But similar structural trends shape
the microeconomies of individual industries and markets; they are
equally important. For three hundred years, since the colonial days, the
floor space per family, and with it the percentage of consumers’ income
spent on housing, has steadily grown in the United States (in contrast
to Europe and Japan). Has this trend now come to an end with the drastic
changes in family size and composition?</p>
<p>Since the Second World War, the share of consumers’ disposable income
spent on entertainment electronics – radio, TV, audio cassettes, video
cassettes, and so on – has grown steadily, a trend the Japanese
understood and exploited. Has it plateaued? The share of consumers’
disposable income spent on telecommunications has been growing for a
century, it may be poised to explode.</p>
<p>Economic wisdom has it that older people do not save. Is this still
true? The growth of mutual funds would argue the opposite. And what
would such a shift in the distribution of disposable income by people
over fifty or fifty-five – the fastest-growing segment of the developed
countries’ population – mean for financial institutions, their products,
services, and marketing? These are not particularly arcane matters. Most
executives know the answers or how to get them. It’s just that they
rarely ask the questions.</p>
<p>The answers to the question ‘What has already happened that will make
the future?’ define the potential of opportunities for a given company
or industry. To convert this potential into reality requires matching
the opportunities with the company‘s strengths and competence. It
requires what I first (in my 1964 book Managing for Results) presented
as ‘strength analysis’ and what now – thanks mainly to the work of
Professors C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel – is coming to be known as the
analysis of ‘core competence’.</p>
<p>‘What is this company good at? What does it do well? What strengths,
in other words, give it a competitive edge? Applied to what?’ Strength
analysis also shows where there is need to improve or to upgrade
existing strengths and where new strengths have to be acquired. It shows
both what the company can do and what it should do. Matching a company’s
strengths to the changes that have already taken place produces, in
effect, a plan of action. It enables a business to turn the unexpected
into advantage. Uncertainty ceases to be a threat and becomes an
opportunity.</p>
<p>There is, however, one condition: that the business create the
resources of knowledge and of people to respond when opportunity knocks.
This means developing a separate futures budget.</p>
<p>The 10 per cent or 12 per cent of annual expenditures needed to
create and maintain the resources for the future – in research and
technology, in market standing and service, in people and their
development – must be put into a constant budget maintained in good
years and bad. These are investments, even though accountants and tax
collectors consider them operating expenses. They enable a business to
make its future – and that, in the last analysis, is what planning for
uncertainty means.</p>
