<h4 id="the-theory-of-the-business">1. The theory of the business</h4>
<p>Not in a very long time – not, perhaps, since the late 1940s or early
1950s – have there been as many new major management techniques as there
are today; downsizing, outsourcing, total quality management, economic
value analysis, benchmarking, re-engineering. Each is a powerful tool.
But with the exceptions of outsourcing and re-engineering, these tools
are designed primarily to do differently what is already being done.
They are ‘how-to-do’ tools.</p>
<p>Yet what to do is increasingly becoming the central challenge facing
managements, especially those of big companies that have enjoyed
long-term success. The story is a familiar one: a company that was a
superstar only yesterday finds itself stagnating and frustrated, in
trouble and, often, in a seemingly unmanageable crisis. This phenomenon
is by no means confined to the United States. It has become common in
Japan and Germany, The Netherlands and France, Italy and Sweden. And it
occurs just as often outside business – in labour unions, government
agencies, hospitals, museums, and churches. In fact, it seems even less
tractable in those areas.</p>
<p>The root cause of nearly every one of these crises is not that things
are being done poorly. It is not even that the wrong things are being
done. Indeed, in most cases, the right things are being done – but
fruitlessly. What accounts for this apparent paradox? The assumptions on
which the organization has been built and is being run no longer fit
reality. These are the assumptions that shape any organization’s
behaviour, dictate its decisions about what to do and what not to do,
and define what the organization considers meaningful results. These
assumptions are about markets. They are about customers and competitors,
their values and behaviour. They are about technology and its dynamics,
about a company’s strengths and weaknesses. These assumptions are about
what a company gets paid for. They are what I call a company’s theory of
the business.</p>
<p>Every organization, whether a business or not, has a theory of the
business. Indeed, a valid theory that is clear, consistent, and focused
is extraordinarily powerful. In 1809, for instance, the German statesman
and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt founded the University of Berlin on a
radically new theory of the university. And for more than one hundred
years, until the rise of Hitler, his theory defined the German
university, especially in scholarship and scientific research. In 1870,
George Siemens, the architect and first CEO of Deutsche Bank, the first
universal bank, had an equally clear theory of the business: to use
entrepreneurial finance to unify a still rural and splintered Germany
through industrial development. Within twenty years of its founding,
Deutsche Bank had become Europe’s premier financial institution, which
it has remained to this day in spite of two world wars, inflation, and
Hitler. And in the 1807s, Mitsubishi was founded on a clear and
completely new theory of the business, which within ten years made it
the leader in an emerging Japan and within another twenty years made it
one of the first truly multinational businesses.</p>
<p>Similarly, the theory of the business explains both the success of
companies like General Motors and IBM, which have dominated the US
economy for the latter half of the twentieth century, and the challenges
they now face. In fact, what underlies the current malaise of so many
large and successful organizations worldwide is that their theory of the
business no longer works.</p>
<p>Whenever a big organization gets into trouble – and especially if it
has been successful for many years – people blame sluggishness,
complacency, arrogance, mammoth bureaucracies. Plausible explanations?
Yes. But rarely relevant or correct. Consider the two most visible and
widely reviled ‘arrogant bureaucracies’ among large US companies that
have recently been in trouble.</p>
<p>Since the earliest days of the computer, it had been an article of
faith at IBM that the computer would go the way of electricity. The
future, IBM knew and could prove with scientific rigour, lay with the
central station, the ever more powerful mainframe into which a huge
number of users could plug. Everything – economics, the logic of
information, technology – led to that conclusion. But then, suddenly,
when it seemed as if such a central-station, mainframe-based information
system was actually coming into existence, two young men came up with
the first personal computer. Every computer maker knew that the PC was
absurd. It did not have the memory, the database, the speed, or the
computing ability necessary to succeed. Indeed, every computer maker
knew that the PC had to fail – the conclusion reached by Xerox only a
few years earlier, when its research team had actually built the first
PC. But when that misbegotten monstrosity – first the Apple, then the
Macintosh – came on the market, people not only loved it, they bought
it.</p>
<p>Every big, successful company throughout history, when confronted
with such a surprise, has refused to accept it. ‘It‘s a stupid fad and
will be gone in three years,’ said the CEO of Zeiss upon seeing the new
Kodak Brownie in 1888, when the German company was as dominant in the
world photographic market as IBM would be in the computer market a
century later. Most mainframe makers responded in the same way. The list
was long: Control Data, Univac, Burroughs, and NCR in the United States;
Siemens, Nixdorf, Machines Bull, and ICL in Europe; Hitachi and Fujitsu
in Japan. IBM, the overlord of mainframes with as much in sales as all
the other computer makers put together and with record profits, could
have reacted in the same way. In fact, it should have. Instead, IBM
immediately accepted the PC as the new reality. Almost overnight, it
brushed aside all its proven and time-tested policies, rules, and
regulations and set up not one but two competing teams to design an even
simpler PC. A couple of years later, IBM had become the world’s largest
PC manufacturer and the industry standard setter.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no precedent for this achievement in all of
business history; it hardly argues bureaucracy, sluggishness, or
arrogance. Yet despite unprecedented flexibility, agility, and humility,
IBM was floundering a few years later in both the mainframe and the PC
business. It was suddenly unable to move, to take decisive action, to
change.</p>
<p>The case of GM is equally perplexing. In the early 1980s – the very
years in which GM’s main business, passenger cars, seemed almost
paralysed – the company acquired two large businesses: Hughes
Electronics and Ross Perot’s Electronic Data Systems. Analysts generally
considered both companies to be mature and chided GM for grossly
overpaying for them. Yet within a few short years, GM had more than
tripled the revenues and profits of the allegedly mature EDS. And ten
years later, in 1994, EDS had a market value six times the amount that
GM had paid for it and ten times its original revenues and profits.</p>
<p>Similarly, GM bought Hughes Electronics – a huge but profitless
company involved exclusively in defence – just before the defence
industry collapsed. Under GM management, Hughes has actually increased
its defence profits and has become the only big defence contractor to
move successfully into large-scale non-defence work. Remarkably, the
same bean counters who had been so ineffectual in the car business –
thirty-year GM veterans who had never worked for any other company or,
for that matter, outside of finance and accounting departments – were
the ones who achieved those startling results. And in the two
acquisitions, they simply applied the policies, practices, and
procedures that had always been used by GM.</p>
<p>This story is a familiar one at GM. Since the company’s founding in a
flurry of acquisitions eighty years ago, one of its core competencies
has been to ‘overpay’ for well-performing but mature businesses – as it
did for Buick, AC Spark Plug, and Fisher Body in those early years – and
then turn them into world-class champions. Very few companies have been
able to match GM’s performance in making successful acquisitions, and GM
surely did not accomplish those feats by being bureaucratic, sluggish,
or arrogant. Yet what worked so beautifully in those businesses that GM
knew nothing about failed miserably in GM itself.</p>
<p>What can explain the fact that at both IBM and GM the policies,
practices, and behaviours that worked for decades – and in the case of
GM are still working well when applied to something new and different –
no longer work for the organization in which and for which they were
developed? The realities that each organization actually faces have
changed quite dramatically from those that each still assumes it lives
with. Put another way, reality has changed, but the theory of the
business has not changed with it.</p>
<p>Before its agile response to the new reality of the PC, IBM had once
before turned its basic strategy around overnight. In 1950, Univac, then
the world’s leading computer company, showed the prototype of the first
machine designed to be a multipurpose computer. All earlier designs had
been for single-purpose machines. IBM’s own two earlier computers, built
in the late 1930s and 1946 respectively, performed astronomical
calculations only. And the machine that IBM had on the drawing board in
1950, intended for the SAGE air defence system in the Canadian Arctic,
had only one purpose: early identification of enemy aircraft. IBM
immediately scrapped its strategy of developing advanced single-purpose
machines; it put its best engineers to work on perfecting the Univac
architecture and, from it, designing the first multipurpose computer
able to be manufactured (rather than handcrafted) and serviced. Three
years later, IBM had become the world’s dominant computer maker and
standard bearer. IBM did not create the computer. But in 1950, its
flexibility, speed, and humility created the computer industry.</p>
<p>However, the same assumptions that had helped IBM prevail in 1950
proved to be its undoing thirty years later. In the 1970s, IBM assumed
that there was such a thing as a ‘computer’, just as it had in the
1950s. But the emergence of the PC invalidated that assumption.
Mainframe computers and PCs are, in fact, no more one entity than are
generating stations and electric toasters. The latter, while different,
are interdependent and complementary. In contrast, mainframe computers
and PCs are primarily competitors. And in their basic definition of
information, they actually contradict each other: for the mainframe,
information means memory; for the brainless PC, it means software.
Building generating stations and making toasters must be run as separate
businesses, but they can be owned by the same corporate entity, as
General Electric did for decades. In contrast, mainframe computers and
PCs probably cannot co-exist in the same corporate entity.</p>
<p>IBM tried to combine the two. But because the PC was the
fastest-growing part of the business, IBM could not subordinate it to
the mainframe business. And because the mainframe was still the cash
cow, IBM could not optimize the PC business. In the end, the assumption
that a computer is a computer – or, more prosaically, that the industry
is hardware driven – paralysed IBM.</p>
<p>GM had an even more powerful, and successful, theory of the business
than IBM had, one that made GM the world’s largest and most profitable
manufacturing organization. The company did not have one setback in
seventy years – a record unmatched in business history. GM’s theory
combined in one seamless web assumptions about markets and customers
with assumptions about core competencies and organizational
structure.</p>
<p>Since the early 1920s, GM assumed that the US car market was
homogeneous in its values and segmented by extremely stable income
groups. The resale value of the ‘good’ used car was the only independent
variable under management’s control. High trade-in values enabled
customers to upgrade their newcar purchases to the next category – in
other words, to cars with higher profit margins. According to this
theory, frequent or radical changes in models could only depress
trade-in values.</p>
<p>Internally, these market assumptions went hand in hand with
assumptions about how production should be organized to yield the
biggest market share and the highest profit. In GM’s case, the answer
was long runs of mass-produced cars with a minimum of changes each model
year, resulting in the largest number of uniform yearly models on the
market at the lowest fixed cost per car.</p>
<p>GM’s management then translated these assumptions about market and
production into a structure of semi-autonomous divisions, each focusing
on one income segment and each arranged so that its highest-priced model
overlapped with the next division’s lowest-priced model, thus almost
forcing people to trade up, provided that used-car prices were high.</p>
<p>For seventy years, this theory worked like a charm. Even in the
depths of the Depression, GM steadily gained market share. But in the
late 1970s, its assumptions about the market and about production became
invalid. The market was fragmenting into highly volatile ‘lifestyle’
segments. Income became one factor among many in the buying decision,
not the only one. At the same time, lean manufacturing created an
economics of small scale. It made short runs and variations in models
less costly and more profitable than long runs of uniform products.</p>
<p>GM knew all this but simply could not believe it. (GM’s union still
doesn’t.) Instead, the company tried to patch things up. It maintained
the existing divisions based on income segmentation, but each division
now offered a ‘car for every purse’. It tried to compete with lean
manufacturing’s economics of small scale by automating the large-scale,
long-run mass production (losing some 0 billion in the process).
Contrary to popular belief, GM patched things up with prodigious energy,
hard work, and lavish investments of time and money. But patching only
confused the customer, the dealer, and the employees and management of
GM itself. In the meantime, GM neglected its real growth market, where
it had leadership and would have been almost unbeatable: light trucks
and minivans.</p>
<p>A theory of the business has three parts. First, there are
assumptions about the environment of the organization: society and its
structure, the market, the customer, and technology.</p>
<p>Second, there are assumptions about the specific mission of the
organization. Sears, Roebuck and Company, in the years during and
following the First World War, defined its mission as being the informed
buyer for the American family. A decade later, Marks andandandand
Spencer in Great Britain defined its mission as being the change agent
in British society by becoming the first classless retailer.
ATandandandandT, again in the years during and immediately after the
First World War, defined its role as ensuring that every US family and
business have access to a telephone. An organization’s mission need not
be so ambitious. GM envisioned a far more modest role – as the leader in
‘terrestrial motorized transportation equipment’, in the words of Alfred
P. Sloan, Jr.</p>
<p>Third, there are assumptions about the core competencies needed to
accomplish the organization’s mission. For example, West Point, founded
in 1802, defined its core competence as the ability to turn out leaders
who deserve trust. Marks andandandand Spencer, around 1930, defined its
core competence as the ability to identify, design, and develop the
merchandise it sold, instead of the ability to buy. ATandandandandT,
around 1920, defined its core competence as technical leadership that
would enable the company to improve service continuously while steadily
lowering rates.</p>
<p>The assumptions about environment define what an organization is paid
for. The assumptions about mission define what an organization considers
to be meaningful results; in other words, they point to how it envisions
itself making a difference in the economy and in the society at large.
Finally, the assumptions about core competencies define where an
organization must excel in order to maintain leadership.</p>
<p>Of course, all this sounds deceptively simple. It usually takes years
of hard work, thinking, and experimenting to reach a clear, consistent,
and valid theory of the business. Yet to be successful, every
organization must work one out.</p>
<p>What are the specifications of a valid theory of the business? There
are four.</p>
<p>1 The assumptions about environment, mission, and core competencies
must fit reality. When four penniless young men from Manchester, England
– Simon Marks and his three brothers-in-law – decided in the early 1920s
that a humdrum penny bazaar should become an agent of social change, the
First World War had profoundly shaken their country’s class structure.
It had also created masses of new buyers for good-quality, stylish
merchandise like lingerie, blouses, and stockings – Marks andandandand
Spencer’s first successful product categories. Marks andandandand
Spencer then systematically set to work developing brand-new and
unheard-of core competencies. Until then, the core competence of a
merchant was the ability to buy well. Marks andandandand Spencer decided
that it was the merchant, rather than the manufacturer, who knew the
customer. Therefore, the merchant, not the manufacturer, should design
the products, develop them, and find producers to make the goods to his
design, specifications, and costs. This new definition of the merchant
took five to eight years to develop and to make acceptable to
traditional suppliers, who had always seen themselves as
‘manufacturers’, not as ‘subcontractors’.</p>
<p>2 The assumptions in all three areas have to fit one another. This
was perhaps GM’s greatest strength in the long decades of its
ascendancy. Its assumptions about the market and about the optimum
manufacturing process were a perfect fit. GM decided in the mid-1920s
that it also required new and as-yet-unheard-of core competencies:
financial control of the manufacturing process and a theory of capital
allocations. As a result, GM invented modern cost accounting and the
first rational capital-allocation process.</p>
<p>3 The theory of the business must be known and understood throughout
the organization. That is easy in an organization’s early days. But as
it becomes successful, an organization tends increasingly to take its
theory for granted, becoming less and less conscious of it. Then the
organization becomes sloppy. It begins to cut corners. It begins to
pursue what is expedient rather than what is right. It stops thinking.
It stops questioning. It remembers the answers but has forgotten the
questions. The theory of the business becomes ‘culture’. But culture is
no substitute for discipline, and the theory of the business is a
discipline.</p>
<p>4 The theory of the business has to be tested constantly. It is not
graven on tablets of stone. It is a hypothesis. And it is a hypothesis
about things that are in constant flux – society, markets, customers,
technology. And so built into the theory of the business must be the
ability to change itself.</p>
<p>Some theories of the business are so powerful that they last for a
long time. But being human artifacts, they don’t last forever, and,
indeed, today they rarely last for very long at all. Eventually every
theory of the business becomes obsolete and then invalid. That is
precisely what happened to those on which the great US businesses of the
1920s were built. It happened to the GMs and the ATandandandandTs. It
has happened to IBM. It is clearly happening today to Deutsche Bank and
its theory of the universal bank. It is also clearly happening to the
rapidly unravelling Japanese keiretsu.</p>
<p>The first reaction of an organization whose theory is becoming
obsolete is almost always a defensive one. The tendency is to put one’s
head in the sand and pretend that nothing is happening. The next
reaction is an attempt to patch, as GM did in the early 1980s or as
Deutsche Bank is doing today. Indeed, the sudden and completely
unexpected crisis of one big German company after another for which
Deutsche Bank is the ‘house bank’ indicates that its theory no longer
works. That is, Deutsche Bank no longer does what it was designed to do:
provide effective governance of the modern corporation.</p>
<p>But patching never works. Instead, when a theory shows the first
signs of becoming obsolete, it is time to start thinking again, to ask
again which assumptions about its environment mission, and core
competencies reflect reality most accurately – with the clear premise
that our historically transmitted assumptions, those with which all of
us grew up, no longer suffice.</p>
<p>What, then, needs to be done? There is a need for preventive care –
that is, for building into the organization systematic monitoring and
testing of its theory of the business. There is a need for early
diagnosis. Finally, there is a need to rethink a theory that is
stagnating and to take effective action in order to change policies and
practices, bringing the organization’s behaviour into line with the new
realities of its environment, with a new definition of its mission, and
with new core competencies to be developed and acquired.</p>
<p>There are only two preventive measures. But if used consistently,
they should keep an organization alert and capable of rapidly changing
itself and its theory. The first measure is what I call abandonment.
Every three years, an organization should challenge every product, every
service, every policy, every distribution channel with the question, If
we were not in it already, would we be going into it now? By questioning
accepted policies and routines, the organization forces itself to think
about its theory. It forces itself to test assumptions. It forces itself
to ask: Why didn’t this work, even though it looked so promising when we
went into it five years ago? Is it because we made a mistake? Is it
because we did the wrong things? Or is it because the right things
didn’t work?</p>
<p>Without systematic and purposeful abandonment, an organization will
be overtaken by events. It will squander its best resources on things it
should never have been doing or should no longer do. As a result, it
will lack the resources, especially capable people, needed to exploit
the opportunities that arise when markets, technologies, and core
competencies change. In other words, it will be unable to respond
constructively to the opportunities that are created when its theory of
the business becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>The second preventive measure is to study what goes on outside the
business, and especially to study non-customers. Walkaround management
became fashionable a few years back. It is important. And so is knowing
as much as possible about one’s customers – the area, perhaps, where
information technology is making the most rapid advances. But the first
signs of fundamental change rarely appear within one’s own organization
or among one’s own customers. Almost always they show up first among
one’s non-customers. Non-customers always outnumber customers. Wal-Mart,
today’s retail giant, has 14 per cent of the US consumer-goods market.
That means 86 per cent of the market is non-customers.</p>
<p>In fact, the best recent example of the importance of the
non-customer in the US department store. At their peak some twenty years
ago, department stores served 30 per cent of the US non-food retail
market. They questioned their customers constantly, studied them,
surveyed them. But they paid no attention to the 70 per cent of the
market who were not their customers. They saw no reason why they should.
Their theory of the business assumed that most people who could afford
to shop in department stores did. Fifty years ago, that assumption
fitted reality. But when the baby boomers came of age, it ceased to be
valid. For the dominant group among baby boomers – women in educated
two-income families – it was not money that determined where to shop.
Time was the primary factor, and this generation’s women could not
afford to spend their time shopping in department stores. Because
department stores looked only at their own customers, they did not
recognize this change until a few years ago. By then, business was
already drying up. And it was too late to get the baby boomers back. The
department stores learned the hard way that although being customer
driven is vital, it is not enough. An organization must be market driven
too.</p>
<p>To diagnose problems early, managers must pay attention to the
warning signs. A theory of the business always becomes obsolete when an
organization attains its original objectives. Attaining one’s
objectives, then, is not cause for celebration; it is cause for new
thinking. ATandandandandT accomplished its mission to give every US
family and business access to the telephone by the mid-1950s. Some
executives then said it was time to reassess the theory of the business
and, for instance, separate local service – where the objectives had
been reached – from growing and future businesses, beginning with
long-distance service and extending into global telecommunications.
Their arguments went unheeded, and a few years later ATandandandandT
began to flounder, only to be rescued by antitrust, which did by fiat
what the company’s management had refused to do voluntarily.</p>
<p>Rapid growth is another sure sign of crisis in an organization’s
theory. Any organization that doubles or triples in size within a fairly
short period of time has necessarily outgrown its theory. Even Silicon
Valley has learned that beer bashes are no longer adequate for
communication once a company has grown so big that people have to wear
name tags. But such growth challenges much deeper assumptions, policies,
and habits. To continue in health, let alone grow, the organization has
to ask itself again the questions about its environment, mission, and
core competencies.</p>
<p>There are two more clear signals that an organization’s theory of the
business is no longer valid. One is unexpected success – whether one’s
own or a competitor’s. The other is unexpected failure – again, whether
one’s own or a competitor’s.</p>
<p>At the same time that Japanese car imports had Detroit’s Big Three on
the ropes, Chrysler registered a totally unexpected success. Its
traditional passenger cars were losing market share even faster than
GM’s and Ford’s were. But sales of its Jeep and its new minivans – an
almost accidental development – skyrocketed. At the time, GM was the
leader of the US light-truck market and was unchallenged in the design
and quality of its products, but it wasn’t paying any attention to its
light-truck capacity. After all, minivans and light trucks had always
been classified as commercial rather than passenger vehicles in
traditional statistics, even though most of them are now being bought as
passenger vehicles. However, had it paid attention to the success of
Chrysler, its weaker competitor, GM might have realized much earlier
that its assumptions about both its market and its core competencies
were no longer valid. From the beginning, the minivan and light-truck
market was not an in-comeclass market and was little influenced by
trade-in prices. And, paradoxically, light-trucks were the one area in
which GM, fifteen years ago, had already moved quite far towards what we
now call lean manufacturing.</p>
<p>Unexpected failure is as much a warning as unexpected success and
should be taken as seriously as a sixty-year-old person’s first ‘minor’
heart attack. Sixty years ago, in the midst of the Depression, Sears
decided that car insurance had become an ‘accessory’ rather than a
financial product and that selling it would therefore fit its mission as
being the informed buyer for the American family. Everyone thought Sears
was crazy. But car insurance became Sears’ most profitable business
almost instantly. Twenty years later, in the 1950s, Sears decided that
diamond rings had become a necessity rather than a luxury, and the
company became the world’s largest – and probably most profitable –
diamond retailer. It was only logical for Sears to decide in 1981 that
investment products had become consumer goods for the American family.
It bought Dean Witter and moved its offices into Sears stores. The move
was a total disaster. The US public clearly did not consider its
financial needs to be ‘consumer products’. When Sears finally gave up
and decided to run Dean Witter as a separate business outside Sears
stores, Dean Witter at once began to blossom. In 1992, Sears sold it at
a tidy profit.</p>
<p>Had Sears seen its failure to become the American family’s supplier
of investments as a failure of its theory and not as an isolated
incident, it might have begun to restructure and reposition itself ten
years earlier than it actually did, when it still had substantial market
leadership. For Sears might then have seen, as several of its
competitors like J. C. Penney immediately did, that the Dean Witter
failure threw into doubt the entire concept of market homogeneity – the
very concept on which Sears and other mass retailers had based their
strategy for years.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we have searched for the miracle worker with a magic
wand to turn an ailing organization around. To establish, maintain, and
restore a theory, however, does not require a Genghis Khan or a Leonardo
da Vinci in the executive suite. It is not genius; it is hard work. It
is not being clever; it is being conscientious. It is what CEOs are paid
for.</p>
<p>There are indeed quite a few CEOs who have successfully changed the
theory of their business. The CEO who built Merck into the world’s most
successful pharmaceuticals business by focusing solely on the research
and development of patented, high-margin breakthrough drugs radically
changed the company’s theory by acquiring a large distributor of generic
and non-prescription drugs. He did so without a ‘crisis’, while Merck
was ostensibly doing very well. Similarly, a few years ago, the new CEO
of Sony, the world’s best-known manufacturer of consumer electronic
hardware, changed the company’s theory of the business. He acquired a
Hollywood film production company and, with that acquisition, shifted
the organization’s centre of gravity from being a hardware manufacturer
in search of software to being a software producer who creates a market
demand for hardware.</p>
<p>But for every one of these apparent miracle workers, there are scores
of equally capable CEOs whose organizations stumble. We can’t rely on
miracle workers to rejuvenate an obsolete theory of the business any
more than we can rely on them to cure other types of serious illness.
And when one talks to these supposed miracle workers, they deny
vehemently that they act by charisma, vision, or, for that matter, the
laying on of hands. They start out with diagnosis and analysis. They
accept that attaining objectives and rapid growth demand a serious
rethinking of the theory of the business. They do not dismiss unexpected
failure as the result of a subordinate’s incompetence or as an accident
but treat it as a symptom of ‘systems failure’. They do not take credit
for unexpected success but treat it as a challenge to their
assumptions.</p>
<p>They accept that a theory’s obsolescence is a degenerative and,
indeed, life-threatening disease. And they know and accept the surgeon’s
time-tested principle, the oldest principle of effective decision
making: a degenerative disease will not be cured by procrastination. It
requires decisive action.</p>
