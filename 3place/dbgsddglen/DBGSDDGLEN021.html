<h4 id="a-weak-dollar-strengthens-japan">19. A weak dollar strengthens
Japan</h4>
<p>For a decade now one US administration after another – Reagan, Bush,
Clinton – has talked down the exchange value of the dollar against the
yen. Every time the dollar declines – and it tumbled during these ten
years from 250 yen to below 100 yen – we are told by the experts that
‘this time’ the trade deficit with Japan will surely go away. And every
time the dollar declines, the Japanese howl that endaka – the high yen –
will destroy their industries and drive them into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>US manufacturing exports to Japan have indeed nearly doubled in the
past ten years. But they have increased even faster in countries – some
in Europe, others in Latin America – where the dollar’s value has
actually increased. And despite endaka, Japanese manufactured exports to
the United States have grown just as fast as US manufactured-goods
exports to Japan. Therefore, the trade deficit has remained pretty much
the same – even widening a bit since the dollar was first devalued.</p>
<p>In fact, neither US merchandise trade nor Japanese companies’ sales
and profits show the slightest correlation to the exchange rate. If they
correlate to anything, it is to the relative levels of economic activity
in the two countries. For example, while Japanese manufacturing-company
profits have fallen sharply in the past three years, the main cause has
not been fewer exports to the United States or lower export earnings, it
has been the sharp drop in the domestic economy, aggravated by huge
losses many of these companies incurred from gambling recklessly in the
Tokyo stock market and in Japanese real estate.</p>
<p>According to all economic theory this simply could not have happened:
the US trade deficit with Japan must have disappeared. At least it must
have shrunk markedly. And the Washington experts still promise us that,
indeed, this will happen the next time around, and ‘inevitably’ so. But
if for a whole decade the inevitable does not happen, one should stop
promising it. In fact, the cheap-dollar policy of US governments in the
past ten years has rested in totally wrong assumptions regarding the
Japanese economy. Japan, rather than the United States, is the
beneficiary of a cheap dollar.</p>
<p>The key to this seeming paradox is that, on a flow-of-funds basis,
Japan spends as many dollars on imports as it earns through exports. As
far as US-Japanese merchandise trade is concerned, the exchange rate is
irrelevant: the dollars are awash. Individual companies might, of
course, be hurt by a lower dollar, but others benefit by it. And in its
total trade accounts – that is, in merchandise and services trade
combined – Japan actually spends more dollars abroad than it earns from
exports. The weaker the dollar, the fewer yen Japan needs to spend to
procure the dollars it requires for its foreign accounts.</p>
<p>Japan imports four-fifths of its fuel and energy, a little more than
one-third of its food, and all its industrial raw materials. Together,
these three categories constitute half of Japan’s total imports. (By
contrast, they account for no more than a quarter of US imports and for
less than a third of Germany’s imports.) Japan pays for all these
commodity imports in US dollars, even if, as in the case of oil, they
come from other countries. According to economic theory and economic
history, commodity prices should have gone up in dollars by the same
proportion by which the dollar went down. But they didn’t.</p>
<p>On the contrary, during the past ten years the dollar prices of
commodities – whether foods, industrial raw materials, or oil – have
actually plummeted. In yen, Japan, the world’s largest commodity
importer, gets an incredible bargain. Feeding its population, running
its factories, and heating its homes now costs Japan little more than a
third of what it had cost it ten years ago. As an importer, Japan
benefits heavily from endaka – and so does its standard of living.</p>
<p>Of Japan’s exports, about two-fifths are paid in US dollars –
everything that is sold to the United States (now around a fifth of the
total), almost everything that goes to Latin America, and everything
that goes to the three countries whose currencies have remained linked
to the US dollar: Britain, Australia, and Canada. And these two-fifths
of Japan’s merchandise exports bring in almost exactly the number of
dollars Japan needs to pay for its commodity imports.</p>
<p>In 1992 – the most typical of these ten years and almost exactly in
the middle of the range – Japan’s bill for commodity imports was 18
billion; its income from dollar-denominated exports was about 20
billion. Actually, Japan needs a few extra billion dollars to cover its
deficit on service trade – almost all payable in dollars. It runs to
some 0 billion a year. But this only means that a cheaper dollar hurts
even less.</p>
<p>On top of this, however, Japan needs dollars – a lot of them – to
invest abroad. During the past ten years Japan has become a major direct
investor abroad, building plants and acquiring stakes in businesses all
over the world. Until a year or two ago the bulk of this investment was
in the United States. Now, to get access to the European Union, the
Japanese are investing heavily in the United Kingdom. Since the British
pound is the major European currency that has stayed most in sync with
the US dollar during the past ten years, the pound also becomes cheaper
for the Japanese as the dollar decreases in value.</p>
<p>All told, the Japanese in the peak year – 1991 – needed about 00
billion for overseas investment. This was financed out of their exports
to countries other than the United States – mainly countries whose
currencies were not linked to the dollar but were fairly stable in
relation to the yen (e.g. the German mark). Thus Japan could get the
dollars needed for investment in the United States at a steadily reduced
price. This alone enabled the Japanese to build plants and to acquire
companies in the United States (and in Britain, Canada, and Australia)
at bargain-basement prices.</p>
<p>No one has yet been able to explain why world commodity prices failed
to rise proportionately as the dollar fell against the yen (and against
all other key currencies except the British pound). But whatever the
answer is, it surely has nothing to do with US-Japanese trade. A very
strong case can be made that a more expensive dollar would actually be
the best way to shrink the US trade deficit with Japan – and within
three to five years.</p>
<p>Increasingly, trade is not determined by the economist’s traditional
‘comparative advantage’ factors, and thus it is less and less
susceptible to exchange rates – the US experience with Japan is but one
example. Increasingly trade follows investment.</p>
<p>A very large and growing part of Japan’s exports to the United States
– perhaps enough to account for the entire US trade deficit with Japan –
comprises parts, supplies, and machinery for the plants Japan has built
in the United States and the companies it has bought there. If Toyota,
for instance, builds a plant in Kentucky, most of the machinery and
tools it requires will be bought from the people who have supplied
Toyota’s plants in Japan for years. And the parts for the cars the plant
builds will come from the people who supply Toyota in Nagoya.</p>
<p>US manufacturers act exactly the same way when they invest in plants
or companies abroad. But the cheap dollar has made it prohibitively
expensive for Americans to invest in Japan. In fact, it has forced a
shrinking of the US investment base in Japan. Several companies – one
example is Minneapolis-based Honywell – have sold their stakes in
Japanese subsidiaries either because they could not afford the yen
needed to modernize and expand a growing and profitable subsidiary or
because they took advantage of the high yen rate to raise the dollars
they needed at home.</p>
<p>A cheaper yen would, in all likelihood, unleash a flood of American
investments in Japan – now the world’s number two consumer market – and
with it a flood of exports of high-value-added and high-quality-job
goods. But it is also quite possible that a higher dollar would bring in
substantially larger foreign-exchange earnings from our commodity
exports to Japan – the world’s largest commodity importer and by far the
largest buyer of American food and raw materials exports, such as
timber.</p>
<p>These, however, are conjectures. What is proven is that a cheaper
dollar has not made the US trade deficit with Japan go away and will not
make it go away. All it does is enable Japan to get dollars more
cheaply.</p>
