<h4 id="a-century-of-social-transformations">21. A century of social
transformations</h4>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>No century in human history has experienced so many social
transformations and such radical ones as the twentieth century. They, I
submit, will turn out to be the most significant events of this century,
and its lasting legacy. In the developed free-market countries – only
one-fifth of the earth’s population, but the model for the rest – work
and workforce, society and polity are all, in the last decade of this
century, qualitatively and quantitatively different both from those of
the first years of this century and from anything ever experienced
before in human history: different in their configuration, in their
processes, in their problems, and in their structures.</p>
<p>Far smaller and far slower social changes in earlier periods trigged
violent intellectual and spiritual crises, rebellions, and civil wars.
The extreme social transformations of this century have hardly caused
any stir. They proceeded with a minimum of friction, with a minimum of
upheavals, and indeed with altogether a minimum of attention from
scholars, politicians, the press, and the public. To be sure, this
century of ours may well have been the cruellest and most violent
century in human history, with its world wars and civil wars, its mass
tortures,ethnic cleansings, and genocides. But all these killings, all
these horrors inflicted on the human race by this century’s
Weltbe-glucker,* hindsight clearly shows, were just that: senseless
killings, senseless horrors. Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, the three evil
geniuses of this century, destroyed. But they created nothing.</p>
<p>Indeed, if this century proves anything, it is the futility of
politics. Even the most dogmatic believer in historical determinism
would have a hard time explaining the social transformations of this
century as caused by the headline-making political events, or explaining
the headline-making political events as caused by the social
transformations. But it is the social transformations, running like
ocean currents deep below the hurricane-tormented surface of the sea,
that have had the lasting, indeed the permanent, effect. They – rather
than all the violence of the political surface – have transformed the
society and the economy, the community, the polity we live in.</p>
<p>The social structure and its transformations</p>
<p>Before the First World War the largest single group in every country
were farmers. They were then no longer the population everywhere, as
they had been since the dawn of history and as they had still been in
every country at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, a hundred years
earlier. But except in England and Belgium, farmers were still a near
majority in every developed country – in Germany, in France, in Japan,
in the United States – and, of course, in all developing and Third World
countries too.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, at the eve of the First World War, it was
considered axiomatic that developed countries – North America being the
only exception – would increasingly become unable to feed themselves and
would increasingly have to rely on food imports from non-industrial,
non-developed areas. England and Belgium had already become massive food
importers. Germany, Holland, and Switzerland were barely breaking even
in their food accounts. And the fear of becoming dependent on food
imports was emerging in Meiji Japan, after 1890, as a keynote of
Japanese politics, as the justification for Japan’s annexing
food-surplus territories like Taiwan and Korea, and as the psychological
force behind Japan’s nascent imperialism.</p>
<p>Today, only Japan, among major, developed, free-market countries is a
heavy importer of food. (Unnecessarily so – its weakness as a food
producer is largely the result of an obsolete rice-subsidy policy that
prevents the country from developing a modern, productive agriculture.)
All other developed free-market countries have become surplus food
producers despite burgeoning urban populations. In all these countries
food production is today many times what it was eighty years ago – in
the United States, eight to ten times as much.</p>
<p>But in all developed free-market countries – including Japan –
farmers today are, at most, 5 per cent of population and workforce, that
is, one-tenth of what they were eighty years ago. Actually, productive
farmers are less than half of the total farm population, or no more than
2 per cent of the workforce. And these agricultural producers are not
‘farmers’ in any sense of the word; they are ‘agribusinesses’ and
constitute arguably the most capital-intensive, most
technology-intensive, and most information-intensive industry around.
Traditional farmers are close to extinction, even in Japan. And those
still around have become a protected species kept alive only by enormous
subsidies.</p>
<p>The second-largest group in population and workforce in every
developed country around 1900 were live-in servants. They were
considered as much a ‘law of nature’ as farmers were. The British Census
of 1910 defined lower middle class’ as a household employing fewer than
three servants. And while farmers as a proportion of population and
workforce had been steadily shrinking throughout the nineteenth century,
the numbers of domestic servants, both absolutely and as a percentage,
were steadily growing right up to the First World War. (And nowhere
faster than in the United States, with its enormous influx of
immigrants. With free land largely gone by 1900, a job as domestic
servant was, for many newcomers, the only work available.) Eighty years
later, live-in domestic servants in developed countries have become
practically extinct. Few people born since the Second World War, that
is, few people under fifty, have even seen any except on the stage or in
old films.</p>
<p>Farmers and domestic servants were not only the largest social
groups, they were the oldest social groups, too. Together they were,
through the ages, the foundation of economy and society, the foundation
altogether of ‘civilization’. Servants, whether slaves, indentured
servants, or hired hands, actually antedate farmers by several
millennia. The patriarchs of the Old Testament were still nomadic
pastoralists, rather than settled farmers. But they had large numbers of
servants of all kinds.</p>
<p>Big cities are nothing new. Nineveh and Babylon were very big cities,
and so were the capital of the Han emperor in China two hundred years
before Christ and the Rome of the Caesars. But these big cities were
islets in a rural sea. This was still largely true for the social world
of 1900, despite the visibility and glamour of a Paris, a London, a New
York, a Boston, a Tokyo. It was then still generally accepted, as it had
been in the Hellas of Hesiod’s Erga Kai Hemera (Days and Works) written
in the eighth century BC, or in the Rome of Virgil’s Georgica, written
in the first century BC, that cities are ‘parasites’ and farmers the
‘real nation’. In its technology the society of 1900 was already much
closer to that of the year 2000 than to that of 1800. It had steamships,
railways, quite a few cars, and, by 1903, the airplane. It had
electricity, telephone, wireless telegraphy, and the first films. But
socially 1900 was still closer to 1800 and indeed to antiquity than to
us, that is, to 1994. It was still organized around farmers and domestic
servants, both still largely living the life their ancestors had lived
at the time of Hesiod and Virgil, doing the same work and with very much
the same tools.</p>
<p>In the developed society of 2000, farmers are little but nostalgia,
and domestic servants are not even that.</p>
<p>Yet these enormous transformations in all free-market developed
countries were accomplished without civil war, and, in fact, in almost
total silence. Only now that their farm population has shrunk to
near-zero do the totally urban French loudly assert that theirs should
be a ‘rural country’ with a ‘rural civilization’.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the blue-collar worker</p>
<p>One reason, indeed the main reason, why the transformation caused so
little stir was that by 1900 a new class, the blue-collar worker in
manufacturing industry (Marx’s ‘proletarian’), had become socially
dominant. Farmers – and not only in Kansas – were loudly adjured to
‘raise more hell and less corn’, but not even the farmers paid much
attention. Domestic servants were clearly the most exploited class
around. But when people before the First World War talked or wrote about
the ‘social question’, they meant blue-collar industrial workers. These
workers were still a fairly small minority of population and workforce –
right up to the First World War, at most, an eighth or a sixth of the
total – and still vastly outnumbered by the traditional ‘lower’ classes
of farmers and domestic servants. But early twentieth-century society
was obsessed with blue-collar workers, fixated on them, bewitched by
them.</p>
<p>Farmers and domestic servants were everywhere. But as a ‘class’ they
were invisible. Domestic servants lived and worked in small and isolated
groups of two or three, inside individual homes or on individual farms.
And farmers too were dispersed. Above all, these traditional lower
classes were not organized. Indeed, they could not be organized. Slaves
employed in mining or in producing goods had revolted frequently in the
ancient world – though always unsuccessfully. But there is no record of
a single demonstration or of a single protest march of domestic servants
any place and at any time. There were peasant revolts galore – no place
more frequently than in Tokugawa Japan from 1700 on, or in imperial
China, also beginning in 1700. But except for two Chinese revolts in the
nineteenth century – the Taiping Rebellion in mid-century and the Boxer
Rebellion at the century’s end, both of which lasted for years and came
close to destroying the regime – all peasant rebellions in history have
fizzled out after a few bloody weeks. Peasants, history shows, are very
hard to organize and do not stay organized – which was the reason why
they earned Marx’s contempt.</p>
<p>The new class, the blue-collar worker in manufacturing industry, were
extremely visible. This is what made them a ‘class’. They lived perforce
in dense population clusters and in cities – in St-Denis outside Paris,
in Berlin’s Wedding and Vienna’s Ottakring, in the textile towns of
Lancashire, the steel towns of America’s Monongahela Valley, and in
Japan’s Kobe. And they soon proved eminently organizable, with the first
strikes occurring almost as soon as there were factory workers. Charles
Dickens’s harrowing tale of a murderous labour conflict at a cotton
textile mill, Hard Times, was published in 1854, only six years after
Marx and Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p>By 1900 it had become quite clear that industrial blue-collar workers
would not become the majority as Marx had predicted only a few decades
earlier. They therefore would not overwhelm the capitalists by their
sheer numbers. Yet the most influential radical writer of the period
before the First World War, the French former Marxist and revolutionary
syndicalist Georges Sorel, found widespread acceptance for his 1906
thesis that the proletarians would overturn the existing order and take
power by their organization and in and through the violence of the
general strike. It was not only Lenin who made Sorel’s thesis the
foundation of his revision of Marxism and built around it his strategy
in 1917 and 1918; both Mussolini and Hitler – and Mao, ten years later –
equally built their strategies on Sorel’s thesis.Mao’s ‘power grows out
of the barrel of a gun’ is almost a straight quote from Sorel. The
blue-collar worker became the ‘social question’ of 1900 because he was
the first ‘lower class’ in history that could be organized and stay
organized.</p>
<p>No class in history has ever risen faster than the blue-collar
worker. And no class in history has ever fallen faster.</p>
<p>In 1883, the year of Marx’s death, ‘proletarians’ were still a
minority of industrial workers. The majority were then skilled workers
employed in small craft shops each containing twenty or thirty workers
at most. Of the anti-heroes of the nineteenth century’s best
‘proletarian’ novel, The Princess Casamassima by Henry James – published
in 1886, only three years after Marx’s death (and surely only Henry
James could have given such a title to a story of working-class
terrorists!) – one is a highly skilled bookbinder, the other one an
equally skilled pharmacist. Similarly, the protagonists of Gerhart
Hauptmann’s Die Weber (The Weavers) – written in 1892 and the only
successful ‘proletarian’ play (its author eventually received the Nobel
Prize for Literature for it) – are skilled men still working in their
homes rather than in a factory.</p>
<p>By 1900, industrial worker had become synonymous with machine
operator in a factory employing hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
These factory workers were indeed Marx’s proletarians, without social
position, without political power, without economic or purchasing
power.</p>
<p>Popular myth has it that Henry Ford’s 1907 Model T was so cheap that
workers could afford it. But at 50 its price was equal to more than
three times the entire annual income of an American machine operator –
70 or 80 cents was a good daily wage. Yet American machine operators
were then already the world’s most highly paid industrial workers.</p>
<p>The workers of 1900 – and even of 1913 – had no pension; no paid
vacation; no overtime pay; no extra pay for Sunday or night work; no
health insurance (except in Germany); no unemployment compensation; no
job security whatever. One of the earliest laws to limit working hours
for adult males – enacted in Austria in 1884 – set the working day at
eleven hours, six days a week. Industrial workers, in 1913, everywhere
worked a minimum of 3000 hours a year. Their unions were still
officially proscribed or, at best, barely tolerated. But the workers had
shown their capacity to be organized. They had shown their capacity to
act as a ‘class’.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, industrial blue-collar workers had become the largest
single group in every developed country, including the Communist ones,
though they were an actual majority only during wartime. They had become
eminently respectable. In all developed free-market countries they had
economically become ‘middle class’. In the United States, in fact – and
soon in non-Communist Europe, too – unionized industrial workers in
mass-production industry (which then was dominant everywhere) had
attained and sometimes even exceeded near upper-class income levels,
with annual incomes including benefits reaching 0 000 – and in the US
car industry (e.g. at Ford) exceeding 00 000. They had extensive job
security; pensions; long, paid vacations; comprehensive unemployment
insurance or ‘lifetime employment’. Above all, they had achieved
political power. It was not only in Britain that the labour unions were
considered to be the ‘real government’, with greater power than prime
minister and Parliament. In the United States, too, and equally in
Germany, France and Italy, the labour unions had emerged as the
country’s most powerful and best-organized political forces. And in
Japan they had come very close, in the 1948 Toyota and the 1954 Nissan
strikes, to overturning the ‘system’ and to taking over power
themselves.</p>
<p>In 1990, however, both the blue-collar worker and his union were in
total and irreversible retreat. They had become marginal in numbers.
Whereas blue-collar workers who made or moved things had accounted for
two-fifths of the American workforce in the 1950s, they accounted for
less than one-fifth of the workforce in the early 1990s – that is, for
no more than they had accounted for in 1900, when their meteoric rise
had begun. In the other developed free-market countries the decline was
slower at first; but after 1980 it began to accelerate everywhere. By
the year 2000 or 2010, in every developed free-market country,
blue-collar industrial workers will account for no more than one-tenth
or, at most, one-eighth of the workforce. Union power has been going
down equally fast. Where in the 1950s and 1960s the National Union of
Mineworkers in the United Kingdom broke prime ministers as if they were
matchwood, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s won election after election by
being openly contemptuous of organized labour and by whittling down its
political power and its privileges. The blue-collar worker in
manufacturing industry and his union are going the way of the
farmer.</p>
<p>Unlike domestic servants, blue-collar workers will not disappear – no
more than producers on the land have disappeared or will disappear. But
just as the traditional ‘farmer’ has become a recipient of subsidies
rather than a ‘producer’, so will the traditional blue-collar worker
largely become an auxiliary force. His place is already being taken by a
‘technologist’, that is, by people who work both with their hands and
their theoretical knowledge. (Examples are computer technicians or
paramedical technicians such as X-ray technicians, physical therapists,
medical-lab technicians, pulmonary technicians, and so on, who have been
the fastest-growing group in the United States workforce since
1980.)</p>
<p>And instead of a ‘class’, that is, a coherent, recognizable, defined,
and self-conscious group, the blue-collar worker in manufacturing
industry may soon be just another ‘pressure group’.</p>
<p>Chroniclers of the rise of the industrial worker tend to highlight
the violent episodes – the clashes between strikers and police
especially, such as America’s Pullman strike. The reason is probably
that the theoreticians and propagandists of socialism, anarchism, and
Communism – beginning with Marx and down to Herbert Marcuse in the 1960s
– incessantly wrote and talked of ‘revolution’ and ‘Violence’. Actually,
the rise of the industrial worker was remarkably non-violent. The
enormous violences of this century – the world wars, civil wars,
genocides, ethnic cleansings, and so on – were all violences from above
rather than violences from below; and they were unconnected with the
transformations of society, whether the shrinking of the number of
farmers, the disappearance of the domestic servant, or the rise of the
industrial worker. In fact, no one any longer even tries to explain
these great convulsions with ‘the crisis of capitalism’, as was standard
Marxist rhetoric only thirty years ago.</p>
<p>In contrast to Marxist and syndicalist predictions, the rise of the
industrial worker did not destabilize society. On the contrary, it
emerged as the century’s most stabilizing social development. It
explains why the disappearance of farmer and domestic servant produced
no social crises.</p>
<p>The ‘enclosures’ in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England,
which drove farmers off the land, were quite limited locally; but they
produced serious and often very violent reactions. They also were widely
noticed and hotly discussed – by writers, poets, politicians, and the
public, one example being Oliver Goldsmith’s great 1770 poem ‘The
Deserted Village’, perhaps the best-known and most-quoted poem in the
England of 1800. Similarly, the early-nineteenth-century Bauernlegen in
East Prussia, in which tenant farmers were pushed off the land to make
way for large-scale agriculture, had profound political and cultural
reverberations. But the far more massive ‘flight from the land’ that
began in the closing decades of the nineteenth century and has continued
unabated has gone almost unnoticed except by statisticians. The equally
massive ‘flight from service’ that began after the First World War, even
the statisticians have barely noticed.</p>
<p>Both the flight from the land and the flight from service were
voluntary. Farmers and maids were not ‘pushed off or ‘displaced’. They
went into industrial employment as fast as they could. Industrial jobs
required no skills they did not already possess, and no additional
knowledge. On the contrary, farmers on the whole had a good deal more
skill than was required to be a machine operator in the mass-production
plant – and so had many domestic servants. To be sure, industrial work
paid poorly until the First World War. But it paid better than farming
or household work. Industrial workers, until 1913 – and until the Second
World War in some countries, such as Japan – worked long hours. But they
worked shorter hours than farmers and domestic servants. What’s more,
they worked specified hours; the rest of the day was their own, which
was true of neither work on the farm nor of work as a servant in a
household.</p>
<p>The history books record the squalor of early industry, the poverty
of the industrial workers, and their exploitation. They did indeed work
in squalor and live in poverty, and they were indeed exploited. But they
lived better than they would either on a farm or in an employer’s
household, and they were treated better,</p>
<p>Proof of this is that infant mortality dropped as soon as farmers and
domestic servants moved into industrial work in the factory.
Historically, cities never reproduced themselves. They depended for
their perpetuation on a constant influx of people from the countryside.
This was still true in the mid-nineteenth century. But with the spread
of factory employment, the city became the centre of population growth.
In part this was the result of the new public health measures: provision
of clean water; collection and treatment of wastes; quarantine and
inoculation against epidemics. These measures – and they were effective
mostly in the city – counteracted, or at least contained, the hazards of
crowding that had made the traditional city the breeding ground for
pestilence. But the largest single factor in the exponential drop in
infant mortality as industrialization spread was surely the improvement
in living conditions brought about by the advent of the factory – better
housing, better nutrition, lighter workloads, and fewer accidents. The
drop in infant mortality – and with it the explosive growth in
population – correlates with only one development: industrialization.
The early factory was indeed the ‘satanic mill’ of William Blake’s great
poem. But the countryside was not the ‘green and pleasant land’ of which
Blake sang; it was (I have said so before) a picturesque but even more
satanic slum.</p>
<p>For farmer and domestic servant, industrial work was an opportunity.
It was in fact the first opportunity in social history to better oneself
substantially without having to emigrate. In the developed, free-market
countries, every generation in the last 100 or 150 years could expect to
do substantially better than the generation preceding it. The main
reason was that farmers and domestic servants could and did become
industrial workers.</p>
<p>Because industrial workers were concentrated in groups, that is,
because they worked in a large factory rather than in a small shop or in
their homes, there could be systematic work on their productivity.
Beginning in 1881 – two years before Marx’s death – the systematic study
of work, tasks, and tools has raised the productivity of manual work
making and moving of things by 3–4 per cent, compounded each year, for a
total fiftyfold increase in output per worker over a hundred years. On
this rest all the economic and social gains during that time. And
contrary to what ‘everybody knew’ in the nineteenth century – not only
Marx but all the ‘conservatives’ as well, such as J. P. Morgan,
Bismarck, and Disraeli – practically all these gains have accrued to the
blue-collar worker, half of the gains in the form of sharply reduced
working hours (with the cuts ranging from 40 per cent in Japan to 50 per
cent in Germany), half of them in the form of a twenty-fivefold increase
in the real wages of blue-collar workers making or moving things.</p>
<p>There were thus very good reasons why the rise of blue-collar workers
was peaceful rather than violent, let alone ‘revolutionary’. But what
explains that the fall of the blue-collar worker has been equally
peaceful and almost entirely free of social protest, of upheaval, of
serious dislocation, at least in the United States?</p>
<p>The rise of the knowledge worker</p>
<p>The rise of the ‘class’ succeeding the industrial blue-collar worker
is not an opportunity to him. It is a challenge. The newly emerging
dominant group are ‘knowledge workers’. The very term was unknown forty
years ago – I first coined it in a 1959 book (The Landmarks of
Tomorrow). By the end of this century, knowledge workers will amount to
a third or more of the workforce in the United States, that is, to as
large a proportion as industrial blue-collar workers ever were, except
in wartime. The majority of knowledge workers are paid at least as well
as blue-collar workers ever were, or better. And the new jobs offer much
greater opportunities to the individual.</p>
<p>But – and it is a big but – the new jobs require, in the great
majority, qualifications the blue-collar worker does not possess and is
poorly equipped to acquire. The new jobs require a good deal of formal
education and the ability to acquire and to apply theoretical and
analytical knowledge. They require a different approach to work and a
different mindset. Above all, they require a habit of continuous
learning.</p>
<p>Farmers, domestic servants, machine operators have learned everything
they need for their life’s work and jobs after a fairly short
apprenticeship – a year or two for farmers and domestic servants, a few
weeks for machine operators. But knowledge work – and a good deal of
service work, such as direct selling – is not experience-based, as all
manual work has always been. It is learning-based. Access to it requires
formal education, or at least formal training. Industrial work as a
machine operator was, in its work characteristics, still traditional
work. Knowledge work and most of services work, in their work
characteristics, are non-traditional. Displaced industrial workers thus
cannot simply move into knowledge work or services work the way
displaced farmers and displaced domestic workers moved into industrial
work. At the very least they have to make a major change in their basic
attitudes, values, and beliefs.</p>
<p>In the United States the industrial workforce has shrunk faster and
further in the closing decades of this century than in any other
developed country. At the same time, industrial production has grown
faster than in any other developed country, except only Japan.</p>
<p>The shift aggravated America’s oldest and least tractable problem:
the position of the Blacks. In the forty years since the Second World
War the economic position of the Negro in America improved faster than
that of any group in American social history – or in the social history
of any country. Three-fifths of America’s Blacks rose into middle-class
incomes – before the Second World War the figure was one-twentieth. But
half of that group rose into middle-class incomes and not into
middle-class jobs. Since the Second World War more and more Blacks have
moved into blue-collar, unionized, mass-production industry, that is,
into jobs paying middle-class and upper-middle-class wages while
requiring neither education nor skill. These are precisely the jobs,
however, that are disappearing the fastest. What is amazing is not that
so many Blacks did not acquire an education but that so many did. For
the economically rational thing to do for a young Black in America from
1945 to 1980 was not to stay in school and to learn. It was to leave
school as early as possible and to take one of the plentiful
mass-production jobs. As a result, the fall of the industrial worker
hits America’s Blacks disproportionately hard – quantitatively, but
qualitatively even more. It denigrates what has been the most potent
role model in the Black community in America: the well-paid industrial
worker with high job security, full health insurance, and a guaranteed
retirement pension – yet possessing neither skill nor much
education.</p>
<p>That half of that group of newly middle-class Blacks advanced because
they used the opportunities education offers and successfully moved into
knowledge work, does not, it seems, compensate for the loss of the
opportunity blue-collar industrial work offered uneducated Blacks. Black
youngsters aged ten or eleven in the inner city could and did identify
with the cousin who, only seven or eight years older, had a well-paying
job in the car plant. They could not easily identify with cousins who
were dentists, accountants, lawyers – which meant that they were twenty
years older and had sat in schools for at least sixteen years. And thus
the fall of the industrial blue-collar worker has been a traumatic shock
for the Black community in America. It explains in large measure not
only the growing defeatism, despair, and rage of inner-city Blacks. It
explains their growing alienation from, and rage against, their
achieving brothers and sisters, that is, the large and growing number of
Blacks who are moving into the new ‘middle class’, as knowledge
workers.</p>
<p>But, of course, the Blacks are a small minority of population and
workforce in the United States. For the rest – Whites and also Latinos
and Asians – the fall of the industrial blue-collar worker has caused
amazingly little disruption and nothing that could be called an
upheaval. Even in communities that were totally dependent on one or two
mass-production plants that have gone out of business or have cut
employment by two thirds – steel cities in western Pennsylvania or
eastern Ohio, for instance, or car cities like Flint, Michigan –
unemployment rates for adult, non-Black men and women fell within a few
short years to levels barely higher than the US average. And that means
to levels barely higher than the US ‘full-employment’ rate. And there
has been no radicalization of America’s blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>The only explanation is that for the non-Black, blue-collar community
the development came as no surprise, however unwelcome, painful, and
threatening to individual worker and individual family. Psychologically
– in terms of values perhaps, rather than in terms of emotions –
America’s industrial blue-collar workers must have been prepared to
accept as right and proper the shift to jobs that require formal
education and that pay for knowledge rather than for manual work,
whether skilled or unskilled.</p>
<p>One possible factor may have been the GI Bill of Rights after the
Second World War, which by offering a college education to every
returning American veteran established advanced education as the ‘norm’
and everything less as ‘substandard’. Another factor may have been the
draft the United States introduced in the Second World War and
maintained for thirty-five years afterwards, as a result of which the
great majority of American male adults born between 1920 and 1950 – and
that means the majority of American adults alive today – served in the
military for several years where they were forced to acquire a
high-school education if they did not already have one. But whatever the
explanation, in the United States the shift to knowledge work from
blue-collar manual work making and moving things has largely been
accepted (except in the Black community) as appropriate or, at least, as
inevitable.</p>
<p>In the United States the shift, by 1990 or so, had largely been
accomplished. But so far only in the United States. In the other
developed free-market countries, in western and northern Europe and in
Japan, it is just beginning in the 1990s. It is, however, certain to
proceed rapidly in these countries from now on, and perhaps to proceed
there faster than it originally did in the United States. Will it then
also proceed, as it did by and large in the United States, with a
minimum of social upheaval, of social dislocation, of social unrest? Or
will the American development turn out to be another example of
‘American exceptionalism’ (as has so much of American social history and
especially of American labour history)? In Japan, the superiority of
formal education and of the formally educated person is generally
accepted so that the fall of the industrial worker – still a fairly
recent class in Japan and outnumbering farmers and domestic servants
only since well after the Second World War – may well be accepted as
appropriate as it has been in the United States, and perhaps even more
so. But what about industrialized Europe – the United Kingdom, Germany,
France, Belgium, northern Italy, and so on – where there has been a
‘working-class culture’ and a ‘self-respecting working class’ for well
over a century, and where, despite all evidence to the contrary, the
belief is still deeply ingrained that industrial, blue-collar work,
rather than knowledge, is the creator of all wealth? Will Europe react
the way the American Black has reacted? This surely is a key question,
the answer to which will largely determine the social as well as the
economic future of the developed free-market countries of Europe. And
the answer will be given within the next decade or so.</p>
<p>The fall of the industrial blue-collar worker in the developed,
free-market countries will also have major impacts outside of the
developed world. It means that developing countries can no longer expect
to base their development on their comparative labour advantage, that
is, on cheap industrial labour.</p>
<p>It is widely believed, especially, of course, by labour-union
officials, that the fall of the blue-collar industrial worker in the
developed countries was largely, if not entirely, caused by moving
production ‘offshore’ to countries of abundant supply of unskilled
labour and low wages. But this is not true.</p>
<p>There was something to the belief thirty years ago, this is, before
1965 or 1970. Japan, Taiwan, and, later on, South Korea did indeed (as
explained in some detail in my 1993 book Post-Capitalist Society) gain
their initial advantage in the world market by combining America’s
invention of training for full productivity almost overnight with wage
costs that were still those of a pre-industrial country. They thereby
created a workforce that had the productivity and quality of a developed
country and the labour costs of a developing one. But this worked only
for some twenty or thirty years. It has not worked at all since 1970 or
1975.</p>
<p>In the 1900s, only an insignificant percentage of manufactured goods
imported into the United States is based on low labour costs. While
total imports in 1990 accounted for about 12 per cent of American gross
national product, imports into the United States from countries with
wage costs that are significantly lower than US wage costs accounted for
less than 3 percent–and only half of those, that is, only 1 per cent or
1½ per cent of the gross domestic product, were imports of manufactured
products.* Of the decline in American blue-collar, industrial employment
from some 30 per cent or 35 per cent to 15–18 per cent of the workforce,
practically nothing can therefore be blamed on moving work to low-wage
countries. The main competition for American manufacturing industry – in
cars for instance, in steel, in machine tools – has come from countries
such as Japan or Germany where wage costs have long been equal to US
wage costs, if not higher. The comparative advantage which now counts is
in the application of knowledge, e.g. in Japan’s Total Quality
Management, Lean Manufacturing, Just-in-Time Delivery and Price-based
Costing, or in the customer service of the medium-sized German or Swiss
engineering company. This means, however, that developing countries can
no longer expect to base their development on low wages. They, too, must
learn to base it on applying knowledge – just at the time when most of
them (e.g. most of Latin America and China) will have to find jobs for
millions of uneducated and unskilled young people qualified for little
except yesterday’s blue-collar industrial jobs.</p>
<p>But for the developed countries, too, the shift poses major social
challenge. Blue-collar workers are manual workers as were farmers and
domestic servants. They still ‘earn their bread by the sweat of their
brow’. Marx proclaimed that blue-collar, industrial workers were
something totally new and totally different. Yes, they worked in a
factory. But otherwise they were traditional workers. Most earlier
workers were similarly not independent but dependent – as hired hands
and landless labourers on the land; as domestic servants whether free or
unfree; as apprentices and journeymen in the craftsman’s shop. That the
blue-collar, industrial worker did not own ’the tools of production was
also not new, as Marx asserted. Even tenant farmers did not, let alone
the far more numerous hired hands. Nor did domestic servants or the
craftsmen’s apprentices and journeymen. Despite the factory, industrial
society was still, essentially, a traditional society in its basic
social relationships of production.</p>
<p>But the emerging society, the one based on knowledge and knowledge
worker, is not. It is the first society in which ‘honest work’ does not
mean a calloused hand. It is also the first society in which everybody
does not do the same work, as was the case when the huge majority were
farmers or were, as seemed likely only forty or thirty years ago, going
to be machine operators.</p>
<p>This is far more than a social change. It is a change in the human
condition, What it means – what the values are of this society, what its
commitments are, what its problems are – we do not know. But we do know
that they will be different. We do know that the twenty-first century
will be different – as regards politics and society, but above all, as
regards humans.</p>
<p>The emerging knowledge society</p>
<p>Knowledge workers will not be the majority in the knowledge society.
But in many countries, if not most developed countries, they will be the
largest single group in the population and the workforce. And even if
outnumbered by other groups, knowledge workers will be the group that
gives the emerging knowledge society its character, its leadership, its
social profile. They may not be the ruling class of the knowledge
society, but they already are its leading class. And in their
characteristics, their social position, their values, and their
expectations, they differ fundamentally from any group in history that
has ever occupied the leading, let alone the dominant, position.</p>
<p>In the first place, the knowledge worker gains access to work, job,
and social position through formal education.</p>
<p>A great deal of knowledge work will require high manual skill and
substantial work with one’s hands. An extreme example is neurosurgery.
The neurosurgeon’s performance capacity rests on formal education and
theoretical knowledge. Absence of manual skill disqualifies for work as
a neurosurgeon, but manual skill alone, no matter how advanced, will
never enable anyone to be a neurosurgeon. The formal education that is
required for knowledge work is education that can only be acquired in
and through formal schooling. It cannot be acquired through
apprenticeship.</p>
<p>In the amount and kind of formal knowledge required, knowledge work
will vary tremendously from one occupation to the next. Some will have
fairly low requirements, others will require the kind of knowledge the
neurosurgeon has to possess. But even if the knowledge itself is quite
primitive, it is knowledge that only formal education can provide.
Filing is hardly advanced knowledge work. But it is based on a knowledge
of the alphabet – or in Japan on a knowledge of Chinese ideographs –
which can be acquired only in and through systematic learning, that is,
in and through formal schooling.</p>
<p>The first implication of this is that education will become the
centre of the knowledge society, and schooling its key institution. What
knowledge is required for everybody? What mix of knowledges is required
for everybody? What is ‘quality’ in learning and teaching? All these
will, of necessity, become central concerns of the knowledge society,
and central political issues. In fact, it may not be too fanciful to
anticipate that the acquisition and distribution of formal knowledge
will come to occupy the place in the politics of the knowledge society
that acquisition and distribution of property and income have occupied
in the two or three centuries that we have come to call the Age of
Capitalism.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, this may not necessarily mean that the school as we
know it will become more important. For in the knowledge society clearly
more and more knowledge, and especially advanced knowledge, will be
acquired well past the age of formal schooling, and increasingly,
perhaps, in and through educational processes that do not centre on the
traditional school – for example, systematic continuing education
offered at the place of employment. But at the same time, there is very
little doubt that the performance of the schools and the basic values of
the schools will increasingly become of concern to society as a whole,
rather than be considered ‘professional’ matters that can safely be left
to the ‘educator’.</p>
<p>We can also predict with high probability that we will redefine what
it means to be an ‘educated person’. Traditionally, and especially
during the last 200 or 300 years, at least in the West (and since about
that time in Japan, as well), an educated person was somebody who shared
a common stock of formal knowledge – someone who had what the Germans
called Allgemeine Bildung (a general education) and the English (and
following them, the nineteenth-century Americans) called a ‘Liberal
education’. Increasingly, an ‘educated person’ will be somebody who has
learned how to learn and who throughout his or her lifetime continues
learning, and especially learning in and through formal education.</p>
<p>There are obvious dangers to this. Such a society can easily
degenerate into one in which the emphasis is on formal degrees rather
than on performance capacity. It can easily degenerate into one of
totally sterile, Confucian-type mandarins – a danger to which the
American university, particularly, is singularly susceptible. It can, on
the other hand, also fall prey to overvaluing immediately usable,
‘practical’ knowledge, and underrate the importance of fundamentals, and
of wisdom altogether.</p>
<p>This society in which knowledge workers dominate is in danger of a
new ‘class conflict’: the conflict between the large minority of
knowledge workers and the majority of people who will make their living
through traditional ways, either by manual work, whether skilled or
unskilled, or by services work, whether skilled or unskilled. The
productivity of knowledge work – still abysmally low – will predictably
become the economic challenge of the knowledge society. On it will
depend the competitive position of every single country, every single
industry, every single institution within society. The productivity of
the non-knowledge-services worker will increasingly become the social
challenge of the knowledge society. On it will depend the ability of the
knowledge society to give decent incomes, and with them dignity and
status, to non-knowledge people.</p>
<p>No society in history has faced these challenges. But equally new are
the opportunities of the knowledge society. In the knowledge society,
for the first time in history, access to leadership is open to all.
Equally, access to the acquisition of knowledge will no longer be
dependent on obtaining a prescribed education at any given age. Learning
will become the tool of the individual – available to him or her at any
point in life – if only because so much of skill and knowledge can be
acquired by means of the new learning technologies.</p>
<p>Another implication is that the productivity of an individual, an
organization, an industry, a country, in acquiring and applying
knowledge will increasingly become the key competitive factor – for
career and earnings opportunities of the individual; for the
performance, perhaps even the survival, of the individual organization;
for an industry; and for a country. The knowledge society will
inevitably become far more competitive than any society we have yet
known – for the simple reason that with knowledge being universally
accessible, there are no excuses for non-performance. There will be no
‘poor’ countries. There will only be ignorant countries. And the same
will be true for individual companies, individual industries, and
individual organizations of any kind. It will be true for the
individual, too. In fact, developed societies have already become
infinitely more competitive for the individual than were the societies
of the early twentieth century – let alone earlier societies, those of
the nineteenth or eighteenth centuries. Then, most people had no
opportunity to rise out of the ‘class’ into which they were born, with
most individuals following their fathers in their work and in their
station in life.</p>
<p>I have been speaking of knowledge. But the proper term is knowledges.
For the knowledge of the knowledge society is fundamentally different
from what was considered knowledge in earlier societies, and in fact,
from what is still widely considered knowledge. The knowledge of the
German Allgemeine Bildung or of the Anglo-American Liberal education had
little to do with one’s life’s work. It focused on the person and the
person’s development rather than on any application – and often even
prided itself on having no utility whatever. In the knowledge society,
however, knowledge basically exists only in application.</p>
<p>Knowledge in application is, by definition, highly specialized –
which was the reason why Plato’s Socrates, 2500 years ago, refused to
accept it as knowledge and considered it mere techne, that is, mere
skill.</p>
<p>Some knowledge work requires a fairly limited amount of knowledge –
examples are some paramedical technologists, such as the X-ray
technologist, the technologist in the clinical laboratory, or the
pulmonary technologist. Other knowledge work requires far more advanced
theoretical knowledge: for example, most of the knowledge work required
in business, whether in market research; in product planning; in
designing manufacturing systems; in advertising and promotion; in
purchasing. In some areas the knowledge base is vast indeed, as in
neurosurgery and in a good many areas of management, such as managing a
major hospital, a big and complex university, or a multinational
enterprise.</p>
<p>Whatever the base, knowledge in application is specialized. It is
always specific, and therefore not applicable to anything else. Nothing
the X-ray technician needs to know can be applied to market research,
for instance, or to teaching medieval history.</p>
<p>The central workforce in the knowledge society will, therefore,
consist of highly specialized people. In fact, it is a mistake to speak
of ‘generalists’. Those whom we refer to by that term will increasingly
be those who have learned how to acquire additional specialities and
especially to acquire rapidly the specialized knowledge needed for them
to move from one kind of work or job to another, such as from being a
market researcher to being in general management, or from being a nurse
in the hospital to being a hospital administrator. But ‘generalists’ in
the sense in which we used to talk of them are becoming dilettantes
rather than educated people.</p>
<p>This too is new. Historically, workers were generalists. They did
whatever had to be done – on the farm, in the household, in the
craftsman’s shop. This was also true of the industrial worker.
Manufacturing industry only expanded and became dominant when it learned
to take the specialized skill out of the work, that is, when it
converted the skilled craftsmen of pre-industrial times into the
semi-skilled or unskilled machine operator of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>But knowledge workers, whether their knowledge is primitive or
advanced, whether they possess a little of it or a great deal, will, by
definition, be specialized. Knowledge in application is effective only
when it is specialized. Indeed, it is more effective, the more highly
specialized it is. This goes for the technician, such as the person who
services a computer, an X-ray machine, or the engine of a fighter
plane.* But it equally applies to work that requires the most advanced
knowledge, whether research into genetics or astrophysics or putting on
the first performance of a new opera.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the shift from knowledge to knowledges offers
tremendous opportunities to the individual. It makes possible a ‘career’
as a knowledge worker. But it equally presents a great many new problems
and challenges. It demands for the first time in history that people
with knowledge take responsibility for making themselves understood by
people who do not have the same knowledge base. It requires that people
learn – and preferably early – how to assimilate into their own work
specialized knowledges from other areas and other disciplines.</p>
<p>This is particularly important, as innovation in any one knowledge
area tends to originate outside the area itself. This is true in respect
to products and processes – where, in sharp contrast to the way it was
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, innovations now tend to arise
outside the industry or process itself. It is true just as much in
scientific knowledge and in scholarship. The new approaches to the study
of history have, for instance, come out of economics, psychology, and
archaeology – all disciplines which historians never considered relevant
to their field and to which historical research had rarely before been
exposed.</p>
<p>How knowledges work</p>
<p>That knowledge in the knowledge society has to be highly specialized
to be productive implies two new requirements:</p>
<p>1 Knowledge workers work in teams.</p>
<p>2 Knowledge workers have to have access to an organization. If not
employees they, at least, have to be affiliated with an
organization.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk these days about ‘teams’ and
‘teamwork’. Most of it starts out with the wrong assumption, namely,
that we never before worked in teams. Actually, people have always
worked in teams – very few people ever could work effectively by
themselves. The farmer had to have a wife, and the farmwife had to have
a husband. The two worked as a team. And both worked as a team with
their employees, the hired hands. The craftsman also had to have a wife,
with whom he worked as a team – he took care of the craft work, she took
care of the customers, the apprentices, and the business altogether. And
both worked as a team with journeymen and apprentices. The present
discussion also assumes as self-evident that there is only one kind of
team. Actually there are quite a few.* But until now the emphasis has
been on the individual worker and not on the team. With knowledge work
being the more effective, the more specialized it is, teams become the
actual work unit rather than the individual.</p>
<p>But the team that is being touted now as the team – I call it the
‘jazz-combo’ team – is only one kind of team. Jazz-combo teamwork is
actually the most difficult kind to master: it is the team that requires
the longest time to gain performance capacity.</p>
<p>We will have to learn to use different kinds of teams for different
purposes. We will have to learn to understand teams – and this is
something to which, so far, very little attention has been paid. The
understanding of the performance capacities of different kinds of teams,
their strengths, their limitations, the trade-offs between various kinds
of teams – those considerations will increasingly become central
concerns in the management of people.</p>
<p>The individual knowledge worker will also have to learn something
that today practically no one has learned: how to switch from one kind
of team to another; how to integrate himself or herself into teams: what
to expect of a team; and, in turn, what to contribute to a team.</p>
<p>The ability to diagnose what kind of team a certain kind of knowledge
work requires for full effectiveness, and the ability, then, to organize
such a team and integrate oneself into it, will increasingly become a
requirement for effectiveness as a knowledge worker. So far, it is not
taught or learned anywhere (except in a few research labs). So far, very
few executives in any kind of organization even realize that it is their
job, to a large extent, to decide what kind of team is needed for a
given situation, how to organize it, and how to make it effective. We
are not even in the very early stages of work on teams, their
characteristics, their specifications, their performance
characteristics, and their appraisal.</p>
<p>Equally important is the second implication of the fact that
knowledge workers are, of necessity, specialists: the need for them to
work as members of an organization. It is only the organization that can
provide the basic continuity that knowledge workers need to be
effective. It is only the organization that can convert the specialized
knowledge of the knowledge worker into performance.</p>
<p>By itself, specialized knowledge yields no performance. The surgeon
is not effective unless there is a diagnosis, which, by and large, is
not the surgeon’s task and not even within the surgeon’s competence.
Market researchers, by themselves, produce only data, To convert the
data into information, let alone to make them effective in knowledge
action, requires marketing people, production people, service people. As
a loner in his or her own research and writing, the historian can be
very effective. But to produce the education of students, a great many
other specialists have to contribute – people whose speciality may be
literature, or mathematics, or other areas of history. And this requires
that the specialist have access to an organization.</p>
<p>This access may be as a consultant. It may be as a provider of
specialized services. But for a large number of knowledge workers it
will be as employees of an organization – full-time or part-time –
whether a government agency; a hospital; a university; a business; a
labour union, any of hundreds of others. In the knowledge society, it is
not the individual who performs. The individual is a cost centre rather
than a performance centre. It is the organization that performs. The
individual physician may have a great deal of knowledge. But the
physician is impotent without the knowledge provided by a host of
scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, genetics, and so
on. The physician is impotent without the test results produced by a
host of diagnosticians, running imaging machines, whether X-ray or
ultrasound; making and interpreting blood tests; administering brain
scans; and so on. And the physician is impotent without the services of
the hospital, which administers intravenous solutions and cares for the
critically ill patients, and which also provides the physical and/or
psychiatric rehabilitation without which there is no full recovery. To
provide any of these services, whether the electrocardiogram, the
analysis of the blood samples, the magnetic resonance imaging, or the
exercises of the physical therapist, physicians need access to the
organization of the hospital, that is, to a highly structured
enterprise, organized to operate in perpetuity.</p>
<p>The employee society</p>
<p>The knowledge society is an employee society. Traditional society,
that is, society before the rise of the manufacturing enterprise and the
blue-collar manufacturing worker, was not a society of independents.
Thomas Jefferson’s society of independent small farmers, each being the
owner of his own family farm and farming it without any help except for
that of his wife and his children, was never much more than fantasy.
Most people in history were dependants. But they did not work for an
organization. They were working for an owner, as slaves, as serfs, as
hired hands on the farm; as journeymen and apprentices in the
craftsman’s shops; as shop assistants and salespeople for a merchant; as
domestic servants, free or unfree; and so on. They worked for a
‘master’. When blue-collar work in manufacturing first arose, they still
worked for a ‘master’.</p>
<p>In Dickens’s great 1854 novel Hard Times, the workers work for an
‘owner’. They do not work for the ‘factory’. Only late in the nineteenth
century did the factory rather than the owner become the employer. And
only in the twentieth century did the corporation, rather than the
factory, then become the employer. Only in this century has the ‘master’
been replaced by a ‘boss’, who, himself, ninety-nine times out of a
hundred, is an employee and has a boss himself.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers will be both ‘employees’ who have a ‘boss’ and
‘bosses’ who have ‘employees’.</p>
<p>Organizations were not known to yesterday’s social science, and are,
by and large, not yet known to today’s social science. The great German
sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936), in his 1888 book Gemeinschaft
und Gesellschaft (Community and Society), classified the known forms of
human organization as being either ‘community’, which is ‘organic’, and
‘fate’, or ‘society’, which is a ‘structure’ and very largely under
social control. He never talked of ‘organization’. Nor did any of the
other sociologists of the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. But
organization is neither community nor society, although it partakes of
some characteristics of each. Membership in an organization is not
‘fate’. It is always freely chosen. One joins a company or a government
agency or the teaching staff of a university. One is not born into it.
And one can always leave – in traditional communities one could only
emigrate. It is not society, either, especially as it does not embrace
the totality of its members. The director of market research in a
company is also a member of half a dozen other organizations. She may
belong to a church, to a tennis club, and may well spend – especially if
an American – five hours a week as a volunteer for a local non-profit
organization, for example as a leader of a Girl Guide troop.
Organizations, in other words, are not true collectives. They are tools,
that is, means to an end.</p>
<p>There have been earlier organizations. The professional military as
it arose after the seventeenth century was an ‘organization’; it was
neither a society nor a community. The modern university, as it emerged
after the foundation of the University of Berlin in 1809, was an
organization. Faculty members freely joined and could always leave. The
same can be said for the civil service as it arose in the eighteenth
century, first in France, then in the rest of the Continent, and finally
in the late nineteenth century in Britain and Meiji Japan (though in the
United States not until 1933 or the Second World War). But these earlier
organizations were still seen as exceptions. The first ‘organization in
the modern sense, the first that was seen as being protypical rather
than exceptional, was surely the modern business enterprise as it
emerged after 1870 – which is the reason why, to this day, most people
think of ‘management’, that is, of the organization’s specific organ, as
being ‘business management’.</p>
<p>With the emergence of the knowledge society, society has become a
society of organizations. Most of us work in and for an organization,
are dependent for our effectiveness and equally for our living on access
to an organization, whether as an organization’s employee or as a
provider of services to an organization – as a lawyer, for instance, or
a freight forwarder. And more and more of these supporting services to
organizations are, themselves, organized as organizations. The first law
firm was organized in the United States a little over a century ago –
until then lawyers practised as individuals. In Europe there were no law
firms to speak of until after the Second World War. Today, the practice
of law is increasingly done in larger and larger partnerships. But that
is also true, especially in the United States, of the practice of
medicine. The knowledge society is a society of organizations in which
practically every single social task is being performed in and through
an organization.</p>
<p>What is an employee?</p>
<p>Most knowledge workers will spend most if not all of their working
life as ‘employees’. But the meaning of the term is different from what
it has been traditionally – and not only in English but in German,
Spanish and Japanese as well.</p>
<p>Individually, knowledge workers are dependent on the job. They
receive a wage or salary. They are being hired and can be fired.
Legally, each is an ‘employee’. But collectively, they are the only
‘capitalists’; increasingly, through their pension funds and through
their other savings (e.g. in the United States through mutual funds),
the employees own the means of production. In traditional economics (and
by no means only in Marxist economics) there is a sharp distinction
between the ‘wage fund’ – all of which went into consumption – and the
‘capital fund’. And most social theory of industrial society is based,
one way or another, on the relationship between the two, whether in
conflict or in necessary and beneficial cooperation and balance. In the
knowledge society, the two merge. The pension fund is ‘deferred wage’
and, as such, a wage fund. But it is also increasingly the main source
of capital, if not the only source of capital, for the knowledge
society.</p>
<p>Equally important, and perhaps more important, is that in the
knowledge society the employees, that is, knowledge workers, again own
the tools of production. Marx’s great insight was the realization that
the factory worker does not and cannot own the tools of production and,
therefore, has to be ‘alienated’. There was no way, Marx pointed out,
for workers to own the steam engine and to be able to take the steam
engine with them when moving from one job to another. The capitalist has
to own the steam engine and had to control it. Increasingly, the true
investment in the knowledge society is not in machines and tools. It is
in the knowledge worker. Without it, the machines, no matter how
advanced and sophisticated, are unproductive.</p>
<p>The market researcher needs a computer. But increasingly this is the
researcher’s own personal computer, and a cheap tool the market
researcher takes along wherever he or she goes. And the true ‘capital
equipment’ of market research is the knowledge of markets, of
statistics, and of the application of market research to business
strategy, which is lodged between the researchers’ ears and is their
exclusive and inalienable property. The surgeon needs the operating room
of the hospital and all its expensive capital equipment. But the
surgeon’s true capital investment are the twelve or fifteen years of
training and the resulting knowledge which the surgeon takes from one
hospital to the next. Without that knowledge, the hospital’s expensive
operating rooms are so much waste and scrap.</p>
<p>This is true whether the knowledge worker commands advanced
knowledge, like the surgeon, or simple and fairly elementary knowledge,
like the junior accountant. In either case, it is the knowledge
investment that determines whether the employee is productive or not,
rather than the tools, machines, and capital the organization furnishes.
The industrial worker needed the capitalist infinitely more than the
capitalist needed the industrial worker – the basis for Marx’s assertion
that there would always be a surplus of industrial workers, and an
‘industrial reserve army’ that would make sure that wages could not
possibly rise above the subsistence level (probably Marx’s most
egregious error). In the knowledge society the most probable assumption
– and certainly the assumption on which all organizations have to
conduct their affairs – is that they need the knowledge worker far more
than the knowledge worker needs them. It is up to the organization to
market its knowledge jobs so as to obtain knowledge workers in adequate
quantity and superior quality. The relationship increasingly is one of
interdependence with the knowledge worker having to learn what the
organization needs, but with the organization also having to learn what
the knowledge worker needs, requires, and expects.</p>
<p>Because its work is based on knowledge, the knowledge organization it
altogether not one of superiors and subordinates.* The prototype is the
symphony orchestra. The first violin may be the most important
instrument in the orchestra. But the first violin-ist is not the
‘superior’ of the harp player. He is a colleague. And the harp part is
the harp player’s part and not delegated to her bv either the conductor
or the first violinist.</p>
<p>There was endless debate in the Middle Ages about the hierarchy of
knowledges, with philosophy claiming to be the ‘queen’ of the
knowledges. We long ago gave up that moot argument. There is no higher
knowledge and no lower knowledge. When the patient’s complaint is an
ingrown toenail, the chiropodist’s knowledge controls, and not that of
the brain surgeon – even though the brain surgeon represents many more
years of training and gets a much larger fee. Conversely, if an
executive is posted to a foreign country, the knowledge he or she needs,
and in a hurry, is the fairly low skill of acquiring fluency in a
foreign language – a language that every native of that country has
mastered by age two and without any great investment. The knowledge of
the knowledge society, precisely because it is knowledge only when
applied in action, derives its rank and standing from the situation and
not from its knowledge content. What is knowledge, in other words, in
one situation, such as the knowledge of Korean for the American
executive posted to Seoul, is only information, and not very relevant
information at that, when the same executive a few years later has to
think through his company’s market strategy for Korea. This, too, is
new. Knowledges were always seen as fixed stars, so to speak, each
occupying its own position in the universe of knowledge. In the
knowledge society, knowledges are tools and, as such, dependent for
their importance and position on the task to be performed.</p>
<p>One additional conclusion: because the knowledge society perforce has
to be a society or organizations, its central and distinctive organ is
management.</p>
<p>When we first began to talk of management, the term meant ‘business
management’ – since large-scale business was the first of the new
organizations to become visible. But we have learned this last
half-century that management is the distinctive organ of all
organizations. All of them require management – whether they use the
term or not. All managers do the same things whatever the business of
their organization. All of them have to bring people – each of them
possessing a different knowledge – together for joint performance. All
of them have to make human strengths productive in performance and human
weaknesses irrelevant. All of them have to think through what are
‘results’ in the organization – and have then to define objectives. All
of them are responsible to think through what I call the ‘theory of the
business’, that is, the assumptions on which the organization bases its
performance and actions, and equally, the assumptions which
organizations make to decide what things not to do. All of them require
an organ that thinks through strategies, that is, the means through
which the goals of the organization become performance. All of them have
to define the values of the organization, its system of rewards and
punishments, and with it its spirit and its culture. In all of them,
managers need both the knowledge of management as work and discipline
and the knowledge and understanding of the organization itself, its
purposes, its values, its environment and markets, its core
competencies.</p>
<p>Management as a practice is very old. The most successful executive
in all history was surely that Egyptian who, 4700 years or more ago,
first conceived the pyramid – without any precedent – and designed and
built it, and did so in record time. With a durability unlike that of
any other human work that first pyramid still stands. But as a
discipline, management is barely fifty years old. It was first dimly
perceived around the time of the First World War. It did not emerge
until the Second World War and then primarily in the United States.
Since then, it has been the fastest-growing new function, and its study
the fastest-growing new discipline. No function in history has emerged
as fast as management and managers have in the last fifty to sixty
years, and surely none has had such worldwide sweep in such a short
period.</p>
<p>Management, in most business schools, is still taught as a bundle of
techniques, such as the technique of budgeting. To be sure, management,
like any other work, has its own tools and its own techniques. But just
as the essence of medicine is not the urinalysis, important though it
is, the essence of management is not techniques and procedures. The
essence of management is to make knowledge productive. Management, in
other words, is a social function. And in its practice, management is
truly a ‘liberal art’.</p>
<p>The social sector</p>
<p>The old communities – family, village, parish, and so on – have all
but disappeared in the knowledge society. Their place has largely been
taken by the new unit of social integration: the organization. Where
community membership was seen as fate, organization membership is
voluntary. Where community claimed the entire person, organization is a
means to a person’s end, a tool. For 200 years a hot debate has been
raging, especially in the West: are communities ‘organic’ or are they
simply extensions of the person? Nobody would claim that the new
organization is ‘organic’. It is clearly an artifact, a human creation,
a social technology.</p>
<p>But who, then, does the social tasks? Two hundred years ago, social
tasks were being done in all societies by the local community –
primarily, of course, by the family. Very few, if any, of these tasks
are now being done by the old communities. Nor would they be capable of
doing them. People no longer stay where they were born, neither in terms
of geography nor in terms of social position and status. By definition,
a knowledge society is a society of mobility. And all the social
functions of the old communities, whether performed well or poorly (and
most were performed very poorly, indeed), presupposed that the
individual and the family would stay put. ‘Family is where they have to
take you in,’ said a nineteenth-century adage; and community, to repeat,
was fate. To leave the community meant becoming an outcast, perhaps even
an outlaw. But the essence of a knowledge society is mobility in terms
of where one lives, mobility in terms of what one does, mobility in
terms of one’s affiliation.</p>
<p>This very mobility means that in the knowledge society, social
challenges and social tasks multiply. People no longer have ‘roots’.
People no longer have a ‘neighbourhood’ that controls where they live,
what they do, and indeed, what their ‘problems’ are allowed to be. The
knowledge society, by definition, is a competitive society; with
knowledge accessible to everyone, everyone is expected to place himself
or herself, to improve himself or herself, and to have aspirations. It
is a society in which many more people than ever before can be
successful. But it is therefore, by definition, also a society in which
many more people than ever before can fail, or at least can come second.
And if only because the application of knowledge to work has made
developed societies so much richer than any earlier society could even
dream of becoming, the failures, whether poverty or alcoholism, battered
women or juvenile delinquents, are seen as failures of society. In
traditional society they were taken for granted. In the knowledge
society they are an affront, not just to the sense of justice but
equally to the competence of society and its self-respect.</p>
<p>Who then, in the knowledge society, takes care of the social tasks?
We can no longer ignore them. But traditional community is incapable of
tackling them.</p>
<p>Two answers have emerged in this century – a majority answer and a
dissenting opinion. Both have been proven to be the wrong answers.</p>
<p>The majority answer goes back more than a hundred years, to the
1880s, when Bismarck’s Germany took the first faltering steps towards
the welfare state. The answer: the problems of the social sector can,
should, and must be solved by government. It is still probably the
answer which most people accept, especially in the developed countries
of the West – even though most people probably no longer fully believe
it. But it has been totally disproven. Modern government, especially
since the Second World War, has become a huge welfare bureaucracy
everywhere. And the bulk of the budget in every developed country today
is devoted to ‘entitlements’, that is, to payment for all kinds of
social services. And yet, in every developed country, society is
becoming sicker rather than healthier, and social problems are
multiplying. Government has a big role to play in social tasks – the
role of policy maker, of standard setter, and, to a substantial extent,
the role of paymaster. But as the agency to run social services, it has
proven itself almost totally incompetent – and we now know why.</p>
<p>The second dissenting opinion was first formulated by me in my 1942
book The Future of Industrial Man. I argued then that the new
organization – and fifty years ago that meant the large business
enterprise – would have to be the community in which the individual
would find status and function, with the plant community, I argued,
becoming the place in and through which the social tasks would be
organized. In Japan (though quite independently and without any debt to
me) the large employer – government agency or business – has indeed
increasingly attempted to become a ‘community’ for its employees.
‘Lifetime employment’ is only one affirmation of this. Company housing,
company health plans, company vacations, and so on, all emphasize for
the Japanese employee that the employer, and especially the big
corporation, is the community and the successor to yesterday’s village
and to yesterday’s family. But this, too, has not worked.</p>
<p>There is a need indeed, especially in the West, to bring the employee
increasingly into the government of the plan community. What is now
called ‘empowerment’ is very similar to the things I talked about more
than fifty years ago. But is does not create a community. And it does
not create the structure through which the social tasks of the knowledge
society can be tackled. In fact, practically all these tasks, whether
providing education or health care; addressing the anomalies and
diseases of a developed and, especially, of a rich society, such as
alcohol and drug abuse; or tackling the problems of incompetence and
irresponsibility such as those of the ‘underclass’ in the American city
– all lie outside the employing institution.</p>
<p>The employing institution is, and will remain, an ‘organization’. The
relationship between it and the individual is not that of ‘membership’
in a ‘community’, that is, an unbreakable, twoway bond. Even in Japan,
lifetime employment has proven not to be tenable except, perhaps, for
government employees (as it is in the West, as well).</p>
<p>We may need more employment security than the United States
traditionally offers. But in no society, in an increasingly competitive
world economy, can the employing institution, whether a business, a
university, or a hospital, become a cocoon of security. To survive, it
needs employment flexibility. But increasingly also, knowledge workers,
and especially people of advanced knowledge, see the organization as the
tool for the accomplishment of their own purposes and, therefore, resent
– increasingly even in Japan – any attempt to subject them to the
organization as a community, that is, to the control of the
organization; to the demand of the organization that they commit
themselves to lifetime membership; and to the demand that they
subordinate their own aspirations to the goals and values of the
organization. The young knowledge people in Japan still sing the company
song. They still expect the company to provide them with job security.
However, not only do they refuse, increasingly, to sacrifice their
family life to the company. But they increasingly are as ready as their
Western counterparts to change jobs if there is a better one available.
For blue-collar workers in Japan who are employed by a major business
corporation, a change in jobs is still exceedingly painful. If possible
at all, it imposes a huge penalty in terms of income and social
standing. But the turnover rate among young engineers in the 1990s in
big Japanese corporations is rapidly approaching the turnover rate of
Western companies and in some areas actually exceeds it. This is
inevitable because the possessor of knowledge, as said earlier, owns his
or her ‘tools of production’ and has the freedom to move to wherever
opportunities for effectiveness, for accomplishment, and for advancement
seem greatest.</p>
<p>The right answer to the question ‘Who takes care of the social
challenges of the knowledge society?’ is thus neither ‘the government’
nor ‘the employing organization’. It is a separate and new social
sector.</p>
<p>It is less than fifty years, I believe, since we first talked in the
United States of the ‘two sectors’ of a modern society: the ‘public
sector’, that is, government, and the ‘private sector’, that is,
business. In the last twenty years the United States has begun to talk
of a ‘third sector’, the ‘non-profit sector’, the organizations that
take care of the social challenges of a modern society.</p>
<p>In the United States, with its tradition of independent and
competitive churches, such a sector has always existed. Even now,
churches are the largest single part of the social sector in the United
States, accounting for almost half of the money given to non-profit,
charitable institutions, and for somewhat less than half of the time
given to non-profit volunteer work by individuals. But the non-church
part of the social sector has been the growth sector in the United
States. In the 1990s, about one million organizations were registered in
the United States as non-profit or charitable organizations doing social
sector work. The overwhelming majority of these, some 70 per cent, have
come into existence in the last thirty years. And most are community
services concerned with this earth rather than with the Kingdom of
Heaven. Quite a few of the new organizations are, of course, religious
in their orientation. But even of these, few are ‘churches’. They are
‘parachurches’ engaged in a specific social task, for example,
rehabilitation of alcohol and drug addicts, the rehabilitation of
criminals, or the education of young children. Even within the church
segment of the social sector,the organizations that have shown the
capacity to grow are radically new. They are the fast-growing pastoral’
churches, which focus on the spiritual needs of individuals, and
especially of educated knowledge workers, and which then put the
spiritual energies of their members to work on the social challenges and
social problems of the community and especially, of course, of the urban
community.</p>
<p>We still talk of these organizations as ‘non-profits’. But this is a
legal term. It means nothing except that under American law these
organizations do not pay taxes.</p>
<p>Whether they are organized as ‘non-profit’ or not is actually
irrelevant to their function and behaviour. Many American hospitals
since 1960 or 1970 have become ‘for-profits’ and are organized in what
legally are business corporations. They function exactly the same way as
traditional ‘non-profit’ hospitals. What matters is thus not the legal
basis. What matters is that the social sector institutions have a
different purpose. Government demands compliance. It makes rules and
enforces them. Business expects to be paid; it supplies. The social
sector institutions aim at changing the human being. The ‘product’ of
the school is the student who has learned something. The ‘product’ of
the hospital is a cured patient. The ‘product’ of the church is a
church-goer whose life is being changed. The task of the social sector
organizations is to create human health.</p>
<p>Increasingly, these organizations of the social sector serve a second
and equally important purpose. They create citizenship. Modern society
and modern polity have become so big and complex that citizenship, that
is, responsible participation, is no longer possible. All we can do as
citizens is to vote once every few years and to pay taxes all the
time.</p>
<p>As a volunteer in the social sector institution, the individual can
again make a difference. In the United States, where there has been a
volunteer tradition all along because of the old independence of the
churches, almost every other adult in the 1990s worked at least three –
and often five – hours a week as a volunteer in a social organization.
Only in Britain is there something like this tradition, although on a
very much lower scale (in part because the welfare state is far more
embracing, but in much larger part because of the tradition of an
Established Church that is paid for by the state and run as a civil
service). Outside of the English-speaking countries, there is not much
volunteer tradition. In fact, the modern state in Europe and Japan has
been openly hostile to anything that smacks of volun-teerism – most so
in France and Japan. It is ancien régime and fundamentally suspected of
being subversive.</p>
<p>But even in these countries – Japan is perhaps the main example –
things are changing. For the knowledge society needs the social sector,
and the social sector needs the volunteer. But knowledge workers also
need a sphere in which they can act as citizens, that is, a sphere in
which they create a community. Organization does not give it to
them.</p>
<p>Nothing has been disproved faster than the concept of the
‘organization man’, which was almost generally accepted forty years ago.
In fact, the more satisfying one’s knowledge work is, the more one needs
a separate sphere of community activity. The volunteer who works in an
American church as a counsellor to young marrieds; who works in a local
school with learning-impeded children as a tutor; who works with normal
children as a scout leader – and there are thousands of such volunteer
activities – creates a sphere of personal achievement but also a
community in which people sharing their values work together for a
common good,</p>
<p>Many social sector organizations will become partners with government
– as is the case in a great many ‘privatizations’, where, for instance,
a city pays for street cleaning and an outside contractor then does the
work. In American education, predictably, within the next twenty years
there will be more and more government-paid ‘vouchers,’ which enable
parents to put their children into a variety of different schools, some
public and tax-supported, some private and largely dependent on the
income from the parents’ vouchers. These social sector organizations,
while partners with government, also clearly compete with government.
The relationship between the two has yet to be worked out – and there is
practically no precedent for it. (Or, rather, the one precedent we have,
the relationship between a government agency, for example the Department
of Defense of the United States, and independent defence contractors,
shows that the relationship is complicated and requires both
interdependence and mutual trust, and profound mutual distrust and
constant guerrilla warfare.)</p>
<p>But one thing is already clear, The knowledge society has to have
three sectors: a public sector, that is, government; a private sector,
that is, business; and a social sector. And it is also, I submit,
becoming increasingly clear that it is in and through the social sector
that a modern developed society can again create responsible and
achieving citizenship, can again give individuals – and especially
knowledge people – a sphere in which they can make a difference in
society, and a sphere in which they re-create community.</p>
<p>Knowledge economy and knowledge polity</p>
<p>The emergence of knowledge society and of the society of
organizations has profound political implications:</p>
<p>• It creates a new centre of policy</p>
<p>• It totally changes economic policy</p>
<p>• It challenges the capacity of government to function</p>
<p>School and education as society’s centre</p>
<p>Knowledge has become the key resource – for a nation’s military
strength as well as for a nation’s economic strength. And it is
knowledge that can be acquired only in a formal process, that is,
through schooling.</p>
<p>Knowledge as the key resource is fundamentally different from any of
the traditional key resources, that is, from land and labour, and even
from capital. It is not tied to any country. It is transnational. It is
portable. It can be created everywhere, fast, and cheaply. Finally, it
is, by definition, changing. Knowledge always makes itself obsolete
within a short period of time. The one thing that is predictable about a
competitive advantage based on knowledge – whether the advantage be that
of a country, of an industry, of an institution (whether a business or a
university), or of an individual – is that the advantage will soon be
challenged, and probably by a total newcomer.</p>
<p>For that reason alone the acquisition of knowledge, that is,
learning, can no longer stop at any age. ‘Life-long learning’ – the
now-fashionable term – may be hyperbole; a good many people stop
learning when they stop working and retire. But continuous learning
during one’s working life will increasingly be a requirement for any
knowledge worker.</p>
<p>The school can no longer be content to be a place that takes care of
juveniles not old enough to work. It will increasingly be the partner of
adults as well as the partner of their employing organizations. And
organizations, in turn – businesses and government agencies – social
sector non-profits in respect to their volunteers – will increasingly
have to become both partners with the schools and themselves teaching
and learning institutions.</p>
<p>But also schools and education are bound to become central political
issues. Of course, every existing educational system expresses basic
political and social values (on this see the discussion ‘Education as
Social Purpose’ in my 1989 book The New Realities). But neither the
content nor the quality nor the productivity and yield of schools and
schooling were major public issues in earlier times. They were concerns
primarily of the educator. Now, increasingly, they will become political
issues – in the United States we are already moving there, and quite
fast.</p>
<p>The competitive knowledge economy</p>
<p>That knowledge has become the key resource means that there is a
world economy. It means that the world economy, rather than the national
economy, controls, Every country, every industry, and every business
will, in its decisions, have to take into serious consideration its
competitive standing in the world economy and the competitiveness of its
knowledge competencies.</p>
<p>That knowledge creates a world economy, and a highly competitive one,
already underlay the transformation of the world economy after the
Second World War. The rise of Japan was based on applying knowledge,
primarily management and training as it had been developed by the
Americans during the war. The process began no earlier than 1950 or
1952. But by 1960 it had created a Japanese economy capable of attacking
the world’s leading manufacturing companies on their own ground, And
South Korea, a few years later, trod the same path.</p>
<p>It is no longer possible to do what the Japanese and the South
Koreans did. Low manufacturing wages, even combined with high
productivity, no longer give enough of a competitive advantage to build
a major economy. But the same process applied to advanced knowledge –
whether in engineering, in marketing, or in research – can lead to very
much the same results, and in a fairly short time.</p>
<p>At least this is what Singapore’s experience indicates. In 1965, when
the city seceded from Malaysia and became independent, it was still
dependent on the unskilled manual labour of dock-workers. A dozen years
later it had pushed itself into the world economy as an exporter of
low-skilled manufactured goods made with cheap but well-trained labour.
But Singapore at the same time heavily promoted and financed education.
The Singapore of 1994 is no longer a low-wage producer. It has become
producer and exporter of high-value-added and highly engineered products
– pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, telecommunication equipment,
optics – turned out by well-educated, young knowledge people. In fact,
within less than fifteen years Singapore has even acquired the capacity
to design such knowledge-intensive products.</p>
<p>And now the Singaporeans are using this recently acquired knowledge
competence to become leaders in mainland China’s new ‘capitalism’ – as
bankers, industrialists, and mass merchants.</p>
<p>Politics and policies still centre on domestic issues in every single
country. Few, if any, politicians, journalists, or civil servants look
beyond the boundaries of their own country when a new measure is being
discussed, whether taxes, regulations of business, or social spending.
Even in West Germany – Europe’s most export-conscious and
export-dependent major country – almost no one even asked in 1990 what
the government’s unbridled spending in the East would do to the
country’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>This will no longer do. Every country and every industry will have to
learn that the first question is not ‘Is this desirable?’ The first
question is ‘What will be the impact on the country’s (or the
industry’s) competitive position in the world economy?’ We need to
develop in politics something similar to the environmental impact
statement, which, in the United States, is now required for any
political action: we need a ‘competitive impact statement’. The impact
on one’s competitive position in the world economy should not be the
main, let alone the only, factor in a decision. But to make a decision
without considering it has become irresponsisble.</p>
<p>Altogether, the fact that knowledge has become the key resource means
that the standing of a country in the world economy will increasingly
determine its domestic prosperity.* Since 1950 the ability to improve a
country’s position in the world economy has been the main, and indeed
perhaps the sole, determinant of economic performance in the domestic
economy. Domestic economic policies have been practically irrelevant,
both for better and, very largely, even for worse (with the single
exception of governmental policies creating inflation, which very
rapidly undermine both a country’s competitive standing in the world
economy and its domestic stability and ability to grow).</p>
<p>The ‘primacy of foreign affairs’ is an old political precept going
back in European politics to the seventeenth century. Since the Second
World War it has also been accepted in American politics – though only
grudgingly, and as a ‘temporary emergency’ only. It always meant that
military security had to be given priority over domestic policies – and
in all likelihood this will continue, cold war or no cold war. But the
‘primacy of foreign affairs’ is now acquiring a different dimension. It
asserts that a country’s competitive position in the world economy – and
equally that of an industry or an organization – has to be the first
consideration in its domestic policies and its strategies. This is just
as true for a country that is only marginally involved in the world
economy (should there still be such a one) as it is for a business that
is only marginally involved in the world economy, or for a university
that sees itself as totally domestic. Knowledge knows no boundaries.
There is no ‘domestic knowledge’ and no ‘international knowledge’. There
is only knowledge. And with knowledge becoming the key resource, there
is only a world economy, even though the individual organization in its
daily activities operates within a national, regional, or even a local
setting.</p>
<p>How can government function?</p>
<p>The emergence of the society of organizations challenges the function
of government. All social tasks in the society of organizations are
increasingly being done by individual organizations, each created for
one, and only one, social task, whether education, health care, or
street cleaning. Society, therefore, is rapidly becoming pluralist. Yet
our social and political theories still assume a society in which there
are no power centres except government, To destroy or at least to render
impotent all other power centres was, in fact, the thrust of Western
history and Western politics for 500 years, from the fourteenth century
on. It culminated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when
(except in the United States) such original institutions as still
survived – for example, the universities or the established churches –
all became organs of the state, with their functionaries becoming civil
servants. But then, immediately beginning in the mid-nineteenth century,
new centres arose – the first one, the modern business enterprise,
emerged around 1870. And since then one new organization after another
has come into being.</p>
<p>This is not a new ‘feudalism’. Feudalism meant ‘public power in
private hands’.* Whether land-owning aristocracy or abbeys or free
cities or trading companies like the English East India Company, these
traditional bodies wanted to be governments. Within the sphere they
indeed wanted to be sovereign. They demanded control of jurisdiction
over their members. They aimed at having their own coinage. They tried
to regulate trade and commerce within their boundaries. And in many
cases they formed and ran their own armies.</p>
<p>The new institutions of the society of organizations have no interest
in ‘public power’. They do not want to be governments. But they demand –
and, indeed, need – autonomy with respect to their function. Even at the
extreme of Stalinism the managers of major industrial enterprises were
largely masters within their enterprise, and the individual industry was
largely autonomous. So was the university and the research lab, let
alone the military.</p>
<p>In the pluralism of yesterday, the feudalism of Europe’s Middle Ages,
or of Edo Japan in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, all
pluralist organizations, whether a feudal baron in the England of the
War of the Roses or the daimyo – the local lord – in Edo Japan, tried to
be in control of whatever went on in their community. At least they
tried to prevent anybody else from having control of any community
concern or community institution within their domain.</p>
<p>But in the society of organizations, each of the new institutions is
concerned only with its own purpose and mission. It does not claim power
over anything else. But it also does not assume responsibility for
anything else. Who then is concerned with the common good?</p>
<p>This has always been a central problem of pluralism. No earlier
pluralism solved it. The problem is coming back now, but in a different
guise. So far it has been seen as imposing limits on these institutions,
that is, forbidding them to do things in the pursuit of their own
mission, function and interest, which encroach upon the public domain or
violate public policy. The laws against discrimination – by race, sex,
age, education, health, and so on – which have proliferated in the
United States in the last forty years all forbid socially undesirable
behaviour. But we are increasingly raising the question of the ‘social
responsibility’ of these institutions: ‘What do these institutions have
to do – in addition to discharging their own functions – to advance the
public good?’ This, however – though nobody seems to realize it – is a
demand to return to the old pluralism, the pluralism of feudalism. It is
a demand for ‘private hands to assume public power’.</p>
<p>That this could seriously threaten the functioning of the new
organizations the example of the school in the United States makes
abundantly clear. One of the major reasons for the steady decline in its
capacity to do its own job, that is, to teach children elementary
knowledge skills, is surely that, beginning in the 1950s, the United
States has made the school increasingly the carrier of all kinds of
social policies, beginning with the elimination of racial
discriminations, the elimination of discrimination against all other
kinds of’minorities’, against the ‘handicapped’, and so on. Whether we
have actually made any progress in assuaging social ills is highly
debatable; so far the school has not proven a particularly effective
tool for social reform. But making the school the organ of social
policies has, without any doubt, severely impaired its capacity to do
its own job.</p>
<p>The new pluralism has the old problem of pluralism – who takes care
of the common good when the dominant institutions of society are
single-purpose institutions? But it also has a new problem: how to
maintain the performance capacity of the new institutions and yet
maintain the cohesion of society? This makes doubly important the
emergence of a strong and functioning social sector. It is an additional
reason why the social sector will increasingly be crucial to the
performance, if not to the cohesion, of the knowledge society.</p>
<p>The first new organization to arise, 125 years ago, was the business
enterprise. It was only natural, therefore, that the problem of the
emerging society of organizations was first seen as the relationship of
‘government and business’. It was also natural that the new ‘interests’
were first seen as ‘economic interests’.</p>
<p>The first attempt to come to grips with the politics of the emerging
society of organizations aimed, therefore, at making economic interests
serve the political process. The first to tackle this was an American,
Mark Hanna, the restorer of the Republican Party in the 1890s and, in
many ways, the founding father of twentieth-century American politics.
His definition of politics as being a dynamic disequilibrium between the
major economic interests – farmers, business, labour – remained the
foundation of American politics until the Second World War. In fact,
Franklin D. Roosevelt restored the Democratic Party by reformulating
Hanna. The basic political statement of this philosophy is the title of
the most influential political book written during the New Deal years –
in 1936 – Politics: Who Gets What, When, How, by Harold D. Laswell.</p>
<p>Mark Hanna, in 1896, knew very well that there are plenty of concerns
other than economic concerns. And yet it was obvious to him – as it was
to Franklin D. Roosevelt forty years later – that economic interests had
to be used to integrate all the other.This is still the assumption
underlying most analyses of American politics – and, in fact, of
politics in all developed countries. But it is no longer a tenable
assumption. Underlying the Mark Hanna formula of the ‘economic
interests’ is the view of land, labour, and capital as the ‘resources’.
But knowledge, the new resource for economic performance, is not in
itself economic.</p>
<p>It cannot be bought or sold. The fruits of knowledge, such as the
income from a patent, can be bought or sold. The knowledge that went
into the patent cannot be conveyed at any price. No matter how much a
medical student is willing to pay a neurosurgeon, the neurosurgeon
cannot sell to him – and surely cannot convey to him – the knowledge
that is the foundation for the neurosurgeon’s performance and for the
neurosurgeon’s income. The acquisition of knowledge has a cost, as has
the acquisition of anything. But the acquisition of knowledge has no
price.</p>
<p>Economic interests can therefore no longer integrate all other
concerns and interests. As soon as knowledge became the key economic
resource, the integration of the interests – and with it the integration
of the pluralism of a modern polity – began to fall apart. Increasingly,
non-economic interests are becoming the new pluralism, the ‘special
interests’, the ‘single-cause’ organizations, and so on. Increasingly,
politics is not about ‘who gets what, when, how’ but about values, each
of them considered to be an absolute. Politics is about ‘the right to
live’ of the embryo in the womb as against the right of a woman to
control her own body and to abort an embryo. It is about the
environment. It is about gaining equality for groups alleged to be
oppressed and discriminated against. None of these issues is economic.
All are fundamentally moral.</p>
<p>Economic interests can be compromised, which is the great strength of
basing politics on economic interests. ‘Half a loaf is still bread’ is a
meaningful saying. But ‘half a baby’, in the biblical story of the
judgment of Solomon, is not half a child. Half a baby is a corpse and a
chunk of meat. There is no compromise possible. To an environmentalist,
‘half an endangered species’ is an extinct species.</p>
<p>This greatly aggravates the crisis of modern government. Newspapers
and commentators still tend to report in economic terms what goes on in
Washington, in London, in Bonn, or in Tokyo. But more and more of the
lobbyists who determine governmental laws and governmental actions are
no longer lobbyists for economic interests. They lobby for and against
measures they – and their paymasters – see as moral, spiritual,
cultural. And each of these new moral concerns, each represented by a
new organization, claims to stand for an absolute. Dividing their loaf
is not compromising, It is treason.</p>
<p>There is thus in the society of organizations no single integrating
force that pulls individual organizations in society and community into
coalition. The traditional parties – perhaps the most successful
political creations of the nineteenth century – no longer can integrate
divergent groups and divergent points of view into a common pursuit of
power. Rather, they become battlefields between groups, each of them
fighting for absolute victory and not content with anything but total
surrender of the enemy.</p>
<p>This raises the question of how government can be made to function
again. In countries with a tradition of a strong independent
bureaucracy, notably Japan, Germany, and France, the civil service still
tries to hold government together. But even in these countries the
cohesion of government is increasingly being weakened by the special
interests and, above all, by the non-economic, the moral, special
interests.</p>
<p>Since Machiavelli, almost 500 years ago, political science has
primarily concerned itself with power. Machiavelli – and political
scientists and politicians since him – took it for granted that
government can function once it has power. Now, increasingly, the
questions to be tackled will be: ‘What are the functions that government
and only government, can discharge and that government must discharge?’
and ‘How can government be organized so that it can discharge these
functions in a society of organizations?’</p>
<p>Conclusion: the priority tasks – the need for social and political
innovations</p>
<p>The twenty-first century will surely be one of continuing social,
economic, and political turmoil and challenge, at least in its early
decades. The Age of Social Transformations is not over yet. And the
challenges looming ahead may be more serious and more daunting still
than those posed by the social transformations that have already
happened, the social transformations of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Yet we will not even have a chance to resolve these new and looming
problems of tomorrow unless we first address the challenges posed by the
developments that are already accomplished facts, the developments
reported in the earlier sections of this chapter.</p>
<p>They are the priority tasks. For only if they are tackled can we, in
the developed, democratic, free-market countries, hope to have the
social cohesion, the functioning economy, and the governmental capacity
needed to tackle the new challenges. The first order of business – for
sociologists, political scientists, and economists; for educators; for
business executives; politicians and non-profit leaders, and for people
in all walks of life, as parents, as employees, as citizens – is to work
on these priority tasks for only a few of which we so far have a
precedent, let alone tested solutions.</p>
<p>In sum, these priority tasks are as follows;</p>
<p>• We will have to think through education – its purpose, its value,
its content. We will have to learn to define the quality of education
and the productivity of education, to measure both and to manage
both.</p>
<p>• We need systematic work on the quality of knowledge and the
productivity of knowledge – neither even defined so far. On those two,
the performance capacity, and perhaps even the survival of any
organization in the knowledge society will increasingly come to depend.
But so will also the performance capacity and perhaps even the survival,
of any individual in the knowledge society. And what responsibility does
knowledge have? What are the responsibilities of the knowledge
individual, and especially of people of high – and therefore highly
specialized – knowledge?</p>
<p>• Increasingly, the policy of any country – and especially of any
developed country – will have to give primacy to the country’s
competitive position in an increasingly competitive world economy. Any
proposed domestic policy needs to be shaped so as to improve the
country’s competitive position in the world economy or, at the least, so
as to minimize adverse impacts on it. The same holds true for policies
and strategies of any institution within a nation, whether a local
government, a business, a university, or a hospital.</p>
<p>• We need to develop an economic theory appropriate to the primacy of
a world economy in which knowledge has become the key economic resource
and the dominant – and perhaps even the only – source of comparative
advantage.</p>
<p>• We are beginning to understand the new integrating mechanism:
organization. But we still have to think through how to balance two
apparently contradictory requirements. Organizations must competently
perform the one social function for the sake of which they exist – the
school to teach; the hospital to cure the sick; the business to produce
goods and services and the capital to provide for the risks of the
future. They can do so only if they single-mindedly concentrate on their
own specialized mission. But there is also the need of society: that
these organizations take social responsibility, that is, work on the
problems and challenges of the community. Together these organizations
are the community. The emergence of a strong, independent, performing
social sector – neither public sector, that is, government, nor private
sector, that is,business – is thus a central need of the society of
organizations. But by itself it is not enough: the organizations of both
the public and the private sector must share in the work.</p>
<p>• The function of government and its functioning will increasingly
become central to political thought and political action The ‘megastate’
in which this century indulged has not performed, neither in its
totalitarian nor in its democratic version. It has not delivered on a
single one of its promises. And government by countervailing lobbyists
is neither particularly effective – in fact, it is paralysis – nor
particularly attractive. Yet effective government has never been needed
more than in this highly competitive and fast-changing world of ours in
which the dangers created by the pollution of the physical environment
are matched only by the dangers of worldwide armaments pollution.</p>
<p>And we do not have even the beginnings of political theory or the
political institutions needed for effective government in the
knowledge-based society of organizations.</p>
<p>If the twentieth century was one of social transformations, the
twenty-first century needs to be one of social and political
innovations.</p>
