<h4 id="managing-the-family-business">4. Managing the family
business</h4>
<p>The majority of businesses everywhere – including the United States
and all other developed countries – are family-controlled and
family-managed. And family management is by no means confined to small
and medium-sized firms – families run some of the world’s largest
companies. Levi Strauss, for instance, has been family-controlled and
family-managed since its inception a century and a half ago. DuPont,
controlled and managed by family members for 170 years (since its
founding in 1802 until professional management took over in the
mid-1970s), grew into the world’s largest chemical company. And two
centuries after a still obscure coin dealer began to send out his sons
to establish banks in Europe’s capitals, financial firms bearing the
Rothschild name and run by Rothschilds are still among the world’s
premier private bankers.</p>
<p>Yet management books and management courses deal almost entirely with
the publicly owned and professionally managed company – they rarely as
much as mention the family-managed business. Of course, there is no
difference whatever between professionally managed and family-managed
businesses in respect to all functional work: research or marketing or
accounting. But with respect to management, the family business requires
its own and very different rules. These rules have to be stringently
observed. Otherwise, the family-managed business will not survive, let
alone prosper.</p>
<p>The first rule is that family members do not work in the business
unless they are at least as able as any non-family employee, and work at
least as hard. It is much cheaper to pay a lazy nephew not to come to
work than to keep him on the payroll. In a family-managed company family
members are always ‘top management’ whatever their official job or
title. For on Saturday evening they sit at the boss’s dinner table and
call him ‘Dad’ or ‘Uncle’. Mediocre or, worse, lazy family members
allowed to work in the family-managed business are rightly resented by
non-family co-workers. They are an affront to their self-respect. If
mediocre or lazy family members are kept on the payroll, respect for top
management and for the business altogether rapidly erodes within the
entire workforce. Capable non-family people will not stay. And the ones
who do soon become courtiers and toadies.</p>
<p>Most CEOs of family businesses know this, of course. But still, far
too many try to be ‘clever’. For example, the mediocre or lazy family
member gets the title ‘Director of Research’. And a highly competent,
non-family professional is brought in at a lush salary as ‘Deputy
Director of Research’, and is told by the CEO ‘My cousin Jim’s title is
a mere formality, and only meant to keep his mother off our backs –
she’s our second-largest shareholder, after all. Everybody else,
including Jim, knows that you are in charge of research. And you’ll work
directly with me and need not pay attention to Jim.’ But this only makes
things worse. With a mediocre Jim actually in charge, the company might
still get mediocre research. With a deeply resentful and jealous Jim
having the official authority but no real responsibility, and an equally
resentful and totally cynical outsider having the responsibility but no
real authority, the company will get no research at all. All it will get
are intrigues and politicking.</p>
<p>DuPont survived and prospered as a family business because it faced
up to the problem. All male DuPonts were entitled to an entrance job in
the company. Five or six years after a DuPont had started, his
performance would be carefully reviewed by four or five family seniors.
And if this review concluded that the young family member was not likely
to be top management material ten years later, he was eased out.</p>
<p>The second rule is equally simple: no matter how many family members
are in the company’s management, and how effective they are, one top job
is always filled by an outsider who is not a member of the family.
Typically, this is either the financial executive or the head of
research – the two positions in which technical qualifications are most
important. But I also know successful family companies in which this
outsider serves as the head of marketing or as the head of personnel.
And while the CEO of Levi Strauss is a family member and a descendant of
the founder, the president and COO is a non-family professional.</p>
<p>The first such ‘inside outsider’ I knew, almost sixty years ago, was
the chief financial officer of a very large and completely
family-managed business in the United Kingdom. Though otherwise on the
closest terms of friendship with his family-member colleagues, he never
attended a family party or a family wedding. He did not even play golf
at the country club where the family members played. The only family
affairs I attend,’ he once said to me, ‘are funerals. But I chair the
monthly top-management meeting.’</p>
<p>There is need in the family company, in other words, for one senior
person – and a highly respected one – who is not family and who never
mixes business and family.</p>
<p>The world’s oldest ‘family business’, the Mafia, follows this rule
faithfully – in its native Sicily as well as in the United States. As
anyone knows who has seen a Godfather film or has read a Godfather book,
in a Mafia family the consigliere, the lawyer, who is the second most
powerful person, might even be a non-Sicilian.</p>
<p>Rule three is that family-managed businesses, except perhaps for the
very smallest ones, increasingly need to staff key positions with
non-family professionals. The knowledge and expertise needed, whether in
manufacturing or in marketing, in finance, in research, in human
resource management have become far too great to be satisfied by any but
the most competent family member no matter how well-intentioned he or
she may be. And then, these non-family professionals have to be treated
as equals. They have to have ‘full citizenship’ in the firm. Otherwise
they simply will not stay.</p>
<p>The first of the great business families to realize that certain
outsiders need to be granted ‘full citizenship’ was the tightest of all
business clans, the Rothschilds. Until the Second World War they
admitted only family members to partnership in their banks. During the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the non-family general manager
who reached his late forties was given a huge severance pay – in one
case a million dollars – so that he could set up his own banking firm.
Since the Second World War, however, non-family members have been
admitted to a partnership in a Rothschild firm – the best known of them
being Georges Pompidou, who later succeeded Charles de Gaulle as
president of France.</p>
<p>Even the family-managed business that faithfully observes the
preceding three rules tends to get into trouble – and often breaks up –
over management succession. It is then that what the business needs and
what the family wants tend to collide. Here are two brothers who have
built a successful manufacturing business. Now that they are nearing
retirement age, each pushes his own son as the next CEO. Thus, though
they have worked together harmoniously for twenty years, they become
adversaries and eventually sell out rather than compromise. Here is the
widow of one of a company’s founders who, in order to save her
daughter’s floundering marriage, pushes her moderately endowed
son-in-law to be the next CEO and successor to her ageing
brother-in-law. Here is the founder of the fair-sized high-tech company
who forces an unwilling son to give up his career as a university
scientist in order to take over the management of the firm – only to
have the son sell out to a big conglomerate within six months after his
father’s death. Anyone who has worked with family companies could
forever add to the list.</p>
<p>There is only one solution: entrust the succession decision to an
outsider who is neither part of the family nor part of the business.</p>
<p>Benjamin Disraeli, the great Tory prime minister, played this role
for the Rothschilds in the 1880s, when the ‘cousins’, the third
generation of the family, began to die off. He persuaded the entire
family to accept the youngest – but ablest – of the next generation, the
Viennese Leopold, as the effective head of all three Rothschild banks,
the one in London, the one in Paris, and the one in Vienna. On a much
smaller scale, I have seen this role being played successfully by a CPA
who had been the outside auditor of a medium-sized food retailer since
the business was started twenty years earlier. A university professor,
who for ten years had been its scientific adviser, saved a fair-sized
high-tech company – and the owning family – by persuading two brothers
and two cousins and the wives of all four to accept as the new CEO the
daughter of one of the cousins who was the youngest but also the ablest
of the next generation.</p>
<p>But it is usually much too late to bring in the outsider when the
succession problem becomes acute. By that time the family members have
committed themselves to this or that candidate. Furthermore, succession
planning in the family business needs to be integrated with financial
and tax planning, an integration which cannot be done overnight. More
and more family-managed businesses, therefore, now try to find the right
outside arbitrator long before the decision has to be made and, ideally,
long before the family members have begun to disagree on the
succession.</p>
<p>Sixth- or seventh-generation family businesses, like Levi Strauss,
DuPont, the Rothschilds, are rare. Few businesses remain family-managed
into, let alone beyond, the fourth generation. The biggest
family-managed business around today, Fiat in Italy, is run by the third
generation of Agnellis, who are now in their sixties and seventies. Few
people in the company, I am told, expect Fiat still to be family-managed
twenty years hence. The fourth generation of a family owning a
successful business is sufficiently well off, as a rule, for the ablest
of them to want to pursue their own interests and their own careers
rather than dedicate themselves to the business. Also, by that time
there are often so many family members that ownership has become
splintered. For the members of the fourth generation, their share in the
company is thus no longer ‘ownership’; it has become ‘investment’. They
will want to diversify rather than to keep all their financial eggs in
the family-company basket, and they therefore want the business to be
sold or to go public. But for the second and even for the third
generation, maintaining the family company may be the most advantageous
course. Often it is the only course, as the business is not big enough
to be sold or to go public. And to make family succession possible is
surely also in the public interest. The growth dynamics in the economy
are shifting fast from the giants to the medium-sized businesses, and
these latter tend to be owner-controlled and owner-managed. Therefore,
to encourage entrepreneurship requires encouraging the family-managed
business and to make possible its continuation. So far, however, the
family-managed businesses that survive the founder – let alone those
that still prosper under the third generation of family management – are
the exception rather than the rule. Far too few family-managed
businesses and their owners accept the four management rules and the one
basic precept which underlies all of them: both the business and the
family will only survive and do well if the family serves the business.
Neither will do well if the business is run to serve the family. The
controlling word in ‘family-managed business’ is not ‘family’. It has to
be ‘business’.</p>
