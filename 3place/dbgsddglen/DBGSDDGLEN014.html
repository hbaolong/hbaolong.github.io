<h4 id="the-information-executives-need-today">12. The information
executives need today</h4>
<p>Ever since the new data-processing tools first emerged thirty or
forty years ago, businesspeople have both over-and under-rated the
importance of information in the organization. We – and I include myself
– over-rated the possibilities to the point where we talked of
computer-generated ‘business models’ that could make decisions and might
even be able to run much of the business. But we also grossly underrated
the new tools; we saw in them the means to do better what executives
were already doing to manage their organizations.</p>
<p>Nobody talks of business models making economic decisions any more.
The greatest contribution of our data-processing capacity so far has not
even been to management. It has been to operations – in the form of such
things as computer-assisted design or the marvellous software that
architects now use to solve structural problems in the buildings they
design.</p>
<p>Yet even as we both over- and under-estimated the new tools, we
failed to realize that they would drastically change the tasks to be
tackled. Concepts and tools, history teaches again and again, are
mutually interdependent and interactive. One changes the other. That is
now happening to the concept we call a business and to the tools we call
information. The new tools enable us – indeed, may force us – to see our
businesses differently, to see them as</p>
<p>• Generators of resources, that is, as the organizations that convert
costs into yields</p>
<p>• Links in an economic chain, which managers need to understand as a
whole in order to manage their costs</p>
<p>• Society’s organs for the creation of wealth</p>
<p>• Both creators and creatures of a material environment, which is the
area outside the organization in which opportunities and results lie but
in which the threats to the success and survival of every business also
originate.</p>
<p>This chapter deals with the tools executives require to generate the
information they need. And it deals with the concepts underlying those
tools. Some of the tools have been around for a long time, but rarely,
if ever, have they been focused on the task of managing a business. Some
have to be refashioned; in their present form they no longer work. For
some tools that promise to be important in the future, we have so far
only the briefest specifications. The tools themselves still have to be
designed.</p>
<p>Even though we are just beginning to understand how to use
information as a tool, we can outline with high probability the major
parts of the information system executives need to manage their
businesses. So, in turn, can we begin to understand the concepts likely
to underlie the business – call it the redesigned corporation – that
executives will have to manage tomorrow.</p>
<p>From cost accounting to yield control</p>
<p>We may have gone furthest in redesigning both business and
information in the most traditional of our information systems:
accounting. In fact, many businesses have already shifted from
traditional cost accounting to activity-based costing. Activity based
costing represents both a different concept of the business process,
especially for manufacturers, and different ways of measuring.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting, first developed by General Motors
seventy years ago, postulates that total manufacturing cost is the sum
of the costs of individual operations. Yet the cost that matters for
competitiveness and profitability is the cost of the total process, and
that is what the new activity-based costing records and makes
manageable. Its basic premise is that manufacturing is an integrated
process that starts when supplies, materials, and parts arrive at the
plant’s loading dock and continues even after the finished product
reaches the end user. Service is still a cost of the product, and so is
installation, even if the customer pays.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting measures what it costs to do something,
for example to cut a screw thread. Activity-based costing also records
the cost of not doing, such as the cost of machine downtime, the cost of
waiting for a needed part or tool, the cost of inventory waiting to be
shipped, and the cost of reworking or scrapping a defective part. The
costs of not doing, which traditional cost accounting cannot and does
not record, often equal and sometimes even exceed the costs of doing.
Activity-based costing therefore gives not only much better cost control
but, increasingly, it also gives result control.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting assumes that a certain operation – for
example, heat treating – has to be done and that it has to be done where
it is being done now. Activity-based costing asks ‘Does it have to be
done? If so, where is it best done?’ Activity-based costing integrates
what were once several activities – value analysis, process analysis,
quality management, and costing – into one analysis.</p>
<p>Using that approach, activity-based costing can substantially lower
manufacturing costs – in some instances by a full third or more. Its
greatest impact, however, is likely to be in services. In most
manufacturing companies, cost accounting is inadequate. But service
industries – banks, retail stores, hospitals, schools, newspapers, and
radio and television stations – have practically no cost information at
all.</p>
<p>Activity-based costing shows us why traditional cost accounting has
not worked for service companies. It is not because the techniques are
wrong. It is because traditional cost accounting makes the wrong
assumptions. Service companies cannot start with the cost of individual
operations, as manufacturing companies have done with traditional cost
accounting. They must start with the assumption that there is only one
cost: that of the total system. And it is a fixed cost over any given
time period. The famous distinction between fixed and variable costs, on
which traditional cost accounting is based, does not make much sense in
services. Neither does another basic assumption of traditional cost
accounting: that capital can be substituted for labour. In fact, in
knowledge-based work especially, additional capital investment will
likely require more rather than less labour. For example, a hospital
that buys a new diagnostic tool may have to add four or five people to
run it. Other knowledge-based organizations have had to learn the same
lesson. But that all costs are fixed over a given time period and that
resources cannot be substituted for one another, so that the total
operation has to be costed – those are precisely the assumptions with
which activity-based costing starts. By applying them to services, we
are beginning for the first time to get cost information and yield
control.</p>
<p>Banks, for instance, have been trying for several decades to apply
conventional cost-accounting techniques to their business – that is, to
figure the costs of individual operations and services – with almost
negligible results. Now they are beginning to ask ‘Which one activity is
at the centre of costs and of results?’ The answer: serving the
customer. The cost per customer in any major area of banking is a fixed
cost. Thus it is the yield per customer – both the volume of services a
customer uses and the mix of those services – that determines costs and
profitability. Retail discounters, especially those in Western Europe,
have known that for some time. They assume that once a unit of shelf
space is installed, the cost is fixed and management consists of
maximizing the yield thereon over a given time span. Their focus on
yield control has enabled them to increase profitability despite their
low prices and low margins.</p>
<p>Services are still only beginning to apply the new costing concepts.
In some areas, such as research labs, where productivity is nearly
impossible to measure, we may always have to rely on assessment and
judgement rather than on measurement. But for most knowledge-based and
service work, we should, within ten to fifteen years, have developed
reliable tools to measure and manage costs and to relate those costs to
results.</p>
<p>Thinking more clearly about costing in services should yield new
insights into the costs of getting and keeping customers in businesses
of all kinds. If GM, Ford, and Chrysler had had activity-based costing,
for example, they would have realized early on the utter futility of
their competitive blitzes of the past few years, which offered new-car
buyers spectacular discounts and hefty cash rewards. Those promotions
actually cost the Big Three carmakers enormous amounts of money and,
worse, enormous numbers of potential customers. In fact, every one
resulted in a nasty drop in market standing. But neither the costs of
the special deals nor their negative yields appeared in the companies’
conventional cost-accounting figures, so management never saw the
damage. Conventional cost accounting shows only the costs of individual
manufacturing operations in isolation, and those were not affected by
the discounts and rebates in the marketplace. Also, conventional cost
accounting does not show the impact of pricing decisions on such things
as market share. Activity-based costing shows – or at least attempts to
show – the impact of changes in the costs and yields of every activity
on the results of the whole. Had it been used, it soon would have shown
the damage done by the discount blitzes. In fact, because the Japanese
already use a form of activity-based costing – though still a fairly
primitive one – Toyota, Nissan, and Honda knew better than to compete
with US carmakers through discount blitzes and thus maintained both
their market share and their profits.</p>
<p>From legal fiction to economic reality</p>
<p>Knowing the cost of your operations, however, is not enough. To
compete successfully in an increasingly competitive global market, a
company has to know the costs of its entire economic chain and has to
work with other members of the chain to manage costs and maximize yield.
Companies are therefore beginning to shift from costing only what goes
on inside their own organizations to costing the entire economic
process, in which even the biggest company is just one link.</p>
<p>The legal entity, the company, is a reality for shareholders, for
creditors, for employees, and for tax collectors. But economically, it
is fiction. Thirty years ago the Coca-Cola Company was a franchisor.
Independent bottlers manufactured the product. Now the company owns most
of its bottling operations in the United States. But Coke drinkers –
even those few who know that fact – could not care less. What matters in
the marketplace is the economic reality, the costs of the entire
process, regardless of who owns what.</p>
<p>Again and again in business history, an unknown company has come from
nowhere and in a few short years overtaken the established leaders
without apparently even breathing hard. The explanation always given is
superior strategy, superior technology, superior marketing, or lean
manufacturing. But in every single case, the newcomer also enjoys a
tremendous cost advantage, usually about 30 per cent. The reason is
always the same: the new company knows and manages the costs of the
entire economic chain rather than its costs alone.</p>
<p>Toyota is perhaps the best-publicized example of a company that knows
and manages the costs of its suppliers and distributors; they are all,
of course, members of its keiretsu. Through that network, Toyota manages
the total cost of making, distributing, and servicing its cars as one
cost stream, putting work where it costs the least and yields the
most.</p>
<p>Managing the economic cost stream is not a Japanese invention,
however, but an American one. It began with the man who designed and
built General Motors, William Durant. In about 1908, Durant began to buy
small, successful car companies – Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Chevrolet
– and merged them into his new General Motors Corporation. In 1916, he
set up a separate subsidiary called United Motors to buy small,
successful parts companies. His first acquisitions included Delco, which
held Charles Kettering’s patents to the automotive self-starter.</p>
<p>Durant ultimately bought about twenty supplier companies; his last
acquisition – in 1919, the year before he was ousted as GM’s CEO – was
Fisher Body. Durant deliberately brought the parts and accessories
makers into the design process of a new car model right from the start.
Doing so allowed him to manage the total costs of the finished car as
one cost stream. In fact, Durant invented the keiretsu.</p>
<p>However, between 1950 and 1960, Durant’s keiretsu became an albatross
around the company’s neck. Unionization imposed higher labour costs on
GM’s parts divisions than on their independent competitors. The outside
customers, the independent car companies such as Packard and Studebaker,
which had bought 50 per cent of the output of GM’s parts divisions,
disappeared one by one. And GM’s control over both the costs and quality
of its main suppliers disappeared with them. But for forty years or
more, GM’s systems costing gave it an unbeatable advantage over even the
most efficient of its competitors, which for most of that time was
Studebaker.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck and Company was the first to copy Durant’s system. In
the 1920s it established long-term contracts with its suppliers and
bought minority interests in them. Sears was then able to consult with
suppliers as it designed the product and to understand and manage the
entire cost stream. That gave the company an unbeatable cost advantage
for decades.</p>
<p>In the early 1930s, London-based Marks andandandand Spencer copied
Sears, with the same result. Twenty years later, the Japanese, led by
Toyota, studied and copied both Sears and Marks andandandand Spencer.
Then in the 1980s, Wal-Mart Stores adapted the approach by allowing
suppliers to stock products directly on store shelves, thereby
eliminating warehouse inventories and with them nearly one-third of the
cost of traditional retailing.</p>
<p>But those companies are still rare exceptions. Although economists
have known the importance of costing the entire economic chain since
Alfred Marshall wrote about it in the late 1890s, most businesspeople
still consider it theoretical abstraction. Increasingly, however,
managing the economic cost chain will become a necessity. Indeed,
executives need to organize and manage not only the cost chain but also
everything else – especially corporate strategy and product planning –
as one economic whole, regardless of the legal boundaries of individual
companies.</p>
<p>A powerful force driving companies toward economic-chain costing will
be the shift from cost-led pricing to price-led costing. Traditionally,
Western companies have started with costs, put a desired profit margin
on top, and arrived at a price. They practised cost-led pricing. Sears
and Marks andandandand Spencer long ago switched to price-led costing,
in which the price the customer is willing to pay determines allowable
costs, beginning with the design stage. Until recently, those companies
were the exceptions. Now price-led costing is becoming the rule. The
Japanese first adopted it for their exports. Now Wal-Mart and all the
discounters in the United States, Japan, and Europe are practising
price-led costing. It underlies Chrysler’s success with its recent
models and the success of GM’s Saturn. Companies can practise price-led
costing, however, only if they know and manage the entire cost of the
economic chain.</p>
<p>The same ideas apply to outsourcing, alliances, and joint ventures –
indeed, to any business structure that is built on partnership rather
than control. And such entities, rather than the traditional model of a
parent company with wholly owned subsidiaries, are increasingly becoming
the models for growth, especially in the global economy.</p>
<p>Still, it will be painful for most businesses to switch to
economic-chain costing. Doing so requires uniform or at least compatible
accounting systems at companies along the entire chain. Yet each one
does its accounting in its own way, and each is convinced that its
system is the only possible one. Moreover, economic-chain costing
requires information sharing across companies, yet even within the same
company, people tend to resist information sharing. Despite those
challenges, companies can find ways to practise economic-chain costing
now, as Procter andandandand Gamble is demonstrating. Using the way
Wal-Mart develops close relationships with suppliers as a model,
PandandandandG is initiating information sharing and economic-chain
management with the 300 large retailers that distribute the bulk of its
products worldwide.</p>
<p>Whatever the obstacles, economic-chain costing is going to be done.
Otherwise, even the most efficient company will suffer from an
increasing cost disadvantage.</p>
<p>Information for wealth creation</p>
<p>Enterprises are paid to create wealth, not to control costs. But that
obvious fact is not reflected in traditional measurements. First-year
accounting students are taught that the balance sheet portrays the
liquidation value of the enterprise and provides creditors with
worst-case information. But enterprises are not normally run to be
liquidated. They have to be managed as going concerns, that is, for
wealth creation. To do that requires information that enables executives
to make informed judgements. It requires four sets of diagnostic tools:
foundation information, productivity information, competence
information, and information about the allocation of scarce resources.
Together, they constitute the executive’s tool kit for managing the
current business.</p>
<p>Foundation information</p>
<p>The oldest and most widely used set of diagnostic management tools
are cash-flow and liquidity projections and such standard measurements
as the ratio between dealers’ inventories and sales of new cars; the
earnings coverage for the interest payments on a bond issue; and the
ratios between receivables outstanding more than six months, total
receivables, and sales. Those may be likened to the measurements a
doctor takes at a routine physical: weight, pulse, temperature, blood
pressure, and urine analysis. If those readings are normal, they do not
tell us much. If they are abnormal, they indicate a problem that needs
to be identified and treated. Those measurements might be called
foundation information.</p>
<p>Productivity information</p>
<p>The second set of tools for business diagnosis deals with the
productivity of key resources. The oldest of them – of Second World War
vintage – measures the productivity of manual labour. Now we are slowly
developing measurements, though still quite primitive ones, for the
productivity of knowledge-based and service work. However, measuring
only the productivity of workers, whether blue or white collar, no
longer gives us adequate information about productivity. We need data on
total-factor productivity.</p>
<p>That explains the popularity of economic value-added analysis. EVA is
based on something we have known for a long time: what we generally call
profits, the money left to service equity, is usually not profit at all.
Until a business returns a profit that is greater than its cost of
capital, it operates at a loss. Never mind that it pays taxes as if it
had a genuine profit. The enterprise still returns less to the economy
than it devours in resources. It does not cover its full costs unless
the reported profit exceeds the cost of capital. Until then, it does not
create wealth; it destroys it. By that measurement, incidentally, few US
businesses have been profitable since the Second World War.</p>
<p>By measuring the value added over all costs, including the cost of
capital, EVA measures, in effect, the productivity of all factors of
production. It does not, by itself, tell us why a certain product or a
certain service does not add value or what to do about it. But it shows
us what we need to find out and whether we need to take remedial action.
EVA should also be used to find out what works. It does show which
product, service, operation, or activity has unusually high productivity
and adds unusually high value. Then we should ask ourselves, what can we
learn from those successes?*</p>
<p>The most recent of the tools used to obtain productivity information
is benchmarking – comparing one’s performance with the best performance
in the industry or, better yet, with the best anywhere in business.
Benchmarking assumes correctly that what one organization does, any
other organization can do as well. And it assumes, also correctly, that
being at least as good as the leader is a prerequisite to being
competitive. Together, EVA and benchmarking provide the diagnostic tools
to measure total-factor productivity and to manage it.</p>
<p>Competence information</p>
<p>A third set of tools deals with competences. Ever since C. K.
Prahalad and Gary Hamel’s pathbreaking article The core competence of
the corporation’ (Harvard Business Review, May-June 1990), we have known
that leadership rests on being able to do something others cannot do at
all or find difficult to do even poorly. It rests on core competencies
that meld market or customer value with a special ability of the
producer or supplier.</p>
<p>Some examples: the ability of the Japanese to miniaturize electronic
components, which is based on their 300-year-old artistic tradition of
putting landscape paintings on a tiny lacquered box, called an inro, and
of carving a whole zoo of animals on the even tinier button, called a
netsuke, that holds the box on the wearer’s belt; or the almost unique
ability GM has had for eighty years to make successful acquisitions; or
Marks andandandand Spencer’s also unique ability to design packaged and
ready-to-eat gourmet meals for middle-class purses. But how does one
identify both the core competencies one has already and those the
business needs in order to take and maintain a leadership position? How
does one find out whether one’s core competence is improving or
weakening? Or whether it is still the right core competence and what
changes it might need?</p>
<p>So far, the discussion of core competencies has been largely
anecdotal. But a number of highly specialized mid-size companies – a
Swedish pharmaceuticals producer and a US producer of speciality tools,
to name two – are developing the methodology to measure and manage core
competencies. The first step is to keep careful track of one’s own and
one’s competitors’ performances, looking especially for unexpected
successes and for unexpected poor performance in areas where one should
have done well. The successes demonstrate what the market values and
will pay for. They indicate where the business enjoys a leadership
advantage. The non-successes should be viewed as the first indication
either that the market is changing or that the company’s competencies
are weakening.</p>
<p>That analysis allows for the early recognition of opportunities. For
example, by carefully tracking an unexpected success, a US tool maker
found that small Japanese machine shops were buying its high-tech,
high-priced tools, even though it had not designed the tools with them
in mind or even called on them. That allowed the company to recognize a
new core competence: the Japanese were attracted to its products because
they were easy to maintain and repair despite their technical
complexity. When that insight was applied to designing products, the
company gained leadership in the small-plant and machine-shop markets in
the United States and Western Europe, huge markets where it had done
practically no business before.</p>
<p>Core competencies are different for every organization; they are, so
to speak, part of an organization’s personality. But every organization
– not just businesses – needs one core competence: innovation. And every
organization needs a way to record and appraise its innovative
performance. In organizations already doing that – among them several
top-flight pharmaceuticals manufacturers – the starting point is not the
company’s own performance. It is a careful record of the innovations in
the entire field during a given period. Which of them were truly
successful? How many of them were ours? Is our performance commensurate
with our objectives? With the direction of the market? With our market
standing? With our research spending? Are our successful innovations in
the areas of greatest growth and opportunity? How many of the truly
important innovation opportunities did we miss? Why? Because we did not
see them? Or because we saw them but dismissed them? Or because we
botched them? And how well do we convert an innovation into a commercial
product? A good deal of that, admittedly, is assessment rather than
measurement. It raises rather than answers questions, but it raises the
right questions.</p>
<p>Resource-allocation information</p>
<p>The last area in which diagnostic information is needed to manage the
current business for wealth creation is the allocation of scarce
resources: capital and performing people. Those two convert into action
whatever information management has about its business. They determine
whether the enterprise will do well or poorly.</p>
<p>GM developed the first systematic capital-appropriations process
about seventy years ago. Today practically every business has a
capital-appropriations process, but few use it correctly. Companies
typically measure their proposed capital appropriations by only one or
two of the following yardsticks: return on investment, payback period,
cash flow, or discounted present value. But we have known for a long
time – since the early 1930s – that none of those is the right method.
To understand a proposed investment, a company needs to look at all
four. Sixty years ago that would have required endless number-crunching.
Now a laptop computer can provide the information within a few minutes.
We also have known for sixty years that managers should never look at
just one proposed capital appropriation in isolation but should instead
choose the projects that show the best ratio between opportunity and
risks. That requires a capital-appropriations budget to display the
choices – again, something far too many businesses do not do. Most
serious, however, is that most capital-appropriations processes do not
even ask for two vital pieces of information:</p>
<p>• What will happen if the proposed investment fails to produce as
promised as do three out of every five? Would it seriously hurt the
company, or would it be just a flea bite?</p>
<p>• If the investment is successful – and especially if it is more
successful than we expect – what will it commit us to?</p>
<p>No one at GM seemed to have asked what Saturn’s success would commit
the company to. As a result, the company may end up killing its own
success because of its inability to finance it.</p>
<p>In addition, a capital-appropriations request requires specific
deadlines: when should we expect what results? Then the results –
successes, near-successes, near-failures, and failures – need to be
reported and analysed. There is no better way to improve an
organization’s performance than to measure the results of capital
appropriations against the promises and expectations that led to their
authorization. How much better off the United States would be today had
such feedback on government programmes been standard practice for the
past fifty years.</p>
<p>Capital, however, is only one key resource of the organization, and
it is by no means the scarcest one. The scarcest resources in any
organization are performing people. Since the Second World War, the US
military – and so far no one else – has learned to test its placement
decisions. It now thinks through what it expects of senior officers
before it puts them into key commands. It then appraises their
performance against those expectations. And it constantly appraises its
own process for selecting senior commanders against the successes and
failures of its appointments. In business, by contrast, placement with
specific expectations as to what the appointee should achieve and
systematic appraisal of the outcome are virtually unknown. In the effort
to create wealth, managers need to allocate human resources as
purposefully and as thoughtfully as they do capital. And the outcomes of
those decisions ought to be recorded and studied as carefully.</p>
<p>Where the results are</p>
<p>Those four kinds of information tell us only about the current
business. They inform and direct tactics. For strategy, we need
organized information about the environment. Strategy has to be based on
information about markets, customers, and non-customers; about
technology in one’s own industry and others; about worldwide finance;
and about the changing world economy. For that is where the results are.
Inside an organization there are only cost centres. The only profit
centre is a customer whose cheque has not bounced.</p>
<p>Major changes also start outside an organization. A retailer may know
a great deal about the people who shop at its stores. But no matter how
successful it is, no retailer ever has more than a small fraction of the
market as its customers; the great majority are non-customers. It is
always with non-customers that basic changes begin and become
significant.</p>
<p>At least half the important new technologies that have transformed an
industry in the past fifty years came from outside the industry itself.
Commercial paper, which has revolutionized finance in the United States,
did not originate with the banks. Molecular biology and genetic
engineering were not developed by the pharmaceuticals industry. Though
the great majority of businesses will continue to operate only locally
or regionally, they all face, at least potentially, global competition
from places they have never even heard of before.</p>
<p>Not all the needed information about the outside is available, to be
sure. There is no information – not even unreliable information – on
economic conditions in most of China, for instance, or on legal
conditions in most of the successor states to the Soviet Empire. But
even where information is readily available, many businesses are
oblivious to it. Many US companies went into Europe in the 1960s without
even asking about labour legislation. European companies have been just
as blind and ill-informed in their ventures into the United States. A
major cause of the Japanese real estate investment debacle in California
during the 1990s was the failure to find out elementary facts about
zoning and taxes.</p>
<p>A serious cause of business failure is the common assumption that
conditions – taxes, social legislation, market preferences, distribution
channels, intellectual property rights, and many others – must be what
we think they are or at least what we think they should be. An adequate
information system has to include information that makes executives
question that assumption. It must lead them to ask the right questions,
not just feed them the information they expect. That presupposes first
that executives know what information they need. It demands further that
they obtain that information on a regular basis. It finally requires
that they systematically integrate the information into their decision
making.</p>
<p>A few multinationals – Unilever, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, the Japanese
trading companies, and a few big construction companies – have been
working hard on building systems to gather and organize outside
information. But in general, the majority of enterprises have yet to
start the job.</p>
<p>Even big companies, in large part, will have to hire outsiders to
help them. To think through what the business needs requires somebody
who knows and understands the highly specialized information field.
There is far too much information for any but specialists to find their
way around. The sources are totally diverse. Companies can generate some
of the information themselves, such as information about customers and
non-customers or about the technology in one’s own field. But most of
what enterprises need to know about the environment is obtainable only
from outside sources – from all kinds of data banks and data services,
from journals in many languages, from trade associations, from
government publications, from World Bank reports and scientific papers,
and from specialized studies.</p>
<p>Another reason why there is need for outside help is that the
information has to be organized so as to question and challenge a
company’s strategy. To supply data is not enough. The data have to be
integrated with strategy, they have to test a company’s assumptions, and
they must challenge a company’s current outlook. One way to do that may
be a new kind of software, information tailored to a specific group –
say, to hospitals or to casualty insurance companies. The Lexis database
supplies such information to lawyers, but it only gives answers; it does
not ask questions. What we need are services that make specific
suggestions about how to use the information, ask specific questions
regarding the user’s business and practices, and perhaps provide
interactive consultation. Or we might ‘outsource’ the
outside-information system. Perhaps the most popular provider of the
outside-information system, especially for smaller enterprises, will be
the ‘inside outsider’, the independent consultant.</p>
<p>Whichever way we satisfy it, the need for information on the
environment where the major threats and opportunities are likely to
arise will become increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>It may be argued that few of those information needs are new, and
that is largely true. Conceptually, many of the new measurements have
been discussed for many years and in many places. What is new is the
technical data-processing ability. It enables us to do quickly and
cheaply what, only a few short years ago, would have been laborious and
very expensive. Seventy years ago, the time-and-motion study made
traditional cost accounting possible. Computers have now made
activity-based cost accounting possible; without them, it would be
practically impossible.</p>
<p>But that argument misses the point. What is important is not the
tools. It is the concepts behind them. They convert what were always
seen as discrete techniques to be used in isolation and for separate
purposes into one integrated information system. That system then makes
possible business diagnosis, business strategy, and business decisions.
That is a new and radically different view of the meaning and purpose of
information: as a measurement on which to base future action rather than
as a post-mortem and a record of what has already happened.</p>
<p>The command-and-control organization that first emerged in the 1870s
might be compared to an organism held together by its shell. The
corporation that is now emerging is being designed around a skeleton:
information, both the corporation’s new integrating system and its
articulation.</p>
<p>Our traditional mindset – even if we use sophisticated mathematical
techniques and impenetrable sociological jargon – has always somehow
perceived business as buying cheap and selling dear. The new approach
defines a business as the organization that adds value and creates
wealth.</p>
