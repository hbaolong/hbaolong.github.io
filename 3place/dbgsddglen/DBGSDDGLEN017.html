<h4 id="where-the-new-markets-are">15. Where the new markets are</h4>
<p>For forty years, since the the destruction of the Second World War
was repaired in the 1950s, an unprecedented expansion of the world
economy has been propelled by consumer demand, culminating in the
developed countries’ great shopping spree of the 1980s. But there is
mounting evidence of a deep structural shift – namely, economic growth
and expansion can no longer be based on consumer demand.</p>
<p>One symptom: Ever since the first TV set appeared on the market, each
new consumer-electronics product has immediately set off a buying
explosion, especially in Japan. Yet when several technically very
exciting consumer-electronics products were introduced in the Japanese
market last year, they produced little more than a yawn.</p>
<p>More important, the new markets are not consumer-goods markets. Nor
are they traditional producer-goods markets, that is, markets for
machinery and factories. (In fact, there is probably worldwide
overcapacity in manufacturing plants, most acutely in Japan and in
Western Europe.) Rather, three of the new markets are for various kinds
of ‘infrastructure’, that is, for facilities that serve both producers
and consumers. And the fourth new market is for things that are neither
‘products’ nor ‘services’ in any traditional meaning of those terms.</p>
<p>The most immediately accessible of the new markets involves
communication and information. Demand for telephone service in Third
World countries and the countries of the former Soviet bloc is
practically insatiable. There is no greater impediment to economic
development than poor telephone service, and no greater spur than good
telephone service. A telephone system is highly capital-intensive. But
technologies that replace the ‘wiring’ of traditional telephones with
the ‘beaming’ of cellular phones are radically reducing the capital
investment needed. And once a telephone service is installed, it begins
to pay for itself fairly soon, especially if it is well maintained.</p>
<p>In the developed world, the information and communications market may
be even larger. Both the office of tomorrow and the school of tomorrow
are likely to be built around information and communication. We already
know that the factory of tomorrow will be organized around information
(rather than automation as we thought only ten years ago). The
technology is already in use; it needs only to be properly packaged.</p>
<p>The second of the new markets – call it the ‘environmental market’ –
may end up presenting an even greater opportunity than the first. It has
three separate components, all rapidly developing:</p>
<p>1 The market for equipment to purify water and air. In the United
States purification of water and of effluents is proceeding apace. Water
use in US manufacturing is already down by one-third since 1977 and will
be cut by as much again by the year 2000. Air pollution in US
manufacturing has also been cut drastically. Japan may be even further
ahead, whereas Europe is still way behind. But manufacturing is not the
world’s biggest polluter. When it comes to water pollution, for
instance, municipal sewage is the worst offender. There the task has not
been tackled in any country, though the technologies are available.</p>
<p>2 The agrobiology market. This market will replace chemical
herbicides and pesticides with non-polluting, mainly biological,
products. The first of these products have just appeared on the market.
By the year 2000, industry experts believe, practically all herbicides
and pesticides used in commercial farming in developed countries will be
biological rather than chemical.</p>
<p>3 The energy market. The biggest component of the environmental
market – the energy market – will not become a major factor until after
the year 2000. There is a growing need to cut down on high-polluting
energy sources, such as petrol as used in car engines or coal as used in
electricity-generating power plants. The first technologies to do so –
solar power cells and non-polluting coal-burning furnaces – are no
longer ‘sci-fi’; within ten years they will be affordable.</p>
<p>The third new market is not really new at all. It is the growing need
in developed and developing countries alike to repair, replenish, and
upgrade physical infrastructure, especially transportation systems –
roads, railways, bridges, harbours, and airports.</p>
<p>Little of the world’s infrastructure is less than thirty years old,
and in undeveloped countries, infrastructure has been neglected since
1929 or even since the First World War. Even the few Japanese
superhighways date back to the 1960s: the US road system, once the
wonder of the world, is older. No European rail system carries more than
one-tenth of its country’s freight, and all lose money. Likewise in
Japan: although its railroads carry enormous numbers of passengers, they
are unable to serve the economy by being freight carriers.</p>
<p>In contrast, America’s railways are in reasonable shape – at least,
they carry almost two-fifths of the country’s freight and earn money
doing so. But even in the United States, overloaded and undermaintained
transportation systems cannot support much more activity. Ocean shipping
– that part of transportation that in the developed countries of the
non-Communist world has been left to private enterprise – is in good
shape by and large.</p>
<p>But otherwise the world’s transportation systems may require ten
years or more of boom-time investment, comparable perhaps to the railway
boom of the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>And then there is the fourth of the new markets, the one created by
demography. It is the market for the investment ‘products’ to finance
survival into old age.</p>
<p>Life insurance, which should, of course, have been called ‘death
insurance’, was a major investment product of the nineteenth century. It
protected the family against economic catastrophe caused by the
breadwinner’s early death. The new growth industry in all developed
countries is ‘survival insurance’ – the fund created by the income that
wage earners put aside to provide for their retirement years. As
everyone knows, pension funds have become the only true ‘capitalists’ in
the American economy. They are rapidly becoming the true capitalists in
the other developed countries as well – and for the same reason: the
growing number of people who live well beyond retirement age. This
development creates a demand for investment vehicles that goes way
beyond anything seen earlier.</p>
<p>There is thus ample potential for economic growth, perhaps even for
another forty years of it. The demand is there; so are the technological
and capital resources. But this potential does not fit traditional
assumptions – and proposals by America’s Democrats and Britain’s Labour
Party – that increased government expenditures will stimulate
consumption. In fact, this is likely to do little more than trigger
inflation. What is needed is not more consumer spending but long-term
investment and the jobs it creates.</p>
<p>The measures America’s Republicans and Britain’s Conservatives
propose to encourage such investment are equally unlikely to do the
trick. They assume that the investors are the ‘rich’, when actually
today’s investors are barely ‘affluent’. The typical individual
contribution to a pension fund is well below 0 000 a year; and the
typical mutual-fund purchase (the preferred investment vehicle for
individual savers) runs around 500.</p>
<p>What is needed is something totally different: the privatization of
infrastructure. The needs of communication, the environment, and
transportation should be entrusted to investor-owned, profit-seeking
enterprises, operating in competitive markets. There is a precedent for
this: the concept of the ‘public utility’, invented in the United States
in the second half of the nineteenth century. This enabled American
railways, power companies, and telephone companies to remain private and
to stay competitive, while such services everywhere else in the world
were taken over by government.</p>
<p>We can already see some progress in the privatization of
infrastructure markets. Germany long ago cleaned up its most polluted
river, the Ruhr, by making it profitable for businesses not to pollute.
And in California’s Central Valley the water allotments of individual
farmers have become tradable commodities, giving buyers incentives to
conserve and to purify.</p>
<p>Privatization is the one way to make sure the needs for
infrastructure will be fulfilled. No government in the world today is
solvent enough to do so on its own, either through taxation or through
borrowing. Yet the capital is there, and in abundance, and so are the
opportunities for profitable investment.</p>
