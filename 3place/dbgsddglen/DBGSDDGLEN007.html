<h4 id="six-rules-for-presidents">5. Six rules for presidents</h4>
<p>It’s hard to imagine a more diverse group than Bill Clinton’s
predecessors in the American presidency – in abilities, personalities,
values, styles, and achievements. But even the weakest of them had
considerable effectiveness as long as they observed six management
rules. And even the most powerful lost effectiveness as soon as they
violated these rules.</p>
<p>What needs to be done? is the first thing the president must ask. He
must not stubbornly do what he wants to do, even if it was the focus of
his campaign.</p>
<p>Harry Truman came to the presidency in April 1945 convinced – as were
most Americans – that with the end of the war in sight, the country
could and should focus again on domestic problems. He was passionately
committed to reviving the New Deal. What made him an effective president
was his accepting within a few weeks that international affairs,
especially the containment of Stalin’s worldwide aggression, had to be
given priority whether he liked it or not (and he didn’t). There seems
to be a law of American politics that the world always changes between
Election Day and Inauguration Day. To refuse to accept this – as Jimmy
Carter tried to do – is not to be ‘principled’. It is to deny reality
and condemn oneself to being ineffectual.</p>
<p>Concentrate, don’t splinter yourself is the second rule. There are
usually half a dozen right answers to ‘What needs to be done?’ Yet
unless a president makes the risky and controversial choice of only one,
he will achieve nothing.</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt snubbed the outside world during his first five
years in office, despite the rise of Hitler in Europe and the Japanese
invasion in China. By early 1938 we were still in deepest Depression,
and the country was highly isolationist in mood. But practically
overnight, FDR switched his priority to international affairs, all but
neglecting domestic issues. Lyndon Johnson, thirty years later, tried to
fight the war in Vietnam and the war on poverty simultaneously. We lost
both.</p>
<p>The president’s top priority has to be something that truly needs to
be done. If it is not highly controversial, it is likely to be the wrong
priority. It has to be doable – and doable fairly fast – which means
that it has to be a limited objective. But it also has to be important
enough to make a difference if done successfully.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan applied these guidelines when he decided in 1981 to
make stopping inflation his first priority and to do so by raising
interest rates sky-high. Any second-year economics student could have
told Mr Reagan that this would cause a massive recession – and indeed
unemployment jumped within a few months from an already high 7½ per cent
to 10 per cent, a rate not seen since the Depression. Yet stopping
inflation was surely something that needed to be done. It was quickly
doable, and it did make a difference.</p>
<p>Mr Reagan’s action laid the foundation for the subsequent expansion
in employment – the greatest in US history. And it earned Mr Reagan the
public’s trust, which he enjoyed to the end of his tenure. Mr Clinton
might have gained similar success if he had made insuring the 37 million
Americans who lack health coverage his first priority. Instead he shrank
from the likely political battle, miring this limited (and doable)
objective in the morass of comprehensive health-care reform.</p>
<p>Don’t ever bet on a sure thing is rule three. It always misfires. If
any president since George Washington ever had a popular mandate it was
FDR at his second inauguration in 1937 – reelected with the largest
majority in US history and in full control of Congress.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt had every reason to believe that his plan to
‘pack’ the Supreme Court and thereby to remove the last obstacle to the
New Deal reforms would be a sure thing. He never even tested the plan
before announcing it. It immediately blew up in his face – so much so
that he never regained control of Congress. Mr Clinton too must have
thought that removing the ban on gays in the military would be a sure
thing – he too never tested the proposal before announcing it. It
immediately led to the sharpest drop in public opinion ratings ever
suffered by a new president.</p>
<p>Packing the Supreme Court was not perceived by the American public as
a way to promote the highly popular New Deal but as a subversion of the
Founders’ America. President Clinton’s proposal was perceived to have
far less to do with gay rights than with the combat-readiness of the
armed forces. Such differences in perception are always ‘obvious’ in
retrospect, but in retrospect only. An effective president knows,
therefore, that there is no risk-free politics.</p>
<p>An effective president does not micromanage is rule four. The tasks
that a US president must do himself are already well beyond what any but
the best-organized and most energetic person can possibly accomplish.
Whatever the president does not have to do he therefore must not do.</p>
<p>Presidents are much too far away from the scene of action, much too
dependent on what other people tell them or choose not to tell them, and
much too busy to study the fine print and to micromanage successfully.
As Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter have proved, there is no quicker way
for a president to discredit himself than to be his own chief operating
executive.</p>
<p>Yet in the American system the president, and no one else, is
ultimately accountable for the government’s performance. And in carrying
out the work of government, ‘God is in the details’. An effective
president has to say no to the temptation to micromanage but he has to
make sure operations are being taken care of. A president needs a small
team of highly disciplined people, each with clear operating
responsibility for one area.</p>
<p>The model might be FDR’s cabinet. Nine of its ten members (all but
the secretary of state) were what we now would call technocrats –
competent specialists in one area. ‘I make the decision,’ Roosevelt
said, ‘and then turn the job over to a cabinet member and leave him or
her alone.’ That the operating team delivered an exceptional performance
– not one financial scandal, for instance, despite unprecedented
government spending – explains in large measure Roosevelt’s own
unprecedented hold on power and office.</p>
<p>Later presidents tried to get the same effectiveness by having one
chief of staff, a chief operating officer. It has never worked. But the
other alternative, the one Mr Clinton has chosen – to have dozens and
dozens of deputy secretaries, undersecretaries, assistant secretaries,
special assistants and so on – only converts government into a perpetual
mass meeting.</p>
<p>A president has no friends in the administration was Lincoln’s maxim
and is rule five. Any president who has disregarded it has lived to
regret it.</p>
<p>No one can trust ‘friends of the president’. Whom do they work for?
Whom do they speak for? To whom do they really report? At best, they are
suspected of running around their official superiors and to their Great
Friend; at worst, they are known as the president’s spies. Above all,
they are always tempted to abuse their position as a friend and the
power that goes with it. If they do so by taking a bribe or otherwise
enriching themselves or their families, the resulting ‘financial
scandal’ makes the headlines. Non-financial abuses (e.g. obtaining
special treatment for this or that interest group) are usually hushed
up. Yet such abuses can do even more damage than the financial misdeeds
to the president’s effectiveness, his policies, his reputation.</p>
<p>Presidents are human beings, and their job is a lonely one. Being
politicians, they tend to be gregarious people who crave company,
companionship, sympathy. This explains both why presidents are so prone
to bring friends into their administrations and why they are usually
extremely reluctant to get rid of a friend who has proved incompetent or
betrayed their trust. But effective presidents should emulate the most
gregarious man ever to occupy the White House: Teddy Roosevelt. Even as
president he led a hectic social life, but not one of his half-dozen
‘intimates’ worked in his administration.</p>
<p>Many presidents’ wives, the prime example being Bess Truman, were
their husband’s main advisers and confidantes. But prior to Hillary
Rodham Clinton not one held a position in an administration.</p>
<p>And the sixth rule? It is the advice Harry Truman gave the newly
elected John F. Kennedy: ‘Once you’ re elected you stop
campaigning.’</p>
