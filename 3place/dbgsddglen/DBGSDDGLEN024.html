<h4 id="it-profits-us-to-strengthen-non-profits">22. It profits us to
strengthen non-profits</h4>
<p>America needs a new social priority: to triple the productivity of
the non-profits and to double the share of gross personal income – now
just below 3 per cent – they collect as donations. Otherwise the country
faces, only a few years out, social polarization.</p>
<p>Federal, state, and local governments will have to retrench sharply,
no matter who is in office. Moreover, government has proved incompetent
at solving social problems. Virtually every success we have scored has
been achieved by non-profits.</p>
<p>The great advances in health and longevity have been sponsored,
directed, and in large part financed by such non-profits as the American
Heart Association and the American Mental Health Association. Whatever
results there are in the rehabilitation of addicts we owe to such
non-profits as Alcoholics Anonymous, the Salvation Army, and the
Samaritans. The schools in which inner-city minority children learn the
most are parochial schools and those sponsored by some Urban League
chapters. The first group to provide food and shelter to the Kurds
fleeing from Saddam Hussein last spring was an American non-profit, the
International Rescue Committee.</p>
<p>Many of the most heartening successes are being scored by small,
local organizations. One example would be the tiny Judson Center in
Royal Oak, Michigan - an industrial suburb of Detroit.It gets black
women and their families off welfare while simultaneously getting
severely handicapped children out of institutions and back into
society.</p>
<p>Judson trains carefully picked welfare mothers to raise in their
homes, for a modest salary, two or three crippled or emotionally
disturbed kids. The rehabilitation rate for the welfare mothers is close
to 100 per cent, with many of them in five years or so moving into
employment as rehabilitation workers. The rehabilitation rate for the
children, who otherwise would be condemned to lifetime institutional
confinement, is about 50 per cent: and every one of these kids had been
given up as hopeless.</p>
<p>The non-profits spend far less for results than governments spend for
failures. The cost per pupil in the New York Archdiocese’s parochial
schools - 70 per cent of whose students stay in school, stay off the
streets, and graduate with high literacy and saleable skills -is about
half that in New York City’s failing public schools.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the first-offenders paroled in Florida into the custody
of the Salvation Army are ‘permanently’ rehabilitated -they are not
indicted for another crime for at least six years. Were they to go to
prison, two-thirds would become habitual criminals. Yet a prisoner costs
at least twice as much per year as a parolee in the custody of the
Salvation Army.</p>
<p>The Judson Center saves the state of Michigan 00000 a year for each
welfare mother and her charges - one-third in welfare costs and
two-thirds in the costs of keeping the children in institutions.</p>
<p>Though the majority of the students in private colleges and
universities get some sort of financial aid, their parents still pay
more than do the parents of students in state universities and colleges.
But the state-university student’s education actually costs a good deal
more (in some states twice as much) than that of the student in a
private non-profit institution - with the difference paid by the
taxpayer.</p>
<p>The non-profits have the potential to become America’s social sector
- equal in importance to the public sector of government and the private
sector of business. The delivery system is already in place: There are
now some 900000 non-profits, the great majority close to the problems of
their communities. About 30000 of them came into being in 1990 (the
latest year for which figures are available), practically all dedicated
to local action on one problem: tutoring minority children; providing
ombudsmen for patients in the local hospital; helping immigrants through
government red tape.</p>
<p>Where twenty years ago the American middle class thought it had done
its social duty by writing a cheque, it increasingly commits itself to
active doing as well. According to the best available statistics, there
are now some 90 million Americans -one out of every two adults - working
as ‘volunteers’ in nonprofits for three hours a week on average; the
non-profits have become America’s largest ‘employer’.</p>
<p>Increasingly these volunteers do not look upon their work as charity;
they see it as a parallel career to their paid jobs and insist on being
trained, on being held accountable for results and performance, and on
career opportunities for advancement to professional and managerial -
though still unpaid - positions in the non-profit. Above all, they see
in volunteer work access to achievement, to effectiveness, to
self-fulfilment, indeed to meaningful citizenship. And for this reason
there is more demand for well-structured volunteer jobs than there are
positions to fill.</p>
<p>Some observers (such a Brian O’Connell, head of Independent Sector,
the national association of the large non-profits) believe that, within
ten years, two-thirds of American adults -120 million - will want to
work as non-profit volunteers for five hours a week each, which would
mean a doubling of the personnel available for non-profit work.</p>
<p>And the non-profits are becoming highly innovative. When some friends
and I founded the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Non-Profit Management
a year ago, we planned as our first public event a 5000 award for the
innovation that ‘creates a significant new dimension of non-profit
performance’. We hoped to receive 40 applications. We received 809 - and
most were deserving of a prize.</p>
<p>The actual award went to the Judson Center, But the big nonprofits
are as innovative as the small fry in many cases. With several billion
dollars in revenue, Family Service America - headquartered in Milwaukee
– has become bigger than a good many Fortune 500 companies; it now is
probably the biggest American non-profit next to the Red Cross. It has
achieved its phenomenal growth in part through contracting with large
employers such as General Motors to help employee families with such
problems as addiction or the emotional disorders of adolescent
children.</p>
<p>For the non-profits’ potential to become reality, three things are
needed. First, the average non-profit must manage itself as well as the
best-managed ones do. The majority still believe that good intentions
and a pure heart are all that are needed. They do not yet see themselves
as accountable for performance and results. And far too many splinter
their efforts or waste them on non-problems and on activities that would
be done better - and more cheaply - by a business.</p>
<p>Second, non-profits have to learn how to raise money. The American
public has not become less generous - there is little evidence of the
‘compassion fatigue’ non-profit people talk about. In fact, giving has
been going up quite sharply these past few years - from 2.5 per cent of
personal income to 2.9 per cent. Unfortunately, a great many non-profits
still believe that the way to get money is to hawk needs. But the
American public gives for results. It no longer gives to ‘charity’; it
‘buys in’. Of the charitable appeals most of us get in the mail every
week, usually just one talks of results - the one that gets our
cheque.</p>
<p>The non-profits will have to get the additional money they need
primarily from individuals - as they always have. Even if there is
government money - mainly via vouchers I expect - and money from
companies, it can supply only a fraction of what is needed.</p>
<p>Finally, we need a change in the attitude of government and
government bureaucracies. President Bush has spoken glowingly of the
importance of the non-profits as the ‘thousand points of light’. If he
really believes this, he should propose allowing taxpayers to deduct .10
for each dollar they give to nonprofits as a cash donation. This would
solve the non-profits money problems at once. It would also could cut
government deficits in the not-so-very-long run. For a well-managed
nonprofit gets at least twice the bang out of each buck that a
government agency does.</p>
<p>Instead of such a policy, however, we have the tax collector making
one move after the other to penalize and to curtail donations to
non-profits. Each of these moves is presented as ‘closing a tax
loophole’; in fact, none has yielded a penny of additional revenue and
none likely to do so.</p>
<p>The real motivation for such actions is the bureaucracy’s hostility
to the non-profits - not too different from the bureaucracy’s hostility
to markets and private enterprise in the former Communist countries. The
success of the non-profits undermines the bureaucracy’s power and denies
its ideology. Worse, the bureaucracy cannot admit that the non-profits
succeed where governments fail. What is needed, therefore, is a public
policy that establishes the non-profits as the country’s first line of
attack on its social problems.</p>
<p>In my 1969 book The Age of Discontinuity I first proposed
‘privatization’, only to have every reviewer tell me that it would never
happen. Now, of course, privatization is widely seen as the cure for
modern economies mismanaged by socialist bureaucracies. We now need to
learn that ‘non-profitization’ for modern societies may be the way out
of mismanagement by welfare bureaucracies.</p>
