<h4 id="the-new-society-of-organizations">7. The new society of
organizations</h4>
<p>Every few hundred years throughout Western history a sharp
transformation has occurred. In a matter of decades, society altogether
rearranges itself – its worldview, its basic values, its social and
political structures, its arts, its key institutions. Fifty years later
a new world exists. And the people born into that world cannot even
imagine the world in which their grandparents lived and into which their
own parents were born.</p>
<p>Our age is such a period of transformation. Only this time the
transformation is not confined to Western society and Western history.
Indeed, one of the fundamental changes is that there is no longer a
‘Western’ history or a ‘Western’ civilization. There is only world
history and world civilization.</p>
<p>Whether this transformation began with the emergence of the first
non-Western country, Japan, as a great economic power or with the first
computer – that is, with information – is moot. My own candidate would
be the GI Bill of Rights, which gave every American soldier returning
from the Second World War the money to attend a university, something
that would have made absolutely no sense only thirty years earlier at
the end of the First World War. The GI Bill of Rights and the
enthusiastic response to it on the part of America’s veterans signalled
the shift to a knowledge society.</p>
<p>In this society, knowledge is the primary resource for individuals
and for the economy overall. Land, labour, and capital – the economist’s
traditional factors of production – do not disappear, but they become
secondary. They can be obtained, and obtained easily, provided there is
specialized knowledge. At the same time, however, specialized knowledge
by itself produces nothing. It can become productive only when it is
integrated into a task. And that is why the knowledge society is also a
society of organizations: the purpose and function of every
organization, business and non-business alike, is the integration of
specialized knowledges into a common task.</p>
<p>If history is any guide, this transformation will not be completed
until 2010 or 2020. Therefore, it is risky to try to foresee in every
detail the world that is emerging. But what new questions will arise and
where the big issues will lie we can, I believe, already discover with a
high degree of probability.</p>
<p>In particular, we already know the central tensions and issues that
confront the society of organizations: the tension created by the
community’s need for stability and the organization’s need to
destabilize; the relationship between individual and organization and
the responsibilities of each to the other; the tension that arises from
the organization’s need for autonomy and society’s stake in the Common
Good; the rising demand for socially responsible organizations; the
tension between specialists with specialized knowledges and the
organization’s need for these specialists to perform as a team. All
these will be central concerns, especially in the developed world, for
years to come. They will not be resolved by pronunciamento or philosophy
or legislation. They will be resolved where they originate: in the
individual organization and in the manager’s office.</p>
<p>Society, community, and family are all conserving institutions. They
try to maintain stability and to prevent, or at least to slow, change.
But the modern organization is a destabilizes. It must be organized for
innovation, and innovation, as the great Austrian-American economist
Joseph Schumpeter said, is ‘creative destruction’. And it must be
organized for the systematic abandonment of whatever is established,
customary, familiar, and comfortable, whether that is a product, a
service, or a process; a set of skills; human and social relationships;
or the organization itself. In short, it must be organized for constant
change. The organization’s function is to put knowledge to work – on
tools, products, and processes; on the design of work; on knowledge
itself. It is the nature of knowledge that it changes fast and that
today’s certainties always become tomorrow’s absurdities.</p>
<p>Skills change slowly and infrequently. If a stonecutter of ancient
Greece came back to life today and went to work in a stonemason’s yard,
the only change of significance would be the design he was asked to
carve on the tombstones. The tools he would use are the same, only now
they have electric batteries in the handles. Throughout history, the
craftsman who had learned a trade after five or seven years of
apprenticeship had learned, by age eighteen or nineteen, everything he
would ever need to use during his lifetime. In the society of
organizations, however, it is safe to assume that anyone with any
knowledge will have to acquire new knowledge every four or five years or
become obsolete.</p>
<p>This is doubly important because the changes that affect a body of
knowledge most profoundly do not, as a rule, come out of its own domain.
After Gutenberg first used movable type, there was practically no change
in the craft of printing for 400 years – until the steam engine came in.
The greatest challenge to the railways came not from changes in railways
but from the car, the truck, and the airplane. The pharmaceuticals
industry is being profoundly changed today by knowledge coming from
genetics and microbiology, disciplines that few biologists had heard of
forty years ago.</p>
<p>It is by no means only science or technology that creates new
knowledge and makes old knowledge obsolete. Social innovation is equally
important and often more important than scientific innovation. Indeed,
what triggered the present worldwide crises in that proudest of
nineteenth-century institutions, the commercial bank, was not the
computer or any other technological change. It was the discovery by
non-bankers that an old but hitherto rather obscure financial
instrument, commercial paper, could be used to finance companies and
would thus deprive the banks of the business on which they had held a
monopoly for 200 years and which gave them most of their income: the
commercial loan. The greatest change of all is probably that in the last
forty years, purposeful innovation – both technical and social – has
itself become an organized discipline that is both teachable and
learnable.</p>
<p>Nor is rapid knowledge-based change confined to business, as many
still believe. No organization in the fifty years since the Second World
War has changed more than the US military. Uniforms have remained the
same. Titles of rank have remained the same. But weapons have changed
completely, as the Gulf War of 1991 dramatically demonstrated; military
doctrines and concepts have changed even more drastically, as have the
armed services’ organizational structures, command structures,
relationships, and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is a safe prediction that in the next fifty years,
schools and universities will change more and more drastically than they
have since they assumed their present form more than 300 years ago, when
they reorganized themselves around the printed book. What will force
these changes is in part new technology, such as computers, videos, and
telecasts via satellite; in part the demands of a knowledge-based
society in which organized learning must become a lifelong process for
knowledge workers; and in part new theory about how human beings
learn.</p>
<p>For managers, the dynamics of knowledge impose one clear imperative:
every organization has to build the management of change into its very
structure. On the one hand, this means that every organization has to
prepare for the abandonment of everything it does. Managers have to
learn to ask every few years of every process, every product, every
procedure, every policy: ‘If we did not do this already, would we go
into it now, knowing what we now know?’ If the answer is no, the
organization has to ask, ‘So what do we do now?’ And it has to do
something, and not say, ‘Let’s make another study’. Indeed,
organizations increasingly will have to plan abandonment rather than try
to prolong the life of a successful product, policy, or practice –
something that so far only a few large Japanese companies have faced up
to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every organization must devote itself to creating
the new. Specifically, every management has to draw on three systematic
practices. The first is continuing improvement of everything the
organization does, the process the Japanese call kaizen. Every artist
throughout history has practised kaizen, or organized, continuous
self-improvement. But so far only the Japanese – perhaps because of
their Zen tradition – have embodied it in the daily life and work of
their business organizations (although not in their singularly
change-resistant universities). The aim of kaizen is to improve a
product or service so that it becomes a truly different product or
service in two or three years’ time.</p>
<p>Second, every organization will have to learn to exploit its
knowledge, that is, to develop the next generation of applications from
its own successes. Again, Japanese businesses have done the best with
this endeavour so far, as demonstrated by the success of the consumer
electronics manufacturers in developing one new product after another
from the same American invention, the tape recorder. But successful
exploitation of their successes is also one of the strengths of the
fast-growing American pastoral churches.</p>
<p>Finally, every organization will have to learn to innovate – and
innovation can now be organized – and must be organized – as a
systematic process. And then, of course, one comes back to abandonment,
and the process starts all over. Unless this is done, the
knowledge-based organization will very soon find itself obsolescent,
losing performance capacity and with it the ability to attract and hold
the skilled and knowledgeable people on whom its performance
depends.</p>
<p>The need to organize for change also requires a high degree of
decentralization. That is because the organization must be structured to
make decisions quickly. And those decisions must be based on closeness –
to performance, to the market, to technology, and to all the many
changes in society, the environment, demographics, and knowledge that
provide opportunities for innovation if they are seen and utilized.</p>
<p>All this implies, however, that the organization of the
post-capitalist society must constantly upset, disorganize, and
destabilize the community. They must change the demand for skills and
knowledges: just when every technical university is geared up to teach
physics, organizations need geneticists. Just when bank employees are
most proficient as loan officers they must become investment
counsellors. But also, businesses must be free to close factories on
which local communities depend for employment or to replace grizzled
model makers who have spent years learning their craft with
twenty-five-year-old whiz kids who know computer simulation.</p>
<p>Similarly, hospitals must be able to move the delivery of babies into
a free-standing birthing centre when the knowledge base and technology
of obstetrics change. And we must be able to close a hospital altogether
when changes in medical knowledge, technology, and practice make a
hospital with fewer than 200 beds both uneconomical and incapable of
giving first-rate care. For a hospital – or a school or any other
community organization – to discharge its social function we must be
able to close it down, no matter how deeply rooted in the local
community it is and how much beloved, if changes in demographics,
technology, or knowledge set new prerequisites for performance.</p>
<p>But every one of such changes upsets the community, disrupts it,
deprives it of continuity. Every one is ‘unfair’. Every one
destabilizes.</p>
<p>Equally disruptive is another fact of organizational life: the modern
organization must be in a community but cannot be of it. An
organization’s members live in a particular place, speak its language,
send their children to its schools, vote, pay taxes, and need to feel at
home there. Yet the organization cannot submerge itself in the community
or subordinate itself to the community‘s ends. Its ‘culture’ has to
transcend community.</p>
<p>It is the nature of the task, not the community in which the task is
being performed, that determines the culture of an organization. The
American civil servant, though totally opposed to Communism, will
understand immediately what a Chinese colleague tells him about the
bureaucratic intrigues in Beijing. But he would be totally baffled in
his own Washington, DC, if he were to sit in on a discussion of next
week’s advertising promotions by the managers of the local grocery
chain.</p>
<p>To perform its task the organization has to be organized and managed
the same way as others of its type. For example, we hear a great deal
about the differences in management between Japanese and American
companies. But a large Japanese company functions very much like a large
American company; and both function very much like a large German or
British company. Likewise, no one will ever doubt that he or she is in a
hospital, no matter where the hospital is located. The same holds true
for schools and universities, for labour unions and research labs, for
museums and opera houses, for astronomical observatories and large
farms.</p>
<p>In addition, each organization has a value system that is determined
by its task. In every hospital in the world, health care is considered
the ultimate good. In every school in the world, learning is considered
the ultimate good. In every business in the world, production and
distribution of goods or services is considered the ultimate good. For
the organization to perform to a high standard, its members must believe
that what it is doing is, in the last analysis, the one contribution to
community and society on which all others depend.</p>
<p>In its culture, therefore, the organization will always transcend the
community. If an organization’s culture and the values of its community
clash, the organization must prevail – or else it will not make its
social contribution. ‘Knowledge knows no boundaries’ says an old
proverb. There has been a ‘town and gown’ conflict ever since the first
university was established more than 750 years ago. But such a conflict
– between the autonomy the organization needs in order to perform and
the claims of the community, between the values of the organization and
those of the community, between the decisions facing the organization
and the interests of the community – is inherent in the society of
organizations.</p>
<p>The issue of social responsibility is also inherent in the society of
organizations. The modern organization has and must have social power –
and a good deal of it. It needs power to make decisions about people:
whom to hire, whom to fire, whom to promote. It needs power to establish
the rules and disciplines required to produce results: for example, the
assignment of jobs and tasks and the establishment of working hours. It
needs power to decide which factories to build where and which factories
to close. It needs power to set prices, and so on.</p>
<p>And non-businesses have the greatest social power – far more, in
fact, than business enterprises. Few organizations in history were ever
granted the power the university has today. Refusing to admit a student
or to a grant a student a diploma is tantamount to debarring that person
from careers and opportunities. Similarly, the power of the American
hospital to deny a physician admitting privileges is the power to
exclude that physician from the practice of medicine. The labour union’s
power over admission to apprenticeship or its control of access to
employment in a ‘closed shop’, where only union members can be hired,
gives the union tremendous social power.</p>
<p>The power of the organization can be restrained by political power.
It can be made subject to due process and to review by the courts. But
it must be exercised by individual organizations rather than by
political authorities. This is why post-capitalist society talks so much
about social responsibilities of the organization.</p>
<p>It is futile to argue, as Milton Friedman, the American economist and
Nobel Laureate does, that a business has only one responsibility:
economic performance. Economic performance is the first responsibility
of a business. Indeed, a business that does not show a profit at least
equal to its cost of capital is irresponsible; it wastes society’s
resources. Economic performance is the base without which a business
cannot discharge any other responsibilities, cannot be a good employee,
a good citizen, a good neighbour. But economic performance is not the
only responsibility of a business any more than educational performance
is the only responsibility of a school or health care the only
responsibility of a hospital.</p>
<p>Unless power is balanced by responsibility, it becomes tyranny.
Furthermore, without responsibility, power always degenerates into
non-performance, and organizations must perform. So the demand for
socially responsible organizations will not go away; rather, it will
widen.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we also know, if only in rough outline, how to answer
the problem of social responsibility. Every organization must assume
full responsibility for its impact on employees, the environment,
customers, and whomever and whatever it touches. That is its social
responsibility. But we also know that society will increasingly look to
major organizations, for-profit and non-profit alike, to tackle major
social ills. And there we had better be watchful, because good
intentions are not always socially responsible. It is irresponsible for
an organization to accept – let alone to pursue – responsibilities that
would impede its capacity to perform its main task and mission or to act
where it has no competence.</p>
<p>Organization has become an everyday term. Everybody gives a nod of
understanding when somebody says In our organization, everything should
revolve around the customer’ or ‘In this organization, they never forget
a mistake’. And most, if not all, social tasks in every developed
country are performed in and by an organization of one kind or another.
Yet no one in the United States – or anywhere else – talked of
‘organizations’ until after the Second World War. The Concise Oxford
Dictionary did not even list the term in its current meaning in the 1950
edition. It is only the emergence of management since the Second World
War, what I call the ‘Management Revolution’, that has allowed us to see
that the organization is discrete and distinct from society’s other
institutions.</p>
<p>Unlike communities, societies, or families, organizations are
purposefully designed and always specialized. Communities and societies
are defined by the bonds that hold their members together, whether they
be language, culture, history, or locality. An organization is defined
by its task. The symphony orchestra does not attempt to cure the sick;
it plays music. The hospital takes care of the sick but does not attempt
to play Beethoven.</p>
<p>Indeed, an organization is effective only if it concentrates on one
task. Diversification destroys the performance capacity of an
organization, whether it is a business, a labour union, a school, a
hospital, a community service, or a house of worship. Society and
community must be multidimensional; they are environments. An
organization is a tool. And as with any other tool, the more specialized
it is, the greater its capacity to perform its given task.</p>
<p>Because the modern organization is composed of specialists, each with
his or her own narrow area of expertise, its mission must be crystal
clear. The organization must be single-minded, or its members will
become confused. They will follow their own speciality rather than apply
it to the common task. They will each define ‘results’ in terms of their
own speciality and impose its values on the organization. Only a focused
and common mission will hold the organization together and enable it to
produce. Without such a mission, the organization will soon lose
credibility and consequently its ability to attract the very people it
needs to perform.</p>
<p>It can be all too easy for managers to forget that joining an
organization is always voluntary. De facto there may be little choice.
But even where membership is all but compulsory – as membership in the
Catholic Church was in all the countries of Europe for many centuries
for all but a handful of Jews and gypsies – the fiction of voluntary
choice is always carefully maintained: the godfather at the infant’s
baptism pledges the child’s voluntary acceptance of membership in the
Church.</p>
<p>Likewise, it may be difficult to leave an organization – the Mafia,
for instance, a big Japanese company, the Jesuit order. But it is always
possible. And the more an organization becomes an organization of
knowledge workers, the easier it is to leave it and move elsewhere.
Therefore, an organization is always in competition for its most
essential resource: qualified, knowledgeable people.</p>
<p>All organizations now say routinely ‘People are our greatest asset’.
Yet few practise what they preach, let alone truly believe it. Most
still believe, though perhaps not consciously, what nineteenth-century
employers believed: people need us more than we need them. But in fact,
organizations have to market membership as much as they market products
and services – and perhaps more. They have to attract people, hold
people, recognize and reward people, motivate people, and serve and
satisfy people.</p>
<p>The relationship between knowledge workers and their organizations is
a distinctly new phenomenon, one for which we have no good term. For
example, an employee, by definition, is someone who gets paid for
working. Yet the largest single group of ‘employees’ in the United
States consists of the millions of men and women who work several hours
a week without pay for one or another non-profit organization. They are
clearly ‘staff and consider themselves as such, but they are unpaid
volunteers. Similarly, many people who work as employees are not
employed in any legal sense because they do not work for someone else.
Fifty or sixty years ago, we would have spoken of these people (many, if
not most, of whom are educated professionals) as ‘Independent’; today we
speak of the ‘self-employed’.</p>
<p>These discrepancies – and they exist in just about every language –
remind us why new realities often demand new words. But until such a
word emerges, this is probably the best definition of employees in the
post-capitalist society: people whose ability to make a contribution
depends on having access to an organization.</p>
<p>As far as the employees who work in subordinate and menial
occupations are concerned – the salesclerk in the supermarket, the
cleaning woman in the hospital, the delivery-truck driver – the
consequences of this new definition are small. For all practical
purposes, their position may not be too different from that of the wage
earner, the worker’ of yesterday, whose direct descendants they are. In
fact, this is precisely one of the central social problems modern
society faces.</p>
<p>But the relationship between the organization and knowledge workers,
who already number at least one-third and more likely two-fifths of all
employees, is radically different, as is that between the organization
and volunteers. They can work only because there is an organization,
thus they too are dependent. But at the same time, they own the ‘means
of production’ – their knowledge. In this respect, they are independent
and highly mobile.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers still need the tools of production. In fact,
capital investment in the tools of the knowledge employee may already be
higher than the capital investment in the tools of the manufacturing
worker ever was. (And the social investment, for example, the investment
in a knowledge worker’s education, is many times the investment in the
manual worker’s education.) But this capital investment is unproductive
unless the knowledge worker brings to bear on it the knowledge that he
or she owns and that cannot be taken away. Machine operators in the
factory did as they were told. The machine decided not only what to do
but how to do it. The knowledge employee may well need a machine,
whether it be a computer, an ultrasound ana-lyser, or a telescope. But
the machine will not tell the knowledge worker what to do, let alone how
to do it. And without this knowledge, which belongs to the employee, the
machine is unproductive.</p>
<p>Further, machine operators, like all workers throughout history,
could be told what to do, how to do it, and how fast to do it. Knowledge
workers cannot be supervised effectively. Unless they know more about
their speciality than anybody else in the organization, they are
basically useless. The marketing manager may tell the market researcher
what the company needs to know about the design of a new product and the
market segment in which it should be positioned. But it is the market
researcher’s job to tell the president of the company what market
research is needed, how to set it up, and what the results mean.</p>
<p>During the traumatic restructuring of American business in the 1980s,
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of knowledge employees lost
their jobs. Their companies were acquired, merged, spun off, or
liquidated. Yet within a few months, most of them found new jobs in
which to put their knowledge to work. The transition period was painful,
and in about half the cases, the new job did not pay quite as much as
the old one and may not have been as enjoyable. But the laid-off
technicians, professionals, and managers found they had the ‘capital’,
the knowledge: they owned the means of production. Somebody else, the
organization, had the tools of production. The two needed each
other.</p>
<p>One consequence of this new relationship – and it is another new
tension in modern society – is that loyalty can no longer be obtained by
the paycheque. The organization must earn loyalty by proving to its
knowledge employees that it offers them exceptional opportunities for
putting their knowledge to work. Not so long ago we talked about
‘labour’. Increasingly we are talking about ‘human resources’. This
change reminds us that it is the individual, and especially the skilled
and knowledgeable employee, who decides in large measure what he or she
will contribute to the organization and how great the yield from his or
her knowledge will be.</p>
<p>Because the modern organization consists of knowledge specialists, it
has to be an organization of equals, of colleagues and associates. No
knowledge ranks higher than another; each is judged by its contribution
to the common task rather than by any inherent superiority or
inferiority. Therefore, the modern organization cannot be an
organization of boss and subordinate. It must be organized as a
team.</p>
<p>There are only three kinds of teams. One is the sort of team that
plays together in tennis doubles. In that team – and it has to be small
– each member adapts himself or herself to the personality, the skills,
the strengths, and the weaknesses of the other member or members. Then
there is the team that plays soccer. Each player has a fixed position;
but the whole team moves together (except for the goalie) while
individual members retain their relative positions. Finally, there is
the American baseball team – or the orchestra – in which all the members
have fixed positions.</p>
<p>At any given time, an organization can play only one kind of game.
And it can use only one kind of team for any given task. Which team to
use or game to play is one of the riskiest decisions in the life of an
organization. Few things are as difficult in an organization as
transforming one kind of team in to another.</p>
<p>Traditionally, American industry has used a baseball-style team to
produce a new product or model. Research did its work and passed it on
to manufacturing. Manufacturing did its work and passed it on to
marketing. Accounting usually came in at the manufacturing phase.
Personnel usually came in only when there was a true crisis – and often
not even then.</p>
<p>Then the Japanese reorganized their new product development into a
soccer team. In such a team, each function does its own work, but from
the beginning they work together. They move with the task, so to speak,
the way a soccer team moves with the ball. It took the Japanese at least
fifteen years to learn how to do this. But once they had mastered the
new concept, they cut development time by two-thirds. Where
traditionally it has taken five years to bring out a new car model,
Toyota, Nissan, and Honda now do it in eighteen months. This, as much as
their quality control, has given the Japanese the upper hand in both the
American and European car markets.</p>
<p>Some American manufacturers have been working hard to reorganize
their development work according to the Japanese model. Ford Motor
Company, for instance, began to do so in the early 1980s. Ten years
later, in the early 1990s, it has made considerable progress – but not
nearly enough to catch up with the Japanese. Changing a team demands the
most difficult learning imaginable: unlearning. It demands giving up
hard-earned skills, habits of a lifetime, deeply cherished values of
craftsmanship and professionalism, and – perhaps the most difficult of
all – it demands giving up old and treasured human relationships. It
means abandoning what people have always considered ‘our community’ or
‘our family’.</p>
<p>But if the organization is to perform, it must be organized as a
team. When modern organizations first arose in the closing years of the
nineteenth century, the only model was the military. The Prussian army
was as much a marvel of organization for the world of 1870 as Henry
Ford’s assembly line was for the world of 1920. In the army of 1870,
each member did much the same thing, and the number of people with any
knowledge was infinitesimally small. The army was organized by
command-and-control, and business enterprise as well as most other
institutions copied that model. This is now rapidly changing. As more
and more organizations become information-based, they are transforming
themselves into soccer or tennis teams, that is, into
responsibility-based organizations in which every member must act as a
responsible decision maker. All members, in other words, have to see
themselves as ‘executives’.</p>
<p>Even so, an organization must be managed. The management may be
intermittent and perfunctory, as it is, for instance, in the
parent-teacher association at a US suburban school. Or management may be
a full-time and demanding job for a fairly large group of people, as it
is in the military, the business enterprise, the labour union, and the
university. But there have to be people who make decisions or nothing
will ever get done. There have to be people who are accountable for the
organization’s mission, its spirit, its performance, its results,
Society, community, and family may have ‘leaders’, but only
organizations know a ‘management’. And while this management must have
considerable authority, its job in the modern organization is not to
command. It is to inspire.</p>
<p>The society of organizations is unprecedented in human history. It is
unprecedented in its performance capacity both because each of its
constituent organizations is a highly specialized tool designed for one
specific task and because each bases itself on the organization and
deployment of knowledge. It is unprecedented in its structure. But it is
also unprecedented in its tensions and problems. Not all of these are
serious. In fact, some of them we already know how to resolve – issues
of social responsibility, for example. But there are other areas where
we do not know the right answer and where we may not even be asking the
right questions yet.</p>
<p>There is, for instance, the tension between the community’s need for
continuity and stability and the organization’s need to be an innovator
and destabilizer. There is the split between ‘literati’ and ‘managers’.
Both are needed: the former to produce knowledge, the latter to apply
knowledge and make it productive. But the former focus on words and
ideas, the latter on people, work, and performance. There is the threat
to the very basis of the society of organizations – the knowledge base –
that arises from ever greater specialization, from the shift from
knowledge to knowledges. But the greatest and most difficult challenge
is that presented by society’s new pluralism.</p>
<p>For more than 600 years no society has had as many centres of power
as the society in which we now live. The Middle Ages indeed knew
pluralism. Society was composed of hundreds of competing and autonomous
power centres: feudal lords and knights, exempt bishoprics, autonomous
monasteries, ‘free’ cities. In some places, the Austrian Tyrol, for
example, there were even ‘free peasants’, beholden to no one but the
Emperor. There were also autonomous craft guilds and transnational
trading leagues like the Hanseatic Merchants and the merchant bankers of
Florence, toll and tax collectors, local ‘parliaments’ with legislative
and tax-raising powers, private armies available for hire, and myriads
more.</p>
<p>Modern history in Europe – and equally in Japan – has been the
history of the subjugation of all competing centres of power by one
central authority, first called the ‘prince’, then the ‘state’. By the
middle of the nineteenth century the unitary state had triumphed in
every developed country except the United States, which remained
profoundly pluralistic in its religious and educational organizations.
Indeed, the abolition of pluralism was the ‘progressive’ cause for
nearly 600 years.</p>
<p>But just when the triumph of the state seemed assured, the first new
organization arose – the large business enterprise. (This, of course,
always happens when the ‘end of history’ is announced.) Since then, one
new organization after another has sprung up. And old organizations like
the university, which in Europe seemed to have been brought safely under
the control of central governments, have become autonomous again.
Ironically, twentieth-century totalitarianism, especially Communism,
represented the last desperate attempt to save the old and once
progressive creed in which there is only one centre of power and one
organization rather than a pluralism of competing and autonomous
organizations.</p>
<p>That attempt failed, as we know. But the failure of central
authority, in and of itself, does nothing to address the issues that
follow from a pluralistic society. To illustrate, consider a story that
many people have heard of or, more accurately, misheard.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Charles E. Wilson was a prominent personality in
the United States, first as president and chief executive officer of
General Motors, at that time the world’s largest and most successful
manufacturer, then as Secretary of Defence in the Eisenhower
administration. But if Wilson is remembered at all today it is for
something he did not say: ‘What is good for General Motors is good for
the United States.’ What Wilson actually said in his 1953 confirmation
hearings for the Defense Department job was ‘What is good for the United
States is good for General Motors’.</p>
<p>Wilson tried for the remainder of his life to correct the misquote.
But no one listened to him. Everyone argued that ‘if he didn’t say it,
he surely believes it – in fact he should believe it’. For as has been
said, executives in an organization – whether business or university or
hospital or the Boy Scouts – must believe that its mission and task are
society’s most important mission and task as well as the foundation for
everything else. If they do not believe this, their organization will
soon lose faith in itself, its self-confidence, its pride, and the
ability to perform.</p>
<p>The diversity that is characteristic of a developed society and that
provides its great strength is only possible because of the specialized,
single-task organizations that we have developed since the Industrial
Revolution and, especially, during the last fifty years. But the feature
that gives them the capacity to perform is precisely that each is
autonomous and specialized, informed only by its own narrow mission and
vision, its own narrow values, and not by any consideration of society
and community.</p>
<p>Therefore, we come back to the old – and never resolved – problem of
the pluralistic society: who takes care of the common good? Who defines
it? Who balances the separate and often competing goals and values of
society’s institutions? Who makes the trade-off decisions and on what
basis should they be made?</p>
<p>Medieval feudalism was replaced by the unitary sovereign state
precisely because it could not answer these questions. But the unitary
sovereign state has now itself been replaced by a new pluralism – a
pluralism of function rather than one of political power – because it
could neither satisfy the needs of society nor perform the necessary
tasks of community. That, in the final analysis, is the most fundamental
lesson to be learned from the failure of socialism, the failure of the
belief in the all-embracing and all-powerful state. The challenge that
faces us now, and especially in the developed, free-market democracies
such as the United States, is to make the pluralism of autonomous,
knowledge-based organizations redound both to economic performance and
to political and social cohesion.</p>
