<h4 id="theres-three-kinds-of-teams">8. There’s three kinds of
teams</h4>
<p>‘Team-building’ has become a buzzword in American business. The
results are not overly impressive.</p>
<p>The Ford Motor Company began more than ten years ago to build teams
to design its new models. It now reports ‘serious problems’, and the gap
in development time between Ford and its Japanese competitors has hardly
narrowed. General Motors’ Saturn Division was going to replace the
traditional assembly line with teamwork in its ‘factory of the future’.
But the plant has been steadily moving back toward the Detroit-style
assembly line. Procter andandandand Gamble launched a team-building
campaign with great fanfare several years ago. Now PandandandandG is
moving back to individual accountability for developing and marketing
new products.</p>
<p>One reason – perhaps the major one – for these near-failures is the
all-but-universal belief among executives that there is just one kind of
team. There actually are three – each different in its structure, in the
behaviour it demands from its members, in its strengths, its
vulnerabilities, its limitations, its requirements, but above all, in
what it can do and should be used for.</p>
<p>The first kind of team is the baseball team. The surgical team that
performs an open-heart operation and Henry Ford’s assembly line are both
‘baseball teams’. So is the team Detroit traditionally sets up to design
a new car.</p>
<p>The players play on the team; they do not play as a team. They have
fixed positions they never leave. The second baseman never runs to
assist the pitcher; the anaesthesiologist never comes to the aid of the
surgical nurse. ‘Up at bat, you’re totally alone’ is an old baseball
saying. In the traditional Detroit design team, marketing people rarely
saw designers and were never consulted by them. Designers did their work
and passed it on to the development engineers, who in turn did their
work and passed it on to manufacturing, which in turn did its work and
passed it on the marketing people.</p>
<p>The second kind of team is the football team. The hospital unit that
rallies round a patient who goes into shock at 3 a.m. is a ‘football
team’, as are Japanese car makers’ design teams. The players on the
football team, like those on the baseball team, have fixed positions.
But on the football team players play as a team. The Japanese car
makers’ design teams, which Detroit and PandandandandG rushed to
imitate, are football-type teams. To use an engineering term, the
designers, engineers, manufacturing people, and marketing people work
‘in parallel’. The traditional Detroit team worked ‘in series’.</p>
<p>Third, there is the tennis doubles team – the kind Saturn management
hoped would replace the traditional assembly line. It is also the sort
of team that plays in a jazz combo, the team of senior executives who
form the ‘president’s office’ in big companies, or the team that is most
likely to produce a genuine innovation like the personal computer
fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>On the doubles team, players have a primary rather than a fixed
position. They are supposed to ‘cover’ their team-mates, adjusting to
their team-mates’ strengths and weaknesses and to the changing demands
of the ‘game’.</p>
<p>Business executives and the management literature have little good to
say these days about the baseball-style team, whether in the office or
on the factory floor. There is even a failure to recognize such teams as
teams at all. But this kind of team has enormous strengths. Each member
can be evaluated separately, can have clear and specific goals, can be
held accountable, can be measured – as witness the statistics a true
aficionado reels off about every major-leaguer in baseball history. Each
member can be trained and developed to the fullest extent of the
individual’s strengths. And because the members do not have to adjust to
anybody else on the team, every position can be staffed with a ‘star’,
no matter how temperamental, jealous, or limelight-hogging each of them
might be.</p>
<p>But the baseball team is inflexible. It works well when the game has
been played many times and when the sequence of its actions is
thoroughly understood by everyone. That is what made this kind of team
right for Detroit in the past.</p>
<p>As recently as twenty years ago, to be fast and flexible in car
design was the last thing Detroit needed or wanted. Traditional mass
production required long runs with minimum changes. And since the resale
value of the ‘good used car’ – one less than three years old – was a key
factor for the new-car buyer, it was a serious mistake to bring out a
new design (which would depreciate the old car) more than every five
years. Sales and market share took a dip on several occasions when
Chrysler prematurely introduced a new, brilliant design.</p>
<p>The Japanese did not invent ‘flexible mass production’; IBM was
probably the first to use it, around 1960. But when the Japanese car
industry adopted it, it made possible the introduction of a new car
model in parallel with a successful old one. And then the baseball team
did indeed become the wrong team for Detroit, and for mass-production
industry as a whole. The design process then had to be restructured as a
football team.</p>
<p>The football team does have the flexibility Detroit now needs. But it
has far more stringent requirements than the baseball team. It needs a
‘score’ – such as the play the coach signals to the huddle on the field.
The specifications with which the Japanese begin their design of a new
car model – or a new consumer-electronics product – are far more
stringent and detailed than anything Detroit is used to in respect to
style, technology, performance, weight, price and so on. And they are
far more closely adhered to.</p>
<p>In the traditional ‘baseball’ design team, every position –
engineering, manufacturing, marketing – does its job its own way. The
word of the coach is law. Players are beholden to this one boss alone
for their orders, their rewards, their appraisals, their promotions.</p>
<p>The individual engineer on the Japanese design team is a member of
his company’s engineering department. But he is on the design team
because the team’s leader has asked for him – not because the chief
engineer sent him there. He can consult engineering and get advice. But
his orders come from the design-team chief, who also appraises his
performance. If there are stars on these teams, they are featured only
if the team leaders entrusts them with a ‘solo’. Otherwise they
subordinate themselves to the team.</p>
<p>Even more stringent are the requirements of the doubles team – the
kind that GM’s Saturn Division hoped to develop in its
‘flexible-manufacturing’ plant, and a flexible plant does indeed need
such a team. The team must be quite small, with five to seven members at
most. The members have to be trained together and must work together for
quite some time before they fully function as a team. There must be one
clear goal for the entire team yet considerable flexibility with respect
to the individual member’s work and performance. And in this kind of
team only the team ‘performs’; individual members ‘contribute’.</p>
<p>All three of these kinds of teams are true teams. But they are so
different – in the behaviour they require, in what they do best, and in
what they cannot do – that they cannot be hybrids. One kind of team can
play only one way. And it is very difficult to change from one kind of
team to another.</p>
<p>Gradual change cannot work. There has to be a total break with the
past, however traumatic it may be. This means that people cannot report
to both their old boss and to the new coach, or team leader. And their
reward, their compensation, their appraisals, and their promotions must
be totally dependent on their performance in their new roles on their
new teams. But this is so unpopular that the temptation to compromise is
always great.</p>
<p>At Ford, for instance, the financial people have been left under the
control of the financial staff and report to them rather than to the new
design teams. GM’s Saturn Division has tried to maintain the authority
of the traditional bosses – the first-line supervisors and the shop
stewards – rather than hand decision-making power over to the work
teams. This, however, is like playing baseball and a tennis doubles
match with the same people, on the same field, and at the same time. It
can only result in frustration and non-performance. And a similar
confusion seems to have prevailed at PandandandandG.</p>
<p>Teams, in other words, are tools. As such, each team design has its
own uses, its own characteristics, its own requirements, its own
limitations. Teamwork is neither ‘good’ nor ‘desirable’ – it is a fact.
Wherever people work together or play together they do so as a team.
Which team to use for what purpose is a crucial, difficult, and risky
decision that is even harder to unmake. Managements have yet to learn
how to make it.</p>
