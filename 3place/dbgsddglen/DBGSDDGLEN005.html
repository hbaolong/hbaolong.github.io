<h4 id="the-five-deadly-business-sins">3. The five deadly business
sins</h4>
<p>The past few years have seen the downfall of one once-dominant
business after another: General Motors, Sears, and IBM, to name just a
few. But in every case the main cause has been at least one of the five
deadly business sins – avoidable mistakes that will harm the mightiest
business.</p>
<p>The first and easily the most common sin is the worship of high
profit margins and of ’premium pricing‘. The prime example of what this
leads to is the near-collapse of Xerox in the 1970s. Having invented the
copier – and few products in industrial history have had greater success
faster – Xerox soon began to add feature after feature to the machine,
each priced to yield the maximum profit margin and each driving up the
machine’s price. Xerox’s profits soared and so did the stock price. But
the vast majority of consumers who need only a simple machine became
increasingly ready to buy from a competitor. And when Japan’s Canon
brought out such a machine, it immediately took over the US market.
Xerox barely survived.</p>
<p>GM’s troubles – and those of the entire US car industry – are, in
large measure, also the result of the fixation on profit margin. By
1970, the Volkswagen Beetle had taken almost 10 per cent of the American
market, showing there was US demand for a small and fuel-efficient car.
A few years later, after the first ‘oil crisis’, that market had become
very large and was growing fast. Yet the US car makers were quite
content for many years to leave it to the Japanese, as small-car profit
margins appeared to be so much lower than those for big cars.</p>
<p>This soon turned out to be a delusion – it usually is. GM, Chrysler
and Ford increasingly had to subsidize their big-car buyers with
discounts, rebates, cash bonuses. In the end, the Big Three probably
gave away more in subsidies than it would have cost them to develop a
competitive (and profitable) small car.</p>
<p>The lesson: the worship of premium pricing always creates a market
for the competitor. And high profit margins do not equal maximum
profits. Total profit is profit margin multiplied by turnover. Maximum
profit is thus obtained by the profit margin that yields the largest
total profit flow, and that is usually the profit margin that produces
optimum market standing.</p>
<p>Closely related to this first sin is the second one: mispricing a new
product by charging what the market will bear‘. This, too, creates a
risk-free opportunity for the competition. It is the wrong policy even
if the product has patent protection. Given enough incentive, a
potential competitor will find a way around the strongest patent.</p>
<p>The Japanese have the world’s fax-machine market today because the
Americans who invented the machine, developed it, and first produced it,
charged what the market would bear – the highest price they could get.
The Japanese, however, priced the machine in the United States two or
three years down the learning curve – a good 40 per cent lower. They had
the market virtually overnight; only one small US fax-machine
manufacturer, which makes a speciality product in tiny quantities,
survives.</p>
<p>By contrast, DuPont has remained the world’s largest producer of
synthetic fibres because, in the mid-1940s, it offered its new and
patented nylon on the world market for the price at which it would have
to be sold five years hence to maintain itself against competition. This
was some two-fifths lower than the price DuPont could then have obtained
from the manufacturers of women’s hosiery and underwear.</p>
<p>DuPont’s move delayed competition by five or six years. But it also
immediately created markets for nylon that nobody at the company had
even thought about (for example, in car tyres), and these markets soon
became both bigger and more profitable than the women’s-wear market
could ever have been. This strategy thus produced a much larger total
profit for DuPont than charging what the traffic would bear could have
done. And DuPont kept the markets when the competitors did appear, after
five or six years.</p>
<p>The third deadly sin is cost-driven pricing. The only thing that
works is price-driven costing. Most American and practically all
European companies arrive at their prices by adding up costs and then
putting a profit margin on top. And then, as soon as they have
introduced the product, they have to start cutting the price, have to
redesign the product at enormous expense, have to take losses – and,
often, have to drop a perfectly good product because it is priced
incorrectly. Their argument? ‘We have to recover our costs and make a
profit.’ This is true but irrelevant: customers do not see it as their
job to ensure that manufacturers make a profit. The only sound way to
price is to start out with what the market is willing to pay – and thus,
it must be assumed, what the competition will charge – and design to
that price specification.</p>
<p>Cost-driven pricing is the reason there is no longer an American
consumer-electronics industry. It had the technology and the products.
But it operated on cost-led pricing – and the Japanese practised
price-led costing. Cost-led pricing also nearly destroyed the US
machine-tool industry and gave the Japanese, who again used price-led
costing, their leadership in the world market. The US industry’s recent
(and still quite modest) comeback is the result of that industry‘s
finally having switched to price-led costing.</p>
<p>If Toyota and Nissan succeed in pushing the German luxury car makers
out of the US market, it will be the result of their using price-led
costing. To be sure, to start out with price and then whittle down costs
is more work initially. But in the end it is much less work than to
start out wrong and then spend loss-making years bringing costs into
line – let alone far cheaper than losing a market.</p>
<p>The fourth of the deadly business sins is slaughtering tomorrow’s
opportunity on the altar of yesterday. It is what derailed IBM. IMB’s
downfall was paradoxically caused by unique success: IBM’s catching up,
almost overnight, when Apple brought out the first PC in the mid-1970s.
But then when IBM had gained leadership in the new PC market, it
subordinated this new and growing business to the old cash cow, the
mainframe computer.</p>
<p>Top management practically forbade the PC people to sell to potential
mainframe customers. This did not help the mainframe business – it never
does. But it stunted the PC business. All it did was create sales for
the IBM ‘clones’ and thereby guarantee that IBM would not reap the
fruits of its achievement.</p>
<p>This is actually the second time that IBM has committed this sin.
Forty years ago, when IBM first had a computer, top management decreed
that it must not be offered where it might interfere with the possible
sale of punch cards, then the company’s cash cow. The company was saved
by the Justice Department’s bringing an antitrust suit against IBM’s
domination of the punch-card market, which forced management to abandon
the cards – and saved the fledgling computer. The second time Providence
did not come to IBM’s rescue, however.</p>
<p>The last of the deadly sins is feeding problems and starving
opportunities. For many years I have been asking new clients to tell me
who their best-performing people are. And then I ask: ‘What are they
assigned to?’ Almost without exception, the performers are assigned to
problems – to the old business that is sinking faster than has been
forecast; to the old product that is being outflanked by a competitor’s
new offering; to the old technology – for example, analogue switches,
when the market has already switched to digital. Then I ask: ‘And who
takes care of the opportunities?’ Almost invariably, the opportunities
are left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>All one can get by ‘problem-solving’ is damage containment. Only
opportunities produce results and growth. And opportunities are actually
every bit as difficult and demanding as problems are. First draw up a
list of the opportunities facing the business and make sure that each is
adequately staffed (and adequately supported). Only then should you draw
up a list of the problems and worry about staffing them.</p>
<p>I suspect that Sears has been doing the opposite – starving the
opportunities and feeding the problems – in its retail business these
past few years. This is also, I suspect, what is being done by the major
European companies that have steadily been losing ground on the world
market (e.g. Siemens in Germany). The right thing to do has been
demonstrated by GE, with its policy to get rid of all businesses – even
profitable ones – that do not offer long-range growth and the
opportunity for the company to be number one or number two worldwide.
And then GE places its best-performing people in the opportunity
businesses, and pushes and pushes.</p>
<p>Everything I have been saying in this article has been known for
generations. Everything has been amply proved by decades of experience.
There is thus no excuse for managements to indulge in the five deadly
sins. They are temptations that must be resisted.</p>
