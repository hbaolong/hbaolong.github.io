<h4 id="trade-lessons-from-the-world-economy">13. Trade lessons from the
world economy</h4>
<p>There are opinions galore about international trade policy,
especially for the United States. All are argued with passion but rarely
with much evidence. The world economy has actually been growing faster
for forty years than at any time since the eighteenth-century
‘Commercial Revolution’, which created both the first modern economies
and the discipline of economics. And though all developed economics have
been stagnant and in recession these last few years, the world economy
is still expanding at a good clip. But no one asks, What are the facts?
What do they teach us? What are the lessons, above all, for domestic
economic policy?</p>
<p>There are important lessons in four areas: the structure of the world
economy; the changed meaning of trade and investment; the relationship
between world economy and domestic economy; and trade policy. In each of
these areas the lessons are quite different from what practically
everybody believes and asserts, whether ‘free trader’, ‘managed trader’,
or protectionist’.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Twenty years ago no one talked of the world economy’. The term then
was ‘international trade’. The change in term – and everybody now talks
of the world economy – bespeaks a profound change in economic reality.
Twenty or thirty years ago the economy outside the borders of a nation –
and especially outside the borders of a middle-sized or large nation –
could still be seen as different, as separate, as something that could
be safely ignored in dealing with the domestic economy and in domestic
economic policy. That, as the evidence makes unambiguously clear, is
sheer delusion today – but it is still very much the basic position of
economists, of politicians, and of the public at large, especially in
the United States.</p>
<p>The ‘international economy’ traditionally had two parts: foreign
trade and foreign investment. The world economy also has two parts – but
they are different from those of international trade. The first part
consists of flows of money and information; the second, trade and
investment, rapidly merging into one transaction, and actually only
different dimensions of the same phenomenon, namely, the new integrating
force of the world economy, cross-border alliances. While both of these
segments are growing fast, money and information flows are growing the
fastest. They deserve to be looked at first.</p>
<p>The centre of world money flows, the London Interbank market, handles
more money in one day than would be needed in many months – perhaps an
entire year – to finance the ‘real economy’ of international trade and
international investment. Similarly, the trades during one day on the
main currency markets – London, New York, Zurich, and Tokyo – exceed by
several orders of magnitude what would be needed to finance the
international transactions of the real economy.</p>
<p>The information flows – conferences, meetings, and seminars;
telecommunications, whether by telephone, teleconference, fax,
electronic mail; computer transmissions; software; magazines and books;
films and videos; and many other communications by new (and largely
electronic) technologies – may already exceed money flows in the fees,
royalties, and profits they generate. They are also probably growing
faster than any category of transactions ever grew before in economic
history.</p>
<p>Transnational money flows can be seen as the successor to what
bankers call ‘portfolio investments’, that is, investments made for the
sake of (usually short-term) financial income such as dividends or
interest. But today’s money flows are not only vastly larger than
portfolio investments ever were, they are almost totally autonomous and
uncontrollable by any national agency or in large measure by any
national policy. Above all, their economic impact is different. The
money flows of traditional portfolio investment were the stabilizers of
the international economy. They flowed from countries of low short-term
returns – low because of low interest rates, overvalued stock prices, or
overvalued currency – into countries of higher short-term returns, thus
restoring equilibrium. And they reacted to a country’s financial policy
or economic condition. Today’s world money flows have become the great
destabilizers. They force a country into ‘crash’ programmes – into
raising interest rates to astronomical levels, for instance, which
throttle business activity, or into devaluing a currency overnight way
below its trade parity or its purchasing-power parity – thus generating
inflationary pressures. And today’s money flows are not driven, by and
large, by the expectation of greater income but by the expectation of
immediate speculative profits. They are a pathological phenomenon
bespeaking the fact that neither fixed foreign-exchange rates nor
flexible foreign-exchange rates really work, though they are the only
two known systems so far. Because money flows are a symptom, it is
futile for governments to try to restrict them, for instance by taxing
money-flow profits; the trading just moves elsewhere. They are a fever,
to be sure; but they are not the disease. All that can be done – and it
needs to be included in the specifications for an effective trade policy
– is to build resistance into the economy against the impacts of money
flows.</p>
<p>In contrast to money flows, the economic impacts of information flows
are benign. Few things, in fact, so stimulate economic growth as rapid
development of information, whether telecommunications, computer data,
computer networks, or access (however distorted) to the outside world
provided by the entertainment media. In the United States, information
flows and the goods needed to carry them have become the largest single
source of foreign-currency income. But just as we do not view the
medieval cathedral as an economic phenomenon – although it was for
several centuries Europe’s biggest economic activity next to farming,
and its biggest non-military employer – information flows are primarily
a social phenomenon. Their impacts are primarily cultural and social.
Economic factors, such as high costs, are a restraint on information
flows rather than motivators. Yet information flows are an increasingly
dominant factor in the world economy.</p>
<p>The first lesson of the world economy is thus that the two most
significant phenomena – money flows and information flows – do not fit
into any theory. or policy we have. They are not even ‘transnational’;
they are outside altogether, and ‘non-national’.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>For practically everybody, international trade means merchandise
trade, that is, imports and exports of manufactured goods, farm
products, and raw materials such as petroleum, iron ore, copper, and
timber. And merchandise trade is what the newspaper reports on every
month. But increasingly, international trade is services trade – little
reported and largely unnoticed. But even merchandise trade is no longer
what practically everybody, including economists and policy makers,
assumes it to be. Increasingly it is not a ‘transaction’ that is a sale
or a purchase of individual goods. Increasingly it is a ‘relationship’ –
either structural trade or institutional trade – in which the individual
transaction is only a ‘shipment’ and an accounting entry. And both
services trade and relationship trade behave differently from
transactional merchandise trade.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, the United States has a large and intractable
trade deficit. Actually, though, US trade is more or less in balance and
may yield a small surplus. The trade deficit that is daily bewailed by
US newspapers, our business executives and economists, our government
officials, and our politicians is a deficit in merchandise trade (caused
primarily by (1) an appalling waste of petroleum in the United States
(2) the steady decline in both the volume of and the world market prices
for US farm exports). The United States has, however, a very large
surplus in services trade. It is being generated by financial services
and retailing; by higher education and Hollywood; by tourism; by
hospital companies; by royalties on books, software, and videos; by
consulting firms; by fees and royalties on technology; and by a host of
other businesses and professions. According to the official figures –
published only every three months and then in a little-read government
bulletin – the US services surplus amounts to two-thirds of the
merchandise trade deficit. But as is acknowledged even by the government
statisticians who collect the figures, US services exports are grossly
underreported. They may be some 50 per cent higher than the official
statistics tell us – and services exports are still growing fast.</p>
<p>The United States has the largest single share of the world’s
services trade followed by the United Kingdom, with Japan at the bottom
of the list among developed countries. But in every developed country,
services trade is growing as fast as merchandise trade, and probably a
good deal faster. Within ten years it may equal, if not exceed,
merchandise trade, at least for highly advanced countries.</p>
<p>Only one major component of services trade is at all susceptible to
the ‘factors’ that govern international trade according to trade theory
and trade policy: tourism. It responds immediately to foreign-exchange
fluctuations and, sluggishly, to changes in labour costs. The rest –
some two-thirds or more – is impervious to such changes. Most services
trade involves exporting and importing knowledge.</p>
<p>More and more merchandise trade is, however, also becoming impervious
to short-term (and even to long-term) changes in the traditional
economic factors. In structural trade the decision regarding where
manufacturing will be done is being made when the product is first
designed. For a new car model, such major parts as engines,
transmissions, electronics, and body panels will be produced by plants –
some owned by the car manufacturer, many more by suppliers – in a dozen
different countries, such as the United States, Mexico, Canada, Belgium,
Japan, and Germany. Final assembly will also be done in plants located
in four or five countries. And until the model is redesigned in ten
years, the plants and the countries specified in the original design are
‘locked in’. There will be change only in the event of a major
catastrophe, such as war or a fire which destroys a plant.</p>
<p>The big Irish plant of the Swiss pharmaceuticals company equally does
not ‘sell’. It ships chemical intermediates to the company’s
finished-product plants in nineteen countries on both sides of the
Atlantic, charging a ‘transfer price’ that is pure accounting convention
and has as much to do with taxes as with production costs. Markets and
knowledge are very important in structural-trade decisions; labour
costs, capital costs, and foreign-exchange rates are restraints rather
than determinants.</p>
<p>But there is also ‘institutional’ trade. When a manufacturer builds a
new plant or when a discounter opens a store, it will, nine times out of
ten, use for it the machines, tools, equipment, and supplies it has been
working with in its existing facilities, is familiar with, and knows it
can rely on. It will buy them from the firms that supply its existing
plants or stores. This holds true whether the new plant or the new store
are in the firm’s home country or abroad. It holds true whether the
company is an American one building a plant in Spain, a German one
building a superstore in the United States, or a Japanese one acquiring
and re-equipping a plant in Shanghai. And as in structural trade the
traditional ‘factors of production’ are largely irrelevant to it.</p>
<p>But that institutional trade, and structural trade as well, do not
behave according to the accepted rules is far less important than that
neither is ‘foreign trade’ – except legally – even when it is trade
across national boundary lines. To the individual business, it makes
absolutely no difference whether the stuff comes from its own home
country or whether it comes from a plant or supplier in what is legally
a foreign country. This is increasingly as true for shipments from
outside suppliers as for intracompany shipments. For the individual
business – the car manufacturer, the pharmaceuticals company, the
discount retailer – these are transactions within its own ‘system’.</p>
<p>Both structural and institutional trade have grown explosively these
last thirty years as business after business has gone multinational. We
have no reliable figures. Estimates range from one-third of total US
merchandise trade (probably an understatement) to two-thirds (almost
certainly too high). Whenever I have been able to get the figures, I
have found structural and institutional trade to be 40–50 per cent of a
company’s total export and import volume – for big companies and
mid-sized ones alike. Traditional transactional merchandise trade is
still larger, I am sure. But the relationship trade is growing faster.
Traditional transactional merchandise trade may be no more than a third
of a developed country’s trade by now. Two-thirds are either services
trade or relationship-based merchandise trade – both behaving quite
differently.</p>
<p>Similarly, ‘investment’ – the other area in the traditional model of
the international economy – is now becoming something markedly
different. Portfolio investment, as has been discussed, has mutated into
money flows, which aren’t investment at all. But now ‘direct investment’
– investment abroad to start a new business or to acquire an existing
one – is also beginning to change, and fast. For a long time in the
post-war years, direct investment seemed impervious to change. The
multinational of 1970 – the carrier of direct investment – looked little
different from the multinational of 1913 controlled as much of the
world’s manufacturing as multinationals now control and far more of its
banking and insurance). Traditional direct investment is still growing;
in fact, since the mid-1980s, direct investment in the United States –
by Europeans, Japanese, Canadians, Mexicans – has grown explosively. But
the action is rapidly shifting to ‘alliances’: joint ventures,
partnerships, knowledge agreements, ‘outsourcing’. And in alliances,
investment is secondary, if there is any at all.</p>
<p>One example is the recent alliance between American-based Intel, the
leading-edge microchip designer, and Sharp, a major Japanese electronics
manufacturer. Intel will share with the Japanese the design of a very
advanced microchip; the Japanese in turn will make the chip and share
the product with Intel. One contributes technical competence, the other
one production competence.</p>
<p>There are alliances between scores of university research labs and
businesses – pharmaceuticals firms, electronics firms, engineering
firms, computer firms, and food processors. There are alliances in which
organizations outsource support activities: a great many American
hospitals now let outside independent suppliers do their maintenance,
housekeeping, billing, collections, and data processing and increasingly
let them run the labs, physical therapy, and the diagnostic centres. And
so, increasingly, do hospitals in the United Kingdom and in Japan.
Computer makers now outsource the data processing for their own business
to contractors like Electronic Data Systems, the company Ross Perot
built and sold to General Motors. The same computer manufacturers are
everywhere entering alliances with small, independent software
designers. Commercial banks are entering alliances with producers and
managers of mutual funds. And small and medium-sized colleges are
entering alliances with one another to do the paperwork jointly.</p>
<p>In some of these alliances there is substantial capital investment,
as was the case in the 1960s and 1970s joint ventures between Japanese
and American companies entered into to produce in Japan and for the
Japanese market American-designed goods. But even then the basis of the
alliance was not capital but complementary knowledge: technical and
manufacturing knowledge supplied by the Americans, marketing knowledge
and management supplied by the Japanese. Increasingly, whatever
investment there is is symbolical rather than substantial – a small
minority share in each other’s business to signify the bond between the
partners. In more and more alliances there is no financial relationship
at all between the partners – there is apparently none between Intel and
Sharp. And there has never been any investment relationship in the
oldest and most successful alliances around, the ones forged by the
English retailer Marks andandandand Spencer in the early 1930s with a
host of manufacturers of textiles, clothing, and footwear (and later
with manufacturers of speciality foods as well) – alliances that the
Japanese copied after 1950 for their keiretsu. Marks andandandand
Spencer and the manufacturer in these alliances jointly develop the
products, with Marks andandandand Spencer committed to buying them from
only that one manufacturer.</p>
<p>How many such alliances exist now nobody knows. In some cases they
are not even embodied in a contract but are quite informal.
Increasingly, however, alliances are becoming the dominant form of
economic integration in the world economy. Some major companies –
Toshiba, the Japanese electronics giant, or Corning Glass, the world’s
leading maker of high-engineered glass – may each have more than a
hundred alliances all over the world. Integration in the European Union
is proceeding far more through alliances than through mergers and
acquisitions, especially among the middle-sized companies that dominate
most European economies. As in structural and institutional trade,
businesses make little distinction between domestic and foreign partners
in their alliances. An alliance creates a systems relationship, a family
relationship in which it does not matter that one partner speaks
Japanese, another English, and the third German or Finnish. And while
alliances increasingly generate both trade and investment, they are
based on neither. They pool knowledge.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Economic theory and economic policy know that developing economies
are greatly affected by their relationship to the world economy.
Economists talk of ‘export-led development’ and ‘foreign-investment-led
development’. But for developed countries, and especially for
middle-sized and large developed countries, economic theory and economic
policy postulate that the domestic economy alone matters. The autonomy
of the domestic economy and its position as the locus of policy making
is an axiom for economists, policy makers, and the public at large.</p>
<p>But as the preceding discussion should have made clear, the
distinction between domestic and international economy has ceased to be
economic reality – however much it remains political, social, cultural,
and psychological reality. The one unambiguous lesson of the last forty
years is that increased participation in the world economy has become
the key to domestic economic growth and prosperity. There is a
one-to-one correlation between a country’s domestic economic performance
in the forty years since 1950 and its participation in the world
economy. The two major countries that have grown the fastest in the
world economy, Japan and South Korea, are also the two countries in
which the domestic economy has grown the fastest. The same correlation
applies to the two European countries that have done best in the world
economy in the last forty years: West Germany and Sweden. The countries
that have retreated in the world economy – notably the United Kingdom –
are also the countries that have done consistently worst domestically.
In the two major countries that have maintained their participation rate
in the world economy within a fairly narrow range – the United States
and France – the domestic economy has put in an average performance,
neither doing exceptionally well nor suffering persistent malaise and
crisis like the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The same correlation holds true for major segments within a developed
economy. In the United States, for instance, services have tremendously
increased their world-economy participation in the last fifteen years –
finance is one example, higher education and information are others.
These are also the segments that have grown the most in the domestic
economy. In manufacturing, the industries that have significantly
increased their world-market participation – through exports, through
investments abroad, through alliances – for example telecommunications,
pharmaceuticals, software, films, are also the industries that have
grown the most in the domestic market. American agriculture, which has
consistently shrunk in terms of world-economy participation, has been in
continual depression and crisis, masked only by ever-growing
subsidies.</p>
<p>Conversely, there is no correlation at all between domestic economic
performance and policies to stimulate the domestic economy. It is easy,
the record shows, for a government to do harm to its domestic economy.
All it has to do is to drive up the inflation rate – examples are the
damage Lyndon Johnson’s inflationary policies did to the US economy
(which has not yet fully recovered twenty-five years later) and the
damage which consistently pro-inflationary policies have done to the
economy of Italy. But there is not the slightest evidence that any
government policy to stimulate the economy has impact, whether that
policy be Keynesian, monetarist, supply-side or neoclassic. Contrary to
what economists confidently promised forty years ago, business cycles
have not been abolished. They still operate pretty much the way they
have been operating for the past 150 years. No country has so far been
able to escape them. But whenever in a business downturn a government
policy to stimulate the economy actually coincided with cyclical
recovery (as has happened only very, very rarely), it was by pure
coincidence. No one policy shows more such coincidences than any other.
And no policy that worked in a given country in recession A showed any
results whatever when tried again in the same country in recession B or
recession C. The evidence not only suggests that government policies to
stimulate the economy short term are ineffectual, it suggests something
far more surprising: they are largely irrelevant. Government, the
evidence shows clearly, cannot control the ‘economic weather’.</p>
<p>But the one-to-one correlation between domestic economy and
participation in the world economy – over long periods and over a wide
range of different phenomena, including widely different economies with
different structures, different fiscal and tax policies, and even
different forms of participation in the world economy – shows
convincingly that participation in the world economy has become the
controlling factor in the domestic economy of a developed country. Two
examples: that the US economy in 1990–92 did not slip into a deep
recession (let alone a real depression), and that unemployment rates for
adults, both men and women, never became as high as they had been in
earlier post-Second World War recessions (and actually stayed low by any
historical standard), resulted entirely from the increase in
world-market participation on the part of both US manufacturing and US
services, with a sharp increase, for instance, in manufacturing exports.
And, similarly, that Japan has so far – as of the end of 1993 – not slid
into a profound recession with unemployment figures at European levels,
that is, around 8–10 per cent (hovering instead below 3 per cent), is
clearly the result of Japan’s manufacturing industry sharply increasing
its exports, and especially institutional exports to mainland Asia.</p>
<p>The world economy has thus become the engine of growth, prosperity,
and employment for every developed country. Every developed economy has
become world-economy led.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>We can now address the question; What works and what does not work in
the world economy? The debate today is largely between advocates of
‘mandated trade’, Japan-style, and conventional free traders, But both
are wrong and the evidence is crystal-clear. Mandated trade means
government picking ‘winners’ and pushing them. But not one industry
picked by MITI (the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry) has turned
out to be a real winner. MITI efforts in the 1960s and 1970s were
concentrated on aluminium, other non-ferrous metals, aircraft, and
aerospace, and none has gone anywhere. In the late 1970s and 1980s MITI
switched to high technology, sponsoring such industries as biomedicine,
pharmaceuticals, mainframe computers, telecommunications – but also
international brokerage and international commercial banking – again
without great success in the world markets. The Japanese industries
which have become the world-beaters either have been bitterly opposed by
MITI, as were Sony in its early days and the car industry well into the
1970s, or have been ignored by MITI until after they had succeeded by
their own efforts. The Japanese policy to create consortia in which
major companies work together to produce new technology – for example,
in supercomputers or biogenetics – has had only very limited
results.</p>
<p>The reasons are clear, at least in hindsight. First, picking winners
requires a fortune teller. MITI picked – and had to pick – what was
successful at the time in the then more advanced countries, especially
the United States. It did not pick – and could not have picked – what
would be successful in an unknown future. Thus MITI pushed mainframe
computers in the early 1970s, just before the totally unexpected debut
of the PC, that is, just before the mainframe plateaued. Second, MITI
picked what had been successful in other countries. But that means it
picked industries that fit other countries’ competencies. It did not
pick – and could not have picked – what turned out to fit Japan’s
competencies, e.g. the extraordinary ability to miniaturize. One reason
was that the existence of this competence was well hidden and unknown
even to the Japanese. Another reason was that no one, inside Japan or
outside, realized its importance before the advent of the microchip.
Also, the Japanese ability to downsize the large American car and to
make it small and fuel-efficient was not an asset on the US market until
the 1973 and 1979 ‘oil shocks’ made it into one. And no one could – or
would – have predicted the inability of the industry’s world leaders,
the American giants, to respond to the Japanese invasion for all of
twenty years. Finally, and most importantly, the world economy has
become far too complex for anyone to be able to outguess it or to
outanalyse it. The available data simply do not report such important
developments as the growth of services trade, the growth of structural
and institutional trade, the growth of alliances.</p>
<p>But as will be argued (and rightly), Japan has performed
outstandingly. This surely cannot be explained as the free traders try
to do – that is, it cannot be explained as really being a triumph of
conventional free trade. And we do now know what underlies it, primarily
because of a recent (1993) World Bank study entitled The East Asian
Miracle.</p>
<p>The World Bank studied eight East Asian ‘superstars’: Japan, South
Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.
The eight started at very different times, but once they got going, all
have shown similar growth in both their domestic economy and in their
international economy. Together they supplied 9 per cent of the world’s
manufactured goods exports thirty years ago. Now they supply 21 per cent
(which means a loss of 12 percentage points primarily by the United
Kingdom, The Netherlands and Belgium, the former Soviet Union, and some
countries in Latin America). Thirty years ago, two-fifths of the
population in the eight East Asian countries lived below the poverty
line; the figure is less than 5 per cent today, despite rapid population
growth in most of them. Several of them – Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
and Taiwan – are now among the world’s richest countries. Yet among the
eight there are tremendous differences in culture, history, political
systems and tax policies. They range from laissez-faire Hong Kong,
through interventionist Singapore, to statist Indonesia.</p>
<p>What all eight have in common are two economic policies. First, they
do not try to manage short-term fluctuations in the domestic economy.
They do not try to control the ‘economic weather’. In fact, in every
case, the economic miracle did not begin until the country had given up
the attempt to manage domestic short-term fluctuations. Each of the
eight countries focuses instead on creating the right ‘economic
climate’. They keep inflation low. They invest heavily in education and
training. They reward savings and investment and penalize consumption,
thus encouraging a high savings rate.</p>
<p>The second economic policy that the eight East Asian Miracles have in
common is that they put performance in the world economy ahead of the
domestic economy. In their decisions the first question is always: how
will this affect the competitiveness of our industry and its performance
in the world economy? It is not: How will this affect domestic economy
and domestic employment? – which is the question that most Western
countries focus on, especially the United States and the United Kingdom.
And then the eight actively foster, encourage, promote, their successes
in the world economy. Though MITI did not anticipate Japan’s successes,
the whole Japanese system is geared to taking a world-market success and
running with it – by offering substantial tax benefits to exporters; by
making credit readily available for international trade and
international investment (where it has been scarce and expensive for
domestic business); by deliberately keeping high prices and profits on a
protected domestic market to generate cash for investments abroad and
for penetrating foreign markets (the popular belief in the ‘low’ profit
margins of Japanese companies being pure myth); by reserving special
recognition (e.g. the prestigious and highly coveted membership in the
executive committee of Keidanren, Japan’s top industrial organization)
to the heads of companies that have done particularly well in the world
economy; and so on. Each of the eight countries of the East Asian
Miracle does things in its own and different way. But all of them follow
the same two basic policies: first, provide the right economic climate
at home through stressing the fundamentals of monetary stability, an
educated and trained workforce, and a high savings rate; and second,
make performance in the world economy the first priority of economic and
business policy.</p>
<p>Exactly the same lessons are being taught by the examples of the two
countries in the West that – until very recently – showed similar
growth: West Germany and Sweden. These two countries also have very
different domestic policies. But both first created and maintained an
economic growth climate, and through the same measures: control of
inflation; high investment in education and training; and a high savings
rate obtained by high taxes on consumption and fairly low taxes on
savings and investment. And they both have systematically given priority
to the world economy in governmental and business decisions. In both
countries, the first question asked is always: How will this affect our
world-market standing, our world-market competitiveness, our
world-market performance? And the moment these countries forgot this –
when the trade unions a few years back subordinated Germany’s
competitive standing to their wage demands, and the Swedes subordinated
their industry’s competitive standing to ever-larger welfare spending –
the domestic economy of both countries went into stagnation right
away.</p>
<p>And one reason why creating the right climate is so important is that
it stands as the one and only way to build into a domestic economy
resistance to money flows and their shocks.</p>
<p>The last forty years of the world economy yield another lesson as to
what works: investment abroad does not ‘export jobs’. Instead, it
creates jobs at home. We should have learned this from the US
performance in the 1960s. When the American-based multinationals
expanded investments rapidly, in Europe, in South America, in Japan, the
domestic economy created jobs at a fast rate. And when in the 1980s
American multinationals resumed heavy foreign investment – particularly
in Europe – domestic employment again expanded fast. The same is true
for Japan, where, as has been said earlier, the jobs created by the
rapidly expanding investment in East Asia – with very heavy investment
in plants that produce goods for the Japanese home market – has not
destroyed jobs but has saved them in large numbers. It was equally true
for Sweden, which, of all industrialized countries, had gone the
furthest in investing abroad in manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>The reason is, of course, the institutional trade generated by such
investment. In manufacturing – and in a good many services, such as
retailing – investment per worker in the machinery, the tools, and the
equipment of a new facility is three to five times annual production.
The employment generated by the institutional trade to get the new
facility into production is thus substantially larger for several years
to come than the annual output and the annual employment of the new
facility. Most of this institutional trade comes from the home country
of the investor; and most of it is produced by high-wage labour.
‘Exporting jobs’ will thus actually create – at least for the medium
term – several jobs in the home country for every one it ‘exports’. This
explains why the Ford Motor Company, which has aggressively built in
Mexico since that country opened itself to foreign investment five or
six years ago, is the one US car company which has added jobs at home.
It explains why the two Mexican manufacturers – a cement maker and a
glass maker – that have aggressively built and bought plants in the
United States are among the few major Mexican manufacturers who have
added jobs in Mexico these last few years. So far, however, only the
Japanese seem to understand this. Ten years ago they were panicky about
‘hollowing out industry’, that is, about exporting to mainland Asia
labour-intensive work (for example, in consumer electronics) to supply
the Japanese home market. Today the export of high-value machinery and
tools to these Japanese-owned plants on the Asian mainland, that is,
institutional trade, has become the biggest contributor to Japan’s
export surplus and the mainstay of Japan’s engineering and high-tech
employment.</p>
<p>The last forty years also teach that protection rarely protects. In
fact the evidence shows quite clearly that protection in a good many
cases hastens the decline of the industry it is intended to protect.</p>
<p>Every developed country massively protects agriculture. But in the
United States some farm products, such as soy beans, fruits, beef, and
poultry, are either not subsidized at all or are very much less
subsidized than the ‘traditional’ crops, such as corn, cotton, and
wheat. These less-protected products have done a good deal better on the
world market – despite intense competition – than have the heavily
protected ones. Farm population in all developed countries has declined
steeply since the Second World War. But it has declined the most steeply
in the two countries in which agriculture is most highly protected
and/or subsidized: France and Japan. It is equally indicative that the
decline in US market share of the American car industry dramatically
speeded up as soon as it became highly protected in 1980, when the US
government forced the Japanese into ‘voluntary export restraints’. That
protection breeds complacency, inefficiency, cartels has been known
since well before Adam Smith. But the counterargument has always been
that it protects jobs. The evidence of the last forty years strongly
suggests that it does not even do that. At least it did not do so in
agriculture in any developed country. It did not do so in the US car
industry nor, as the last few years indicate, in the European car
industry either. It equally did not protect jobs in the US steel
industry or in the steel industries of Europe or Japan. Protection no
longer protects jobs; it is more likely to hasten their demise.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>What the last forty years teach is that free trade is not enough. We
have to go beyond it.</p>
<p>The world economy has become too important for a country not to have
a world-economy policy. Managed trade is delusion of grandeur,
Protectionism can only do harm. But not to be protectionist is not
enough. What is needed is a deliberate and active, indeed an aggressive,
policy that gives the external economy, its demands, its opportunities,
its dynamics, priority over domestic-policy demands and problems. For
the United States (and for a country like France – as well as most of
Latin America), this would mean a radical reversal of decades of
traditional policy – it would mean abandoning, in large measure,
economic policies that have governed American thinking and American
economics ever since 1933, and certainly since 1945. We still see
world-economy demands and world-economy opportunities as
‘externalities’. We usually do not even ask: Will this domestic decision
hurt American participation, American competitiveness, and American
standing in the world economy? Yet what we really need to ask is: Will
this domestic move advance, strengthen, promote American participation
in the world economy and American competitiveness? The answer to this
question then determines what are the right domestic economic policy
decisions and domestic business decisions. This, the lessons of the last
forty years teach us, is the only economic policy that can work. It is
also – as the last forty years unambiguously teach – the only policy
that can rapidly revive a domestic economy mired in turbulence and
chronic recession.</p>
