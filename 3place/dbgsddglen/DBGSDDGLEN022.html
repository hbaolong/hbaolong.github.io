<h4 id="the-new-superpower-the-overseas-chinese">20 The new superpower
the overseas Chinese</h4>
<p>Newspapers and magazines in the United States, in Europe, and in
Japan are full of stories about the new billionaires: the handful of
overseas Chinese who have built huge multinationals, headquartered
mostly in Hong Kong, Taipei, or Singapore, but also in Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia. Actually, these ‘tycoons’, though highly
visible and individually super-rich, are only the small tip of an
enormous iceberg. Largely invisible – and carefully shunning publicity –
are a great many more multinationals owned by overseas Chinese. Most are
mid-size; typically their sales worldwide run to several hundred million
dollars. Collectively, however, they are far larger than all the tycoons
together.</p>
<p>One example is the 00 million group built by an ethnic Chinese whose
grandfather had come to the Philippines as a labourer during the First
World War. The group comprises sixteen small manufacturing plants around
the world. Each plant turns out only a few highly engineered products,
usually for only one customer or two. Four plants, for instance – two in
the United States, one each in Japan and the United Kingdom – make small
but critical parts for workstations. Three plants – one each in
Indonesia, the United States, and the United Kingdom – manufacture
precision parts for the world’s two leading sewing-machine makers,
America’s Singer and Germany’s Pfaff, now both owned by another overseas
Chinese group. And so on. Every plant is separately incorporated as a
legally independent company with its ownership registered in the name of
its local manager. Each manager is a citizen of his country, though all
are of Chinese descent. But these ostensibly independent managers are
kept on a very tight leash. Actual ownership is 100 per cent in the
hands of the founder in Manila. And each plant reports in great detail
and at least twice a week to the group’s chief operating officer, who
just moved himself and the group’s top staff from Manila to
Honolulu.</p>
<p>How many such groups there are, no one knows. They are privately
owned, publish no figures or annual reports, and are secretive to a
fault. In Taiwan, where many of them have their lawyers, the best
estimate is that there are at least a thousand. How big the overseas
Chinese economy is, is not known either. An often-heard guess – over
trillion in investments outside their own home territories – is wildly
improbable. It would make the overseas Chinese foreign investments
larger than those of the United States! But even 00 billion would mean
foreign investments by the overseas Chinese roughly equal to those of
the Japanese. The overseas Chinese are certainly the largest investors
in mainland China. They have put in more money than either the Americans
or the Japanese – more even than the Chinese government has invested
this last decade in its own economy. They are thus the driving force
behind the explosive economic growth of coastal China. And, with the
sole exception of South Korea (which, by and large, is closed to them),
they also lead the economies of the other fast-growing countries of
Southeast Asia: not only the three islands with a solidly Chinese
population – that is, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore – but also
Malaysia (where ethnic Chinese are 30 per cent of the population),
Thailand (10 per cent ethnic Chinese), Indonesia (2 per cent ethnic
Chinese), and the Philippines (1 per cent ethnic Chinese). And they are
branching out to wherever there are even small populations of ethnic
Chinese, to the United States and Canada, to Australia and to Europe.
The overseas Chinese have become the new economic superpower.</p>
<p>Outwardly, the new multinational groups of the overseas Chinese look
exactly like other businesses. They are, for instance, incorporated as
companies, with a board and with corporate officers. But they function
in a drastically different way from anything else in the world economy.
The best way to describe them is perhaps as a clan doing business
together. Each plant manager in the Manila group is related to the
founder – and to each other – by blood or marriage, if only distantly.
‘We wouldn’t dream of going into a new business,’ said the COO to me,
‘if we did not have a relative available to run it.’ This COO is himself
not an ethnic Chinese but a Dutchman – he used to run one of Phillips’s
big Asian plants. But he is married to the founder’s niece. And, as he
told me, when he joined the group, the founder said to him, ‘I don’t
care how many concubines or mistresses you have. But on the day on which
my niece and you separate or file for divorce, you can look for another
job.’ The word of the founder-CEO is law. But his authority far more
resembles that of a Confucian head of the house (or that of a Scottish
Highland chieftain of yore) than that of the head of a business. He is
expected to base his decisions on the best interests of the clan and to
manage so as to guarantee the clan’s survival and prosperity. What holds
together the multinationals of the overseas Chinese is neither ownership
nor legal contract. It is mutual trust and the mutual obligations
inherent in clan membership.</p>
<p>This structure has deep roots in Chinese culture and history,
reaching back two millennia. It was the only way merchants could survive
in a country that knew no civil law (it still doesn’t) and in which
there was (and still is) no appeal against a local mandarin who could be
arbitrary, was often corrupt, and was usually contemptuous of ‘trade’.
Survival thus depended on the ability to shift one’s money and one’s
business overnight to a distant cousin, without contract or anything in
writing. The one sanction in this system – and an effective one – is
then disgrace and ostracism by the entire business community for anyone
who betrays this trust.</p>
<p>There is tremendous strength to this tradition. It explains in large
measure why the groups of the overseas Chinese could grow so fast. If
there is a qualified clan member available in a certain country or a
certain industry, the group can often get him to join by appealing to
his clan spirit. Thus, unlike the Japanese company, the group does not
have to wait until it has grown its own managers from scratch in order
to expand. And unlike the typical Western company, there is little
internal resistance against bringing into a senior position someone from
the outside; he is, after all, ‘family’. ‘Ten of our sixteen plant
managers,’ the COO of the Manila group told me, ‘worked for Western
companies but were willing to join the clan business.’ And since it is
accepted that the group has to be run to perpetuate the clan and its
prosperity, the lazy or incompetent family member can usually be kept
out of a top job and even out of the business altogether. The founder
and CEO of the Manila-based group wanted his two sons to succeed him.
But the clan members running the plants made it clear that they would
not accept the sons. They persuaded the founder instead to make their
choice, the Dutch COO, the heir-designate. ‘My money,’ I was told in
Malaysia by the head of another overseas Chinese group, ‘I can leave to
whomever I pick; my power has to be left to whomever my associates
trust.’ The Japanese, it has often been said, owe their success to their
ability to run the modern corporation as a family. The overseas Chinese
owe their success to their ability to run their family as a modern
corporation.</p>
<p>But with all its strengths, the overseas-Chinese multinational will
have to change quite a bit in the next decade; indeed, wherever I went
on a recent South-east Asian trip, the discussion centred on the need
for drastic changes. For one, the founders who still run the groups are,
in the majority of cases, getting old. The head of the Manila-based
group, for instance, is seventy-three. The successors to the founders
have grown up in a very different world; many are Western-educated, for
example. ‘Our next CEO,’ the number-two man in a Taiwan-based (and
fast-growing) multinational told me, ‘cannot be a Confucian “head of
house“ or “elder brother“; he’ll have to be a team builder and a team
leader – that’s what we learned as graduate students in the US.’ But
also for the overseas-Chinese multinational to grow, and especially for
it to grow in mainland China, it will have to go into joint ventures of
all kinds with foreigners – Westerners and Japanese – to whom the
Chinese tradition is totally alien. Only foreigners – Americans,
Japanese, Europeans – have the technology to build, for instance, the
trains that China desperately needs. But Chinese-speaking businesses,
that is, overseas Chinese, will be needed to maintain and service those
trains. And joint ventures, as the younger overseas Chinese fully
realize, mean written business plans and clear contractual arrangements
– things the Chinese tradition abhors. It also means something even more
abhorrent: sharing information. But above all, the overseas-Chinese
multinational cannot grow unless it learns to bring in ‘strangers’, that
is, Chinese from outside the clan. If you need a metallurgist or a
computer specialist, what matters is the person’s competence, not his
membership in the clan. And that person will expect to be treated as an
equal; if he’s not treated so, he will leave. Wherever I went in
South-east Asia, how to treat the stranger was the first topic raised
and the one that provoked the most heated controversy. ‘To maintain clan
cohesion we cannot possibly treat as an equal a Chinese who is not a
clan member,’ everybody said. ‘Yet to grow the business, we have
to.’</p>
<p>And then there is, of course, the grave uncertainty of mainland
China’s future. Only a few, largely Hong Kong-based groups have all
their eggs in the Chinese basket. There are even a few groups – in
Singapore mostly, but also in Malaysia and Indonesia – that have kept
out of mainland China altogether. But all overseas Chinese know that
their future heavily depends on how China does; and in countries in
which they are a (greatly envied) minority, namely, in Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, the Chinese also know that
even their economic survival may depend on China’s health and strength.
And I did not meet a single overseas Chinese who expected anything but a
decade of surprises and turbulence for mainland China.</p>
<p>Yet every single one of the younger overseas Chinese – the people who
are now taking over the day-to-day management of their multinationals –
was confident that his group could successfully solve its problems and
yet maintain its basic Chinese character. They will change details, but
they won’t change the fundamentals any more than the Japanese changed
theirs when they modernized,’ said a Taipei lawyer who is the confidant
of a large number of overseas-Chinese business leaders. ‘And it will
work!’</p>
<p>Will The Secrets of Chinese Management be the title of the management
best-seller of the year 2005?</p>
