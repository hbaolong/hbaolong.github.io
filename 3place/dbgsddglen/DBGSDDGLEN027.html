<h4 id="can-the-democracies-win-the-peace">25. Can the democracies win
the peace?</h4>
<p>Communism has lost the cold war. Now the democracies have to win the
peace. That may be harder, as all history teaches. For forty years now
it was enough that the democracies were infinitely – and visibly –
better. Now they are expected to be good. They are being measured now
against their own professions and their own performance. Now the
democracies have to rethink and to reform.</p>
<p>Specifically, to win the peace, the democracies have:</p>
<p>• To regain control of their domestic, economic, and fiscal policies,
both lost as a result of the bankruptcy of the Keynesian Deficit
State</p>
<p>• To stop and reverse the corrosion and spreading decay of domestic
society caused by the failure of the welfare state</p>
<p>• To promote worldwide civil society without which there can be
neither political nor social stability, least of all in the former
Communist countries. For we now know that the free market, however
effective economically, does not by itself alone build and sustain a
functioning society.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of the Keynesian welfare state</p>
<p>For forty years the domestic policies of the developed countries have
been dominated by two sets of beliefs, each considered self-evident:</p>
<p>• One is the Keynesian (or neo-Keynesian) belief in the ‘Deficit
State’. It rested on three economic assertions. Consumption
automatically creates capital formation and capital investment (the
Keynesian ‘multiplier’). Savings are dangerous to economic health
(Keynes’ ‘over-saving’). Government deficits stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>• The other set, the belief in the welfare state, rested on two
social assertions. Government can and should redistribute income so as
to promote greater income equality – an assertion which when first
pronounced as government policy (by David Lloyd George when he became
England’s Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal Cabinet of 1908),
was considered the most radical of heresies but which became orthodoxy
in the Great Depression. The second assertion: the only thing the poor
need is money – what might be called the Social Worker’s creed.</p>
<p>Both beliefs have been decisively disproven.</p>
<p>In the West all Democracies came to accept these beliefs – though
West Germany accepted the Keynesian propositions only with great
reservations. Japan – with its habitual preference for ambiguity in
policies – never completely accepted nor completely rejected these
beliefs and followed their prescriptions only intermittently.</p>
<p>Originally the two beliefs were opposed to each other. Keynes was
outspoken in his contempt for the welfare state. He claimed that his
economics would make unnecessary large-scale social spending. And he
considered futile any governmental attempt to redistribute income. The
proponents of the welfare theorem in turn had little use for the free
market in which Keynes passionately believed. After the Second World War
the two found, however, that they needed each other. Keynes’ putting
consumption over thrift and his advocacy of deficits, converted
‘charity’ into ‘economic stimulus’ and thereby enabled the middle class
to accept welfare spending on the poor. In turn, Keynesian economics,
despite their middle-class and free-market bias, needed the political
support of Progressives and Socialists. And so the two embraced each
other, thus forming the Keynesian welfare state.</p>
<p>The Keynesian welfare state has ruled for forty years. Whatever
differences there have been in the democracies on economic and fiscal
policies – between Republicans and Democrats in the United States,
between Tories and Labour in the United Kingdom, between Christians and
Socialists in West Germany – were mainly differences in degree. Reagan’s
‘supply siders’ fully subscribed to the basic tenets of the Keynesian
welfare state for all their being considered arch-conservatives. Each
side, the Right as well as the Left, boasted that it was better at
building and running the Keynesian welfare state – which, by the way,
largely explains why government deficits grew the fastest under
supposedly Conservative governments, e.g. under Reagan in the United
States, under Thatcher in the United Kingdom, under Kohl in Germany.</p>
<p>There was actually never any evidence to support the Keynesian
propositions – as was pointed out by such eminent economists as Lionel
Robbins in England and Joseph Schumpeter in America when Keynes first
published his theses in the mid-1930s. By now these propositions are so
completely discredited that economists hardly mention them. Nowhere has
increased consumption led to capital formation and investment. On the
contrary, the United States and the United Kingdom which have been
pushing consumption most consistently and most thoroughly, have the
lowest rates of capital formation. In the United States it has long been
hovering around a dismal 4 per cent of disposable income. In the United
Kingdom it plunged from 8 or 9 per cent to 5 per cent of disposable
income in 1989 when Mrs Thatcher tried (unsuccessfully) to stimulate an
ailing economy by (successfully) pushing up consumption. Conversely, as
long as Japan discouraged consumption, it had a capital-formation rate
of almost 15 per cent of disposable income. But when in the mid-1980s,
Japan tried to fight a sudden recession by revving up consumption (with
disastrous results, by the way), the capital-formation rate plunged at
once to 9 per cent of disposable income, and has stayed there ever
since.</p>
<p>Oversaving has proven to be pure myth. No one believes any more
Keynes’s assertion that it had anything to do with the Great Depression,
let alone that it caused it. And far from oversaving having caused
depression in Japan – as the theory would have had it do most assuredly
– Japan’s high rate of capital formation is universally considered a key
factor in its economic success. The abundant supply of savings pushed
interest rates so low that Japanese big business could obtain capital at
almost zero cost while the Americans and the Europeans had to pay up to
15 per cent or more for their money. Japan thus had a 10 per cent cost
advantage over its world-market competitors – and even a 5 per cent cost
advantage is usually decisive.</p>
<p>There also has not been one single case of government spending
stimulating the economy, let alone one of government spending turning
around a recession or depression.</p>
<p>The one instance usually cited to the contrary, the so-called Kennedy
tax cut of 1962, is a phony. The economy did indeed recover in
1962–1963. Only there was no Kennedy tax-cut. On the contrary, the US
tax burden went up in 1962 and 1963 – in part because President Kennedy
did not get through Congress his key proposal for a cut in the
capital-gains tax, in part because states and cities raised their taxes
faster and further than the federal government lowered its take.</p>
<p>Contrary to the promises of Keynesian economics, business cycles have
not been eliminated. There is no difference either in frequency or
severity between the recessions of the period since the Second World War
(that is the period of the Keynesian welfare state) and those of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>Had there been any validity to the basic theories of the Keynesian
welfare state the democracies would be rolling in money. Government
spending would have so stimulated the economy that both capital
formation and tax revenues would have skyrocketed. In short order there
would then have been huge budget surpluses. President Reagan’s
supply-siders still promised that. Instead, the democracies – except
only Japan – are so deeply in debt that they can pay their daily bills
only if their creditors lend ever more and more money. The proper term
for this condition is insolvency.</p>
<p>The return of the panic</p>
<p>A few academic Keynesians – Robert Eisner at Northwestern University
is an example – still argue that government deficits do not matter. But
even they do not claim any more that they are beneficial. Outside of the
economics departments everybody now knows: business executives, labour
leaders, bankers, investors, the stock market, the bond market, that
damage is all that deficits can do. At the first sign of an increase in
the government deficit, stock markets drop, money flees the country and
business investment dries up, and employment with it. Above all, there
is no longer the slightest doubt that government deficits destroy
capital formation. But this then means that to pay their bills
governments which run continuous deficits cannot borrow at home to
finance themselves. They become increasingly dependent on foreign money
borrowed for shorter and shorter terms. This is extremely volatile
money, easily scared, and prone to panic.</p>
<p>Financial panics were the bane of the nineteenth century. Keynes’
claim that his economics would once and for all put an end to them was
therefore a major factor in their acceptance. But panics have returned
with a vengeance. They are as plentiful now as they ever were a century
ago, and as destructive. A three-day flight of capital in 1981
devastated France’s financial markets and threatened to turn into a run
on the banks. It forced President Mitterand to jettison all the social
promises on which he had won the election only a few months earlier. A
few years later panic forced Sweden to raise interest rates overnight to
a disastrous 30 per cent. Two years ago another panic caused by the
flight of foreign money all but destroyed the Italian lira. And only
last December panic brought on a run on Mexico’s peso, devalued it
overnight by 50 per cent, and in one fell swoop wiped out years of hard,
painful work that had raised the economy to the threshold of being
‘developed’ (or at least ‘emerging’).</p>
<p>No country that practises Keynesian welfare economics can be
considered immune from panic. Indeed, the list of countries that are on
the brink is steadily growing – in Europe the worst cases are Italy
(government deficit 9.7 per cent of disposable income; government debt
125 per cent of disposable income; rate of capital formation: zero, if
not negative); and Sweden (government deficit 10 per cent of disposable
income; government debt 100 per cent of disposable income;
capital-formation rate no more than 2 per cent). Belgium, Holland,
Spain, Denmark are not much better off; Britain and France only
marginally so – and Canada is almost as close to bankruptcy as Sweden.
The United States actually has a fairly low deficit in terms of its
disposable income – around 2 per cent, or no more than Japan. But
because its rate of capital-formation is totally inadequate, it is as
dependent on short-term money from abroad as any of the Europeans – and
thus equally vulnerable to panic. In fact the United States has already
suffered two ‘mini-panics’. The 1987 stock market crash was caused by
the Japanese panicking and dumping huge quantities of US Treasury Bonds.
And the 1993 crash of the bond market – also caused primarily by a
sudden flight of foreign capital – forced President Clinton to scuttle
his plans for stimulating the economy and to accept instead the priority
of the Federal Reserve Board (led by a Republican Chairman!) to placate
the foreign lenders, that is, to fight inflation even at the risk of
domestic slump.</p>
<p>The worst consequences of the failure of the Keynesian welfare state
are not economic. The increasing dependence on short-term and volatile
foreign money impairs the ability of governments to set and to pursue
policies. It increasingly subordinates sovereignty to the whims of an
erratic world money market, driven by rumours, and with the next ‘deal’
as its long-term horizon. One recent example: to attract and keep the
short-term money needed to finance Chancellor Kohl’s (ultra-Keynesian)
unification policy, Germany in 1993–1994 had to raise interest rates and
keep them sky-high. This severely hurt Germany’s neighbours in Europe
who were already suffering from massive unemployment. They in turn had
to push up their already high interest rates to prevent the flight of
short-term money to high-interest Germany. Throughout Europe the Germans
were berated for their ‘selfishness’. Yet they had no choice. The global
short-term money market was in control rather than the German
government. The greatest damage was probably the blow the German policy
inflicted on the support for political and currency union throughout
Europe – Dr Kohl’s own most cherished goals during his entire political
life.</p>
<p>The Keynesian welfare state also did not deliver on its social
promise to redistribute income and thereby to promote equality of
income. There is, on the contrary, an almost perfect correlation among
major democracies between welfare state spending and income inequality.
The country with the lowest inequality of incomes is also the country
with the lowest deficit, the lowest rate of social spending (only 12 per
cent of disposable income), and the highest rate of capital formation:
Japan. In the United States, in the United Kingdom, even in Germany
(with social-spending rates of 15 per cent, 23 per cent and 27 per cent,
respectively) income inequality has become greater rather than smaller,
the more social spending has grown.</p>
<p>The entitlement crisis</p>
<p>Liquidating the deficit state can no longer be avoided. It cannot
even be postponed much longer. It is clearly the number one political
task faced by the democracies, and will be their political reality for
the next decade. And it means the end of ever-increasing middle-class
entitlements. A little over a hundred years old – they were invented in
Bismarck’s Germany in the 1880s – entitlements have now become a threat
to the very survival of democracy, if not of the modern state
altogether. The only way the democracies can regain control of their
finances – and with them of economic, social and foreign policy – is to
cut back sharply on entitlements, whether that be health care (spending
on which is racing out of control in all developed countries rather than
in the United States alone); on social security; on pensions; or, in
Europe, on unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>That middle-class entitlements threaten the democracies’ prosperity
and health – and indeed their very survival – has been known for quite
some time now. As early as 1988 it was proven with mathematical rigour
by Peter G. Petersen (President Nixon’s erstwhile Secretary of Commerce)
in a book entitled On Borrowed Time: How The Growth in Entitlement
Spending Threatens America’s Future. But nobody was yet willing to
listen.</p>
<p>Any attempt at cutting entitlements – or even at slowing their growth
– is still bitterly resisted. Last year the voters in Sweden tossed out
the incumbent Liberal government for proposing to cap a few entitlement
programmes that had clearly gone out of control. Shortly thereafter,
Italy’s prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, was kicked out of office for
the same offence. A few months earlier he had been elected on the
promise of reforming entitlements. But when he actually proposed taking
a close look at the outrageous abuses of the country’s pension system,
his coalition partners deserted him. Everybody in Italy knows that
hundreds of thousands of able-bodied people – some estimates say
millions – are fraudulently receiving life-long disability pensions
which are the main cause of Italy’s financial troubles. They account for
half of Italy’s social spending, that is, for a full eighth of the
country’s disposable income and for all of its horrendous deficit.
Cutting entitlements – even fraudulent ones – was, however, still not
‘politically correct’.</p>
<p>That both Republicans and Democrats in the United States now agree
that Medicare – long the most sacred of sacred cows – needs to be pruned
back is thus a major change. It still remains to be seen, however,
whether the Congress can get itself to do anything so unpopular.
Actually, the middle class has no choice. Entitlements will be cut in
all developed countries. The only question is by what method. The least
painful way is to do it openly – e.g. by raising to seventy-five the age
at which Americans get full social security benefits. If this is not
accepted, middle-class entitlements will be cut by inflation, that is,
by destroying the purchasing power of middle-class incomes. Or there
will be draconian increases in taxation – in the United States most
probably through substantial consumption taxes on top of already high
income taxes.</p>
<p>And as soon as one major country cuts middle-class entitlements –
e.g. if the United States were to accept more than token cuts in
Medicare benefits – it will be the signal for entitlement reform in all
the other democracies. This would herald the end of the Keynesian
welfare state as surely as Mr Gorbachev’s perestroika heralded the end
of Communism.</p>
<p>To restore government to solvency – and with it restore its control
of policy – requires that it be forced again to make priority decisions.
It will again have to be forced to say ‘No’. The first step might be a
return to the way budgets were made before the advent of the Keynesian
Deficit State: by beginning with the available revenues, that is, with
how much money can be spent. This forces government to decide what can
and should be financed within the limits set by the availability of
money. What exceeds these limits has to be said ‘no’ to. Since the
Second World War, however – or at least since Western Europe and Japan
returned to prosperity in the late 1950s – all democracies start
budget-making with the question: What do we want to spend money on?
Spending beyond the available revenues, that is, deficit spending, was
easy to finance. Above all, it was deemed beneficial. Indeed, the
Keynesian postulates made saying ‘no’ appear heartless and almost
immoral. Saying ‘no’ is indeed painful. For a politician it is risky. It
is only necessary.</p>
<p>But that would only be the first step. The decisions on priorities
would then still be ahead. They are likely – 1 would say, certain – to
explode all existing parties everywhere. In fact, both ‘Right’ and
‘Left’ have already lost much of their meaning in the democracies. Who
is on the ‘right’, for instance: people who want the pension age set
according to life expectancies, that is, to be pushed up to seventy-five
(sixty years ago when the United States embraced sixty-five as the
social-security age, it was actually a good deal higher than average
life expectancies at the time and chosen for that reason)? Or people who
argue a duty of the young to support their elders? Traditionally both
are ‘Conservative’ positions. What is ‘Liberal’: the argument that
university education be free for all? Or the counter-argument that its
recipients should repay from their greatly increased post-graduation
earnings the cost of their schooling so that the next generation can
have free access? These are new issues. They do not fit the existing
mould of politics; they are neither economic nor ideological. In the
democracies therefore more than political issues can be expected to be
in transition; political structure will be in transition too.</p>
<p>Turning poverty into degradation</p>
<p>The social axioms of the Keynesian welfare state have worn no better
than its economic axioms. Welfare has not ended poverty. It has instead
turned it into degradation and dependence. It has done so in the
domestic as well as the international society, that is, as much through
domestic welfare’ as through ‘foreign aid’.</p>
<p>In the United States it is now generally accepted that neither of the
two big welfare programmes works. Both Aid to Families with Dependant
Children and Disability Aid are disasters. It is still widely denied,
however, that they do damage. Rather, the dependence and degradation of
long-term welfare dependents and the dreary squalor of their lives is
being explained away.</p>
<p>In terms of income, America’s welfare recipients are doing quite
well. If non-cash benefits (e.g. food stamps or housing allowances) are
included, the incomes of most are above the ‘poverty line’. Yet they
live in a squalor and degradation as bad as that of yesterday’s worst
slums, if not worse. The most common explanation asserts that the
American ‘welfare mess’ is part of our racial problem. There are indeed
proportionally many more Black unwed ‘welfare mothers’ who are
permanently on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (37 per cent of
the welfare population is Black, where Blacks are only 13 per cent of
the population). And so one explanation is racial inferiority (no longer
expressed publicly, as a rule, but surely held by a great many
non-Blacks, whether Whites, Latinos or Asians). The other one is the
legacy of discrimination and slavery. Both are equally racist and
equally despicable. And both are patently wrong. There is the same
‘welfare mess’ – that is, the same turning of poverty into degradation –
where the welfare recipients are purely white and indeed where they were
competent, self-supporting middle-class until they became welfare
recipients.</p>
<p>In Britain the ‘welfare underclass’ (what British statisticians
classify as members of ‘Class V’) is now growing as fast as the same
group in America. It suffers from the same social anomie, the same
destruction of personality and competence and self-respect. Before 1950
illegitimacy in the British working class was no higher than it had been
for centuries, i.e. around 4 or 5 per cent of births. It has now passed
25 per cent; and among chronic welfare recipients it is well past 30 per
cent and already higher than among White welfare recipients in America.
And it is climbing as fast as among America’s Blacks. Unlike the United
States, the British system also supports men on welfare through very
high and long-term unemployment benefits. The dependency rate among
young British males is climbing as fast as the welfare-dependency rate
among American young women in the ‘underclass’. The British on welfare
and long-term unemployment payments are financially even better off than
their US counterparts. Their pre-tax income is equal to that of the
average employed blue-collar family but is tax exempt so that their net
income on welfare is actually a good deal higher. Yet they display the
same social pathology: dropping out of school; increasing illegitimacy
rates; more and more fatherless families; increasing addiction – in
Britain still primarily on alcohol though hard-drug use is growing fast.
Britain’s inner-cities – only thirty years ago among the safest in the
world – are becoming jungles; the urban burglary rate is already higher
in Britain than it is in America. Yet this British welfare underclass is
almost totally white.</p>
<p>Across the Channel, in Germany, the welfare underclass consists of
people – entirely white and predominantly male – who stay permanently
idle because Germany pays unemployment compensation of 80 per cent of
the employees’ former wages for the rest of their lives. The recipients
are graduates of the famed German apprentice training system and have
grown up with the equally famous German work ethic. But welfare, within
no time at all, converts growing numbers of them into what Germans call
‘welfare cripples’, with all the pathology of social disintegration and
anomie: rising numbers of families headed by single, unwed mothers;
sharp increases in alcoholism; and the young ‘skinheads’ and neo-Nazis
who ‘for kicks’ set fire to tenement houses inhabited by Turks or other
foreign workers. As a result, Germany now has one of the highest
unemployment rates – even when the economy is booming – with an
intractably high permanent unemployment.</p>
<p>In Italy, the welfare underclass consists of forty- to fifty-year-old
males – all white, of course – who go on full or partial ‘disability
pension’ and stay on it the rest of their adult lives. Most of them, it
is generally known, are able-bodied; their disabilities are quite minor
or totally fraudulent. That a great many of these people actually hold a
job while claiming to be unable to do so mitigates the economic impact
of their idleness. (In fact it is common knowledge in Italy that a fair
number of the recipients of disability pensions actually hold two paid
jobs: a patronage job in the public service where they only show up to
collect their salary, and a paid job in the ‘underground’ economy.) But
this does not mitigate the impact on Italy’s government budget which is
crippled by pension payments. And it aggravates the moral and
psychological damage to society and individual alike. That Italy has
become riddled with corruption from top to bottom is in large measure
the result of pension fraud. It has made being on the take the accepted,
indeed the proper, thing to do.</p>
<p>The evidence is thus crystal-clear. First, modern welfare destroys.
It does not build competence; it creates dependence. It does not
alleviate poverty even though it provides middle-class or
near-middle-class incomes. And it does so irrespective of who the
recipients are: black teenage girls in the United States; young,
working-class white males in the United Kingdom; highly trained adult
men in Germany; middle-class, mostly salaried men in Italy. The one
thing these corrupted and poisoned people have in common is that they
are being financially rewarded for staying on welfare and financially
penalized for getting off it.</p>
<p>The failure of foreign aid</p>
<p>Internationally the failure of welfare has been just as great.
Development aid was surely one of the most important political
inventions of this century. The first attempt, the Marshall Plan, was
successful beyond all expectations. There was thus every reason to
expect great results from its two successors: President Truman’s Point
Four (1950) and President Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress (1962). (No
one expected greater things from both than I did; indeed I worked
enthusiastically for both.) At best, neither plan did much damage. But
neither did much good. The forty years since President Truman’s
proclamation have indeed brought more, and more widely spread, economic
development than any earlier period in history. But the development was
mainly in areas that received little or no aid – especially the
countries of South-east Asia. Indeed, there is a near-perfect negative
correlation between receiving development aid and development. The areas
that received the most such aid either did not develop at all – India
and Egypt are the prime examples – or actually lost ground as did most
of tropical Africa. Just as with domestic welfare, the recipients of
international welfare (we call it ‘development aid’) have little in
common with each other except their developing the less the more aid
they got. Nor do such popular explanations as the ‘population explosion’
hold water. Populations grew just as much in some of the
fastest-developing countries in South-east Asia, e.g. Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, or coastal China. The one factor that the
non-developing countries share is their having received massive
development aid. The one factor the fast-developing countries share is
that they received little or no development aid.</p>
<p>Welfare and international aid which increases dependence or inhibits
development – that is, a good many of the welfare and aid programmes of
the last forty years – will be discontinued or, at least, be cut back
sharply. But it is surely wrong to conclude – as a good many people now
do – that the welfare concept, both domestic and international, was a
mistake best to be forgotten. What is needed is to refocus welfare on
creating independence, competence, responsibility.</p>
<p>The need for help – at least for temporary help – is surely going to
grow. Developed and developing countries alike are undergoing major
transformations of economy and society. There will therefore be massive
dislocations in which well-established, competent, responsible people
will find themselves uprooted. They may not need much – in many cases
their main need is the assurance that help is available. But a society
and economy in transition are a dangerous environment. There is need for
what welfare was supposed to be: a ‘safety net’. It must only be
prevented from becoming instead a ‘couch’ and a permanent resting
place.</p>
<p>A second reason for constructing an effective welfare system is that
it would be total defeat for the democracies, and a denial of the very
idea on which they are based, for affluence to lead to an erosion of
compassion. In the not-so-long run, rising affluence does indeed most
benefit those at the bottom of the income pyramid. It cannot be said too
often that – contrary to everything Marx predicted – the ‘proletarians’
were the main beneficiaries of the enormous increase in wealth-producing
capacity in the developed countries during the last hundred years. Their
real income has risen at least three times as fast as that of the
‘capitalists’. Contrary to the predictions of Marx’s successors and
disciples – e.g. Lenin and the other theoreticians of ‘Imperialism’ –
the greatest increase in national prosperity and wealth in these hundred
years were among ‘colonial’ and ‘exploited’ countries that have become
developed countries. Japan’s total national product has risen a good
deal faster than that of the United States – but so also has that of
South Korea and of the ‘Tigers’ of South-east Asia: Taiwan, Singapore
and Hong Kong – all former colonies – and of such other former colonies
as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>But that the great majority in the developed and emerging countries
is now so much better off only makes more visible and more painful the
plight of the minorities who are left behind because of lack of
competence or lack of opportunity. And this is just as true for the
international society as for the domestic society. For their own
self-respect the rich therefore need to help. But for the good of the
poor it must be help that helps, help that creates competence, health,
self-respect, rather than the help of the welfare state which creates
dependence, destitution, incompetence, self-loathing.</p>
<p>Encouraging the competence of the poor and promoting their capacity
to develop themselves is clearly in the self-interest of the affluent,
that is, of the democracies. For their stability and social cohesion is
increasingly threatened by the anomie, the degradation, the despair of
the incompetent and dependent poor.</p>
<p>A hundred and sixty years ago an epidemic in London’s East End made
the wealthy in the West End realize for the first time that typhoid
among the poor threatened them too. This was the beginning of public
health – until then there had been only private health – and with it the
beginning of the revolution in health and longevity which has benefited
the rich surely as much as it has benefited the poor.</p>
<p>The anomie, the degradation, the lawlessness, the corruption caused
among the incompetent poor by the failure of welfare – domestically and
internationally – equally threatens the cities, the suburbs, the
schools, the streets of the healthy, the competent, the affluent. It
threatens to infect their children, above all. Surely, spreading
contagion from the welfare underclass is heavily to blame for much of
the coarsening and proletarization of middle-class life, middle-class
culture, and middle-class values. The anomie, the degradation, the
lawlessness of the non-developing ‘Third World’ equally threatens the
safety, the peace, the affluence of the wealthy countries – if only
through the increasing immigration-pressure of desperate and incompetent
people fleeing to the developed world.</p>
<p>The final – and most compelling – reason for not giving up on
development – whether at home or internationally – is that it is the
wrong thing to do: there are enough successes to show that development
out of poverty and into competence is possible, and also what it
requires.</p>
<p>We know what made the Marshall Plan succeed – the world’s biggest
welfare programme ever, and its most successful one. Another – and
equally impressive – success was the ‘Green Revolution’ in which new
seeds and improved farming methods (financed and promoted by the
Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, that is, by two non-governmental
organizations) changed India in the 1960s, From a country in which
large-scale famines occurred every few years India has become one which
in most years has an export surplus of cereal grains. Domestically there
is the success of the Salvation Army in the United States in
rehabilitating a large proportion of the worst losers – prostitutes;
former convicts; alcoholics; hard-drug addicts – and turning them into
competent, self-sustaining and self-respecting citizens. It is arguably
the most successful social programme in any developed country today
with, for instance, a 30 per cent rehabilitation rate for alcoholics and
hard-drug addicts.</p>
<p>There is also the tremendous difference in results between two
superficially very similar programmes: the European (both British and
German) programmes of unemployment benefits and the one in the United
States. The programmes in Britain and Germany turn self-respecting
workers into permanent welfare dependants. In the United States there
has been little chronic unemployment despite upheavals in the labour
force which were considerably more drastic than anything Britain and
Germany have experienced so far.</p>
<p>The Marshall Plan spent very, very little money by the standards of
the 1900s; and it spent it sparingly. It liberally gave technical
support and consulting help. But it gave money only as ‘seed money to
businesses that had a convincing track record and submitted a realistic
plan with clear performance goals. And both, support and money, were
withdrawn the moment a business – whether private or government-owned –
either diverted money from the agreed-upon plan or failed to meet
agreed-upon performance goals. The Green Revolution spent even less
money. Its agents – e.g. CARE, the American international relief
organization – sought out competent Indian farmers and worked closely
with them on trying out new seeds and new farming methods. The main use
of money was as insurance against the risk of crop failure during the
first two or three critical years. The Salvation Army spends practically
no money at all. It explains its success as being based on discipline;
hard work; minimum subsistence pay; a demanding programme of skill
teaching, and unlimited compassion. And anyone who breaks the Salvation
Army’s draconian rules is out, no matter how needy. Unemployment
compensation in the United States in the first weeks or months of
unemployment is as high as it is in Europe – and for some workers,
e.g. those in unionized car plants – even higher. It provides ample
support for the period during which the newly unemployed is likely to be
in a state of shock. But the money soon tapers off; and it stops
altogether after two years. There is thus a powerful incentive to look
for work. Even in cities or regions that have been heavily dependent on
a single plant or a single industry which totally shut down,
unemployment within two years or so drops to the national average. And
national average in the United States, even in times of labour-market
upheavals, rarely has stayed very long above the ‘natural’ rate of
unemployment, that is, above the rate which expresses the normal
in-between jobs turnover of the American economy.</p>
<p>Welfare can work, in other words. But only if the axiom is changed
from ‘All the poor need is money’ to ‘All the poor need is competence’.
Of course there is need for money. But by itself alone money encourages
incompetence and irresponsibility. Today’s welfare focuses on needs.
There will be true ‘welfare’, however, only if the focus is on
results.</p>
<p>What welfare has to be</p>
<p>Major countries are now tackling welfare spending. In the United
States, Aid to Families with Dependent Children is being sharply cut by
some states, e.g. New York, California and Massachusetts; and for the
United States altogether by the new, Republican-dominated Congress.
Italy, as already mentioned, is at least talking about pension reform.
Britain is about to enact cuts in the rewards for remaining permanently
unemployed, as is Germany. These proposals penalize staying on welfare.
This may do the trick where, as with German unemployment compensation
and Italian disability pensions, the recipients are largely competent
and healthy people whose main incapacity is welfare itself.</p>
<p>But for people who lack competence – the welfare recipients in the
United States and largely in Britain – there may be need also for
positive incentives for not going on welfare in the first place, and for
not staying on it. Governments will surely have to pay for this at least
in part (though, as in the Salvation Army programmes, rehabilitated
recipients should routinely be required to become themselves donors or
volunteers). We are unlikely to be able to depend for helping the less
competent entirely on philanthropy, as the Victorians believed. But the
delivery of welfare programmes should be contracted out to
non-governmental, community organizations as much as possible. This is
what the example of the Salvation Army teaches (but also many smaller
and less conspicuous programmes in the United States – especially a good
many church-run ones). What is primarily needed by the less competent
and the wounded is not money – whether less money or more of it. It is
what makes the Salvation Army successful: discipline; commitment; hard
work; self-respect and a great deal of individual attention. And such
intangibles a government bureaucracy, however well intentioned, cannot
deliver.</p>
<p>In the present discussion of ‘welfare reform’ the emphasis in all
countries is on money. It is the wrong emphasis. In the first place,
welfare is a big-budget item only if it is ‘entitlement’ to the middle
class as are German unemployment compensation and Italian disability
benefits. Welfare to the truly less competent – the US and UK programmes
– is a minor budget item in comparison to the entitlements to the
competent middle class such as Medicare, social security, or the British
National Health Service. Second, that welfare wastes money – and it does
– is its least offence. It wastes lives. If welfare had results it would
be cheap even if it cost twice as much. And the reason for welfare
should not be, as the welfare state asserted, that the less fortunate
and less competent deserve to be financially supported. The reason must
be that they deserve to be restored to competence, self-respect and
self-support – and those are the results welfare needs to aim for and to
pay for.</p>
<p>Internationally too, welfare, i.e. foreign aid, is being pruned
drastically. It should, however, in all probability be stopped
altogether – except as disaster aid in an earthquake or to house and
feed refugees from civil war. What is needed internationally – as the
next section discusses – is Civil Society; and that money cannot
buy.</p>
<p>But to develop policies that truly promote domestic welfare rather
than create dependence and destitution will be the major social
challenge for the democracies in the next decade, and a crucial test for
them as functioning societies.</p>
<p>The free market’s power and its limitations</p>
<p>Keynesian economics still underlie the domestic policies of the
democracies. But only in the first half of the period since the Second
World War did they reign unchallenged. In the second half, i.e. since
the 1970s, Keynesian economics have come under increasingly heavy attack
from what in the United States is known as ‘neo-Conservatism’ (elsewhere
called ‘neo-classic economies’, the term I shall use). And in
international economics, neo-classicism has come to reign supreme. It is
the economics on which the international agencies – the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund – base themselves. And the same
governments that are Keynesian at home – especially the US government –
have also been turning neo-classic in their international economics.
Whenever a foreign country gets into trouble, the United States advises
it to accept, and fast, the neo-classic prescription.</p>
<p>Neo-classic economists, like their forebears in the nineteenth
century, preach the superiority of the free market over any other system
of economic organization. But they go far beyond their mentors. They
claim that the free market by itself will create a functioning society
and, indeed, even a stable democratic political system.</p>
<p>Neo-classicism goes back to Friedrich Hayek’s 1944 book The Road to
Serfdom. Hayek asserted that any tampering with the free market soon
leads to destruction of political freedom and to tyranny. He also
claimed – and that has proven eventually his most important thesis –
that an economy based on the free market and unencumbered by government
controls, regulations and interventions creates, by itself, an optimally
free, just, and equal society. What to the nineteenth century had
primarily been economic theory Hayek converted into social and political
doctrine.</p>
<p>Hayek’s book was an immediate sensation: though, for a long time,
without much impact on government policy or on academia. But as the
failure of Keynesian economics became more and more apparent,
neo-classicism became increasingly respectable. It is still not domestic
government policy – deficit spending is much too attractive for
governments to embrace the neo-classics’ austerity and self-discipline –
and not only in the Anglo-American countries. But in the universities
Keynesians are now a minority and are found mainly among the older
economists. The younger ones have predominantly become ‘neo-classics’,
even in such Keynesian strongholds as Harvard, MIT, or Cambridge
University. Until the late 1970s and early 1980s the Nobel Prize for
Economics went regularly to Keynesians, e.g. Paul Samuelson (1970) or
Kenneth Arrow (1972). In the last twenty years it has gone increasingly
to neo-classics (examples are George J. Stigler in 1981; James M.
Buchanan in 1987, and Gary S. Becker in 1992). Neo-classic economics
have become the standard prescription for turning around an economy;
after it had floundered under the statist or neo-Keynesian economics of
the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. the economies of Latin America); when it
embarks on systematic economic development (e.g. the economies of
South-east Asia, beginning with South Korea); and to bring back to life
economies asphyxiated by Communism, e.g. the countries of the former
Soviet Empire and post-Maoist China.</p>
<p>There can be no longer any doubt that neo-classics work as economics.
In fact, they work like a wonder drug. As soon as an economy moves
towards free-market policies – that is, cuts government spending and
balances the budget; privatizes government-owned businesses; cuts back
or eliminates government regulations and government controls of economic
activity; opens its borders to imports and thereby allows competition;
eliminates or at least cuts back government restrictions on the movement
of money and capital – an economic boom gets going. At first it is
accompanied by – often severe – dislocation. Inefficient enterprises go
bankrupt as they are no longer kept alive by tariff walls or government
subsidies. There is a drastic jump in unemployment. But this transition
period should not last very long, as a rule no more than two years. Then
unemployment, for instance, goes down again, and fast.</p>
<p>This has happened in quite a few countries. It happened in
desperately poor Bolivia in the 1980s; in Chile a little later; in
Argentina after 1989; in the Czech Republic in 1991–1992 and, most
spectacularly, in the Tigers’ of mainland Asia: Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Singapore and, a few years later, in their neighbours, Malaysia,
Thailand, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>But it did not happen in all countries. Except for the Czech Republic
it has not happened so far in any of the countries of the former Soviet
Empire, whether they had been incorporated into the Soviet Union or had
been nominally independent. Free-market economics did not turn around
the East German economy. To keep East Germany from dying, West Germany
had to pour in larger amounts of government aid than has ever been
poured into any area. Freeing the economy did indeed produce economic
boom in China. But in inland China where most of the people live, the
boom soon collapsed. And even coastal China has wild inflation rather
than a stable economy. Mexico experienced tremendous economic growth as
soon as it adopted free-market economics in 1987–1988. But this did not
produce social and political stability. On the contrary, economic growth
only activated the profound cultural, economic, social, and political
seismic faults which economic backwardness had kept from producing
earthquakes.</p>
<p>Economically neo-classicism has been fully proven. But its claims
that it would also generate a functioning society and a stable polity –
the claim that made it neo-classicism – has been fully disproven. The
free market works only where there are effective institutional
guarantees of property rights and, especially, effective protection of
property rights against the powerful whether kings, nobles, bishops,
generals, or parliaments – as shown by the American economic historian
Douglass C. North, especially in his 1990 book Institutions,
Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Cambridge University
Press), for which he received the 1993 Nobel Prize for Economics. For
the free market to work also requires a reliable legal system, an
infrastructure of financial institutions and an adequate educational
system. The free market does not create a functioning society – it
presupposes it. Without such a functioning civil society a few
speculators may get very rich. But the economy will remain poor. There
may be tremendous economic excitement as there is in Mr Yeltsin’s
Russia, or in today’s Shanghai. But unless there is the social
infrastructure of a civil society this apparent economic turn around is
likely to be short-lived. It will either collapse right away or swell
into a speculative bubble and burst. Sustained economic development does
indeed require the neo-classic economics. But there first have to be the
legal, financial, educational institutions of a functioning society, and
the human resources such a society produces, educates, develops, tests –
and respects.</p>
<p>Before Hitler the Czech core of Czechoslovakia was one of the
stablest, most solid, most bourgeois – and most productive societies in
the world – next to Switzerland the stablest and most solid society on
the continent of Europe. It was first brutally persecuted by Hitler and
then totally suppressed by Stalin. But the foundations were still there;
the traditions were there; the memories were there – and the people
remained resolutely bourgeois in their values and commitments. In the
Czech Republic the free market could and did indeed perform economically
almost as soon as the Stalinist shackles were struck off. Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Singapore – even South Korea – all inherited legal, financial,
educational institutions from their former colonial rulers, as did
Malaysia and Indonesia. For a century or longer Chile – with a stable
society and stable politics – was considered ‘the Switzerland of Latin
America’; and thus the free market could produce a functioning economy
despite a few years of Communist incompetence followed by a brutally
repressive military dictatorship. But where no such tradition of civil
society exists – in tropical Africa; in the former lands of the Tsar; in
China which never knew civil law – the free market by itself is unlikely
to create a functioning economy, let alone a functioning society.</p>
<p>Democracy – as the term is commonly understood, that is, free
elections and a parliament or Congress – is by itself not the answer.
Hong Kong knows neither. Neither does Singapore. Taiwan was a military
dictatorship until fairly recently. Chile started its spectacular
turnaround under a repressive military dictatorship. In fact, there is
considerable evidence for the claim made by the authoritarian rulers of
the rapidly developing economies of South-east Asia: political freedom
and democracy follow economic development rather than precede it as US
political dogma preaches. Indeed, except in the United States, political
development has everywhere followed economic development. The enormous
social, economic, and cultural development of major continental-European
countries during the nineteenth century, for instance – Imperial
Germany; the Austria-Hungary of Francis Joseph; France under Napoleon
III – all took place under authoritarian political regimes. The Japan of
the ‘economic miracle of the last forty years is in its political
reality (e.g. in the supremacy of a politically uncontrolled
bureaucracy) much closer to the authoritarian nineteenth-century
continental-European countries than to Anglo-American ‘democracy. That
the United States – alone of all countries in the world – achieved
political development before it achieved economic development may thus
be only another case of ‘American excep-tionalism’.</p>
<p>But what is absolutely essential – or otherwise the free market will
not function even as an economic institution – is what
nineteenth-century political theorists called by a German word: the
Rechtsstaat (the Justice State), and what we now call human rights: a
social and political order which effectively protects the person and the
property of citizens against arbitrary interference from above. Human
rights equally guarantee the citizen’s freedom to choose their religion;
to choose their professions or their vocations; to form autonomous
social institutions and to read, speak, write, and think, free of
dictation by any power whether party, church or state.</p>
<p>Whether democracy then actually emerges – as the nineteenth-century
Liberal fervently believed – remains to be seen. But without human
rights as its foundation there surely will never be political democracy.
There can only be chaos or tyranny. Equally, without human rights there
is unlikely to be lasting economic development, even with market
freedom.</p>
<p>‘Capitalism’ and ‘capitalists’ we now know – thanks mainly to the
work of a great French historian, the late Fernand Braudel – are not
modern phenomena. Both have been common throughout the ages and are
found in most cultures and countries of which we have any knowledge.
What is ‘modern’ is the free market as an organizing principle of the
economy. The neo-classicists are right: without the free market there
will be no functioning modern economy and, in fact, no economic growth.
But the free market is in turn dependent on a functioning civil society.
Without it, it is impotent.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century European Liberal fervently believed that
civilization – and that meant a stable government, political order,
rapid economic growth, a thriving middle class, and political and
religious freedom – would follow automatically upon the establishment of
the political institutions of a constitutional monarchy: a hereditary
monarch with limited powers; a parliament with political parties and an
annual budget; a professional civil service; a small standing army with
a professional officer corps; an independent judiciary; a central bank;
compulsory public education; a German-style university; and a
(substantially) free press. The nineteenth-century American Liberal
believed in the same model with only one change: the substitution of an
elected president for the hereditary king. And both, the European and
the American version of the model, were exported to the four corners of
the earth.</p>
<p>This nineteenth-century modernization through political institutions
does not have a good press today. It did better, however, than is
commonly believed. In two countries – nineteenth-century Japan and early
twentieth-century Turkey – it worked and created a new and modern
civilization. Elsewhere – in Romania, Bulgaria and Poland; in Brazil and
Mexico; in Egypt; and even in the Tsar’s Russia – it established an
ideal to which an educated elite still aspires despite a century’s
frustrations and disasters. But the nineteenth-century political model
failed overall to create the liberal, enlightened, peaceful civilization
it promised. Even in Italy it had impact mainly in the north which had
had civilization for many centuries. In the south – in Calabria, for
instance, or in Sicily – political modernization brought railways and
hotels but little civilization.</p>
<p>The neo-classic economics of today have done somewhat better than the
Old-Liberal politics of the last century. The free market has been
changing the lives of many more people. Telephone, film, television,
computer, hit harder than did the steamship, the railway, and the
factory-made goods, which accompanied political modernization and were
its most visible symbols. Goods, no matter how greedily desired, change
consumption; information changes the imagination. Goods change how we
live; information how we dream. Goods change how we see the world;
information changes how we see ourselves.</p>
<p>Still, the free market of the neo-classicists no more creates a civil
society than did the political institutions in which the Old-Liberals of
the nineteenth century so firmly believed. The free market thus finds
itself very much at the same impasse. It will not work unless there is
civil society. But it cannot by itself create a civil society – as
little as did political Liberalism a hundred years ago. Yet for the
democracies truly to win the peace in the post-cold war world they must
bring forth civil societies, especially in the former Communist parts of
the world, i.e. the successors to the Soviet Empire and the successors
to Mao’s (or Deng’s) China.</p>
<p>Can civil society be exported?</p>
<p>The one public figure in the democracies who has so far asked this
question has answered it with a ‘yes’. When Jimmy Carter as President of
the United States made establishment of ‘human rights’ a goal of
American policy and a prerequisite to giving American aid, he in effect
proclaimed the promotion of civil society to be a goal of American
foreign policy on a par with the military and political goal of
containing and outliving Communism.</p>
<p>Mr Carter was ridiculed as a ‘dreamer’. Viewed twenty years later he
may have been the realist, and the dreamers are the believers in the
efficacy of the free market. But Mr Carter did not succeed in getting a
single country to accept human rights nor in convincing the public in
the democracies of the wisdom of his priorities. But that was then still
at the height of the cold war – and in any war, winning it always comes
first, and thinking about the peace is brushed aside as a dangerous
diversion, and subversive. Now the democracies need to reconsider; to
win the peace in today’s post-cold war world they have to establish
civil society as a policy goal of its own. The failure of the free
market to deliver on its economic promises, especially in the former
Communist countries, may otherwise destroy the credibility of freedom
and again endanger world peace.</p>
<p>At the least, governments will have to learn that it is futile,
folly, and, predictably, a waste of money, to invest – whether through a
World Bank loan or through a Stabilization Credit – unless the recipient
country establishes a truly independent and truly effective legal
system. Otherwise the money will only make the wrong people rich:
political bosses; generals; con-artists. Instead of enriching the
recipient country it will impoverish it. The same lesson needs to be
learned by businesses: to invest in a country – like today’s Russia or
today’s China – which has not even started building a legal system
means, with near-certainty, to lose one’s money, and in fairly short
order. The experience of the last decades is crystal-clear: the free
market will not produce a functioning and growing economy unless it is
embedded in a functioning civil society, with effective human rights a
minimum requirement.</p>
<p>It is often said today that the democracies have lost their bearings
with the collapse of Communism. They no longer have a policy, no longer
have priorities, no longer have criteria for what to do and what not to
do. To be sure: the old policies, priorities, criteria do not make sense
now that there is no longer a ‘public enemy’. But there is a new policy,
a new priority, a new necessity: the promotion of civil society as a
goal of international policy. A civil society is not a panacea. It is
not the ‘end of history’. It does not by itself guarantee democracy, and
not even peace. It is, however, a prerequisite to these, and equally to
economic development. Only if civil society worldwide becomes their
goal, can the democracies win the peace.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Interview: Managing in a post-capitalist society An interview with
Industry Week Conducted by Tom Brown</p>
<p>One of the downsides of what passes as contemporary management
thinking is that too many managers venerate ‘newness’ and nothing else.
The latest-fad authors, whether there’s substance to their claims or
not, too often become the hot ticket for a month or two and then fade.
But then there’s Peter Drucker. He wrote his first book, The End of
Economic Man, in 1937 and in more than half a century, the steady stream
of rock-solid management books that he has written are, in and of
themselves, a complete management library. His analysis is consistently
on point, his conclusions well reasoned, his counsel worthy of any
manager’s consideration. Peter Drucker refuses to become outdated. So
far anyone who overlooked or ignored the best management book published
in 1993, Post-Capitalist Society (Harper-Business), missed a very great
deal indeed. In this relatively short book, written in the clear and
cogent style that Peter Drucker is famous for, he asserts that we are in
a period of immense social transition. Then he handily interprets the
consequences of the transformation we’re living through as it applies to
business, labour, and, of course, management. He also re-evaluates how
the politics of nations must be accounted for in future business
planning; here, too, he shares his insigfits about the role of workers,
managers, and plants in the larger context of citizenship.</p>
<p>And in an age when everything seems to he in flux, he affirms that
flux is the right word for our age and that success can only come
through deliberate, constructive action. But the most cogent theme
throughout the book, a theme that is consummated in the final section,
is that knowledge needs to be better understood, measured, and managed.
As you will see in this interview, far from dismissing the important
role of management and manufacturing in the future of the United States,
Peter Drucker affirms them. He cautions, however, that executives had
better understand that there will be both informed and uninformed
management and manufacturing – and only the former will be competitive
enough to survive. By my count, Post-Capitalist Society is Peter Drucker
s twenty-seventh book, but I found no pretence or self-importance in the
man. To meet him in his neighbourly California home, to see him most
comfortable in sports shirt and casual walking shoes, to hear him cite
facts, figures, names, and anecdotes without strain, and to note that he
shares his thinking with courtesy and good humour – this is the Peter
Drucker that still remains in many ways hidden from even his most avid
followers. If there ever was a master of management, then Peter Drucker
is the genuine article.</p>
<p>Industry Week: Peter, let me start this interview at a strange place
– at the last chapter of your book, in which you discuss ‘the educated
person’. Just how educated are most of us, in terms of being prepared to
deal with the society and the workplace of the future?</p>
<p>Peter. F. Drucker: You know, we have a very peculiar situation. Young
people, when they are in school, are extremely excited by the
humanities, even the most traditional subjects. And five years after
graduation, they will reject them, basically, and become totally
vocational in their orientation. This imbalance isn’t healthy in a
long-range sense. As I look at our executive-management people who
started out twenty or thirty years ago, I thought that these
just-turned-45-or-50-year-old managers would ultimately come back to
their schools and say, ‘Now we need to understand a little bit about
ourselves and about life!’ But the postgraduate education of our
managers, from this perspective, has been a total flop.</p>
<p>A flop?</p>
<p>Almost a total fizzle. But more and more are coming back, and they
always want to come back to this vocational or their professional area.
They start to see the humanities or the world of history as a way to
reflect on their business experiences and to judge how they might have
thought or acted differently, to look at their lives from whole new
perspectives.</p>
<p>What does this mean, that too many of us blur the world of work and
the world of ‘life’?</p>
<p>It’s deeper than just that. For most of history, earning a living was
something you had to do because, after all, you had to eat. Life did not
have that much leisure at all, in our sense of the word. Now, many
people allow their work to consume their lives totally: that’s what they
enjoy. But in the past for people to admit that they enjoyed their work
was simply – I wouldn’t say it wasn’t done – it wasn’t expected…. The
idea that your work was supposed to be meaningful was not a topic of
discussion in the past. That’s much different from today and even more
different from the world of the future. Today more and more people
simply expect and demand that their work and their jobs should be
meaningful. I don’t think it would ever have occurred to most people a
hundred years ago.</p>
<p>So this, of course, has management and business implications, no?</p>
<p>I think the growth industry in this country and the world will soon
be continuing education of adults. Nothing else is growing as fast,
whether you are talking physicians, or engineers, or dentists. This is
happening in part because things are changing so fast in every field of
every business or occupation.</p>
<p>Let me personalize this for you. There’s a young man I know – at
least he’s a young man to me; he’s in his forties – he’s probably the
leading radiologist on the East Coast. I’ve known him since he was a
child. He heads up the radiology, now Imaging’, department at a major
medical school. I was heading to the East Coast to do some speaking, so
I called him up, to arrange a get-together. His response: ‘Peter, I am
sorry. I’ll be out of town that week. I’m going to Minnesota for a
course.’ And I asked, ‘What are you teaching?’ And he said, ‘Peter, I’m
not teaching. I’m going for a week to study new aspects in ultrasound
technology. You know, I should have gone to study this last year, but I
had some surgery, and I couldn’t go. Now I’m way behind.’</p>
<p>And so I think that the educated person of the future is somebody who
realizes they need to continue to learn. That is a new definition, and
it is going to change the world we live and work in.</p>
<p>That brings me to the management implications. I had the feeling in
your book that you felt that a lot of companies forced people, or
encouraged people, to be too narrowly focused.</p>
<p>Not just companies. Almost the only organization that is different is
the military. Check it out, and you’ll see that practically all the
senior military people have been back to school numerous times. Now when
they go to the command and general staff school, that’s very narrow. But
when the Air Force or Army sends them to the university to get their
master’s or PhD, then they’ve pushed them to be more broad, to get some
new perspectives.</p>
<p>So how does a company broaden its managers?</p>
<p>A good many companies today are encouraging their people to work in
the community with non-profit organizations, which is perhaps the best
educational experience I could advise for a thirty-five-year-old
manager.</p>
<p>Peter, I feel that I’m almost grasping the significance of what
you’re driving at. Your book extols how the shrinking world will
increasingly be the reality for everyone in business. Are you saying
that we need to learn more about how the world works?</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, people did not travel as much, but many talked
more to each other about the nature of being human and about life. I
can’t explain to my children or my grandchildren, in a way that they can
appreciate, that when I was growing up, my father had a dinner party
every Monday. There were economists, ranking civil servants, a major
international lawyer. And about every week there were other dinners when
my parents would invite medical people. My mother and father were very
interested in mathematics and philosophy – so they invited folks to
dinner from these fields once a month. This is unthinkable today.</p>
<p>The reason that your words are so important is that your book makes
many forceful points about the increasing importance of knowledge as a
commodity in and of itself You say that ‘knowledge is the only
meaningful resource today’. You also state that ‘knowledge employees
cannot, in effect, be supervised’. Will managers be needed in the
future?</p>
<p>Managers will still be needed. But fewer will be needed than we see
today. A lot of people who now have the title manager don’t manage a
damn thing. We have all these corporate layers for a variety of reasons.
One is that when big organizations came into existence, the only model
we had was the army. The Prussian army was at that time at the peak of
its renown, right after 1870, and – like all armies – they had to have a
lot of redundancy. So corporations built in a lot of redundancy. No one
under sixty can possibly imagine how denuded we were of people after the
Second World War. As the economy began to expand right after the war,
you needed people and you had none, because the baby boomers didn’t join
the workforce until twenty-five years later. And so the available young
people had to be promoted very fast. Before 1929 you didn’t become a
full professor anywhere until you were fifty. When I first taught in a
business school, enrolments were exploding: for five years, we doubled
each year. When I joined it in 1949, it had 600 students. When I left,
it had 6500. And it reached that in ten years!</p>
<p>During this time, I once studied the management of a bank, at one
point reporting to the chief executive officer the average age of the
bank’s senior managers. ‘Your vice-presidents,’ I said, ‘have fewer
years of age than your predecessor’s vice-presidents had years of
seniority.’ It traditionally took thirty years to become a
vice-president at a bank. Traditionally, you could come into a bank
during this tough time, say at age twenty-one and if you were very,
very, very good, you became an assistant vice-president in your
mid-forties. Then suddenly, because of manpower shortages, you had
twenty-six-year-old vice-presidents. You had to! And we made jobs very
small.</p>
<p>There will, to be sure, be less of a need for this many levels of
management and for this many managers in the future. The nature of work
– and of workers – is such that oversupervision can become a drag on the
productivity of the firm. But as I say in the book, management is needed
in all modern organizations; it’s a generic function of all
organizations, whatever their specific mission. And you could say that
management is the generic organ of the knowledge society.</p>
<p>Yet I noted the importance you attached to teams in your book – and
how they can manage themselves. It is one of the most powerful and
useful parts of your book.</p>
<p>A team is one of the most difficult things to run. Look, I’ve done a
lot of work with baseball teams. They are very peculiar organizations.
They are among the most difficult things to run. Very few coaches do a
good job, precisely because you are dealing with a team, but your best
pitcher is either a prima donna or he’s no good. In baseball, average
pitchers need not apply.</p>
<p>In corporations, you are also often dealing with prima donnas, yet it
is a team where people often don’t perceive that they have to work
together. Think of almost any design team you know.</p>
<p>I happen to know Toyota quite well. A couple of years ago, I asked
one of their senior executives, just retired, ‘How long did it take you
before your design team performed well?’ He laughed and said, ‘In the
first place, it doesn’t perform yet. And in the second place, we began
in 1950.’ Donald Petersen of Ford started in the early 1970s and retired
in the mid-1980s; he worked very hard to get teams going, but you hear
constant complaints at Ford that their teams don’t work.</p>
<p>It takes a really superb manager to build that kind of team where
people really work together and adjust and take their cues from the
others and move ahead as a unit. That’s not easy. That takes time and
nerve and a very clear mission and a very skilful leader … perhaps
‘skilful’ isn’t the right word. You need a very focused, a very clear
kind of leadership. So what’s needed in the future may not be ‘a
manager’ in the typical sense. Many executives I meet are totally
baffled by what I’m talking about. They don’t know how to build a team.
And not because they don’t try it, but because it’s got to be built. You
manage to build a team, and yet you work each day with individuals.</p>
<p>Peter, the time when I have seen managers get the most bothered by
your writing is when you talk about the move to knowledge work as part
of a ‘a knowledge society’, and they say – perhaps without reading you
closely – ‘Does Drucker believe we in the United States won’t
manufacture things anymore, that our economy will be solid enough
without a manufacturing base?’ How do you answer them?</p>
<p>That’s nonsense. Look, most people believe that American
manufacturing has been in decline. There isn’t the slightest reason for
that belief. Manufacturing has grown as fast as the economy, that is,
very fast. It has expanded two-and-a-half times in the last, well, since
the late 1960s – the last twenty, twenty-five years. Same as GNP. But
people still identify manufacturing production with manufacturing and
blue-collar employment. Big mistake.</p>
<p>Explain, please.</p>
<p>Blue-collar employment has grown less fast than manufacturing volume
since 1900, which nobody seems to know, even though it’s in every
statistical yearbook. It has been declining: the unit of blue-collar
labour needed to make an additional unit of manufacturing has been going
down at 1 per cent compounded for more than ninety years – for almost a
century!</p>
<p>Manufacturing production has been going up steadily and shows every
sign of continuing to grow, and the share of manufacturing in GNP has
remained steady since about 1890 – for one hundred years – between 21
per cent and 23 per cent. The entire growth of services is at the
expense of agriculture. Agriculture in 1900 was still 50 per cent; it is
now 3 per cent. Manufacturing has remained constant. But bluet-collar
employment – not total employment – has come down and will continue to
go down. We are not at the bottom yet, though we are getting there.
We’re down to 18 per cent. It’ll bottom out at around 10 per cent or 11
per cent, which doesn’t mean that you have another cut of 50 per cent,
because manufacturing production is steadily growing. But you have
another cut of maybe 2 per cent to 4 per cent of the present workforce.
But this trend represents an enormous shift.</p>
<p>What caused the shift?</p>
<p>There are two or three key things we could talk about. Let me talk
about the biggest single factor: the emergence of new manufacturing
industries that are not blue-collar labour-intensive, but
knowledge-intensive!</p>
<p>So it’s knowledge in the form of …</p>
<p>Re-engineering! It’s the steady re-engineering of the manufacturing
process. Most people think of automation as the reason for the lower
demand for labour; automation is almost irrelevant. Take, for example,
making blue jeans. That’s a sewing operation. Even thirty years ago,
blue jeans came in three sizes – that was it – and in one colour and in
one style.</p>
<p>Today, blue jeans come in about sixteen sizes and twice as many
styles. But the process has been organized so that the burden of
adjustment is not at the beginning of the process, but at the end. It’s
at the very end: you go right through to the final sewing stage with one
length, one width, and maybe one colour. The burden of adjustment to
styles and sizes is all at the end, the culmination of a continuous and
uniform process. It costs a little extra cloth to do it this way, but
you basically have a flow process in which practically all the work can
be programmed. It’s not machine work; there’s still a lot of handwork,
but it is programmed and very well engineered. And so the labour needed
is probably one-fifth of what you had even twenty years ago, but not
just because they’ve automated anything. We have cut cloth by machine
for sixty years; this is nothing very new. It’s the re-engineering.</p>
<p>That doesn’t sound all that radical</p>
<p>It’s not. Any good engineer was probably taught to approach
production this way since 1940. But the last ones to actually do it will
probably be the car manufacturers, because they had the fantastically
efficient system based on a minimum number of models. Once you have
locked into a model for the year, you didn’t do anything to it. Well,
that’s gone. So they have to relearn the process. The Japanese have led
the way, but there’s still more to be learned.</p>
<p>So knowledge is absolutely key.</p>
<p>It’s as I say in the book: A country that has the knowledge workers
to design products and to market them will have no difficulty getting
those products made at low cost and high quality. But narrow-mindedness
and narrow perspectives are not going to make any business in any
country more competitive in the future.</p>
<p>I was amazed at how I misunderstood F. W. Taylor, the pioneer
business thinker of the early 1900s. You have given me a new
appreciation for him. Do you think, given your awesome stretch of books,
that you have been understood?</p>
<p>I think I have been understood in different ways in different parts
of the world. For example, in Japan people seem to note that I made
businesses and managers much more aware of the need to understand
marketing in the truest sense: you have to let the market drive your
business; you have to listen to customers and heed their wants and
needs.</p>
<p>The Japanese also seem to appreciate my words on price-controlled
costing: that you have to design products to the price that the
marketplace is willing to pay.</p>
<p>I also believe the Japanese heeded first and best my point of view
that people must be viewed as your colleagues and one of your prime
resources. It is only through such respect of the workers that true
productivity is achieved.</p>
<p>And, lastly, the Japanese seemed to take to heart that there really
is such a thing as a world economy and that trying to sell only within
your national borders is provincialism when it comes to business.</p>
<p>How about in Europe?</p>
<p>I think they see me as a pioneer of the counterculture. During modern
times, most of European management (and Europe is, after all, where my
own roots are) had what I would call a ‘Krupp’ mentality, where the
manager projects the attitude that ‘I own everything’ and that everyone
who works within a company is no more than a ‘helper’. I’m afraid to
think how many managers of this ilk are still around, all over the
world.</p>
<p>The problems with this attitude are many. It blocks out the kind of
communication and dialogue that you need to run a business. It doesn’t
allow for the possibility that lots of people need to make decisions if
a business is to be dynamic. In fact, a lot of European managers were
reduced to counting pencil stubs or meaningless stuff like that.</p>
<p>Well, European managers who have followed my books and my thinking
right away saw my advocacy of management as a profession, as something
that was a bit subversive, a bit revolutionary, and – in short –
countercultural. In fact, in this light my book The Practice of
Management was, and is, a sort of a manifesto in Europe.</p>
<p>What about the United States?</p>
<p>My impression is that managers in the United States derived two major
points from my writing and my counsel. First, they at least started to
understand that people are a resource and not just a cost. I think that
the most enlightened managers have started to understand what could be
realized by managing people towards a desired end or goal.</p>
<p>Which raises the second major point that managers here seem to note
about my work, that I helped them start to see management. In other
words, for a long time, the impact – plus or minus – of management was
invisible to most Americans. I think that many credit me with
discovering the discipline and insisting that businesses take management
seriously – as a profession that can make a difference in the life of
the business.</p>
<p>I would hope that American managers – indeed, managers worldwide –
continue to appreciate what I have been saying almost since day one:
that management is so much more than exercising rank and privilege; it’s
so much more than ‘making deals’. Management affects people and their
lives, both in business and in many other aspects as well. The practice
of management deserves our utmost attention; it deserves to be
studied.</p>
