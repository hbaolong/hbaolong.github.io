<h4 id="knowledge-work-and-gender-roles">23. Knowledge work and gender
roles</h4>
<p>In any work that requires skill or confers status, men’s and women’s
jobs have been distinct and separate through all but the last few
decades of history, in all cultures and civilizations. The belief that
women’s jobs and women’s social status were always inferior to men’s –
practically an article of faith today – is a half-truth at best. Rather,
men competed with men, women with women. In knowledge work today,
however, men and women increasingly do the same jobs and are competing
and working collegially in the same arena.</p>
<p>This is still an experiment – though practically all developed
countries (beginning, of course, with the United States) are engaged in
it. For all anyone can know so far, the experiment may fail and be
abandoned or sidelined after a few decades. I consider this unlikely,
but it cannot be ruled out. After all, the experiment preceding it, the
feminist movement that began in the early nineteenth century and saw
‘freedom for women’ in their not having to work (its model being the
‘cultured, middle-class housewife’), is now widely (though by no means
generally) considered to have been both a mistake and a failure.</p>
<p>Historically, women have always worked as hard as men. A farmer had
to have a wife, and she had to have a farmer husband. A craftsman had to
have a wife, and she had to have a goldsmith husband or shoemaker
husband. Neither could run the craft shop alone. The store owner had to
have a wife. And, conversely, no woman alone was likely to be able to
run a store.</p>
<p>But, historically, men and women did the same work only when it was
menial. Men and women both dug ditches, and they worked together. Men
and women both picked cotton in the fields. But any work involving
skill, and any work conferring social status or providing income above
minimum subsistence, was segregated by sex. A ‘spinster’ is a woman.
Potters were always men.</p>
<p>In every primitive society studied by anthropologists, work requiring
skill or giving social status is strictly separated by sex. In the
Trobriand Islands in the Pacific Ocean – studied around the time of the
Second World War by Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942) – the men built
boats, manned them, and fished; the women tilled the land and grew yams.
And then the men turned over half their catch to the women, and the
women half their crop to the men.</p>
<p>Such sex segregation was still the rule in nineteenth-century Europe
and America. The first of the new knowledge jobs was nursing, invented
by Florence Nightingale in 1854, during the Crimean War. It was designed
to be exclusively women’s work. After the typewriter became
all-pervasive in the office, the job of secretary soon became a female
one. From the beginning, telephone operators were women; telephone
installers were men.</p>
<p>Indeed, until recently, ‘feminism’ meant extending the separation of
jobs by sex, all the way down to the menial work men and women
traditionally had been doing together. From 1850 on, when agitation to
limit women’s hours of industrial work first began, the thrust of
traditional feminism was to enlarge the scope of occupations in which
there was men’s work and women’s work, with each sphere clearly defined
and limited to people of one sex only.</p>
<p>But knowledge is gender-neutral. Knowledge and knowledge jobs are
equally accessible to both sexes.</p>
<p>As soon as there were a substantial number of knowledge jobs, women
began to qualify for them, reach for them, move into them. The movement
began in the last decades of the nineteenth century – teaching came
first. It gathered momentum after the First World War. In fact, the era
of outstanding American women leaders is not today. In the 1930s and
1940s a galaxy of exceptional women bestrode the American stage. Eleanor
Roosevelt and Frances Perkins in government and politics; Anna Rosenberg
in personnel management and labour relations; half a dozen brilliant
presidents of women’s colleges; Helen Taussig in medicine; Lillian
Hellman and Clare Boothe Luce as playwrights; Dorothy Thompson in
foreign affairs and journalism. Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Clinton
are very much throwbacks to this earlier generation.</p>
<p>The movement of women into the same kinds of knowledge work as men
has become a flood since the Second World War, and a ‘cause’ in the past
twenty years. Conversely, men, in increasing numbers, are moving into
what, for more than a century, had been the one exclusively female
knowledge profession: nursing. Two-fifths of the nurse-anesthetists in
the United States – all of them RNs – are now men.</p>
<p>The higher up the ladder we go in knowledge work, the more likely it
is that men and women are doing the same work. Being a secretary in an
American bank still means being a woman, but a vice-president in the
same bank may be a man or a woman. Increasingly, what an earlier
generation of feminists saw as advancing the status and position of
women – for example, prohibiting women from doing physically dangerous
work – is now seen by feminists as discrimination against women, and
possibly even as oppression of women.</p>
<p>Unless this movement fizzles out – or at least abates to where the
‘career woman’ is again the exception she was half a century ago – it
will have tremendous impact, and not only on workforces and careers. The
greatest impact may be on the family.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, all attempts to take children away from their
mothers and to bring them up in collective institutions – as was done in
Sparta in Greek antiquity – were deeply resented and bitterly fought by
women. They saw such moves as depriving them of their rightful sphere of
power, of influence, and of contribution. Now the demand for child-care
centres, to look after children while their mothers work, is seen as
crucial to women’s equality and as a woman’s right.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, it was axiomatic that the first task of the
adult woman was to hold the family together and take care of the
children. And the first responsibility of the man was to support wife
and children. Today’s feminism, especially in its radical form, fights
as discrimination and as oppression woman’s role as ‘homemaker’ and
child-care provider. But at the same time, the ‘single mother’ who does
not need a man to support her children releases the father from
responsibility for the family. What, then, will family mean tomorrow, if
these trends persist? And what will this mean for community and for
society?</p>
<p>This is all still quite speculative. But this development, well
outside of anything that traditional economics, sociology, and political
science ever considered to be within their purview, may well be seen a
century hence as the distinctive social innovation of the twentieth
century. It is a reversal of all history and tradition.</p>
<p>In this century the workforce in the developed countries has shifted
from manual workers doing and moving things – on the farm, in the
factory, in the mines, in transportation – to knowledge work and
services work. These are momentous shifts. But they are shifts in how we
earn our living. The disappearance of sex roles in knowledge work
profoundly affects how we live.</p>
