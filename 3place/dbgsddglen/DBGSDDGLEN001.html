<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>All the pieces in this book – two interviews, one at the beginning
and one at the end, and twenty-five chapters in between – have one
common theme, despite their apparent diversity. They all deal with
changes that have already irreversibly happened. They therefore deal
with changes on which executives can – indeed must – take action. None
of the pieces in this book attempts to predict the future. All deal with
what executives can do – have to do – to make the future.</p>
<p>It is not so very difficult to predict the future. It is only
pointless. Many futurologists have high batting averages – the way they
measure themselves and are commonly measured. They do a good job
foretelling some things. But what are always far more important are
fundamental changes that happened though no one predicted them or could
possibly have predicted them. Looking back ten years today, no one in
1985 predicted – or could have predicted – that the establishment of the
European Economic Community would not release explosive economic growth
in Europe but would, on the contrary, usher in a decade of economic
stagnation and petty bickering. As a result, the unified Europe of 1995
is actually weaker in the world economy than was the fractured Europe of
1985. No one, ten years ago, predicted – or could have predicted – the
explosive economic growth of mainland China, a growth that came despite
rather than because of its government policies. No one predicted the
emergence of the 55 million overseas Chinese as the new economic
superpower. No one ten years ago could have predicted that the biggest
impact of the Information Revolution on business would be a radical
rethinking and restructuring of the oldest information system – and one
that apparently was ossified in every joint and tissue – the accounting
model of the ‘bean counters’.</p>
<p>But equally important: one cannot make decisions for the future.
Decisions are commitments to action. And actions are always in the
present, and in the present only. But actions in the present are also
the one and only way to make the future. Executives are paid to execute
– that is, to take effective action. That they can only do in
contemplation of the present, and by exploiting the changes that have
already happened.</p>
<p>This book starts out with the executive’s job, that is, with
management. What has already happened in the world of the executive that
puts into question – or perhaps even makes obsolete – the assumptions,
rules, and practices which worked these last forty years and which
therefore have automatically been taken for granted? The book then
proceeds to look at the implications of one particular fundamental
change in management, economy, and society: the emergence of information
as the executive’s key resource and as the organization’s skeleton. The
premise of this part of the book is the old adage that either you are
the tool’s master or you are its servant. What do executives have to
learn to be masters of the new tool? Then this book moves out of the
executive’s job and organization into markets and into a world economy
in which there are new power centres, new growth markets, new growth
industries. In its last section the book analyses the changes in society
and government – the biggest changes, perhaps, in this Century of Social
Transformation, in which government has been both a great success and
the ultimate failure.</p>
<p>Only thirty – perhaps even only twenty – years ago it was often said
that while there were a great many more managers and executives than
there had been in the 1920s (let alone before the First World War), most
of them were doing pretty much what their predecessors had done and in
pretty much the same way. No one would say that anymore for today s
managers and executives. But if there is one thing that is certain today
it is that tomorrow’s managers and executives will do things that are
even more different from what today’s managers and executives do. And
they will do them quite differently. To enable today’s executives to be
ahead of this different tomorrow – indeed to make it their tomorrow – is
the aim of this book.</p>
