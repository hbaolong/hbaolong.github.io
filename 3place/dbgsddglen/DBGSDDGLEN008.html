<h4 id="managing-in-the-network-society">6. Managing in the network
society</h4>
<p>For well over a hundred years all developed countries were moving
steadily towards an employee society of organizations. Now this trend is
reversing itself. The developed countries, with the United States in the
lead, are fast moving towards a network society – in respect to the
relationship between organizations and individuals who work for them,
and in respect to the relationships between different organizations.</p>
<p>There were, of course, plenty of employed people before 1860 and 1870
when Big Business and Big Civil Service emerged as the first modern
organizations. There were domestic servants and hired hands on the farm;
sales clerks in the small store; journeymen and apprentices in the
craftsman’s shop. But these people did not work for an ‘organization’:
they worked for a ‘master’ or a ‘mistress’. In 1913 – the year before
the First World War – fewer than a fifth of the labour force worked for
an organization – primarily as blue-collar workers in industry. And most
of these still worked in small family-owned enterprises rather than in
big businesses. Forty years later, in the 1950s, employees of large
organizations dominated every developed economy – as blue-collar workers
and managers in industry; as civil servants in giant government
agencies; as nurses in rapidly growing hospitals; as teachers in even
faster-growing universities. The best-selling books of those years were
jeremiads about the ‘Organization Man’ who immerses himself into grey
conformity and puts loyalty to the organization above everything else.
Few people then doubted that by 1990 almost everyone in the workforce
would be an employee of an organization, and probably of a big one.</p>
<p>A substantially larger proportion of adults now participate in the US
labour force than did thirty or forty years ago. Most of them – and
especially the great majority of educated people – do indeed work for an
organization. But increasingly they are not employees of that
organization. They are contractors, part-timers, temporaries (‘temps’).
Recently I ran a three-day seminar for some 300 alumni of one of the
major US graduate business schools – mostly people in their late
thirties or early forties, and highly successful. Practically every one
of them worked for an organization – but barely half of them as
employees. Fewer still expected to spend their entire working life as
employees of an organization. One participant – a forty-five-year old
metallurgist – only five years ago was an executive of a Fortune 500
Company. Today he is on his own and retained by five different
companies, one of them his former employer. ‘There simply wasn’t enough
for me to do in the old company’ he said. ‘It has a serious
metallurgical problem only three or four times a year. The rest of the
time I wrote memoranda. Now, when that company has a metallurgical
problem I dive right in – not as a consultant but as a full-time member
of the team and as its leader. But I stay only until we’ve licked the
problem. I work the same way for my other four clients.’ Then there was
the thirty-eight-year-old information specialist who similarly works as
a ‘permanent temp’ for a number of state agencies in the Midwest. There
was the woman executive of an ‘outsourcing’ firm who described herself
as an ‘itinerant member of top management’ in the twenty large hospitals
for which her company keeps the books and does housekeeping and
maintenance. Among the participants there were also an engineer on the
payroll of a ‘temporary-help’ firm who works as plant manager for large
companies – usually on a three-year contract – whenever such a company
builds and runs in a new plant; the woman physician who similarly works
as a ‘temp’ in setting up emergency departments in hospitals; and a
former college dean who works as a ‘full-time temp’ – for a year at a
time – setting up and running fund-raising campaigns for small and
medium-sized colleges.</p>
<p>Temporary and part-time work emerged some thirty-five years ago to
supply typists, receptionists, and checkers in the supermarket – people
of relatively low skill. At first the temps filled in whenever a regular
employee was sick or went on vacation. Increasingly temps do high-skill
and high-status work. And increasingly temps work for the same
organization for long periods of time. In the United States the number
of temporary-employment agencies doubled in the five years 1989–1994:
from 3500 firms to 7000. A good deal of this growth, perhaps half if not
more, is in agencies providing professionals – all the way up to senior
managers – rather than low-skill people or people to fill entry
positions.</p>
<p>Relations between organizations are changing just as fast as
relations between organizations and the people who work for them. The
most visible example is ‘outsourcing’, in which a company, a hospital, a
government agency, turns over an entire activity to an independent firm
that specializes in that kind of work. Hospitals – first in the United
States and now, increasingly, in Japan as well – have been turning over
maintenance and housekeeping to outsourcing firms for many years now;
increasingly they are now outsourcing their data processing and their
business management. Outsourcing the information system has become
routine – for businesses, for government agencies, for universities, for
hospitals. In only one recent day (13 March 1995) two such outsourcing
ventures were announced. The largest hospital company in the United
States, Columbia/HCA Healthcare, announced that it had outsourced the
purchasing and maintenance of all diagnostic instruments in its 300
hospitals to the Medical-Electronics Group of the General Electric
Company, the world’s largest manufacturer of such instruments. Yet these
diagnostic instruments are the core of a modern hospital. They are its
biggest investment – amounting at Columbia/HCA Healthcare to many
billions of dollars; its biggest revenue producer; but also the key to a
hospital’s medical performance. On the same day IBM, still the world’s
largest computer maker, announced the formation of a new business
(called Network Station Management) to purchase, maintain, and manage
the many thousands of PCs in large companies – by now the largest single
investment in the office of the typical US big company.</p>
<p>In another ten or fifteen years, organizations may have outsourced
all work that is ‘support’ rather than ‘revenue producing’ and all
activities which do not offer career opportunities into senior
management. This would mean that in many organizations a majority of
people who work for it might not be its employees but employees of an
outsourcing contractor.</p>
<p>More important even may be the trend towards Alliances as the vehicle
for business growth. Downsizing, divestments, mergers, acquisitions –
these dominate the headlines. But the greatest change in corporate
structure – and in the way business is being conducted – may be the
largely unreported growth of relationships which are based not on
ownership but on partnership: joint ventures; minority investments
cementing a joint-marketing agreement or an agreement to do joint
research; semi-formal alliances of all sorts. Japanese computer makers
are gaining access to software technology by buying minority stakes in
high-tech Silicon Valley firms. Large pharmaceuticals companies – both
American and European – gain access to research in genetics, in medical
electronics, in biotechnology, by similarly buying minority stakes in
start-up firms in these new disciplines, or by going into partnership
with university research labs. Banks gain access to new investment
markets by going into partnership with small, independent asset managers
– with or without putting in any money. And there are any number of even
less formal ‘alliances’ – most of them unreported – like the one between
the world’s leading designer of microchips, Intel, and Sharp, a major
Japanese manufacturer. Intel will do the research and design; Sharp the
manufacturing. Each company will separately then market the resulting
new products – and, apparently neither firm is investing a penny in the
other one. In telecommunications there are the ‘consortia’ in which
three or more big established telephone companies – one American, one
English, one Swedish, for instance – team up to obtain licences for
cellular-phone services all over the world, or for cable television, or
to buy together into an old government monopoly system about to be
privatized. Like outsourcing, the trend towards alliances of this sort
in which nobody has control – that is, toward partnerships – is
accelerating. One reason is that no one company, not even the telephone
giants, has enough money to swing the deal alone. A more important one
is that no one company has by itself the needed technology. And in many
parts of the world, especially in ‘emerging countries’ like Coastal
China or Malaysia, business cannot be done except through a joint
venture or an alliance with a local partner. ‘Today,’ the CEO of a major
pharmaceuticals company said recently, ‘80 per cent of our sales and
profits come from products we make in plants we own a hundred per cent
and sell through wholly owned subsidiaries. In ten years more than half
of all we sell – and we plan on doubling in volume during that period –
will come from joint ventures, licences, alliances, and from products
made by companies in which we have either no investment or only a
minority stake but for which we are the research and/or marketing
partner. It is simply impossible for us – and we are among the world’s
research leaders – to have enough scientific expertise in all the new
fields. It is equally impossible for us – and we pride ourselves on our
marketing organization – to serve all the new channels through which
health-care products will be marketed as the health-care systems of the
world are re-engineering themselves.’</p>
<p>Not quite thirty years ago, in 1967, the world’s business-bestseller
was Le Défi Américain (The American Challenge) by Jean-Jacques
Servan-Schreiber, a French journalist. It predicted that by 1985 or 1990
the world’s economies would be owned and run by a mere dozen or so huge
American multinationals whose plants would produce some 90 per cent of
the world’s manufactured goods. Even earlier, in 1955, the Fortune 500
had made bigness the measurement of business success. Bigger was better,
whether in business, in government, in the hospital, in the university.
And in that big organization – as in Servan-Schreiber’s giant American
multinational – one top management controlled everything and ran
everything. Everyone who worked for or with that big company was its
full-time employee. By the time Servan-Schreiber published his book the
tide in the world economy had already turned: both the Europeans and the
Japanese were giving the Americans a run for their money. A few years
later the growth dynamics in the US economy (and soon thereafter in the
European economies as well) were beginning to shift towards the
medium-sized company. But still, the basic structures of organizations
and of employment seemed to remain what they had been for a century. Now
both are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>Even if twenty years hence the majority of managers and professionals
will still be employees of the organization they work for, the
psychology of the workforce – and especially of the knowledge workforce
– will largely be determined by the large minority who are not employees
of that organization, whether they are employees of an outsourcing firm,
of a partnership organization or half-independent contractors. For the
organizations and their top managements this means that they had better
stop talking about ‘loyalty’. They will have to earn the trust of the
people who work for them, whether these people are its own employees or
not. Even the professional or executive who has no intention of leaving
the company’s employ will know that there are opportunities outside –
they already know that, even in Japan. And even professionals or
executives who would much prefer to stay with the company they now work
for will know that there is now no such thing as ‘lifetime employment’ –
such as was the rule in the big US or European company only a few years
ago and is still considered the rule (though with great doubts) in the
big Japanese company. Even in government service where lifetime tenure
has been the rule for a century or longer, radical downsizing,
privatization, shutting down whole agencies is surely going to occur in
all developed (and in most emerging) countries. Conversely, individual
professionals and executives will have to learn that they must take
responsibility for placing themselves – both within their organization
and outside of it. This means, above all, that they must know their
strengths. Most résumés I get – and I get several from former students
every day – list the jobs the person has held. A few then describe the
job the person would like to get. Very, very few even mention what the
person has done well and can do well. Even fewer state what a future
employer can and should expect from that person. Very, very few, in
other words, yet look upon themselves as a ‘product’ that has to be
marketed.</p>
<p>Equally novel are the demands partnerships and alliances make on
managing a business and its relationships. Executives are used to
command. They are used to think through what they want and then to get
acceptance of it by subordinates. Even Japanese ‘consensus management’
is a way to get acceptance by the organization of whatever the
higher-ups have decided should be done – and so is the much-touted
‘participative management’. But in a partnership – whether with an
outsourcing contractor, with a joint-venture partner, with a company in
which one holds a minority stake – one cannot command. One can only gain
trust. Specifically, that means that one must not start out with the
question ‘What do we want to do?’ The right question is ‘What do they
want to do? What are their objectives? Their values? Their ways of doing
things?’ Again, these are marketing relationships – and in marketing one
starts with the customer rather than with one’s own product.</p>
<p>I asked the participants in that alumni seminar a few months ago what
to call this new organization and its society. At first they said ‘Call
it free-form’. But then they reconsidered and said ’Call it the Network
society</p>
