<h4 id="we-need-to-measure-not-count">11. We need to measure, not
count</h4>
<p>Quantification has been the rage in business and economics these past
fifty years. Accountants have proliferated as fast as lawyers. Yet we do
not have the measurements we need.</p>
<p>Neither our concepts nor our tools are adequate for the control of
operations or for managerial control. And, so far, there are neither the
concepts nor the tools for business control – that is, for economic
decision making. In the past few years, however, we have become
increasingly aware of the need for such measurements. And in one area,
the operational control of manufacturing, the needed work has actually
been done.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting in manufacturing – now seventy-five years
old – does not record the cost of non-producing, such as the cost of
faulty quality, or of a machine being out of order, or of needed parts
not being on hand. Yet these unrecorded and uncontrolled costs in some
plants run as high as the costs that traditional accounting does record.
By contrast, a new method of cost accounting developed in the past ten
years – called ‘activity-based’ accounting – records all costs, And it
relates them, as traditional cost accounting cannot, to value added.
Within the next ten years it should be in general use. And then we will
have operational control in manufacturing.</p>
<p>But this control will be in manufacturing only. We still will not
have cost control in services: schools, banks, government agencies,
hospitals, hotels, retail stores, research labs, architectural firms,
and so on. We know how much a service takes in, how much it spends and
on what. But we do not know how the spending relates to the work the
service organization does and to its results – one of the reasons the
costs of hospitals, colleges, and the post office are out of control.
Yet in every developed country, two-thirds to three-quarters of total
output, employment, and costs are in services.</p>
<p>A few big banks are just beginning to implement cost accounting for
services. Though results so far are quite spotty, we have found out a
few important things. In contrast to cost accounting in manufacturing,
cost accounting for services will have to be top-down, starting with the
cost of the entire system over a given period. How the work is organized
matters far more than it does in manufacturing. Quality and productivity
are as important to cost in services as is quantity of output. In most
services, teams are the cost centre rather than individuals or machines.
And in services, the key is not ‘cost’ but ‘cost-effectiveness’. But
these are still only beginnings.</p>
<p>Even if we had the measurements we need for manufacturing and for
services, we would still not have true operational control. We would
still treat the individual organization – the manufacturer, the bank,
the hospital – as the cost centre. But the costs that matter are the
costs of the entire economic process in which the individual
manufacturer, bank, or hospital is only a link in the chain. The costs
of the entire process are what the ultimate customer (or the taxpayer)
pays and what determines whether a product, a service, an industry, or
an economy is competitive. A large part of these costs are
‘interstitial’ – incurred between, say, the parts supplier and
manufacturer, or between the manufacturer and distributor, and recorded
by neither.</p>
<p>The cost advantage of the Japanese derives in considerable measure
from their control of these costs within a keiretsu, the ‘family’ of
suppliers and distributors clustered around a manufacturer. Treating the
keiretsu as one cost stream led, for instance, to ‘just-in-time’ parts
delivery. It also enabled the keiretsu to shift operations to where they
are most cost-effective.</p>
<p>Process-costing from the machine in the supplier’s plant to the
checkout counter in the store also underlies the phenomenal rise of
Wal-Mart. It resulted in the elimination of a whole slew of warehouses
and of reams of paperwork, which slashed costs by a third. But
process-costing requires a redesign of relationships and changes in
habits and behaviour. It requires compatible accounting systems where
organizations now pride themselves on having their own unique method. It
requires choosing what is cost-effective rather than what is cheapest.
It requires joint decisions within the entire chain as to who does
what.</p>
<p>Similarly drastic are the changes needed for effective managerial
control. Balance sheets were designed to show what a business would be
worth if liquidated today. Budgets are meant to ensure that money is
spent only where authorized. What managements need, however, are balance
sheets that relate the enterprise’s current condition to its future
wealth-producing capacity, both short term and long term. Managements
need budgets that relate proposed expenditures to future results but
also provide follow-up information that shows whether promised results
have actually been achieved.</p>
<p>So far, we have only bits and pieces: the cash-flow forecast, for
example, or the analysis of proposed capital investments. Now, however,
for the first time, some large multinational companies – American and
European – are beginning to put these pieces together into
‘going-concern’ balance sheets and ‘going-concern’ budgets.</p>
<p>But most needed – and totally lacking – are measurements to give us
business control. Financial accounting, balance sheets, profit-and-loss
statements, allocation of costs, and so forth are an X-ray of the
enterprise’s skeleton. But much as the diseases we most commonly die
from – heart disease, cancer, Parkinson’s – do not show up in a skeletal
X-ray, a loss of market standing or a failure to innovate does not
register in the accountant’s figures until the damage has been done.</p>
<p>We need new measurements – call them a ‘business audit’ – to give us
effective business control. We need measurements for a company or
industry that are akin to the ‘leading indicators’ and ‘lagging
indicators’ that economists have developed during the past half-century
to predict the direction in which the economy is likely to move and for
how long. For the first time, big institutional investors, including
some of the very large pension funds, are working on such concepts and
tools to measure the business performance of the companies in which they
invest.</p>
<p>These are only beginnings. And so far, each of these areas is being
worked on separately. Indeed, the people working in one field – for
example, pension funds – may not even be aware of the work done in other
areas.</p>
<p>It may take many years, decades perhaps, until we have the
measurements we need in all these areas. But at least we know now that
we need new measurements, and we know what they have to be. Slowly, and
still gropingly, we are moving from counting to measuring.</p>
