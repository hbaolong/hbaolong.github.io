<h4 id="the-end-of-japan-inc">18. The end of Japan, Inc?</h4>
<p>Japan, Inc., is in disarray. Individual Japanese companies compete
just as aggressively as before on the world market. But no distinctive
Japanese policy exists any more, least of all in economics. Instead,
short-term fixes and panicky reactions to the unexpected are the norm.
As in the West, these are no substitutes for policy, and they are having
little, if any, success. Part of the problem is that none of Japan’s
available choices looks attractive: none would produce consensus. They
would instead cause division among the nation’s major groups –
bureaucrats, politicians, business leaders, academia, and labour.
Japanese newspapers are full of plaints about ‘weak leadership’. But
that is only a symptom. The root problem is that the four pillars on
which Japanese policy has been based for over thirty years have
collapsed or are tottering.</p>
<p>The first pillar of Japanese policy was the belief that Japan was so
important as a bulwark against Soviet Communism that the United States
would subordinate economic interests to the maintenance of Tokyo’s
political stability and to the US–Japanese strategic alliance. During
the 1970s and 1980s US ambassador Mike Mansfield repeatedly asserted the
priority of the US-Japanese political relationship over all.other
considerations. The same priorities clearly existed in the Bush
administration. The Japanese assumed, correctly, that no matter how loud
the American bark, the bite would be only a nip and draw no blood.</p>
<p>Japan must now question this assumption. Will the Clinton
administration subordinate US economic interests, real or perceived, to
alliance politics? To be sure, America declares itself committed to the
defence of Japan, were the country to be attacked by armed force.
However, the Japanese are beginning to realize that the United States
will increasingly exact a substantial economic price for this political
support – and just at a time when China, Japan’s big neighbour, has
become the world’s one major power that is increasing its military
strength. The Europeans, who never subscribed to the Mansfield thesis,
are less encumbered. In the next few years, Europe will be deciding not
only how many Japanese-made goods to let in, but also whether goods made
within Europe by Japanese companies can be sold freely and in large
quantities on European markets.</p>
<p>The second pillar of Japan’s economic policy was the belief that its
businesses could dominate world markets by projecting Western trends and
then doing better and faster what the West was doing slowly and
halfheartedly. Such a strategy, first used in the early 1960s by Sony
for transistor radios, followed a few years later by camera and
copier-makers, has hit one bull’s-eye after another. It can still be a
winning strategy – witness the way the Japanese outflanked European
luxury cars on the American market in the last few years, or speedily
took over the faxmachine business from the Americans who invented
it.</p>
<p>But these successes are no longer a sure thing. The strategy has
failed in computers. Projecting where IBM was going and then attempting
to outmanouevre it made the Japanese miss the growth industries of
workstations and networking. In computer chips, the Japanese fumbled the
shift to high-value, dedicated circuits and instead concentrated on
low-value commodity products, in which they are now being hard pressed
by producers from low-wage countries. In telecommunications, the
Japanese missed the swing to over-the-air telephone transmission
(cellular phones), where world market growth is likely to occur. In
consumer electronics and high-definition television, where the final
returns are not yet in, the Japanese are again on the defensive instead
of delivering knockout blows.</p>
<p>Even though quantitatively Japan’s export surplus with the United
States rose again in 1992, qualitatively it is deteriorating. Almost
three-quarters of it is now being earned by the products of one old
industry with saturated markets in every developed country; cars. Even
there the Japanese are no longer taking business away from US producers
but rather from European imports. To be sure, General Motors is still
losing market share, but now to Ford and Chrysler.</p>
<p>Japan’s third traditional pillar of strength was the assumption that
the country’s domestic economy was largely immune to outside troubles.
Underpinning this belief was the knowledge that the preponderance of
imports are foodstuffs and raw materials and the preponderance of
exports are manufactured goods. In a recession raw-materials prices
slide faster and farther than manufactured-goods prices – that is, the
prices of Japan’s exports. Hence both Japan’s terms of trade (its
relative economic strength) and balance of trade (its absolute economic
strength) tend to improve when the world economy goes down.</p>
<p>This equation still works. It largely explains the persistent
Japanese trade surplus of the last few years. The depression in the
world prices of foodstuffs and raw materials – now in its second decade
– constitutes a massive subsidy to the Japanese economy. It gets its raw
materials and its foodstuffs for about half of 1979 prices, in relation
to the prices of manufactured goods. Yet at home Japan has now been
mired in recession for more than two years. Employment, output, profits,
and investments are still declining, and all four, it seems, are
determined by trends in the world economy from which Japan should be
immune.</p>
<p>The fourth pillar was the commitment to long-term policy, with the
flexibility to make exceptions, to cater for special interests, and to
seize opportunities. It was periodically reviewed and, if necessary,
updated or revised. The strategy shunned short-term quick fixes whose
ineffectualness would jeopardize national consensus.</p>
<p>Commitment to long-term policy was maintained for twenty-five years,
from the 1960s until 1985, when floating the over-valued US dollar led
to a 50 per cent drop against the yen in just a few months. The Japanese
panicked at the threat to their exports, two-fifths of which went to the
United States. To shore up lifetime employment and social stability by
replacing the lost sales and profits of exports, the government rushed
into a frenzied campaign to stimulate domestic consumption.</p>
<p>Whether Japan’s manufacturers really needed such a heavy shot of
economic adrenalin is debatable. Most adjusted quickly to the lower
value of the dollar and to lower export earnings. Needed or not,
stimulating domestic consumption could not have come at a worse time for
the Japanese economy. It occurred just when purchasing power and
lifestyles were shifting rapidly from a consumption-shy older
generation, still scarred by wartime and post-war deprivations, to the
‘yuppies’ of the ‘baby boom’. The government policy thus kicked off the
biggest spending spree in economic history. It also ignited a
speculative firestorm in real estate and stock prices. Three years ago,
at the height of what the Japanese now call the ‘bubble economy’, shares
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were quoted at fifty or sixty times pretax
earnings (that is, at an after-tax yield of less than 1 per cent). Real
estate in Tokyo’s better office districts was mortgaged for up to fifty
times annual rental income.</p>
<p>The bubble burst in early 1990 with the stock market losing half its
value in just a few months. If savings banks, commercial banks, and
insurance companies had been forced to write down to realistic values
their holdings of shares and real estate loans, there would have been
massive financial collapse. Instead of organizing a managed and
controlled retreat – akin to US management of Latin American loans and
real estate loans by commercial banks and thrifts – Japan is pretending
the losses never happened. Massive government purchase of stocks and
bonds accounted for one-third of all purchases on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in the spring of 1993. The official line is that the markets
‘must’ go up as soon as the economy recovers, allowing the government to
sell its equity holdings and even to make a profit. But that has never
worked. The very existence of such holdings puts a lid on the market.
And every day of postponement in facing financial reality makes the
problem less tractable, more controversial, more divisive, and more
politically corrosive.</p>
<p>The official line in Japan is still that the country will return to
the traditional long-term policy once the situation becomes ‘normal’
again. It is doubtful that any informed Japanese, in or out of
government, takes this profession seriously. The likelihood is that
Japan will not, in the foreseeable future, return to having an economic
policy. Rather, it will increasingly look like the major Western
countries, whose economic irresolution and lack of direction the
Japanese have been deriding for years. There will be no more ‘Japan,
Inc.’, no consensus, and no one policy-setting group steering the
economy through ‘administrative guidance’. Individual companies,
industries, and interest groups will go their own way, both domestically
and internationally. Instead of ‘policy’ there will be ad hoc,
short-term measures and perhaps also increasing immobility (probably
accompanied, as in the West, by increasingly grandiose promises).</p>
<p>This policy discord will be universally deplored in Japan, as it is
in the West, but it will not be universally unpopular. Leading
manufacturers, especially those who are successful on the world markets,
prefer a return to the days of a consistent economic policy in the hands
of a powerful government bureaucracy. But many other Japanese business
leaders are disenchanted with ‘administrative guidance’, which committed
them in the last ten years to such strategic blunders as the emphasis on
mainframe computers and supercomputers and the maintenance of the
monopolies in telecommunications and telecommunications equipment.</p>
<p>If there is no consensus policy and no administrative guidance,
individual Japanese companies should become tougher competitors on the
world market. Their response to market opportunities and market
challenges will be quicker. They are likely to work even harder on the
three prongs of competition with which they attack Western competitors:
control of the economics of the entire production and distribution
process rather than accounting control of the costs of each step;
zero-defects quality; and shortening development, production, and
delivery cycles by spending money to save time.</p>
<p>Already, individual companies have shifted from the traditional
strategy of outguessing and outflanking Western competitors to genuine
research aimed at innovative breakthroughs. Just as some individual
companies in the West have prospered by doing things entirely their own
way, so some Japanese companies can be expected to prosper greatly by
doing things their own way rather than the ‘Japanese way’. But it
remains questionable whether the Japanese economy as a whole will do any
better without a consistent long-range policy and strong leadership than
have the short-term-driven Western economies of the United States, the
United Kingdom, France, or Germany.</p>
<p>The United States should, but probably will not, refrain from
gloating and ‘Japan bashing’. A financial crisis in Japan is the last
thing the United States or anyone else in the developed world needs. Nor
is it in America’s interest for the world’s second-largest economy to
have a disorganized and drifting government or an increasingly
disoriented society. Such circumstances could only mean that the
Japanese would start hunting for a scapegoat and would find it in
Americans.</p>
<p>Washington will rightfully press Tokyo much harder to eliminate the
obstacles to the entry on fair terms of American goods, services, and
investments. Japan is not nearly as protectionist as the American public
believes – or else American manufactured goods exports to Japan would
not have almost doubled in the last ten years, particularly in
high-technology products. In fact as a proportion of total US – Japanese
trade, the deficit is now only a fraction of what it was ten years ago.
And Japan is still the best customer by far for American foodstuffs and
forest products, all of which the Japanese could easily buy from other
suppliers at the same price and quality.</p>
<p>Still, there are real obstacles to foreign business in Japan. For
better or worse, the disappearance of the Soviet threat means that there
is now no reason the United States should not demand the same access for
its products, service, and investments that the Japanese enjoy to the
far less restricted US markets.</p>
<p>Washington needs a trade policy that focuses on those areas where
removing Japanese barriers would actually make a difference. This means,
for instance, forgetting about the Japanese ban on rice imports. US
nagging on rice helps no one but the Japanese politicians who skilfully
blame American pressure for whittling down increasingly onerous
subsidies to Japan’s politically powerful rice growers. If any foreign
country gets to supply Japan with large quantities of rice, it will not
be California; it will be lower-cost Thailand or Vietnam. Also,
penalizing Japanese car imports, a move that Detroit’s Big Three have
been clamouring for, is nothing but pure emotion; the car workers’ union
would applaud, but it would not help Detroit at all. It would, however,
greatly help the major Japanese car manufacturers’ public relations.
Such demands would give them the pretext they badly need to speed up
their plans to move production for the US market entirely out of Japan
and into their US plants, where costs are actually lower than they are
at home. It would give them a perfect excuse for doing the politically
unthinkable but economically inevitable – laying off Japanese workers
who have lifetime employment.</p>
<p>Beyond using a little more intelligence and a good deal less rhetoric
in relations with Japan, the only thing Washington can do is to
understand the transition Japan is going through. It needs to take Japan
seriously, for it is the only big customer left for US farm and forest
products and one of America’s biggest manufactured-goods customers.
Japan is still the only fully developed and democratic non-Western
country, with the world’s second-largest economy. It is not a happy omen
that there is, apparently, no one in a senior policy-making position in
the present administration who seems to know or care much about
Japan.</p>
