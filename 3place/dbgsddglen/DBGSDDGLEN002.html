<h4 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>From the very beginning, in 1991, every piece in this volume was
written with this book in mind. But every single one was also
prepublished, intentionally so. It is the reaction of readers – and
especially of friends all over the world, former students, present and
former clients – which ultimately determine whether a piece is worthy of
being included in the final book. Prepublication is, so to speak, my
market test.</p>
<p>For the most part, the pieces chosen appear as chapters in this book
without any change other than perhaps a new title or a restoration of
cuts that had to be made to fit a piece into a magazine or newspaper.
But three long pieces in this book are substantially different from the
version in which they were published originally – they are much longer.
Chapter 21 (‘A century of social transformation’) was published only in
an abridged version in The Atlantic Monthly and so was Chapter 25 (‘Can
the democracies win the peace?’) Chapter 13 (‘Trade lessons from the
world economy’) was similarly published only in an abridged version in
Foreign Affairs magazine. The other long chapters – the two interviews
which open and close the book; Chapters 1, 7 and 12 (all three first
published in the Harvard Business Review); Chapter 18 (first published
in Foreign Affairs); and Chapter 24 (first published in The Atlantic
Monthly) – are published in this book the way they first appeared in
print. Of the short pieces – reprinted virtually unchanged except for an
occasional change in title – all but one first appeared in The Wall
Street Journal. Chapter 16 first appeared in the Asian Wall Street
Journal under the sponsorship of Citibank. The May 1955 epilogue to
Chapter 24 was written especially for this book.</p>
<p>This is the fourth book of mine which owes its focus and structure to
my friend, editor, and publisher M. Truman Talley, of Truman Talley
Books. It was Mr Talley who fifteen years ago first had the idea that I
might organize my articles and essays written over a period of years
around a common idea and towards a common objective. Each piece was to
be written separately and had to stand on its own. But eventually the
pieces would form a unit – as does this book. Prepublication would test
them, or rather would allow them to be tested by executives all over the
world. Pieces that proved to contribute the most to their readers’
effectiveness would be selected for republication in a book. The idea
has proven extraordinarily productive. The three earlier books which
resulted from it – published respectively in 1982 (The Changing Work of
the Executive), 1986 (The Frontiers of Management), and 1992 (Managing
for the Future) – have been extremely successful, both in their original
English editions and in a large number of translations. They have also
proven extremely effective as tools, guides, thought-starters, and
action-starters for practising executives and managers worldwide. To M.
Truman Talley my readers and I thus owe a large debt of gratitude. And I
want to express my gratitude also to Mr Talley’s associates, the
managing editor and the production editor, who worked hard to turn a
manuscript into a handsome book.</p>
<p>Interview: The post-capitalist executive An interview with the
Harvard Business Review Conducted by T. George Harris</p>
<p>For half a century, Peter F. Drucker has been teacher and adviser to
senior managers in business, human service organizations, and
government. Sometimes called the godfather of modern management, he
combines an acute understanding of socio-economic forces with practical
insights into how leaders can turn turbulence into opportunity. With a
rare gift for synthesis, Drucker nourishes his insatiable mind on a full
range of intellectual disciplines, from Japanese art to network theory
in higher mathematics. Yet he learns most from in-depth conversation
with clients and students: a global network of men and women who draw
their ideas from action and act on ideas.</p>
<p>Since 1946, when his book Concept of the Corporation redefined
employees as a resource rather than a cost, Drucker’s works have become
an ever-growing resource for leaders in every major culture,
particularly among Japan’s top decision makers in the critical stages of
their rise to world business leadership. A goodly share of productive
organizations worldwide are led by men and women who consider Drucker
their intellectual guide, if not their personal mentor.</p>
<p>Drucker’s most productive insigts have often appeared first in the
Harvard Business Review. He has written thirty HBR articles, more than
any other contributor. In the September–October 1992 issue, he published
core concepts from his major new work Post-Capitalist Society
(HarperCollins, 1993). HBR editors sent T. George Harris, a Drucker
friend for twenty-four years, to the Drucker Management Center at the
Claremont Graduate School in California for two days of intensive
conversation about the book’s practical implications for today’s
executives.</p>
<p>HBR: Peter, you always bring ideas down to the gut level where people
work and live. Now we need to know how managers can operate in the
post-capitalist society.</p>
<p>Peter F. Drucker: You have to learn to manage in situations where you
don’t have command authority, where you are neither controlled nor
controlling. That is the fundamental change. Management textbooks still
talk mainly about managing subordinates. But you no longer evaluate an
executive in terms of how many people report to him or her. That
standard doesn’t mean as much as the complexity of the job, the
information it uses and generates, and the different kinds of
relationships needed to do the work.</p>
<p>Similarly, business news still refers to managing subsidiaries. But
this is the control approach of the 1950s or 1960s. The reality is that
the multinational corporation is rapidly becoming an endangered species.
Businesses used to grow in one of two ways: from grassroots up or by
acquisition. In both cases, the manager had control. Today businesses
grow through alliances, all kinds of dangerous liaisons and joint
ventures, which, by the way, very few people understand. This new type
of growth upsets the traditional manager, who believes he or she must
own or control sources and markets.</p>
<p>How will the manager operate in a work environment free of the old
hierarchies?</p>
<p>Would you believe that you’re going to work permanently with people
who work for you but are not your employees? Increasingly, for instance,
you outsource when possible. It is predictable, then, that ten years
from now a company will outsource all work that does not have a career
ladder up to senior management. To get productivity, you have to
outsource activities that have their own senior management. Believe me,
the trend toward outsourcing has very little to do with economizing and
a great deal to do with quality.</p>
<p>Can you give an example?</p>
<p>Take a hospital. Everybody there knows how important cleanliness is,
but doctors and nurses are never going to be very concerned with how you
sweep in corners. That’s not part of their value system. They need a
hospital maintenance company. One company I got to know in southern
California had a cleaning woman who came in as an illiterate Latina
immigrant. She is brilliant. She figured out how to split a bedsheet so
that the bed of a very sick patient, no matter how heavy, could be
changed. Using her method, you have to move the patient about only six
inches, and she cut the bed-making time from twelve minutes to two. Now
she’s in charge of the cleaning operations, but she is not an employee
of the hospital. The hospital can’t give her one single order. It can
only say, ‘We don’t like this; we’ll work it out’.</p>
<p>The point is, managers still talk about the people who ‘report’ to
them, but that word should be stricken from management vocabulary.
Information is replacing authority. A company treasurer with outsourced
information technology, IT, may have only two assistants and a
receptionist, but his decisions on foreign exchange can lose or make
more money in a day than the rest of the company makes all year. A
scientist decides which research not to do in a big company lab. He
doesn’t even have a secretary or a title, but his track record means
that he is not apt to be overruled. He may have more effect than the
CEO. In the military, a lieutenant-colonel used to command a battalion,
but today he may have only a receptionist and be in charge of liaison
with a major foreign country.</p>
<p>Amid these new circumstances, everybody is trying to build the ideal
organization, generally flat with few layers of bosses and driven
directly by consumer satisfaction. But how do managers gear up their
lives for this new world?</p>
<p>More than anything else, the individual has to take more
responsibility for himself or herself, rather than depend on the
company. In this country, and in Europe and even Japan, you can’t expect
that if you’ve worked for a company for five years you’ll be there when
you retire forty years from now. Nor can you expect that you will be
able to do what you want to do at the company in forty years’ time. In
fact, if you make a wager on any big company, the chances of it being
split within the next ten years are better than the chances of it
remaining the way it is.</p>
<p>This is a new trend. Big corporations became stable factors before
the First World War and in the 1920s were almost frozen. Many survived
the Depression without change. Then there were thirty or forty years
when additional stories were built onto skyscrapers or more wings added
onto corporate centres. But now they’re not going to build corporate
skyscrapers. In fact, within the past ten years, the proportion of the
workforce employed by Fortune 500 companies has fallen from 30 per cent
to 13 per cent.</p>
<p>Corporations once built to last like pyramids are now more like
tents. Tomorrow they’re gone or in turmoil. And this is true not only of
companies in the headlines like Sears or GM or IBM. Technology is
changing very quickly, as are markets and structures. You can’t design
your life around a temporary organization.</p>
<p>Let me give you a simple example of the way assumptions are changing.
Most men and women in the executive programme I teach are about
forty-five years old and just below senior management in a big
organization or running a mid-size one. When we began fifteen or twenty
years ago, people at this stage were asking, ‘How can we prepare
ourselves for the next promotion?’ Now they say, ‘What do I need to
learn so that I can decide where to go next?’</p>
<p>If a young man in a grey flannel suit represented the lifelong
corporate type, what’s today s image?</p>
<p>Taking individual responsibility and not depending on any particular
company. Equally important is managing your own career. The stepladder
is gone, and there’s not even the implied structure of an industry’s
rope ladder. It’s more like vines, and you bring your own machete. You
don’t know what you’ll be doing next, or whether you’ll work in a
private office or one big amphitheatre or even out of your home. You
have to take responsibility for knowing yourself, so you can find the
right jobs as you develop and as your family becomes a factor in your
values and choices.</p>
<p>That’s a significant departure from what managers could expect in the
past</p>
<p>Well, the changes in the manager’s work are appearing everywhere,
though on different timetables. For instance, I see more career
confusion among the many Japanese students I’ve had over the years.
They’re totally bewildered. Though the Japanese are more structured than
we ever were, suddenly they are halfway between being totally managed
and having to take responsibility for themselves. What frightens them is
that titles don’t mean what they used to mean. Whether you were in India
or France, if you were an assistant director of market research,
everybody used to know what you were doing. That’s no longer true, as we
found in one multinational. A woman who had just completed a management
course told me not long ago that in five years she would be an assistant
vice president of her bank. I’m afraid I had to tell her that she might
indeed get the title, but it would no longer have the meaning she
thought it did.</p>
<p>Another rung in the ladder?</p>
<p>Yes. The big-company mentality. Most people expect the personnel
department to be Pa or Ma Bell. When the ATandandandandT personnel
department was at its high point thirty years ago, it was the power
behind the scenes. With all their testing and career planning, they’d
know that a particular twenty-seven-year-old would be, by age
forty-five, an assistant operating manager and no more. They didn’t know
whether he’d be in Nebraska or Florida. But unless he did something
quite extraordinary, his career path until retirement was set.</p>
<p>Times have certainly changed. And, in fact, the Bell people have done
better than most, because they could see that change coming in the
antitrust decision. They couldn’t ignore it. But most people still have
a big-company mentality buried in their assumptions. If they lose a job
with Sears, they hunt for one with K Mart, unaware that small companies
create most of the new jobs and are about as secure as big
companies.</p>
<p>Even today, remarkably few Americans are prepared to select jobs for
themselves. When you ask, ‘Do you know what you are good at? Do you know
your limitations?’ they look at you with a blank stare. Or they often
respond in terms of subject knowledge, which is the wrong answer. When
they prepare their resumés, they still try to list positions like steps
up a ladder. It is time to give up thinking of jobs or career paths as
we once did and think in terms of taking assignments one after the
other.</p>
<p>How does one prepare for this new kind of managerial career?</p>
<p>Being an educated person is no longer adequate, not even educated in
management. One hears that the government is doing research on new job
descriptions based on subject knowledge. But I think that we probably
have to leap right over the search for objective criteria and get into
the subjective what I call competencies. Do you really like pressure?
Can you be steady when things are rough and confused? Do you absorb
information better by reading, talking, or looking at graphs and
numbers? I asked one executive the other day, ‘When you sit down with a
person, a subordinate, do you know what to say?’ Empathy is a practical
competence. I have been urging this kind of self-knowledge for years,
but now it is essential for survival.</p>
<p>People, especially the young, think that they want all the freedom
they can get, but it is very demanding, very difficult to think through
who you are and what you do best. In helping people learn how to be
responsible, our educational system is more and more counterproductive.
The longer you stay in school, the fewer decisions you have to make. For
instance, the decision whether to take French II or Art History is
really based on whether one likes to get up early in the morning. And
graduate school is much worse.</p>
<p>Do you know why most people start with big companies? Because most
graduates have not figured out where to place themselves, and companies
send in the recruiters. But as soon as the recruits get through training
and into a job, they have to start making decisions about the future.
Nobody’s going to do it for them.</p>
<p>And once they start making decisions, many of the best move to
mid-size companies in three to five years, because there they can break
through to top management. With less emphasis on seniority, a person can
go upstairs and say, ‘I’ve been in accounting for three years, and I’m
ready to go into marketing’. Each year I phone a list of my old students
to see what’s happening with them. The second job used to be with
another big company, often because people were beginning to have
families and wanted security. But with two-career families, a different
problem emerges. At a smaller organization, you can often work out
arrangements for both the man and the woman to move to new jobs in the
same city.</p>
<p>Some of the psychological tests being developed now are getting
better at helping people figure out their competencies. But if the world
economy is shifting from a command model to a knowledge model, why
shouldn’t education determine who gets each job?</p>
<p>Because of the enormous danger that we would not value the person in
terms of performance, but in terms of credentials. Strange as it may
seem, a knowledge economy’s greatest pitfall is in becoming a Mandarin
meritocracy. You see creeping credentialism all around. Why should
people find it necessary to tell me so-and-so is really a good
researcher even though he or she doesn’t have a PhD? It’s easy to fall
into the trap, because degrees are black and white. But it takes
judgement to weigh a person’s contribution.</p>
<p>The problem is becoming more serious in information-based
organizations. When an organization re-engineers itself around
information, the majority of management layers become redundant. Most
turn out to have been just information relays. Now, each layer has much
more information responsibility. Most large companies have cut the
number of layers by 50 per cent, even in Japan. Toyota came down from
twenty-odd to eleven. GM has streamlined from twenty-eight to perhaps
nineteen, and even that number is decreasing rapidly. Organizations will
become flatter and flatter.</p>
<p>As a result, there’s real panic in Japan, because it’s a vertical
society based on subtle layers of status. Everybody wants to become a
kachõ, a supervisor or section manager. Still, the United States doesn’t
have the answer either. We don’t know how to use rewards and recognition
to move the competent people into the management positions that remain.
I don’t care for the popular theory that a generation of entrepreneurs
can solve our problems. Entrepreneurs are monomaniacs. Managers are
synthesizers who bring resources together and have that ability to
‘smell’ opportunity and timing. Today perceptiveness is more important
than analysis. In the new society of organizations, you need to be able
to recognize patterns to see what is there rather than what you expect
to see. You need the invaluable listener who says, ‘I hear us all trying
to kill the new product to protect the old one.’</p>
<p>How do you find these people?</p>
<p>One way is to use small companies as farm clubs, as in baseball. One
of my ablest friends is buying minority stakes in small companies within
his industry. When I said it didn’t make sense, he said, I’m buying farm
teams. I’m putting my bright young people in these companies so they
have their own commands. They have to do everything a CEO does in a big
company.’</p>
<p>And do you know the biggest thing these young executives have to
learn in their new positions? My friend continued, ‘We have more PhD’s
in biology and chemistry than we have janitors, and they have to learn
that their customers aren’t PhD’s, and the people who do the work
aren’t’. In other words, they must learn to speak English instead of
putting formulas on the blackboard. They must learn to listen to
somebody who does not know what a regression analysis is. Basically,
they have to learn the meaning and importance of respect.</p>
<p>A difficult thing to learn, let alone teach.</p>
<p>You have to focus on a person’s performance. The individual must
shoulder the burden of defining what his or her own contribution will
be. We have to demand – and ‘demand’ is the word, nothing permissive –
that people think through what constitutes the greatest contribution
that they can make to the company in the next eighteen months or two
years. Then they have to make sure that contribution is accepted and
understood by the people they work with and for.</p>
<p>Most people don’t ask themselves this question, however obvious and
essential it seems. When I ask people what they contribute to an
organization, they blossom and love to answer. And when I follow with
‘Have you told other people about it?’ the answer often is ‘No, that
would be silly, because they know’. But, of course, ‘they’ don’t. We are
one hundred years past the simple economy in which most people knew what
others did at work. Farmers knew what most farmers did, and industrial
workers knew what other factory workers did. Domestic servants
understood each other’s work, as did the fourth major group in that
economy: small tradesmen. No one needed to explain. But now nobody knows
what others do, even within the same organization. Everybody you work
with needs to know your priorities. If you don’t ask and don’t tell,
your peers and subordinates will guess incorrectly.</p>
<p>What’s the result of this lack of communication?</p>
<p>When you don’t communicate, you don’t get to do the things you are
good at. Let me give you an example. The engineers in my class, without
exception, say they spend more than half their time editing and
polishing reports – in other words, what they are least qualified to do.
They don’t even know that you have to write and rewrite and rewrite
again. But there are any number of English majors around for that
assignment. People seldom pay attention to their strengths. For example,
after thinking for a long time, an engineer told me he’s really good at
the first design, at the basic idea, but not at filling in the details
for the final product. Until then, he’d never told anybody, not even
himself.</p>
<p>You’re not advocating self-analysis alone, are you?</p>
<p>No. Not only do you have to understand your own competencies, but you
also have to learn the strengths of the men and women to whom you assign
duties, as well as those of your peers and boss. Too many managers still
go by averages. They still talk about ‘our engineers’. And I say,
‘Brother, you don’t have “engineers“. You have Joe and Mary and Jim and
Bob, and each is different.’ You can no longer manage a workforce. You
manage individuals. You have to know them so well you can go and say
‘Mary, you think you ought to move up to this next job. Well, then you
have to learn not to have that chip on your shoulder. Forget you are a
woman; you are an engineer. And you have to be a little considerate. Do
not come in at ten minutes to five on Friday afternoon to tell people
they have to work overtime when you knew it at nine a.m.’</p>
<p>The key to the productivity of knowledge workers is to make them
concentrate on the real assignment. Do you know why most promotions now
fail? One-third are outright disasters, in my experience, while another
third are a nagging backache. Not more than one in three works out. No
fit. The standard case, of course, is the star salesman promoted to
sales manager. That job can be any one of four things – a manager of
salespeople, a market manager, a brand manager, or a supersalesman who
opens up an entire new area. But nobody figures out what it is, so the
man or woman who got the promotion just tries to do more of whatever led
to the promotion. That’s the surest way to be wrong.</p>
<p>Expand on your idea of information responsibility and how it fits
into post-capitalist society.</p>
<p>Far too many managers think computer specialists know what
information managers need to do their job and what information they owe
to whom. Computer information tends to focus too much on inside
information, not the outside sources and customers that count. In
today’s organization, you have to take responsibility for information
because it is your main tool. But most don’t know how to use it. Few are
information-literate. They can play ‘Mary Had a Little Lamb’ but not
Beethoven.</p>
<p>I heard today about a brand manager in a major OTC drug company who
tried to get the scientific papers on the product he markets. But the
corporate librarian complained to his superior. Under her rules, she
gives hard science only to the company’s scientists and lawyers. He had
to get a consultant to go outside and use a computer database to pull up
about twenty journal articles on his product, so he’d know how to
develop honest advertising copy. The point of the story is that this
brand manager is way ahead of the parade: ninety-nine out of a hundred
brand managers don’t know they need that kind of information for today’s
consumers and haven’t a clue how to get it. The first step is to say ‘I
need it’.</p>
<p>And many people don’t recognize the importance of this step. I work
with an information manager at a large financial institution that has
invested .5 billion in information. He and I talked all morning with his
department’s eight women and ten men. Very intelligent, but not one
began to think seriously about what information they need in order to
serve their customers. When I pointed this out, they said, ‘Isn‘t the
boss going to tell us?’ We finally had to agree to meet a month later so
that they could go through the hard work of figuring out what
information they need and, more important, what they do not need.</p>
<p>So a manager begins the road to information responsibility first by
identifying gaps in knowledge.</p>
<p>Exactly. To be information-literate, you begin with learning what it
is you need to know. Too much talk focuses on the technology; even
worse, on the speed of the gadget – always faster, faster. This kind of
‘techie’ fixation causes us to lose track of the fundamental nature of
information in today’s organization. To organize the way work is done,
you have to begin with the specific job, then the information input, and
finally the human relationships needed to get the job done.</p>
<p>The current emphasis on re-engineering essentially means changing an
organization from the flow of things to the flow of information. The
computer is merely a tool in the process. If you go to the hardware
store to buy a hammer, you do not ask if you should do upholstery or fix
the door. To put it in editorial terms, knowing how a typewriter works
does not make you a writer. Now that knowledge is taking the place of
capital as the driving force in organizations worldwide, it is all too
easy to confuse data with knowledge and information technology with
information.</p>
<p>What’s the worst problem in managing knowledge specialists?</p>
<p>One of the most degenerative tendencies of the last forty years is
the belief that if you are understandable, you are vulgar. When I was
growing up, it was taken for granted that economists, physicists,
psychologists – in fact leaders in any discipline – would make
themselves understood. Einstein spent years with three different
collaborators to make his theory of relativity accessible to the layman.
Even John Maynard Keynes tried hard to make his economics accessible.
But just the other day, I heard a senior scholar seriously reject a
younger colleague’s work because more than five people could understand
what he’s doing. Literally.</p>
<p>We cannot afford such arrogance. Knowledge is power, which is why
people who had it in the past often tried to make a secret of it. In
post-capitalism, power comes from transmitting information to make it
productive, not from hiding it.</p>
<p>That means you have to be intolerant of intellectual arrogance. And I
mean intolerant. At whatever level, knowledge people must make
themselves understood, and whatever field the manager comes from, he or
she must be eager to understand others. This may be the main job of the
manager of technical people. He or she must not only be an interpreter
but also work out a balance between specialization and exposure.</p>
<p>Exposure is an important technique. For an exotic example, look at
weather forecasting, where meteorologists and mathematicians and other
specialists now work with teams of experts on satellite data. Europeans,
on the one hand, have tried to connect these different disciplines
entirely through information managers. On the other hand, Americans
rotate people at an early stage. Suppose you put a PhD in meteorology on
a team that is to work on the new mathematical model of hurricanes for
three years. He isn’t a mathematician, but he gets exposed to what
mathematicians assume, what they eliminate, what their limitations are.
With the combination of exposure and translation, the American approach
yields forecasts that are about three times more accurate than the
European ones, I’m told. And the exposure concept is useful in managing
any group of specialists.</p>
<p>Is the fact that some teams provide exposure as well as interpreters
a reason why the team has become such a hot topic?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of nonsense in team talk, as if teams were something
new. We have always worked in teams, and while sports give us hundreds
of team styles, there are only a few basic models to choose from. The
critical decision is to select the right kind for the job. You can’t mix
soccer and doubles tennis. It’s predictable that in a few years, the
most traditional team will come back in fashion, the one that does
research first, then passes the idea to engineering to develop, and then
on to manufacturing to make. It’s like a baseball team, and as you may
know, I have done a little work with baseball-team management.</p>
<p>The great strength of baseball teams is that you can concentrate. You
take Joe, who is a batter, and you work on batting. There is almost no
interaction, nothing at all like the soccer team or the jazz combo, the
implicit model of many teams today. The soccer team moves in unison but
everyone holds the same relative position. The jazz combo has incredible
flexibility because everyone knows each other so well that they all
sense when the trumpet is about to solo. The combo model takes great
discipline and may eventually fall out of favour, especially in Japanese
car manufacturing, because we do not need to create new car models as
fast as we have been.</p>
<p>I know several German companies that follow the baseball-team model,
whether they know it or not. Their strength is clear: they are fantastic
at exploiting and developing old knowledge, and Germany’s mid-size
companies may be better than their big ones simply because they
concentrate better. On the other hand, when it comes to the new, from
electronics to biotech, German scientists may do fine work, but their
famous apprenticeship system discourages innovation.</p>
<p>So, beyond all the hype, teams can help the executive to navigate a
post-capitalist society?</p>
<p>Thinking about teams helps us to highlight the more general problem
of how to manage knowledge. In the production of fundamental new
knowledge, the British groups I run into are way ahead of anybody. But
they have never done much with their expertise, in part because many
British companies don’t value the technically oriented person enough. I
don’t know of a single engineer in top management there. My Japanese
friends are just the opposite. While they still do not specialize in
scientific advances, they take knowledge and make it productive very
fast. In the United States, on the other hand, we have not improved that
much in existing industries. The automobile business, until recently,
was perfectly satisfied doing what it did in 1939. But as we are
discovering in computers and in biotech, we may be at our very best when
it comes to groundbreaking technology.</p>
<p>Where is the lesson in all this for the manager?</p>
<p>The lesson is that the productivity of knowledge has both a
qualitative and a quantitative dimension. Though we know very little
about it, we do realize that executives must be both managers of
specialists and synthesizers of different fields of knowledge – really
of knowledges, plural. This situation is as threatening to the
traditional manager, who worries about highfaluting highbrows, as it is
to the intellectual, who worries about being too commercial to earn
respect in his or her discipline. But in the post-capitalist world, the
highbrow and the lowbrow have to play on the same team.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty democratic. Does a post-capitalist society based
more on knowledge than capital become egalitarian?</p>
<p>No. Both of these words miss the point. Democratic bespeaks a narrow
political and legal organization. Nor do I use the buzzword
participative. Worse yet is the empowerment concept. It is not a great
step forward to take power out at the top and put it in at the bottom.
It’s still power. To build achieving organizations, you must replace
power with responsibility.</p>
<p>And while we’re on the subject of words, I’m now not comfortable with
the word manager because it implies subordinates. I find myself using
executive more, because it implies responsibility for an area, not
necessarily dominion over people. The word boss, which emerged in the
First World War, is helpful in that it can be used to suggest a mentor’s
role, someone who can back you up on a decision. The new organizations
need to go beyond senior-junior polarities to a blend with sponsor and
mentor relations. In the traditional organization – the organization of
the last one hundred years – the skeleton, or internal structure, was a
combination of rank and power. In the emerging organization, it has to
be mutual understanding and responsibility.</p>
