<h4 id="reinventing-government">24. Reinventing government</h4>
<p>Vice-President Al Gore’s promise to ‘reinvent government’, proclaimed
with a great fanfare in the first year of the Clinton administration,
produced only a nationwide yawn. (The similar promise made in the
Republicans’ ‘Contract with America’, last year, initially met with no
better response.) There has been no lack of publicity about the Gore
initiative since. Press release after press release has announced the
reinvention of yet another agency or programme; big conferences, one
chaired by the President himself, have been convened, and any number of
TV appearances made. Of all the domestic programmes of the Clinton
administration, this is the one in which there actually have been
results and not just speeches, Yet neither the public nor the media have
shown much interest. And last November’s elections were hardly a vote of
confidence in the administration’s performance at reinventing
government.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for this. In any institution other than the
federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would
not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the
hallway. They are the kinds of thing that a hospital expects floor
nurses to do on their own; that a bank expects branch managers to do on
their own; that even a poorly run manufacturer expects supervisors to do
on their own – without getting much praise, let alone any extra
rewards.</p>
<p>Here are some examples – sadly, fairly typical ones:</p>
<p>• In Atlanta, Georgia, six separate welfare programmes, each
traditionally with its own office and staff, have consolidated their
application process to give ‘one-stop service’. The reinvented programme
is actually getting phone calls answered, and on the first try.</p>
<p>• In Ogden, Utah, and Oakland, California, among other places, the
Internal Revenue Service is also experimenting with treating taxpayers
as customers and with a one-stop service, in which each clerk, instead
of shuffling taxpayers from one office to another, has the information
to answer their questions.</p>
<p>• The Export-Import Bank has been reinvented. It is now expected to
do what it was set up to do all of sixty years ago: help small
businesses get export financing.</p>
<p>• The US Geological Survey office in Denver is supposed to sell maps
of the United States to the public. But it is almost impossible to find
out what maps to order and how and where to order them, since the
catalogue is carefully hidden. And the very fact that a map is in demand
by the public all but guarantees that it will be unobtainable. It cannot
be reprinted simply because the public wants to buy it; another
government agency must order it for internal use. If the map sells well,
it therefore immediately goes out of print. What’s more, the warehouse
is so poorly lit that when an order for a map in print comes in, the
clerks cannot find the map. The task force that the Geological Survey
created seven months ago to reinvent all this has succeeded so far in
putting more lights in the warehouse and making a few other minor
improvements.</p>
<p>For the future, however, more ambitious things are promised:</p>
<p>• The Department of Agriculture proposes to trim its agencies from 42
to 30, to close more than 1000 field offices, and to eliminate 11000
jobs, for savings of about .6 billion over five years.</p>
<p>• Of the 384 recommendations of ways to reinvent government
identified by the Vice-President in 1993, about half are being proposed
in the budget for the fiscal year 1995. If all these recommendations are
accepted by Congress, they should result in savings of about 2.5 billion
over two years.</p>
<p>But neither the trimming of the Department of Agriculture nor the
Vice-President’s 384 recommendations are new. We have long known that a
great many agricultural field offices are in cities and suburbs, where
few (if any) farmers are left. Closing them was first proposed in the
Eisenhower years. And a good many, perhaps the majority, of Gore’s 384
recommendations were made ten years ago, in the Grace Report, under
President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Nor is it by any means sure that all of these proposals and
recommendations will become law. Mike Espy proposed large cuts in the
bloated US Department of Agriculture on 6 December 1994. But he then
resigned on 31 December, and there is no guarantee that there will be
someone at the top of the department committed to these changes.</p>
<p>Even if all these proposals were to be enacted, the results would be
trivial. The proposed Agriculture Department saving of .6 billion over
five years works out to about 20 million a year – or around 1 per cent
of the annual department budget of almost 0 billion. A saving of 2.5
billion looks like a lot of money. But over two years the federal
government spends trillion. An annual saving of billion – and this is
many times more than Congress is likely to accept – would thus be a cut
of no more than two-tenths of 1 per cent of the budget. Surely the only
way to describe the results of Gore’s efforts so far is with the old
Latin tag ‘The mountains convulsed in labour only to give birth to a
ridiculous, teensy-weensy mouse’.</p>
<p>Restructuring</p>
<p>The reason most often given for this embarrassment of non-results is
‘resistance by the bureaucracy’. Of course, no one likes to be
reinvented by fiat from above. But actually, one positive result of
Gore’s programme has been the enthusiastic support it has received from
a great many people in the government’s employ – especially the
low-level people who are in daily contact with the public and are thus
constantly frustrated by red tape and by such inane rules as those that
prevent their selling the beautiful Geological Survey maps, of which
they are justly proud.</p>
<p>Nor is lack of effort the explanation. Some of the most dedicated
people in Washington meet week after week to produce these embarrassing
non-results. They include the deputy secretaries of the major government
departments. Vice-President Gore – an unusually energetic man – pushes
and pushes. And the driving force behind the whole endeavour is the most
knowledgeable of all Washington insiders, Alice Rivlin, formerly the
director of the Congressional Budget Office, and now the director of the
Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>These able people are getting nowhere fast because their basic
approach is wrong. They are trying to patch and to spot-weld, here,
there, and yonder – and that never accomplishes anything. There will be
no results unless there is a radical change in the way the federal
government and its agencies are managed and paid. The habit of
continuous improvement has to be built into all government agencies, and
has to be made self-sustaining.</p>
<p>Continuous improvement is considered a recent Japanese invention –
the Japanese call it kaizen. But in fact it was used almost eighty years
ago, and in the United States. From the First World War until the early
1980s, when it was dissolved, the Bell Telephone System applied
‘continuous improvement’ to every one of its activities and processes,
whether it was installing a telephone in a home or manufacturing
switchgear. For every one of these activities, Bell defined results,
performance, quality, and cost. And for every one, it set an annual
improvement goal. Bell managers weren’t rewarded for reaching these
goals; but those who did not reach them were out of the running and
rarely given a second chance.</p>
<p>What is equally needed – and is also an old Bell Telephone invention
– is ‘benchmarking’: every year comparing the performance of an
operation or an agency with the performances of all others, with the
best becoming the standard to be met by all the following year.</p>
<p>Continuous improvement and benchmarking are largely unknown in the
civilian agencies of the US government. They would require radical
changes in policies and practices which the bureaucracy, the federal
employees’ unions, and Congress would all fiercely resist. They would
require every agency – and every bureau within every agency – to define
its performance objective, its quality objective, and its cost
objective. They would require defining the results that the agency is
supposed to produce. Continuous improvement and benchmarking also need
different incentives. An agency that did not improve its performance by
a preset minimum would have its budget cut – which was Bell Telephone’s
approach. And a manager whose unit consistently fell below the benchmark
set by the best performers would be penalized in terms of compensation
or – more effective – in terms of eligibility for promotion.
Non-performers would ultimately be demoted or fired.</p>
<p>But not even such changes, though they would be considered radical by
almost anybody in Congress or the federal bureaucracy, would warrant
being called a reinvention of government. By themselves alone they would
probably even do harm. For what should not be done at all can always be
improved the most and thus we usually see the greatest improvements in
things that should not be done at all.</p>
<p>Any organization, whether biological or social, needs to change its
basic structure if it significantly changes its size. Any organization
that doubles or triples in size needs to be restructured. Similarly, any
organization, whether a business, a nonprofit, or a government agency,
needs to rethink itself once it is more than forty or fifty years old.
It has outgrown its policies and its rules of behaviour. If it continues
in its old ways, it becomes ungovernable, unmanageable,
uncontrollable.</p>
<p>The civilian part of the US government has outgrown its size and
outlived its policies. It is now far larger than it was during the
Eisenhower administration. Its structure, its policies, and its rules
for doing government business and for managing people go back even
further than that. They were first developed under William McKinley
after 1896, and were pretty much completed under Herbert Hoover from
1929 to 1933.</p>
<p>In fact there is no point in blaming this or that president for the
total disarray of our government today. It is the fault neither of the
Democrats nor of the Republicans. Government has outgrown the structure,
the policies, and the rules designed for it and still in use.</p>
<p>Rethinking</p>
<p>The first reaction in a situation of disarray always is to do what
Vice-President Gore and his associates are now doing – patching. It
always fails. The next step is to rush into downsizing. Management picks
up a meat-axe and lays about indiscriminately. This is what both the
Republicans and the Clinton administration now propose to do. In the
past fifteen years one big American company after another has done this
– among them IBM, Sears, and GM. Each first announced that laying off 10
000 or 20 000 or even 50000 people would lead to an immediate
turnaround. A year later there had, of course, been no turnaround, and
the company laid off another 10000 or 20000 or 50000 – again without
results. In many if not most cases, downsizing has turned out to be
something that surgeons for centuries have warned against: ‘amputation
before diagnosis.’ The result is always a cripple.</p>
<p>But there have been a few organizations – some large companies (GE,
for instance) and a few large hospitals (Beth Israel in Boston, for
instance) – that quietly, and without fanfare, did turn themselves
around, by rethinking themselves. They did not start out by downsizing.
In fact, they knew that to start by reducing expenditures is not the way
to get control of costs. The starting point is to identify the
activities that are productive, that should be strengthened, promoted,
and expanded. Every agency, every policy, every programme, every
activity, should be confronted with these questions: ‘What is your
mission?’ ‘Is it still the right mission?’ Is it still worth doing?’ If
we were not already doing this, would we go into it now?’ This
questioning has been done often enough in all kinds of organizations –
businesses, hospitals, churches, and even local governments – that we
know it works.</p>
<p>The overall answer is almost never This is fine as it stands; let’s
keep on’. But in some – indeed, a good many – areas, the answer to the
question is ‘Yes, we would go into this again, but with some changes. We
have learned a few things.’</p>
<p>An example might be the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, created in 1970. Safety in the workplace is surely the
right mission of OSHA. But safety in the American workplace has not
improved greatly in the past twenty-five years. There may be slightly
fewer disabling injuries now than there were in 1960 or 1970, and to be
sure, the workforce has increased tremendously over those years. But
considering the steady shift of the labour force from highly unsafe to
fairly safe work (for example, from deep-level coal mining to the safer
surface strip mining, and especially the shift from inherently dangerous
manufacturing jobs to inherently safe office and service jobs), safety
in the American workplace may actually have deteriorated since 1970.
Such a result usually means that we have been going about the right task
in the wrong way. In OSHA’s case we actually understand the problem.
OSHA runs on the assumption that an unsafe environment is the primary
cause of accidents. It therefore tries to do the impossible: create a
risk-free universe. Of course, eliminating hazards is the right thing to
do. But it is only one part of safety, and probably the lesser part. In
fact, by itself it achieves next to nothing. The most effective way to
produce safety is to eliminate unsafe behaviour. OSHA’s definition of an
accident – ‘when someone gets hurt’ – is inadequate. To cut down on
accidents the definition has to be ‘a violation of the rules of safe
behaviour, whether anyone gets hurt or not’. This is the definition
under which the United States has been running its nuclear submarines.
Anyone in a nuclear sub, whether the commanding officer or the most
junior seaman, is punished for the slightest violation of the rules of
safe behaviour, even if no one gets hurt. As a result, the nuclear
submarine has a safety record unmatched by any industrial plant or
military installation in the world; and yet a more unsafe environment
than a crowded nuclear sub can hardly be imagined.</p>
<p>OSHA’s programme should, of course, be maintained, and perhaps even
expanded. But it needs to be refocused.</p>
<p>Rethinking will identify a number of agencies whose mission is no
longer viable, if it ever was – agencies that we would definitely not
start now if we had the choice.</p>
<p>The mission may have been accomplished, for instance. An example is
that most sacred of cows, the Veterans Administration’s 171 hospitals
and 130 nursing homes. When they first became accredited hospitals,
around 1930, competent hospitals were scarce in the rural areas and
small towns where a great many veterans lived. Today a competent
hospital is easily accessible to a veteran almost anywhere. Medically,
most VA hospitals are, at best, mediocre; yet, they are extremely
expensive. Worst, they are not neighbourhood facilities, and thus
veterans – especially elderly, chronically ill ones – have to travel far
from their communities and their families just when they most need
community and family support. The VA hospitals and nursing homes long
ago accomplished what they were set up to do. They should be closed and
the job contracted out to local hospitals and Health Maintenance
Organizations.</p>
<p>Or there may be no mission left. For example, would be now establish
a separate Department of Agriculture? A good many Americans would answer
with a loud No. Now that farmers are no more than 3 per cent of the
population, and productive farmers are half that (and ‘agribusinesses’
to boot), a bureau at Commerce or Labour is probably all we need.</p>
<p>Some perfectly respectable activities belong elsewhere. Why, for
instance, should a scientific agency like the Geological Survey run a
retail business? Surely there are enough businesses around, map stores
or book chains, to sell its maps. Or they could be offered in the
catalogues of firms that sell outdoor gear.</p>
<p>Continuing with activities that we would not now choose to begin is
wasteful. They should be abandoned. One cannot even guess how many
government activities would be found to be worth preserving. But my
experience with many organizations suggests that the public would vote
against continuing something like two-fifths, perhaps even half, of all
civilian agencies and programmes. And almost none of them would win a
vote – that is, be deemed to be properly organized and operating well –
by a large margin.</p>
<p>Abandoning</p>
<p>Together the qualified yea and nays are likely to be awarded in any
organization to some three-fifths or two-thirds of programmes and
activities. The thorny cases are the programmes and activities that are
unproductive or counterproductive without our quite knowing what is
wrong, let alone how to straighten it out.</p>
<p>Two major and highly cherished US government programmes belong in
this category. The welfare programme is one highly visible example. When
it was designed, in the late 1930s, it worked beautifully. But the needs
it then tackled were different from those it is supposed to serve today:
the needs of unwed mothers and fatherless children, of people without
education, skills, or work experience. Whether it actually does harm is
hotly debated. But few claim that it works or that it even alleviates
the social ills it is supposed to cure. And then there is that mainstay
of US foreign policy during the cold war years: military aid. If it is
given to an ally who is actually engaged in fighting, military aid can
be highly productive: consider Lend-Lease to Great Britain in 1940–1941,
and military aid to an embattled Israel. But military aid is
counterproductive if it is given in peacetime to create an ally – a
proposition that Plutarch and Suetonius already accepted as amply proved
2000 years age. Surely our worst recent foreign-policy messes – Panama,
Iran, Iraq, and Somalia are prime examples – were caused by our giving
military aid to create an ally. Little, if any, military aid since the
beginning of the cold war has actually produced an ally. Indeed, it
usually produced an enemy – as did Soviet military aid to
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The favourite prescription for such programmes or activities is to
reform them. President Clinton’s welfare reform is one example, as is
the welfare reform proposed by the new Republican majority. Both are
quackery. To reform something that malfunctions – let alone something
that does harm – without knowing why it does not work can only make
things worse. The best thing to do with such programmes is to abolish
them.</p>
<p>Maybe we should run a few – a very few – controlled experiments. In
welfare, for instance, we might try, in some carefully chosen places
across the country, to privatize retraining and placing long-term
welfare recipients. Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith has achieved
promising results in this area. In health care we might try several
different approaches in different states: for example, managed
competition in California, home of the strong and experienced
health-care wholesaler Kaiser Permanente; single-payer health care on
the Canadian model in New Jersey, where there has been support for it;
and rationing on the basis of medical expectations, which is now being
tried in Oregon for the care of indigents.</p>
<p>But in areas where there are no successes to be tested – for example,
military aid – we should not even experiment. There are no hypotheses to
test. We should abandon.</p>
<p>Rethinking will result in a list that has activities and programmes
that should be strengthened at the top, others that should be abolished
at the bottom, and between them activities that need to be refocused or
in which a few hypotheses might be tested. Some activities and
programmes should, despite an absence of results, be given a grace
period of a few years before they are put out of their misery. Welfare
may be the prime example.</p>
<p>Rethinking is not primarily concerned with cutting expenses. It leads
above all to a tremendous increase in performance, in quality, in
service. But substantial cost savings – sometimes as much as 40 per cent
of the total – always emerge as a byproduct. In fact, rethinking could
produce enough savings to eliminate the federal deficit within a few
years. The main result, however, would be a change in basic approach.
For where conventional policy-making ranks programmes and activities
according to their good intentions, rethinking ranks them according to
results.</p>
<p>An exception for crusades</p>
<p>Anyone who has read this far will exclaim Impossible. Surely no group
of people will ever agree on what belongs at the top of the list and
what at the bottom.’ But amazingly enough, wherever rethinking has been
done, there has been substantial agreement about the list, whatever the
backgrounds or the beliefs of the people involved. The disagreements are
rarely over what should be kept or strengthened and what should be
abandoned. They are usually over whether a programme or activity should
be axed right away or put on probation for two or three years. The
programmes that people do not agree on are the ones concerned not with
results but with ‘moral imperatives’.</p>
<p>The best American example is the War on Drugs. After many years it
has had little effect on substance abuse and addiction, and much of the
effect it has had is deleterious. But it underlies the destruction of
our cities in that addicts are prostituting themselves, mugging,
robbing, or killing to earn enough for the fix that the War on Drugs has
made prohibitively expensive. All the War on Drugs is actually doing, in
other words, is enriching drug dealers and penalizing and terrorizing
non-users, especially in the inner city. But the War on Drugs is a
crusade. What lies behind it is not logic but outrage. Stopping the War
on Drugs no matter how beneficial, would be ‘immoral’. The smart thing
to do is to exclude such crusades from the rational analysis involved in
rethinking. Fortunately, there are never a lot of them. As for the rest
– more than 90 per cent of all programmes and activities – rethinking
will in all probability produce substantial agreement.</p>
<p>A government that is effective</p>
<p>Surely, it will be argued, even total agreement among highly
respected people will be futile. Congress will not accept anything like
this. Neither will the bureaucracy. And lobbyists and special interests
of all persuasions will be united in opposition to anything so
subversive.</p>
<p>Perfectly true: action on rethinking is impossible today. But will it
be impossible tomorrow? In the last presidential election almost
one-fifth of the electorate voted for Ross Perot, the man who promised
to get rid of the deficit by slashing government expenditures. A
substantial number – perhaps another fifth – agreed with his aims even
though they could not bring themselves to vote for him. Just now the
federal deficit is declining. But even without health-care reform or
welfare reform, the deficit will again grow explosively, at the latest
by 1997. And then the demand for cutting the deficit may become
irresistible and overwhelm Congress, the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists.
If no rational rethinking of government performance has yet occurred, we
will in all likelihood do what so many large companies have done – apply
the meat-axe and downsize. We will then destroy performance, but without
decreasing the deficit. It is predictable that the wrong things will
then be cut – the things that perform and should be strengthened.</p>
<p>But if we have a plan that shows how and where the government needs
to be rethought, we have a chance. In a crisis one turns to people who
have thought through in advance what needs to be done. Of course, no
plan, no matter how well thought through, will ever be carried out as
written. Even a dictator has to make compromises. But such a plan would
serve as the ideal against which the compromises are measured. It might
save us from sacrificing things that should be strengthened in order to
maintain the obsolete and the unproductive. It would not guarantee that
all – or even most – of the unproductive things would be cut, but it
might maintain the productive ones. Within a few years we are likely to
face such a crisis, as the federal budget and the federal deficit resume
explosive growth, while taxpayers grow ever more resistant to tax
increases and ever more contemptuous of government and its promises.</p>
<p>In fact, we may already be very close to having to reinvent
government. The theory on which all governments in the developed world
have operated at least since the Great Depression (Harry Hopkins,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s adviser, called it Tax and Tax, Spend and
Spend’) no longer delivers results. It no longer even delivers votes.
The ‘nanny state’ – a lovely English term – is a total failure.
Government everywhere – in the United States, the United Kingdom,
Germany, the former Soviet Union – has been proved unable to run
community and society. And everywhere voters revolt against the nanny
state’s futility, bureaucracy, and burdens. The landslide in which
California’s voters last November enacted Proposition 187, abolishing
health care and even free public education for illegal immigrants, is
but one example. But the countertheory that preaches a return to
pre-First World War government has also not proved out – the theory that
was first formulated in 1944 in Friedrich Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom,
and that culminated in neo-conservatism. Despite its ascendancy in the
1980s, despite Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the nanny state has
not shrunk. On the contrary, it is growing ever faster. As the new
Republican majority is soon going to find out, neither maintaining nor
curtailing the nanny state is acceptable to the public.</p>
<p>Instead we will have to find out what government programmes and
activities in community and society do serve a purpose. What results
should be expected of each? What can governments – federal, state, local
– do effectively? And what non-governmental ways are there to do
worthwhile things that governments do not and cannot do effectively?</p>
<p>At the same time, as President Clinton learned in his first two
years, government cannot opt out of the wider world and become domestic
only, as he so very much wanted it to be. Foreign brushfires – in
Bosnia, in Rwanda, in the former Soviet Union – have to be attended to,
because they have a nasty habit of spreading. And the growing threat of
international terrorism, especially if used as a weapon by outlaw
governments, will surely require more government involvement in foreign
affairs, including military matters, and more international
cooperation.</p>
<p>By now it has become clear that a developed country can neither
extend big government, as the (so-called) liberals want, nor abolish it
and go back to nineteenth-century innocence, as the (so-called)
conservatives want. The government we need will have to transcend both
groups. The mega-state which this century built is bankrupt, morally as
well as financially. It has not delivered. But its successor cannot be
‘small government’. There are far too many tasks, domestically and
internationally. We need effective government – and that is what the
voters in all developed countries are actually clamouring for.</p>
<p>For this, however, we need something we do not have: a theory of what
government can do. No major political thinker – at least not since
Machiavelli, almost 500 years ago – has addressed this question. All
political theory, from Locke on through The Federalist Papers and down
to the articles published by today’s liberals and conservatives, deals
with the process of government: with constitutions, with power and its
limitations, with methods and organizations. None deals with the
substance. None asks what the proper functions of government might be
and could be. None asks what results government should be held
accountable for.</p>
<p>Rethinking government, its programmes, its agencies, its activities,
would not by itself give us this new political theory. But it would give
us the factual information for it. And so much is already clear: the new
political theory we badly need will have to rest on an analysis of what
does work rather than on good intentions and promises of what should
work because we would like it to. Rethinking will not give us the
answers, but it might force us to ask the right questions.</p>
<p>Now is the time to start, when polls show that less than a fifth of
the American public trusts government to do anything right.
Vice-President Gore’s ‘reinventing government’ is an empty slogan so
far. Yet what the slogan implies is what free government needs – and
desperately.</p>
