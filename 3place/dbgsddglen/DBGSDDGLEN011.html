<h4 id="the-information-revolution-in-retail">9. The information
revolution in retail</h4>
<p>Wherever I went in Europe in 1993 – Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Belgium, Austria, Switzerland – I heard the same lament: European
economic unification is at a standstill in manufacturing and finance.
But in retailing, where no one expected it, economic unification is
galloping across Europe.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Aldi, a food discounter, was still purely German; now
it is in seven European countries with some 3300 stores. Other food
discounters – German, French, Danish – are expanding with similar speed
across Europe, from Spain to Norway. Sweden-based Ikea now dominates
Western Europe’s furniture business and is opening stores in the former
Russian satellites. Italy-based Benetton (women’s fashions) and
Britain-based The Body Shop (toiletries) are becoming market leaders in
one European country after the other.</p>
<p>The internationalization of retailing is by no means confined to
Europe. Japanese retailers, both food and non-food, are rapidly
expanding in China. Ikea and Benetton have nearly as much market
penetration in the United States as they have in Europe. America’s
Wal-Mart is set to cover Mexico with Sam’s Clubs, while Toys ‘R’ Us is
pushing aggressively into Japan.</p>
<p>Most of the earlier retailers who went multinational tried to improve
slightly on what retailers in their ‘host’ countries were already doing
quite well. This was true of Sears building traditional Sears stores in
Latin America in the 1950s or German Tengelmann and Dutch Ahold buying
established supermarket chains in the United States in the 1970s and
early 1980s. But the new multinationals are revolutionaries, rejecting
the very assumptions that most retailers still consider holy writ.</p>
<p>During the past half-century, ‘shopping centre’ has become almost
synonymous with ‘successful retailing’. And the bigger, the better. But
the new retailers shun shopping centres. They build freestanding stores
or go into ‘minimalls’ that contain only a handful of shops. The
shopping centre,’ a top executive of one of the fastest-growing European
discount retailers said to me, ‘submerges the personality of the
individual store into the anonymity of the parking lot.’ And the new
retailers aim at a sharply profiled personality and a clear market
niche.</p>
<p>The new retailers rarely speak of ‘re-engineering’ – to them it
sounds too much like manufacturing. But they constantly redesign
operations. Indeed, many redefine the entire business.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart’s success, for example, rests in large measure on its
redefining retailing as the moving of merchandise, rather than its sale.
This led to the integration of the entire process – all the way from the
manufacturer’s machine to the selling floor – on the basis of
‘real-time’ information about customer purchases. As a result, Wal-Mart
could cut out three tiers of warehouses and a full third of the costs of
traditional retailing. But Wal-Mart still carries a full assortment of
goods, and that means thousands of items.</p>
<p>Aldi has re-engineered operations in much the same way. But it also
has cut its assortment to the 600 items that, its research showed, are
all a household buys regularly. Each item has been designed by Aldi, is
made to its specifications, and is sold under its own brand name. As a
result, it has doubled or tripled sales per square foot of shelf space –
a retailer’s basic capital and cost centre.</p>
<p>Spar, another German deep-discounter, is going further still. It will
carry only the 200 items a household buys every week. Another
fast-growing European retailer will apply the same principle a different
way, Its deep-discount ‘clubs’ will carry only the 200 items needed for
special occasions – and absolutely nothing people buy regularly or
often.</p>
<p>Ikea can sell at a low price because it realized that half the cost
of finished furniture is final assembly. Provided that parts are
meticulously engineered and instructions crystal-clear, even mechanical
morons can do the final assembly at home.</p>
<p>Everybody in retailing talks of ‘service’ as the key to success, if
not to survival So do the new retailers. But they mean something
different.</p>
<p>For traditional merchants, service means salespeople who personally
take care of an individual customer. But the new retailers employ very
few salespeople. Service to them means that customers do not need a
salesperson, do not have to spend time trying to find one, do not have
to ask, do not have to wait. It means that the customers know where
goods are the moment they enter the store, in what colours and sizes,
and at what price. It means providing information.</p>
<p>But service for the new retailers also means getting customers out of
the store as fast as possible once they have made their purchases. A
European superdiscounter is studying a technology that eliminates the
checkout counter. When a customer has decided to buy an item, she puts
her credit card into a slot on the shelf and does so as many times as
she wants packages or bottles of a particular item. There is no shopping
cart. Her purchasers are packed and waiting when she is ready to leave.
All she has to do is to check the goods and sign a prepared credit-card
slip.</p>
<p>Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s – the first, the most successful,
and the most multinational of the new retailers – is reputed to have
said ‘A mother with two small children does not come to our store
because the hamburgers are delicious. She comes because the restrooms
are clean.’ This is often considered pure whimsy. But it was meant to
express a radically new concept of what ‘shopping’ means. What customers
– at least a good many of them – want is not shopping that is enjoyable
but shopping that is painless.</p>
<p>The retail store was invented in the late seventeenth century – first
in Japan, shortly thereafter in Western Europe. From its very early days
it has been based on three assumptions: shopping offers the customer –
especially the housewife – perhaps the only way to have a little choice,
to make a few decisions, to have a little say and a little power.
Second, it offers the housewife the only break from the monotonous and
dreary routine that the Germans call ‘The Three K’s’: Kinder, Kirche,
Küche (children, church, kitchen). And, finally, the retail store offers
access to the world to people whose information otherwise consists of
inane chats over the back fence or at the sewing circle.</p>
<p>The retail store has, of course, changed many times over the past 300
years of its existence. But traditional retailers – department stores,
shopping centres, hardware stores, supermarkets, shoe stores – by and
large still accept the traditional assumptions, if only
subconsciously.</p>
<p>The new retailers, however, reject them. Their prototypical customer
has a paying job, if not a career. She has many occasions to choose and
to make decisions, and most of them more interesting than what to cook
for dinner. And even if she never leaves the house, she has unlimited
access to the outside world through the telephone and TV screen.
Shopping is no longer a satisfaction to her, it is a chore.</p>
<p>The department store – the success story of the early twentieth
century – is slipping everywhere. Shopping centres and supermarkets –
the success stories of the past half-century – are, at best, holding
their own. The new retailers are rapidly expanding. Still, there are
signs that theirs, too, may be a fairly short-lived success.</p>
<p>Retailers now talk of ‘shopping without a store’ through interactive
TV. They talk of ‘virtual reality’ in which the customer in her own
living room ‘walks’ through a simulated shopping centre on her computer
screen, ‘tries on’ a blouse, and orders by pushing a few buttons.</p>
<p>The technology for all this is available and is increasingly less
expensive. And there are quite a few signs that a substantial number of
customers are becoming receptive to it. There is the upsurge in
catalogue sales in all developed countries – ‘non-tech’ shopping without
a store. In the United States direct selling over cable TV has been
successful for costume jewellery, for instance; in some affluent suburbs
interactive TV also works for selling ready-to-heat ‘gourmet’ meals. In
more and more beauty parlours women ‘try on’ and ‘adjust’ different
haircuts on a TV monitor, deciding which style suits them best.</p>
<p>Shopping without a store is thus no longer science fiction. But it is
still speculation (and a lot of hype). But even without any new
technology, retailing has already changed. The changes are having
profound effects on advertising, on consumer-goods manufacturers, and on
the structure of the economy. Retailing – rather than manufacturing or
finance – may be where the action is now.</p>
