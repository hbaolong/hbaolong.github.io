<h4 id="the-us-economys-power-shift">14. The US economy’s power
shift</h4>
<p>Power in the economies of developed countries is rapidly shifting
from manufacturers to distributors and retailers. The phenomenal success
of Wal-Mart, which made the late Sam Walton one of the world’s richest
men in less than twenty years, was based squarely on the chain’s
controlling the operations of its main suppliers. Wal-Mart, rather than
the manufacturer – a Procter andandandand Gamble, for instance –
controls what should be produced, in what product mix, in what
quantities, when it should be delivered, and to which stores. Similarly,
in Japan, Ito-Yoka-do Company controls the product mix, the
manufacturing schedule, and the delivery of major supplies, such as
Coca-Cola or beer, for its 4300 7-Eleven stores.</p>
<p>In hardware a few very large distributors – many of them owned by the
independent retail stores they serve – actually design the products (or
at least write the specifications for them), find a manufacturer, and
lay down manufacturing schedules and delivery times. One example is
Servistar, a company based in Butler, Ohio, which buys for 4500 stores
across the United States and is owned by them.</p>
<p>The chains of hypermarkets that have come to dominate food retailing
in France and Spain similarly control the product mix, manufacturing
schedules, and delivery schedules of their main suppliers. And so do the
discount chains that take a growing share of the US market in office
products. In the United States, the free-standing community hospital is
no longer the principal customer for health-care products. Buying is now
done by chains: for-profit ones, such as Humana; voluntary ones;
denominational ones, whether Catholic or Lutheran. They set the product
specifications, find the manufacturer, negotiate price, and determine
manufacturing schedules and delivery.</p>
<p>Distributing is increasingly becoming concentrated; manufacturing, by
contrast, is increasingly splintering. Thirty years ago, three big car
makers shared the US market. Today the market is split among ten –
Detroit’s Big Three, five Japanese, two Germans. But thirty years ago 85
per cent of all retail car sales were done in single-site dealerships;
even three-dealership chains were quite uncommon. Today a fairly small
number of large chain-dealers – no more than fifty or sixty – sell
two-fifths of all cars in the United States. Yesterday’s dealer handled
only one make. Today’s chains may sell GM cars in one dealership,
Toyotas in the dealership across the street, and BMWs in a dealership in
the next town. They have little commitment to any one maker but go by
what their customers want.</p>
<p>In the mid-1960s Servistar (then called American Hardware) bought
less than 0 million a year and had 600 member stores. Today it serves
4500 stores and has an annual volume of .5 billion. Twenty years ago,
each of the current 7-Eleven outlets in Japan was an independent
‘mom-and-pop’ store. Mom and Pop still serve the customers, but they
have become franchises: 7-Eleven runs the store, decides what
merchandise it carries and in what quantity, buys it, stocks it, does
the display, finances the store, does its accounting, and trains its
people.</p>
<p>These large distributors are becoming less and less dependent on
manufacturers’ brands. Thirty years ago, only two very big American
retailers successfully sold their own ‘private labels’: R. H. Macy and
Sears, Roebuck. The largest American food retailer of that time, the
Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, tried to emulate these two.
AandandandandP’s private labels were superior value. But the public
refused to buy them, which all but destroyed AandandandandP. Now private
labels are flourishing.</p>
<p>The independent stationery store in my neighbourhood carries only
national brands. But the only national brands carried by the recently
opened local outlet of a stationery discount chain are goods that
require service, such as computers and fax machines, and they account
for less than half of the store’s volume. Increasingly the retail chains
use cable TV to promote their own brands; they no longer depend on the
manufacturers’ advertising on over-the-air networks.</p>
<p>What underlies this shift is information. Wal-Mart is built around
information from the sales floor. Whenever a customer buys anything, the
information goes directly – in ‘real time’ – to the manufacturer’s
plant. It is automatically converted into a manufacturing schedule and
into delivery instructions: when to ship, how to ship, and where to
ship. Traditionally, 20 per cent or 30 per cent of the retail price went
toward getting merchandise from the manufacturer’s loading dock to the
retailer’s store – most of this cost went to keep inventory in three
warehouses: the manufacturer’s, the wholesaler’s and the retailer’s.
These costs are largely eliminated in the Wal-Mart system, which enables
the company to undersell local competitors despite its generally higher
labour costs.</p>
<p>The moment a 7-Eleven customer in Japan buys a soft drink or a can of
beer, the information goes directly to bottler or brewery. It
immediately becomes both production schedule and delivery schedule,
actually specifying the hour when the new supply has to be delivered and
to which of the 4300 stores.</p>
<p>We would not have needed the computer to do what Wal-Mart and
7-Eleven are doing. More than fifty years ago, Marks andandandand
Spencer, the British retail chain, integrated market information and the
manufacturing schedules of its suppliers and created the first
just-in-time system. In the mid-1960s, O. M. Scott of Marysville, Ohio,
a producer of grass seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, built real-time
market information into its manufacturing system. Both almost
immediately attained industry leadership. But once the computer is there
and provides instant market information, the integration of this
information with manufacturing production and delivery becomes
inevitable.</p>
<p>Since I first said it in my 1954 book The Practice of Management, it
has become commonplace to assert that results are only in the
marketplace; where things are being made or moved, there are only costs.
Everybody these days talks of the ‘market-driven’ or the
‘customer-driven’ company. But as long as we did not have market
information, decisions (especially day-to-day operating decisions) had
to be made as manufacturing decisions. They had to be controlled by what
goes on in the plant, and they had to be based on the only information
we had (or believed we had) – on manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>Now that we have real-time information on what goes on in the
marketplace, decisions will increasingly be based on what goes on where
the ultimate customers, whether housewives or hospitals, take buying
action. These decisions will be controlled by the people who have the
information – retailers and distributors. Increasingly, decision-making
power will shift to them.</p>
<p>One implication of this is that producers will have to structure
their plants for ‘flexible manufacturing’ – the buzzword for production
organized around the flow of market information rather than around the
flow of materials, as in traditional manufacturing. The more we
automate, the more important this will be. General Motors largely wasted
0 billion on automating the traditional process, which only made its
plants more expensive, more rigid, and less responsive. Toyota (and, to
some extent, Ford) spent a fraction of what GM spent. But it spent the
money restructuring production around market information – on ‘flexible
manufacturing’.</p>
<p>There is another important implication. When, during the past ten or
fifteen years, companies began to organize themselves internally around
the flow of information – we now call it ‘reengineering’ – they
immediately found that they did not need a good many management levels.
Some companies have since cut two-thirds of their management layers. Now
that we are beginning to organize around external information, we are
learning that the economy needs far fewer intermediaries. We are
eliminating wholesalers.</p>
<p>In the US hardware industry, for example, the new distributors such
as Servistar are doing what three levels of wholesalers used to do. In
Japan, 7-Eleven has eliminated five or six wholesale levels. And this
trend has only started.</p>
<p>Physical distribution is changing too. In many industries the
warehouse is becoming redundant. In others it is changing function. One
medium-sized supermarket chain now handles half its merchandise without
any storage; it goes directly from manufacturer to store. The other half
still goes through a warehouse. But it is not held there; it goes out
within twelve hours, soon to be cut to three – in transportation
parlance, the warehouse has become a ‘switching yard’ instead of a
‘holding yard’.</p>
<p>This also means that the economy needs less and less of the financing
that for two centuries provided banks with their safest and most
lucrative business: short-term lending on inventory. The sharp drop in
the demand for such money explains in large measure why banks in
developed countries are seeing their commercial-loan business shrink,
even in boom times, and why they have been trying to compensate by
rushing into dubious real-estate deals, loans to Third World dictators
and derivatives gambling.</p>
<p>But the biggest implication is that the economy is changing
structure. From being organized around the flow of things and the flow
of money, it is becoming organized around the flow of information.</p>
