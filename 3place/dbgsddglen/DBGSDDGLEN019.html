<h4 id="chinas-growth-markets">17. China’s growth markets</h4>
<p>Coastal China, home to 400 million people of mercantile and urban
culture, has been the world’s fastest-growing economy over the past
decade. But now it, and the rest of the country, face formidable
problems.</p>
<p>To prevent runaway inflation, thousands of unproductive and
unprofitable state enterprises that employ millions of workers and are a
key power base for the Communist Party must be dismantled. Social
tensions are mounting as peasants stream into overcrowded cities where
there is no housing, no health care, and far too few jobs. And a
nationwide power struggle has begun in anticipation of the octogenarian
leadership’s passing. Their successors may not be democrats.</p>
<p>Yet where the internal effects of China’s growth are unsettling, the
external effects are potentially destabilizing. It is hardly a harbinger
of peace that the Chinese military – with no foreign enemy in sight –
eagerly snaps up whatever high-tech weapons a cash-hungry Russia offers
for sale. And the world is confounded by a Chinese trade dragon that
exports like a capitalist but imports like a Communist. The world must
find new ways to meet the challenge of this emerging power.</p>
<p>Trade is a good example. US trade policy towards China should be
based on the assumption that by the early years of the next century,
coastal China might become one of the largest economic powers in terms
of total gross national product, industrial output, and industrial
exports.</p>
<p>Yet a conventional approach to bilateral trade problems may fail to
target the fundamentally different kind of commercial relationship a
modern China will need to have with the world. This is because China is
likely to be the first country where the balance of payments rather than
the balance of trade is the key to economic relations. Indeed, China may
be the first country to be integrated into the world economy through
services rather than through trade in goods.</p>
<p>To be sure, the Chinese market has to open to foreign goods. In many
ways it is far more tightly locked than Japan has ever been. But even if
China’s doors are fully opened, it is doubtful whether the country would
become a major market for foreign-made goods. Despite the enormous size
of its market – more than a billion people with rapidly rising incomes –
and an insatiable appetite for foreign brands, China will not import
Coca-Cola and Levis. Instead, such products will be manufactured in
China – by joint ventures, by franchises such as soft-drink bottlers, by
licences and by alliances of all kinds. (In 1993, Coca-Cola signed an
agreement with the government in Beijing to invest 50 million in ten
bottling plants in China over the next five years.)</p>
<p>The reason for this is compelling social necessity: manufacturing
will be the primary vehicle to accommodate the Chinese peasant’s
transition from the feudal countryside to the modern era. Within the
next ten years, as much as half of China’s population might be employed
in factories. Whatever can be made in China will be made there – and
that means most manufactured products.</p>
<p>Bringing down barriers to the importation of goods into China has to
be worked on, and hard. But far more important is creating a legal and
administrative framework to enable a foreigner to do business in China
as a partner. Laws today are often unenforced, sometimes even
unpublished. There is nearly no protection for a licensor or minority
partner and little respect for intellectual property rights. A trade
policy with China must establish and safeguard access to
partnership.</p>
<p>All that said, the biggest market opportunities for foreigners in a
fast-growing China are not in manufacturing but in services.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, education. Despite a literacy rate of 73 per
cent, China’s university system is one of the world’s most backward and
is unable to support sustained economic growth. There are barely 1.5
million college students in China, a proportion to population smaller
than America’s a hundred years ago. Even India, with a literacy rate
about half that of China, has proportionately nearly four times as many
university students. Worse still, most Chinese university education
prepares students for bureaucratic careers that prove more useful for
preventing others from doing than for getting things done.</p>
<p>Unless this changes, and changes fast, China’s growth will be aborted
by a shortage of engineers and chemists, statisticians and accountants,
physicians and nurses, managers and teachers. In a similar fix forty
years ago, South Korea sent thousands of its young people to US colleges
for training; they then created the ‘Korean miracle’, which transformed
a war-ravaged, rural country of profound poverty into one of the Four
Tigers in less than thirty years.</p>
<p>But China’s education problem will not be alleviated by despatching
40 000 students abroad every year, as it does now. What is needed is a
massive and immediate overhaul of the country’s educational system – a
job that can be done only by large-scale outside service contractors who
design, plan, and set up the needed educational institutions. Qualified
suppliers of such services do exist – the English universities, for
instance, are well trained in such endeavours, as are many American
universities and colleges that generally provide educational contract
services as a charitable activity.</p>
<p>Such generosity, however, ignores a potential market. If such
ventures are organized and professionally run, there is money to be
made. A number of American colleges already have branches in Japan, and
it is not inconceivable that higher education will one day become
America’s biggest ‘export’ to China and the source of major export
earnings.</p>
<p>Health care offers similar opportunities. Mao’s flawed vision of a
China cared for by ‘barefoot doctors’ is as much a travesty today as it
was thirty years ago. What is needed are experienced (and that means
foreign) contractors who plan, design, build, and manage health-care
facilities and train medical staff. The needed hospitals could be built
quite fast: the American military’s field hospitals, developed over the
past thirty years and tested in the Iraq war, provide a prototype.</p>
<p>Financial services, the circulatory system of a modern society,
provide yet another major market opportunity. Chinese financial services
are in worse shape than either higher education or health care, Simply
put, China has a very high savings rate but no way to put the money to
productive use. It lacks the legal structures for a financial industry:
its financial institutions are primitive and its personnel poorly
trained. An infusion of foreign commercial and investment banks,
thrifts, insurance companies, mutual funds, and the reliable economic
and business data they provide would help develop a system that the
Chinese could not possibly develop by themselves, at least not to the
extent they need to in the time they have.</p>
<p>What else does China need? It needs telecommunications and
information services on a massive scale. The need is so great and China
is so far behind that it will have to bypass a century of Western
technology and leap directly into the more modern wireless forms of
telecommunications – shortwave telephone transmission beamed directly
into urban homes, microwave and satellite transmission to span the
enormous distances in the countryside.</p>
<p>The same applies to China’s last major development need:
transportation. China is blessed with excellent natural harbours. But
few are developed well enough to handle much traffic or cargo. And the
few that are lack roads and railways to move goods to the interior.
Almost seven decades have passed since new railway lines were built, and
many of those are narrow-gauge and single-track, have obsolete switching
yards, and still run on steam.</p>
<p>The measure of success in trade relations with China is thus selling
services rather than selling goods. This is surely not ‘free’ trade. But
no matter how desirable it might be, free trade is not a possible policy
for China – at least not until the enormous surplus population from the
farms has been absorbed into urban society and urban jobs.</p>
<p>A service-focused trade policy with China will be criticized,
especially by trade unionists, for ‘not creating jobs’. But this is
yesterday’s argument. In all developed countries the majority of jobs,
especially of well-paid jobs, are precisely in those industries that
would benefit the most from a successful service-focused trade policy:
engineering, design, health care, education, management, training, and
so on. What really matters is that these service areas are the ones
where the emergence of China as a major economic power creates
opportunities. They are where the markets are.</p>
