<h4 id="be-data-literate-know-what-to-know">10. Be data literate; know
what to know</h4>
<p>Executives have become computer-literate. The younger ones,
especially, know more about the way the computer works than they know
about the mechanics of the car or the telephone. But not many executives
are information-literate. They know how to get data. But most still have
to learn how to use data.</p>
<p>Few executives yet know how to ask ‘What information do I need to do
my job? When do I need it? In what form? And from whom should I be
getting it?’ Still fewer ask ‘What new tasks can I tackle now that I get
all these data? Which old tasks should I abandon? Which tasks should I
do differently?’ Practically no one asks ‘What information do I owe? To
whom? When? In what form?’</p>
<p>A ‘database’, no matter how copious, is not information. It is
information’s ore. For raw material to become information, it must be
organized for a task, directed towards specific performance, applied to
a decision. Raw material cannot do that itself. Nor can information
specialists. They can cajole their customers, the data users. They can
advise, demonstrate, teach. But they can no more manage data for users
than a personnel department can take over the management of the people
who work with an executive.</p>
<p>Information specialists are tool makers. The tool users, whether
executive or professional, have to decide what information to use, what
to use it for, and how to use it. They have to make themselves
information-literate. This is the first challenge facing information
users now that executives have become computer-literate.</p>
<p>But the organization, too, has to become information-literate. It,
too, needs to learn to ask ‘What information do we need in this company?
When do we need it? In what form? And where do we get it?’ So far, such
questions are being asked primarily by the military, and even there
mainly for tactical, day-to-day decisions. In business, such questions
have been asked only by a few multinationals, foremost among them the
Anglo-Dutch Unilever, a few oil companies (such as Shell) and the large
Japanese trading companies.</p>
<p>The moment these questions are asked, it becomes clear that the
information a business most depends on is available, if at all, only in
a primitive and disorganized form. For what a business needs the most
for its decisions – especially its strategic ones – are data about what
goes on outside of it. It is only outside the business where there are
results, opportunities, and threats.</p>
<p>So far, the only data from the outside that have been integrated into
most companies’ information systems and into their decision-making
processes are day-to-day market data: what existing customers buy, where
they buy, how they buy. Few businesses have tried to get information
about their non-customers, let alone have integrated such information
into their databases. Yet no matter how powerful a company is in its
industry or market, non-customers almost always outnumber customers.</p>
<p>American department stores had a very large customer base, perhaps 30
per cent of the middle-class market, and they had far more information
about their own customers than any other industry. Yet their failure to
pay attention to the 70 per cent who were not customers largely explains
why they are today in a severe crisis. Their non-customers increasingly
were the young, affluent, double-earner families who were the growth
market of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The commercial banks, for all their copious statistics about their
customers, similarly did not realize until very late that more and more
of their potential customers had become non-customers. Many potential
customers had turned to commercial paper to finance themselves instead
of borrowing from the banks.</p>
<p>When it comes to non-market information – demographics; the behaviour
and plans of actual and potential competitors; technology; economics;
the shifts signalling foreign-exchange fluctuations to come and capital
movements – there are either no data at all or only the broadest of
generalizations. Few attempts have been made to think through the
bearing that such information has on the company’s decisions. How to
obtain these data; how to test them; how to put them together with the
existing information system to make them effective in a company’s
decision process – this is the second major challenge facing information
users today.</p>
<p>It needs to be tackled soon. Companies today rely for their decisions
either on inside data, such as costs, or on untested assumptions about
the outside. In either case they are trying to fly on one wing.</p>
<p>Finally, the most difficult of the new challenges: we will have to
bring together the two information systems that businesses now run side
by side – computer-based data processing and the accounting system. At
least we will have to make the two compatible.</p>
<p>People usually consider accounting to be ‘financial’. But that is
valid only for the past, going back 700 years, that deals with assets,
liabilities, and cash flows; it is only a small part of modern
accounting. Most of accounting deals with operations rather than with
finance, and for operational accounting, money is simply a notation and
the language in which to express non-monetary events. Indeed, accounting
is being shaken to its very roots by reform movements aimed at moving it
away from being financial and towards becoming operational.</p>
<p>There is the new ‘transactional’ accounting that attempts to relate
operations to their expected results. There are attempts to change asset
values from historical cost to estimates of expected future returns.
Accounting has become the most intellectually challenging area in the
field of management, and the most turbulent one. All these new
accounting theories aim at turning accounting data into information for
management decision making. In other words, they share the goals of
computer-based data processing.</p>
<p>Today these two information systems operate in isolation from each
other. They do not even compete, as a rule. In the business schools we
keep the two apart with separate departments of accounting and of
computer science, and separate degrees in each.</p>
<p>The practitioners have different backgrounds, different values,
different career ladders. They work in different departments and for
different bosses. There is a ‘chief information officer’ for
computer-based data processing, usually with a background in computer
technology. Accounting typically reports to a ‘chief financial officer’,
often with a background in financing the company and in managing its
money. Neither boss, in other words, is information-focused as a
rule.</p>
<p>The two systems increasingly overlap. They also increasingly come up
with what look like conflicting – or at least incompatible – data about
the same event; for the two look at the same event quite differently.
Until now this has created little confusion. Companies tended to pay
attention to what their accountants told them and to disregard the data
of their information system, at least for top-management decisions. But
this is changing as computer-literate executives are moving into
decision-making positions.</p>
<p>One development can be considered highly probable: managing money –
what we now call the ‘treasury function’ – will be divorced from
accounting (that is, from its information component) and will be set up,
staffed, and run separately. How we will otherwise manage the two
information systems is up for grabs. But that we will bring them
together within the next ten years, or at least sort out which system
does what, can be predicted.</p>
<p>Computer people still are concerned with greater speed and bigger
memories. But the challenges increasingly will be not technical; rather
they will be to convert data into information that is actually being
used.</p>
