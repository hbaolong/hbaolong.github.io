<h4 id="the-pacific-rim-and-the-world-economy">16. The Pacific Rim and
the world economy</h4>
<p>The next few years – the years between now and the year 2000 – will
decide how Asia’s Pacific Rim will integrate itself into a rapidly
changing world economy. Will it be as a number of independent countries
and economies fiercely competing with one another? Will it be through a
number of regional trade blocs, as the prime minister of Malaysia has
suggested? Or will it be as one – and by far the biggest – of the new
superblocs such as those into which the West is now organizing itself,
each free trade inside but heavily protectionist outside? Whichever way
the decision goes, it will profoundly change Asia as well as world
economy and world politics. And the decision is being forced on the
Asian countries of the Pacific Rim both by developments outside, that
is, in the West, and by their own economic growth.</p>
<p>The rapid reshaping of the West into regional superblocs was
triggered by the completion of the European Economic Community –
arguably the most important economic development of the 1980s. Now North
America is in the process of turning itself into a similar superbloc. In
fact, both Canada and Mexico are already so firmly integrated into the
US economy that it is no longer too important that the North American
Free Trade Agreement (that is, the agreement between the governments of
the United States, Canada, and Mexico) became law. The only question now
is whether other Latin American countries – Chile first, then perhaps
Argentina, and eventually Brazil – will be pulled into the North
American superbloc, the way all of Europe, beginning with Britain, was
pulled into the European Community.</p>
<p>These superblocs into which the West is organizing its economy are
creating the largest and richest free trade areas the world has ever
seen. But at the same time, both the European Union and the North
American economic bloc are being inexorably pushed away from free trade
with the world outside and towards a new protectionism. They will
aggressively push exports, while at the same time fiercely protecting
their domestic industries. And the main reason is not economic. It is
far more compelling: it is social. The social priority for both Western
Europe and the United States will have to be manufacturing jobs in
Eastern Europe and Mexico, respectively. The alternative is to be
inundated by a mass immigration of unskilled or low-skilled people for
whom there are no jobs at home. And as events in Germany (but also in
Los Angeles) show only too clearly, such immigration already exceeds
what is socially and politically manageable. But the only industries in
which such people can possibly be employed in their home countries –
whether Slovakia, the Ukraine, or Mexico – are traditional,
labour-intensive industries: textiles, toys, footwear, cars, steel,
shipbuilding, and consumer electronics. These, however, are the very
industries on whose exports the growing Asian countries of the Pacific
Rim would have to depend – the same industries on whose exports
yesterday’s Asian ‘miracles’ based their early growth: Japan in the
1960s and 1970s and the ‘Four Tigers’ later on. They are, of course,
also the industries on which today’s growth-economies – coastal China,
Thailand, Indonesia – largely expect to base their growth.</p>
<p>But equally as important as what is happening in the West – in fact
more important than the events there – is what is happening in Asia
itself. China faces enormous problems during the next few years –
beginning with the threat of disastrous inflation and reaching all the
way to the threat of wrenching political instability. Yet the coastal
areas of the country, with 300–400 million competent and ambitious
people, should be one of the world’s great economic powers by the year
2000. Per capita production and per capita income will still be those of
a ‘developing’ rather than those of a ‘developed’ country. But total
industrial production in coastal China might be so large within ten
years as to make it a contender for the number two spot in world
industry – the place now contested by Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>Like Japan and the Four Tigers, coastal China will be ‘export-led’ in
its economic development. But the main export market for its products is
a domestic market: the 800 million largely rural people in the country’s
vast interior, people who are after all quite distinct economically,
socially, and culturally from the people of the coastal areas. Like
Japan forty years ago, coastal China will not need large investments
such as Western Europe needed for its reconstruction after the Second
World War. Coastal China has one of the world’s highest savings rates
(if only because there was so little to buy until recently). And now
that investment decisions are largely being made by individuals and in
the market – rather than by bureaucrats indulging in central planning –
capital productivity seems to be quite high (though still lower than it
was in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s). Still, coastal China will need
enormous amounts of foreign exchange. My guess is that within a few
years, the exports coastal China needs to cover its foreign exchange
requirements will be larger than the combined exports of all other
Pacific Rim countries in Asia, excluding Japan.</p>
<p>But who will take these exports? Practically all of them will be in
industries in which there is already substantial overcapacity in the
developed world. The developed countries of Pacific Rim Asia, with
Singapore in the lead, are rapidly moving out of traditional
labour-intensive industries. By the year 2000 even Japan will have
stopped exporting cars to the West’s developed countries and will
instead produce there. But developing countries – especially rapidly
developing countries – have no choice. Thailand and Indonesia face
pretty much the same problem. But coastal China, because of its huge
population and its explosive growth, is the place where the problem will
come to a head. Indeed, for the Clinton administration, eliminating the
trade deficit with China is already a top priority. And the European
Union has no intention at all of letting in Chinese goods that are in
competition with the products of depressed European industries.</p>
<p>This calls for something totally new: Asian leadership in trade
policy. So far, Asian countries have reacted to the trade policies of
the developed countries. Even Japan’s trade policy so far has been in
large measure skilful exploitation of America’s trade policy (or of the
absence of any such thing). Now Asian action is needed. For only Asians
can integrate a rapidly developing Asia into the world economy. But
where will this leadership be coming from?</p>
