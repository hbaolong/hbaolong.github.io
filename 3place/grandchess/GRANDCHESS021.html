<h4 id="beyond-the-last-global-superpower">BEYOND THE LAST GLOBAL
SUPERPOWER</h4>
<p>In the long run, global politics are bound to become increasingly
uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a
single state. Hence, America is not only the first, as well as the only,
truly global superpower, but it is also likely to be the very last.</p>
<p>That is so not only because nation-states are gradually becoming
increasingly permeable but also because knowledge as power is becoming
more diffuse, more shared, and less constrained by national boundaries.
Economic power is also likely to become more dispersed. In the years to
come, no single power is likely to reach the level of 30 percent or so
of the world’s GDP that America sustained throughout much of this
century, not to speak of the 50 percent at which it crested in 1945.
Some estimates suggest that by the end of this decade, America will
still account for about 20 percent of global GDP, declining perhaps to
about 10–15 percent by 2020 as other powers—Europe, China,
Japan—increase their relative share to more or less the American level.
But global economic preponderance by a single entity, of the sort that
America attained in the course of this century, is unlikely, and that
has obviously far-reaching military and political implications.</p>
<p>Moreover, the very multinational and exceptional character of
American society has made it easier for America to universalize its
hegemony without letting it appear to be a strictly national one. For
example, an effort by China to seek global primacy would inevitably be
viewed by others as an attempt to impose a national hegemony. To put it
very simply, anyone can become an American, but only a Chinese can be
Chinese—and that places an additional and significant barrier in the way
of any essentially national global hegemony.</p>
<p>Accordingly, once American leadership begins to fade, America’s
current global predominance is unlikely to be replicated by any single
state. Thus, the key question for the future is “What will America
bequeath to the world as the enduring legacy of its primacy?”</p>
<p>The answer depends in part on how long that primacy lasts and on how
energetically America shapes a framework of key power partnerships that
over time can be more formally institutionalized. In fact, the window of
historical opportunity for America’s constructive exploitation of its
global power could prove to be relatively brief, for both domestic and
external reasons. A genuinely populist democracy has never before
attained international supremacy. The pursuit of power and especially
the economic costs and human sacrifice that the exercise of such power
often requires are not generally congenial to democratic instincts.
Democratization is inimical to imperial mobilization.</p>
<p>Indeed, the critical uncertainty regarding the future may well be
whether America might become the first superpower unable or unwilling to
wield its power. Might it become an impotent global power? Public
opinion polls suggest that only a small minority (13 percent) of
Americans favor the proposition that “as the sole remaining superpower,
the U.S. should continue to be the preeminent world leader in solving
international problems.” An overwhelming majority (74 percent) prefer
that America “do its fair share in efforts to solve international
problems together with other countries.”34</p>
<p>Moreover, as America becomes an increasingly multicultural society,
it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy
issues, except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely
perceived direct external threat. Such a consensus generally existed
throughout World War II and even during the Cold War. It was rooted,
however, not only in deeply shared democratic values, which the public
sensed were being threatened, but also in a cultural and ethnic affinity
for the predominantly European victims of hostile totalitarianisms.</p>
<p>In the absence of a comparable external challenge, American society
may find it much more difficult to reach agreement regarding foreign
policies that cannot be directly related to central beliefs and widely
shared cultural-ethnic sympathies and that still require an enduring and
sometimes costly imperial engagement. If anything, two extremely varying
views on the implications of America’s historic victory in the Cold War
are likely to be politically more appealing: on the one hand, the view
that the end of the Cold War justifies a significant reduction in
America’s global engagement, irrespective of the consequences for
America’s global standing; and on the other, the perception that the
time has come for genuine international multilateralism, to which
America should even yield some of its sovereignty. Both extremes command
the loyalty of committed constituencies.</p>
<p>More generally, cultural change in America may also be uncon-genial
to the sustained exercise abroad of genuinely imperial power. That
exercise requires a high degree of doctrinal motivation, intellectual
commitment, and patriotic gratification. Yet the dominant culture of the
country has become increasingly fixated on mass entertainment that has
been heavily dominated by personally hedonistic and socially escapist
themes. The cumulative effect has made it increasingly difficult to
mobilize the needed political consensus on behalf of sustained, and also
occasionally costly, American leadership abroad. Mass communications
have been playing a particularly important role in that regard,
generating a strong revulsion against any selective use of force that
entails even low levels of casualties.</p>
<p>In addition, both America and Western Europe have been finding it
difficult to cope with the cultural consequences of social hedonism and
the dramatic decline in the centrality of religious-based values in
society. (The parallels with the decline of the imperial systems
summarized in chapter 1 are striking in that respect.) The resulting
cultural crisis has been compounded by the spread of drugs and,
especially in America, by its linkage to the racial issue. Lastly, the
rate of economic growth is no longer able to keep up with growing
material expectations, with the latter stimulated by a culture that
places a premium on consumption. It is no exaggeration to state that a
sense of historical anxiety, perhaps even of pessimism, is becoming
palpable in the more articulate sectors of Western society.</p>
<p>Almost half a century ago, a noted historian, Hans Kohn, having
observed the tragic experience of the two world wars and the
debilitating consequences of the totalitarian challenge, worried that
the West may have become “fatigued and exhausted.” Indeed, he feared
that</p>
<ul>
<li>〔t〕wentieth century man has become less confident than his
nineteenth century ancestor was. He has witnessed the dark powers of
history in his own experience. Things which seemed to belong to the past
have reappeared: fanatical faith, infallible leaders, slavery and
massacres, the uprooting of whole populations, ruthlessness and
barbarism.35</li>
</ul>
<p>That lack of confidence has been intensified by widespread
disappointment with the consequences of the end of the Cold War. Instead
of a “new world order” based on consensus and harmony, “things which
seemed to belong to the past” have all of a sudden become the future.
Although ethnic-national conflicts may no longer pose the risk of a
central war, they do threaten the peace in significant parts of the
globe. Thus, war is not likely to become obsolete for some time to come.
With the more-endowed nations constrained by their own higher
technological capacity for self-destruction as well as by self-interest,
war may have become a luxury that only the poor peoples of this world
can afford. In the foreseeable future, the impoverished two-thirds of
humanity may not be motivated by the restraint of the privileged.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that international conflicts and acts of
terrorism have so far been remarkably devoid of any use of the weapons
of mass destruction. How long that self-restraint may hold is inherently
unpredictable, but the increasing availability, not only to states but
also to organized groups, of the means to inflict massive casualties—by
the use of nuclear or bacteriological weapons—also inevitably increases
the probability of their employment.</p>
<p>In brief, America as the world’s premier power does face a narrow
window of historical opportunity. The present moment of relative global
peace may be short lived. This prospect underlines the urgent need for
an American engagement in the world that is deliberately focused on the
enhancement of international geopolitical stability and that is capable
of reviving in the West a sense of historical optimism. That optimism
requires the demonstrated capacity to deal simultaneously with internal
social and external geopolitical challenges.</p>
<p>However, the rekindling of Western optimism and the universalism of
the West’s values are not exclusively dependent on America and Europe.
Japan and India demonstrate that the notions of human rights and the
centrality of the democratic experiment can be valid in Asian settings
as well, both in highly developed ones and in those that are still only
developing. The continued democratic success of Japan and India is,
therefore, also of enormous importance in sustaining a more confident
perspective regarding the future political shape of the globe. Indeed,
their experience, as well as that of South Korea and Taiwan, suggests
that China’s continued economic growth, coupled with pressures from
outside for change generated by greater international inclusion, might
perhaps also lead to the progressive democratization of the Chinese
system.</p>
<p>Meeting these challenges is America’s burden as well as its unique
responsibility. Given the reality of American democracy, an effective
response will require generating a public understanding of the
continuing importance of American power in shaping a widening framework
of stable geopolitical cooperation, one that simultaneously averts
global anarchy and successfully defers the emergence of a new power
challenge. These two goals—averting global anarchy and impeding the
emergence of a power rival—are inseparable from the longer-range
definition of the purpose of America’s global engagement, namely, that
of forging an enduring framework of global geopolitical cooperation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to date, efforts to spell out a new central and
worldwide objective for the United States, in the wake of the
termination of the Cold War, have been one-dimensional. They have failed
to link the need to improve the human condition with the imperative of
preserving the centrality of American power in world affairs. Several
such recent attempts can be identified. During the first two years of
the Clinton administration, the advocacy of “assertive multilateralism”
did not sufficiently take into account the basic realities of
contemporary power. Later on, the alternative emphasis on the notion
that America should focus on global “democratic enlargement” did not
adequately take into account the continuing importance to America of
maintaining global stability or even of promoting some expedient (but
regrettably not “democratic”) power relationships, as with China.</p>
<p>As the central U.S. priority, more narrowly focused appeals have been
even less satisfactory, such as those concentrating on the elimination
of prevailing injustice in the global distribution of income, on shaping
a special “mature strategic partnership” with Russia, or on containing
weapons proliferation. Other alternatives—that America should
concentrate on safeguarding the environment or, more narrowly, on
combating local wars—have also tended to ignore the central realities of
global power. As a result, none of the foregoing formulations have fully
addressed the need to create minimal global geopolitical stability as
the essential foundation for the simultaneous protraction of American
hegemony and the effective aversion of international anarchy.</p>
<p>In brief, the U.S. policy goal must be unapologetically twofold: to
perpetuate America’s own dominant position for at least a generation and
preferably longer still; and to create a geopolitical framework that can
absorb the inevitable shocks and strains of social-political change
while evolving into the geopolitical core of shared responsibility for
peaceful global management. A prolonged phase of gradually expanding
cooperation with key Eurasian partners, both stimulated and arbitrated
by America, can also help to foster the preconditions for an eventual
upgrading of the existing and increasingly antiquated UN structures. A
new distribution of responsibilities and privileges can then take into
account the changed realities of global power, so drastically different
from those of 1945.</p>
<p>These efforts will have the added historical advantage of benefiting
from the new web of global linkages that is growing exponentially
outside the more traditional nation-state system. That web—woven by
multinational corporations, NGOs (nongovernmental organizations, with
many of them transnational in character) and scientific communities and
reinforced by the Internet—already creates an informal global system
that is inherently congenial to more institutionalized and inclusive
global cooperation.</p>
<p>In the course of the next several decades, a functioning structure of
global cooperation, based on geopolitical realities, could thus emerge
and gradually assume the mantle of the world’s current “regent,” which
has for the time being assumed the burden of responsibility for world
stability and peace. Geostrategic success in that cause would represent
a fitting legacy of America’s role as the first, only, and last truly
global superpower.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that influential voices both in Finland and in
Sweden have began to discuss the possibility of association with NATO.
In May 1996, the commander of the Finnish Defense Forces was reported by
the Swedish media to have raised the possibility of some NATO
deployments on Nordic soil, and in August 1996, the Swedish Parliament’s
Defense Committee, in an action symptomatic of a gradual drift toward
closer security cooperation with NATO, recommended that Sweden join the
Western European Armaments Group (WEAG) to which only NATO members
belong.</p>

<p>For example, even Yeltsin’s top adviser, Dmitryi Ryurikov, was quoted
by Interfax (November 20, 1996) as considering Ukraine to be “a
temporary phenomenon,” while Moscow’s Obshchaya Gazeta (December 10,
1996) reported that “in the foreseeable future events in eastern Ukraine
may confront Russia with a very difficult problem. Mass manifestations
of discontent . . . will be accompanied by appeals to Russia, or even
demands, to take over the region. Quite a few people in Moscow would be
ready to support such plans.” Western concerns regarding Russian
intentions were certainly not eased by Russian demands for Crimea and
Sevastopol, nor by such provocative acts as the deliberate inclusion in
late 1996 of Sevastopol in Russian public television’s nightly weather
forecasts for Russian cities.</p>

<p>In early 1996, General Aleksandr Lebed published a remarkable article
(“The Fading of Empire or the Rebirth of Russia,” Segodnya, April 26,
1996) that went a long way toward making that case.</p>

<p>21</p>
<p>“Official Document Anticipates Disorder During the Post-Deng Period,”
Cheng Ming (Hong Kong), February 1, 1995, provides a detailed summary of
two analyses prepared for the Party leadership concerning various forms
of potential unrest. A Western perspective on the same topic is
contained in Richard Baum, “China After Deng: Ten Scenarios in Search of
Reality,” China Quarterly (March 1996).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In the somewhat optimistic report titled “China’s Economy Toward the
21st Century” (Zou xiang 21 shi ji de Zhongguo jinji), issued in 1996 by
the Chinese Institute for Quantitative Economic and Technological
Studies, it was estimated that the per capita income in China in 2010
will be approximately 35, or less than 0 higher than the World Bank
definition of a low-income country.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>According to Yazhou Zhoukan (Asiaweek), September 25, 1994, the
aggregate assets of the 500 leading Chinese-owned companies in Southeast
Asia totaled about 40 billion. Other estimates are even higher:
International Economy, November/December 1996, reported that the annual
income of the 50 million overseas Chinese was approximately the above
amount and thus roughly equal to the GDP of China’s mainland. The
overseas Chinese were said to control about 90 percent of Indonesia’s
economy, 75 percent of Thailand’s, 50–60 percent of Malaysia’s, and the
whole economy in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Concern over this
condition even led a former Indonesian ambassador to Japan to warn
publicly of a “Chinese economic intervention in the region,” which might
not only exploit such Chinese presence but which could even lead to
Chinese-sponsored “puppet governments” (Saydiman Suryohadiprojo, “How to
Deal with China and Taiwan,” Asahi Shimbun 〔Tokyo〕, September 23,
1996).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Symptomatic in that regard was the report published in the Bangkok
English-language daily, The Nation (March 31, 1997), on the visit to
Beijing by the Thai Prime Minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The purpose
of the visit was defined as establishing a firm strategic alliance with
“Greater China.” The Thai leadership was said to have “recognized China
as a superpower that has a global role,” and as wishing to serve as “a
bridge between China and ASEAN.” Singapore has gone even farther in
stressing its identification with China.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Song Yimin. “A Discussion of the Division and Grouping of Forces in
the World After the End of the Cold War,” International Studies (China
Institute of International Studies, Beijing) 6–8 (1996):10. That this
assessment of America represents the view of China’s top leadership is
indicated by the fact that a shorter version of the analysis appeared in
the mass-circulation official organ of the Party, Renmin Ribao (People’s
Daily), April 29, 1996.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>An elaborate examination of America’s alleged intent to construct
such an anti-China Asian system is contained in Wang Chunyin, “Looking
Ahead to Asia-Pacific Security in the Early Twenty-first Century,” Guoji
Zhanwang (World Outlook), February 1996.</p>
<p>Another Chinese commentator argued that the American-Japanese
security arrangement has been altered from a “shield of defense” aimed
at containing Soviet power to a “spear of attack” pointed at China (Yang
Baijiang, “Implications of Japan-U.S. Security Declaration Outlined,”
Xiandai Guoji Guanxi 〔Contemporary International Relations〕, June 20,
1996). On January 31, 1997, the authoritative daily organ of the Chinese
Communist Party, Renmin Ribao, published an article entitled
“Strengthening Military Alliance Does Not Conform with Trend of the
Times,” in which the redefinition of the scope of the U.S.-Japanese
military cooperation was denounced as “a dangerous move.”</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>The Japan Digest, February 25, 1997, reported that, according to a
governmental poll, only 36 percent of the Japanese felt friendly toward
South Korea.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>For example, the Higuchi Commission, a prime-ministerial advisory
board that outlined the “Three Pillars of Japanese Security Policy” in a
report issued in the summer of 1994, stressed the primacy of the
American-Japanese security ties but also advocated an Asian multilateral
security dialogue; the 1994 Ozawa Committee report, “Blueprint for a New
Japan”; the Yomiuri Shimbun’s outline for “A Comprehensive Security
Policy” of May 1995, advocating among other items the use abroad of the
Japanese military for peacekeeping; the April 1996 report of the Japan
Association of Corporate Executives (keizai doyukai), prepared with the
assistance of the Fuji Bank think tank, urging greater symmetry in the
American-Japanese defense system; the report entitled “Possibility and
Role of a Security System in the Asian-Pacific Region,” submitted to the
prime minister in June 1996 by the Japan Forum on International Affairs;
as well as numerous books and articles published over the last several
years, often much more polemical and extreme in their recommendations
and more often cited by the Western media than the above-mentioned
mostly mainstream reports. For example, in 1996 a book edited by a
Japanese general evoked widespread press commentaries when it dared to
speculate that under some circumstances the United States might fail to
protect Japan and hence Japan should augment its national defense
capabilities (see General Yasuhiro Morino, ed., Next Generation Ground
Self-Defense Force and the commentary on it in “Myths of the U.S. Coming
to Our Aid,” Sankei Shimbun, March 4, 1996).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Some conservative Japanese have been tempted by the notion of a
special Japan-Taiwan connection, and in 1996 a “Japan-Taiwan
Parliamentarians’ Association” was formed to promote that goal. The
Chinese reaction has been predictably hostile.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>In a meeting in 1996 with China’s top national security and defense
officials, I identified (using occasionally deliberately vague
formulations) the following areas of common strategic interest as the
basis for such a dialogue: (1) a peaceful Southeast Asia; (2) nonuse of
force in the resolution of offshore issues; (3) peaceful reunification
of China; (4) stability in Korea; (5) independence of Central Asia; (6)
balance between India and Pakistan; (7) an economically dynamic and
internationally benign Japan; (8) a stable but not too strong
Russia.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>A strong case for this initiative, pointing out the mutual economic
benefits thereof, is made by Kurt Tong, “Revolutionizing America’s Japan
Policy,” Foreign Policy (Winter 1996–1997).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>A number of constructive proposals to that end were advanced at the
CSIS (Center for International and Strategic Studies) Conference on
America and Europe, held in Brussels in February 1997. They ranged from
joint efforts at structural reform, designed to reduce government
deficits, to the development of an enhanced European defense industrial
base, which would enhance transatlantic defense collaboration and a
greater European role in NATO. A useful list of similar and other
initiatives, meant to generate a greater European role, is contained in
David C. Gompert and F. Stephen Larrabee, eds., America and Europe: A
Partnership for a New Era (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND, 1997).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>It is appropriate to quote here the wise advice offered by my
colleague at CSIS, Anthony H. Cordesman (in his paper on “The American
Threat to the United States,” February 1997, p. 16, delivered as a
speech to the Army War College), who has warned against the American
propensity to demonize issues and even nations. As he put it: “Iran,
Iraq, and Libya are cases where the U.S. has taken hostile regimes that
pose real, but limited threats and ‘demonized’ them without developing
any workable mid- to long-term end game for its strategy. U.S. planners
cannot hope to totally isolate these states, and it makes no sense to
treat them as if they were identical ‘rogue’ or ‘terrorist’ states…. The
U.S. lives in a morally gray world and cannot succeed by trying to make
it black and white.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>“An Emerging Consensus—A Study of American Public Attitudes on
America’s Role in the World” (College Park: Center for International and
Security Studies at the University of Maryland, July 1996). It is
noteworthy, but not inconsistent with the foregoing, that studies by the
above center, conducted in early 1997 (under principal investigator
Steven Kull), also showed a considerable majority in favor of NATO
expansion (62 percent in favor, with 27 percent strongly in favor; and
only 29 percent against, with 14 percent strongly against).</p>
