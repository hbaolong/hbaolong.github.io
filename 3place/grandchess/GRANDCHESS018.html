<h4 id="americas-geostrategic-adjustment">AMERICA’S GEOSTRATEGIC
ADJUSTMENT</h4>
<p>It should be the task of American policy to make certain that Japan
pursues such a choice and that China’s rise to regional preeminence does
not preclude a stable triangular balance of East Asian power. The effort
to manage both Japan and China and to maintain a stable three-way
interaction that also involves America will severely tax American
diplomatic skills and political imagination. Shedding past fixation on
the threat allegedly posed by Japan’s economic ascension and eschewing
fears of Chinese political muscle could help to infuse cool realism into
a policy that must be based on careful strategic calculus: how to
channel Japanese energy in the international direction and how to steer
Chinese power into a regional accommodation.</p>
<p>Only in this manner will America be able to forge on the eastern
mainland of Eurasia a geopolitically congenial equivalent to Europe’s
role on the western periphery of Eurasia, that is, a structure of
regional power based on shared interests. However, unlike the European
case, a democratic bridgehead on the eastern mainland will not soon
emerge. Instead, in the Far East the redirected alliance with Japan must
also serve as the basis for an American accommodation with a regionally
preeminent China.</p>
<p>For America, several important geostrategic conclusions flow from the
analysis contained in the preceding two sections of this chapter:</p>
<p>The prevailing wisdom that China is the next global power is breeding
paranoia about China and fostering megalomania within China. Fears of an
aggressive and antagonistic China that before long is destined to be the
next global power are, at best, premature; and, at worst, they can
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It follows that it would be
counterproductive to organize a coalition designed to contain China’s
rise to global power. That would only ensure that a regionally
influential China would be hostile. At the same time, any such effort
would strain the American-Japanese relationship, since most Japanese
would be likely to oppose such a coalition. Accordingly, the United
States should desist from pressing Japan to assume larger defense
responsibilities in the Asia-Pacific region. Efforts to that effect will
merely hinder the emergence of a stable relationship between Japan and
China, while also further isolating Japan in the region.</p>
<p>But precisely because China is in fact not likely to emerge soon as a
global power—and because for that very reason it would be unwise to
pursue a policy of China’s regional containment—it is desirable to treat
China as a globally significant player. Drawing China into wider
international cooperation and granting it the status it craves can have
the effect of dulling the sharper edges of China’s national ambitions.
An important step in that direction would be to include China in the
annual summit of the world’s leading countries, the so-called G-7 (Group
of Seven), especially since Russia has also been invited to it.</p>
<p>Despite appearances, China does not in fact have grand strategic
options. China’s continued economic success remains heavily dependent on
the inflow of Western capital and technology and on access to foreign
markets, and that severely limits China’s options. An alliance with an
unstable and impoverished Russia would not enhance China’s economic or
geopolitical prospects (and for Russia it would mean subordination to
China). It is thus not a viable geostrategic option, even if it is
tactically tempting for both China and Russia to toy with the idea.
Chinese aid to Iran and Pakistan is of more immediate regional and
geopolitical significance to China, but that also does not provide the
point of departure for a serious quest for global power status. An
“antihegemonic” coalition could become a last-resort option if China
came to feel that its national or regional aspirations were being
blocked by the United States (with Japan’s support). But it would be a
coalition of the poor, who would then be likely to remain collectively
poor for quite some time.</p>
<p>A Greater China is emerging as the regionally dominant power. As
such, it may attempt to impose itself on its neighbors in a manner that
is regionally destabilizing; or it may be satisfied with exercising its
influence more indirectly, in keeping with past Chinese imperial
history. Whether a hegemonic sphere of influence or a vaguer sphere of
deference emerges will depend in part on how brutal and authoritarian
the Chinese regime remains and in part also on the manner in which the
key outside players, notably America and Japan, react to the emergence
of a Greater China. A policy of simple appeasement could encourage a
more assertive Chinese posture; but a policy of merely obstructing the
emergence of such a China would also be likely to produce a similar
outcome. Cautious accommodation on some issues and a precise drawing of
the line on others might avoid either extreme.</p>
<p>In any case, in some areas of Eurasia, a Greater China may exercise a
geopolitical influence that is compatible with America’s grand
geostrategic interests in a stable but politically pluralistic Eurasia.
For example, China’s growing interest in Central Asia inevitably
constrains Russia’s freedom of action in seeking to achieve any form of
political reintegration of the region under Moscow’s control. In this
connection and as related to the Persian Gulf, China’s growing need for
energy dictates a common interest with America in maintaining free
access to and political stability in the oil-producing regions.
Similarly, China’s support for Pakistan restrains India’s ambitions to
subordinate that country and offsets India’s inclination to cooperate
with Russia in regard to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Finally, Chinese
and Japanese involvement in the development of eastern Siberia can
likewise help to enhance regional stability. These common interests
should be explored through a sustained strategic dialogue.30</p>
<p>There are also areas where Chinese ambitions might clash with
American (and also Japanese) interests, especially if these ambitions
were to be pursued through historically more familiar strong-arm
tactics. This applies particularly to Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and
Korea.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is potentially too rich, geographically too spread
out, and simply too big to be easily subordinated by even a powerful
China—but it is also too weak and politically too fragmented not to
become at least a sphere of deference for China. China’s regional
influence, abetted by the Chinese financial and economic presence in all
of the area’s countries, is bound to grow as China’s power increases.
Much depends on how China applies that power, but it is not self-evident
that America has any special interest in opposing it directly or in
becoming involved in such issues as the South China Sea dispute. The
Chinese have considerable historical experience in subtly managing
unequal (or tributary) relationships, and it would certainly be in
China’s own interest to exercise self-restraint in order to avoid
regional fears of Chinese imperialism. That fear could generate a
regional anti-Chinese coalition (and some overtones of that are already
present in the nascent Indonesian-Australian military cooperation),
which would then most likely seek support from the United States, Japan,
and Australia.</p>
<p>A Greater China, especially after digesting Hong Kong, will almost
certainly seek more energetically to achieve Taiwan’s reunification with
the mainland. It is important to appreciate the fact that China has
never acquiesced in the indefinite separation of Taiwan. Therefore, at
some point, that issue could generate a head-on American-Chinese
collision. Its consequences for all concerned would be most damaging:
China’s economic prospects would be set back; America’s ties with Japan
could become severely strained; and American efforts to create a stable
balance of power in eastern Eurasia could be derailed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is essential to attain and maintain reciprocally the
utmost clarity on this issue. Even if for the foreseeable future China
is likely to lack the means to effectively coerce Taiwan, Beijing must
understand—and be credibly convinced—that American acquiescence in an
attempt at the forcible reintegration of Taiwan, sought by the use of
military power, would be so devastating to America’s position in the Far
East that America simply could not afford to remain militarily passive
if Taiwan were unable to protect itself.</p>
<p>In other words, America would have to intervene not for the sake of a
separate Taiwan but for the sake of America’s geopolitical interests in
the Asia-Pacific area. This is an important distinction. The United
States does not have, per se, any special interest in a separate Taiwan.
In fact, its official position has been, and should remain, that there
is only one China. But how China seeks reunification can impinge on
vital American interests, and the Chinese have to be clearly aware of
that.</p>
<p>The issue of Taiwan also gives America a legitimate reason for
raising the human rights question in its dealings with China without
justifying the accusation of interference in Chinese domestic affairs.
It is perfectly appropriate to reiterate to Beijing that reunification
will be accomplished only when China becomes more prosperous and more
democratic. Only such a China will be able to attract Taiwan and
assimilate it within a Greater China that is also prepared to be a
confederation based on the principle of “one country, several systems.”
In any case, because of Taiwan, it is in China’s own interest to enhance
respect for human rights, and it is appropriate in that context for
America to address the matter.</p>
<p>At the same time, it behooves the United States—in keeping with its
promise to China—to abstain from directly or indirectly supporting any
international upgrading of Taiwan’s status. In the 1990s, some
U.S.-Taiwanese official contacts conveyed the impression that the United
States was tacitly beginning to treat Taiwan as a separate state, and
the Chinese anger over this issue was understandable, as was Chinese
resentment of the intensifying effort by Taiwanese officials to gain
international recognition for Taiwan’s separate status.</p>
<p>The United States should not be shy, therefore, in making it clear
that its attitude toward Taiwan will be adversely affected by Taiwanese
efforts to alter the long-established and deliberate ambiguities
governing the China-Taiwan relationship. Moreover, if China does prosper
and does democratize and if its absorption of Hong Kong does not involve
a retrogression regarding civil rights, American encouragement of a
serious cross-Strait dialogue regarding the terms of an eventual
reunification would also help generate pressure for increased
democratization within China, while fostering a wider strategic
accommodation between the United States and a Greater China.</p>
<p>Korea, the geopolitically pivotal state in Northeast Asia, could
again become a source of contention between America and China, and its
future will also impact directly on the American-Japanese connection. As
long as Korea remains divided and potentially vulnerable to a war
between the unstable North and the increasingly rich South, American
forces will have to remain on the peninsula. Any unilateral U.S.
withdrawal would not only be likely to precipitate a new war but would,
in all probability, also signal the end of the American military
presence in Japan. It is difficult to conceive of the Japanese
continuing to rely on continued U.S. deployment on Japanese soil in the
wake of an American abandonment of South Korea. Rapid Japanese
rearmament would be the most likely consequence, with broadly
destabilizing consequences in the region as a whole.</p>
<p>Korea’s reunification, however, would also be likely to pose serious
geopolitical dilemmas. If American forces were to remain in a reunified
Korea, they would inevitably be viewed by the Chinese as pointed against
China. In fact, it is doubtful that the Chinese would acquiesce in
reunification under these circumstances. If that reunification were
taking place by stages, involving a so-called soft landing, China would
obstruct it politically and support those elements in North Korea that
remained opposed to reunification. If that reunification were taking
place violently, with North Korea “crash landing,” even Chinese military
intervention could not be precluded. From the Chinese perspective, a
reunified Korea would be acceptable only if it is not simultaneously a
direct extension of American power (with Japan in the background as its
springboard).</p>
<p>However, a reunified Korea without U.S. troops on its soil would be
quite likely to gravitate first toward a form of neutrality between
China and Japan and then gradually—driven in part by residual but still
intense anti-Japanese feelings—toward a Chinese sphere of either
politically more assertive influence or somewhat more delicate
deference. The issue would then arise as to whether Japan would still be
willing to serve as the only Asian base for American power. At the very
least, the issue would be most divisive within Japanese domestic
politics. Any resulting retraction in the scope of U.S. military reach
in the Far East would in turn make the maintenance of a stable Eurasian
balance of power more difficult. These considerations thus enhance the
American and Japanese stakes in the Korean status quo (though in each
case, for somewhat different reasons), and if that status quo is to be
altered, it must occur in very slow stages, preferably in a setting of a
deepening American-Chinese regional accommodation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a true Japanese-Korean reconciliation would
contribute significantly to a more stable regional setting for any
eventual reunification. The various international complications that
could ensue from Korean reintegration would be mitigated by a genuine
reconciliation between Japan and Korea, resulting in an increasingly
cooperative and binding political relationship between these two
countries. The United States could play the critical role in promoting
that reconciliation. Many specific steps that were taken to advance
first the German-French reconciliation and later that between Germany
and Poland (for example, ranging from joint university programs
eventually to combined military formations) could be adapted to this
case. A comprehensive and regionally stabilizing Japanese-Korean
partnership would, in turn, facilitate a continuing American presence in
the Far East even perhaps after Korea’s unification.</p>
<p>It almost goes without saying that a close political relationship
with Japan is in America’s global geostrategic interest. But whether
Japan is to be America’s vassal, rival, or partner depends on the
ability of the Americans and Japanese to define more clearly what
international goals the countries should seek in common and to demarcate
more sharply the dividing line between the U.S. geostrategic mission in
the Far East and Japan’s aspirations for a global role. For Japan,
despite the domestic debates about Japan’s foreign policy, the
relationship with America still remains the central beacon for its own
sense of international direction. A disoriented Japan, lurching toward
either rearmament or a separate accommodation with China, would spell
the end of the American role in the Asia-Pacific region and would
foreclose the emergence of a regionally stable triangular arrangement
involving America, Japan, and China. That, in turn, would preclude the
shaping of an American-managed political equilibrium throughout
Eurasia.</p>
<p>In brief, a disoriented Japan would be like a beached whale:
thrashing around helplessly but dangerously. It could destabilize Asia,
but it could not create a viable alternative to the needed stabilizing
balance among America, Japan, and China. It is only through a close
alliance with Japan that America will be able to accommodate China’s
regional aspirations and constrain its more arbitrary manifestations.
Only on that basis can an intricate three-way accommodation—one that
involves America’s global power, China’s regional preeminence, and
Japan’s international leadership—be contrived.</p>
<p>It follows that in the foreseeable future, reduction of the existing
levels of U.S. forces in Japan (and, by extension, in Korea) is not
desirable. By the same token, however, any significant increase in the
geopolitical scope and the actual magnitude of the Japanese military
effort is also undesirable. A significant U.S. withdrawal would most
probably prompt a major Japanese armament program in the context of an
unsettling strategic disorientation, whereas American pressure on Japan
to assume a greater military role can only damage the prospects for
regional stability, impede a wider regional accommodation with a Greater
China, divert Japan from undertaking a more constructive international
mission, and thereby complicate the effort to foster stable geopolitical
pluralism throughout Eurasia.</p>
<p>It also follows that Japan—if it is to turn its face to the world and
away from Asia—must be given a meaningful incentive and a special
status, so that its own national interest is thereby well served. Unlike
China, which can seek global power by first becoming a regional power,
Japan can gain global influence by eschewing the quest for regional
power. But that makes it all the more important for Japan to feel that
it is America’s special partner in a global vocation that is as
politically satisfying as it is economically beneficial. To that end,
the United States would do well to consider the adoption of an
American-Japanese free trade agreement, thereby creating a common
American-Japanese economic space. Such a step, formalizing the growing
linkage between the two economies, would provide the geopolitical
underpinning both for America’s continued presence in the Far East and
for Japan’s constructive global engagement.31</p>
<p>To conclude: For America, Japan should be its vital and foremost
partner in the construction of an increasingly cooperative and pervasive
system of global cooperation but not primarily its military ally in any
regional arrangement designed to contest China’s regional preeminence.
In effect, Japan should be America’s global partner in tackling the new
agenda of world affairs. A regionally preeminent China should become
America’s Far Eastern anchor in the more traditional domain of power
politics, helping thereby to foster a Eurasian balance of power, with
Greater China in Eurasia’s East matching in that respect the role of an
enlarging Europe in Eurasia’s West.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>THE TIME HAS COME for the United States to formulate and prosecute an
integrated, comprehensive, and long-term geostrategy for all of Eurasia.
This need arises out of the interaction between two fundamental
realities: America is now the only global superpower, and Eurasia is the
globe’s central arena. Hence, what happens to the distribution of power
on the Eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to America’s
global primacy and to America’s historical legacy.</p>
<p>American global primacy is unique in its scope and character. It is a
hegemony of a new type that reflects many of the features of the
American democratic system: it is pluralistic, permeable, and flexible.
Attained in the course of less than a century, the principal
geopolitical manifestation of that hegemony is America’s unprecedented
role on the Eurasian landmass, hitherto the point of origin of all
previous contenders for global power. America is now Eurasia’s arbiter,
with no major Eurasian issue soluble without America’s participation or
contrary to America’s interests.</p>
<p>How the United States both manipulates and accommodates the principal
geostrategic players on the Eurasian chessboard and how it manages
Eurasia’s key geopolitical pivots will be critical to the longevity and
stability of America’s global primacy. In Europe, the key players will
continue to be France and Germany, and America’s central goal should be
to consolidate and expand the existing democratic bridgehead on
Eurasia’s western periphery. In Eurasia’s Far East, China is likely to
be increasingly central, and America will not have a political foothold
on the Asian mainland unless an American-Chinese geostrategic consensus
is successfully nurtured. In the center of Eurasia, the space between an
enlarging Europe and a regionally rising China will remain a
geopolitical black hole at least until Russia resolves its inner
struggle over its postimperial self-definition, while the region to the
south of Russia—the Eurasian Balkans—threatens to become a cauldron of
ethnic conflict and great-power rivalry.</p>
<p>In that context, for some time to come—for more than a
generation—America’s status as the world’s premier power is unlikely to
be contested by any single challenger. No nation-state is likely to
match America in the four key dimensions of power (military, economic,
technological, and cultural) that cumulatively produce decisive global
political clout. Short of a deliberate or unintentional American
abdication, the only real alternative to American global leadership in
the foreseeable future is international anarchy. In that respect, it is
correct to assert that America has become, as President Clinton put it,
the world’s “indispensable nation.”</p>
<p>It is important to stress here both the fact of that indispensability
and the actuality of the potential for global anarchy. The disruptive
consequences of population explosion, poverty-driven migration,
radicalizing urbanization, ethnic and religious hostilities, and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction would become unmanageable
if the existing and underlying nation-state-based framework of even
rudimentary geopolitical stability were itself to fragment. Without
sustained and directed American involvement, before long the forces of
global disorder could come to dominate the world scene. And the
possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical
tensions not only of today’s Eurasia but of the world more
generally.</p>
<p>The resulting risks to global stability are likely to be further
increased by the prospect of a more general degradation of the human
condition. Particularly in the poorer countries of the world, the
demographic explosion and the simultaneous urbanization of these
populations are rapidly generating a congestion not only of the
disadvantaged but especially of the hundreds of millions of unemployed
and increasingly restless young, whose level of frustration is growing
at an exponential rate. Modern communications intensify their rupture
with traditional authority, while making them increasingly conscious—and
resentful—of global inequality and thus more susceptible to extremist
mobilization. On the one hand, the rising phenomenon of global
migrations, already reaching into the tens of millions, may act as a
temporary safety valve, but on the other hand, it is also likely to
serve as a vehicle for the transcontinental conveyance of ethnic and
social conflicts.</p>
<p>The global stewardship that America has inherited is hence likely to
be buffeted by turbulence, tension, and at least sporadic violence. The
new and complex international order, shaped by American hegemony and
within which “the threat of war is off the table,” is likely to be
restricted to those parts of the world where American power has been
reinforced by democratic sociopolitical systems and by elaborate
external multilateral—but also American-dominated—frameworks.</p>
<p>An American geostrategy for Eurasia will thus be competing with the
forces of turbulence. In Europe, there are signs that the momentum for
integration and enlargement is waning and that traditional European
nationalisms may reawaken before long. Large-scale unemployment persists
even in the most successful European states, breeding xenophobic
reactions that could suddenly cause a lurch in French or German politics
toward significant political extremism and inward-oriented chauvinism.
Indeed, a genuinely prerevolutionary situation could even be in the
making. The historical timetable for Europe, outlined in chapter 3, will
be met only if Europe’s aspirations for unity are both encouraged and
even prodded by the United States.</p>
<p>The uncertainties regarding Russia’s future are even greater and the
prospects for a positive evolution much more tenuous. It is therefore
imperative for America to shape a geopolitical context that is congenial
to Russia’s assimilation into a larger setting of growing European
cooperation and that also fosters the self-reliant independence of its
newly sovereign neighbors. Yet the viability of, say, Ukraine or
Uzbekistan (not to speak of the ethnically bifurcated Kazakstan) will
remain uncertain, especially if American attention becomes diverted by
new internal crises in Europe, by a growing gap between Turkey and
Europe, or by intensifying hostility in American-Iranian relations.</p>
<p>The potential for an eventual grand accommodation with China could
also be aborted by a future crisis over Taiwan; or because internal
Chinese political dynamics prompt the emergence of an aggressive and
hostile regime; or simply because American-Chinese relations turn sour.
China could then become a highly destabilizing force in the world,
imposing enormous strains on the American-Japanese relationship and
perhaps also generating a disruptive geopolitical disorientation in
Japan itself. In that setting, the stability of Southeast Asia would
certainly be at risk, and one can only speculate how the confluence of
these events would impact on the posture and cohesion of India, a
country critical to the stability of South Asia.</p>
<p>These observations serve as a reminder that neither the new global
problems that go beyond the scope of the nation-state nor more
traditional geopolitical concerns are likely to be resolved, or even
contained, if the underlying geopolitical structure of global power
begins to crumble. With warning signs on the horizon across Europe and
Asia, any successful American policy must focus on Eurasia as a whole
and be guided by a geostrategic design.</p>
