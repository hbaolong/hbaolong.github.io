<h4 id="europes-historic-timetable">EUROPE’S HISTORIC TIMETABLE</h4>
<p>Although at this stage the ultimate eastern limits of Europe can
neither be defined firmly nor finally fixed, in the broadest sense
Europe is a common civilization, derived from the shared Christian
tradition. Europe’s narrower Western definition has been associated with
Rome and its historical legacy. But Europe’s Christian tradition has
involved also Byzantium and its Russian Orthodox emanation. Thus,
culturally, Europe is more than the Petrine Europe, and the Petrine
Europe in turn is much more than Western Europe—even though in recent
years the latter has usurped the identity of “Europe.” Even a mere
glance at the map on page 82 confirms that the existing Europe is simply
not a complete Europe. Worse than that, it is a Europe in which a zone
of insecurity between Europe and Russia can have a suction effect on
both, inevitably causing tensions and rivalry.</p>
<p>A Charlemagne Europe (limited to Western Europe) by necessity made
sense during the Cold War, but such a Europe is now an anomaly. This is
so because in addition to being a civilization, the emerging united
Europe is also a way of life, a standard of living, and a polity of
shared democratic procedures, not burdened by ethnic and territorial
conflicts. That Europe in its formally organized scope is currently much
less than its actual potential. Several of the more advanced and
politically stable Central European states, all part of the Western
Petrine tradition, notably the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and
perhaps also Slovenia, are clearly qualified and eager for membership in
“Europe” and its transatlantic security connection.</p>
<p>In the current circumstances, the expansion of NATO to include
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary—probably by 1999—appears to be
likely. After this initial but significant step, it is likely that any
subsequent expansion of the alliance will either be coincidental with or
will follow the expansion of the EU. The latter involves a much more
complicated process, both in the number of qualifying stages and in the
meeting of membership requirements (see chart on page 83). Thus, even
the first admissions into the EU from Central Europe are not likely
before the year 2002 or perhaps somewhat later. Nonetheless, after the
first three new NATO members have also joined the EU, both the EU and
NATO will have to address the question of extending membership to the
Baltic republics, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, and perhaps
also, eventually, to Ukraine.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the prospect of eventual membership is already
exercising a constructive influence on the affairs and conduct of
would-be members. Knowledge that neither the EU nor NATO wishes to be
burdened by additional conflicts pertaining either to minority rights or
to territorial claims among their members (Turkey versus Greece is more
than enough) has already given Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania the needed
incentive to reach accommodations that meet the standards set by the
Council of Europe. Much the same is true for the more general principle
that only democracies can qualify for membership. The desire not to be
left out is having an important reinforcing impact on the new
democracies.</p>
<p>EU Membership: Application to Accession</p>
<p>In any case, it ought to be axiomatic that Europe’s political unity
and security are indivisible. As a practical matter, in fact it is
difficult to conceive of a truly united Europe without a common security
arrangement with America. It follows, therefore, that states that are in
a position to begin and are invited to undertake accession talks with
the EU should automatically also be viewed henceforth as subject in
effect to NATO’s presumptive protection.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the process of widening Europe and enlarging the
transatlantic security system is likely to move forward by deliberate
stages. Assuming sustained American and Western European commitment, a
speculative but cautiously realistic timetable for these stages might be
the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>By 1999, the first new Central European members will have been
admitted into NATO, though their entry into the EU will probably not
happen before 2002 or 2003.</p></li>
<li><p>In the meantime, the EU will initiate accession talks with the
Baltic republics, and NATO will likewise begin to move forward on the
issue of their membership as well as Romania’s, with their accession
likely to be completed by 2005. At some point in this stage, the other
Balkan states may likewise become eligible.</p></li>
<li><p>Accession by the Baltic states might prompt Sweden and Finland
also to consider NATO membership.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere between 2005 and 2010, Ukraine, especially if in the
meantime the country has made significant progress in its domestic
reforms and has succeeded in becoming more evidently identified as a
Central European country, should become ready for serious negotiations
with both the EU and NATO.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, it is likely that Franco-German-Polish collaboration
within the EU and NATO will have deepened considerably, especially in
the area of defense. That collaboration could become the Western core of
any wider European security arrangements that might eventually embrace
both Russia and Ukraine. Given the special geopolitical interest of
Germany and Poland in Ukraine’s independence, it is also quite possible
that Ukraine will gradually be drawn into the special
Franco-German-Polish relationship. By the year 2010,
Franco-German-Polish-Ukrainian political collaboration, engaging some
230 million people, could evolve into a partnership enhancing Europe’s
geostrategic depth (see map above).</p>
<p>Whether the above scenario emerges in a benign fashion or in the
context of intensifying tensions with Russia is of great importance.
Russia should be continuously reassured that the doors to Europe are
open, as are the doors to its eventual participation in an expanded
transatlantic system of security and, perhaps at some future point, in a
new trans-Eurasian system of security. To give credence to these
assurances, various cooperative links between Russia and Europe—in all
fields—should be very deliberately promoted. (Russia’s relationship to
Europe, and the role of Ukraine in that regard, are discussed more fully
in the next chapter.)</p>
<p>If Europe succeeds both in unifying and in expanding and if Russia in
the meantime undertakes successful democratic consolidation and social
modernization, at some point Russia can also become eligible for a more
organic relationship with Europe. That, in turn, would make possible the
eventual merger of the transatlantic security system with a
transcontinental Eurasian one. However, as a practical reality, the
question of Russia’s formal membership will not arise for quite some
time to come—and that, if anything, is yet another reason for not
pointlessly shutting the doors to it.</p>
<p>To conclude: with the Europe of Yalta gone, it is essential that
there be no reversion to the Europe of Versailles. The end of the
division of Europe should not precipitate a step back to a Europe of
quarrelsome nation-states but should be the point of departure for
shaping a larger and increasingly integrated Europe, reinforced by a
widened NATO and rendered even more secure by a constructive security
relationship with Russia. Hence, America’s central geostrategic goal in
Europe can be summed up quite simply: it is to consolidate through a
more genuine transatlantic partnership the U.S. bridgehead on the
Eurasian continent so that an enlarging Europe can become a more viable
springboard for projecting into Eurasia the international democratic and
cooperative order.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4</p>
<p>The Black Hole</p>
<p>THE DISINTEGRATION LATE IN 1991 of the world’s territorially largest
state created a “black hole” in the very center of Eurasia. It was as if
the geopoliticians’ “heartland” had been suddenly yanked from the global
map.</p>
<p>For America, this new and perplexing geopolitical situation poses a
crucial challenge. Understandably, the immediate task has to be to
reduce the probability of political anarchy or a reversion to a hostile
dictatorship in a crumbling state still possessing a powerful nuclear
arsenal. But the long-range task remains: how to encourage Russia’s
democratic transformation and economic recovery while avoiding the
reemergence of a Eurasian empire that could obstruct the American
geostrategic goal of shaping a larger Euro-Atlantic system to which
Russia can then be stably and safely related.</p>
