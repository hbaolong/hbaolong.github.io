<h4 id="the-multiple-contest">THE MULTIPLE CONTEST</h4>
<p>The traditional Balkans of Europe involved head-on competition among
three imperial rivals: the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
and the Russian Empire. There were also three indirect participants who
were concerned that their European interests would be adversely affected
by the victory of a particular protagonist: Germany feared Russian
power, France opposed Austria-Hungary, and Great Britain preferred to
see a weakening Ottoman Empire in control of the Dardanelles than the
emergence of any one of the other major contestants in control of the
Balkans. In the course of the nineteenth century, these powers managed
to contain Balkan conflicts without prejudice to anyone’s vital
interests, but they failed to do so in 1914, with disastrous
consequences for all.</p>
<p>Today’s competition within the Eurasian Balkans also directly
involves three neighboring powers: Russia, Turkey, and Iran, though
China may eventually become a major protagonist as well. Also involved
in the competition, but more remotely, are Ukraine, Pakistan, India, and
the distant America. Each of the three principal and most directly
engaged contestants is driven not only by the prospect of future
geopolitical and economic benefits but also by strong historical
impulses. Each was at one time or another either the politically or the
culturally dominant power in the region. Each views the others with
suspicion. Although head-on warfare among them is unlikely, the
cumulative impact of their external rivalry could contribute to regional
chaos.</p>
<p>In the case of the Russians, the attitude of hostility to the Turks
verges on the obsessive. The Russian media portrays the Turks as bent on
control over the region, as instigators of local resistance to Russia
(with some justification in the case of Chechnya), and as threatening
Russia’s overall security to a degree that is altogether out of
proportion to Turkey’s actual capabilities. The Turks reciprocate in
kind and view their role as that of liberators of their brethren from
prolonged Russian oppression. The Turks and the Iranians (Persians) have
also been historical rivals in the region, and that rivalry has in
recent years been revived, with Turkey projecting the image of a modern
and secular alternative to the Iranian concept of an Islamic
society.</p>
<p>Although each of the three can be said to seek at least a sphere of
influence, in the case of Russia, Moscow’s ambitions have a much broader
sweep because of the relatively fresh memories of imperial control, the
presence in the area of several million Russians, and the Kremlin’s
desire to reinstate Russia as a major global power. Moscow’s foreign
policy statements have made it plain that it views the entire space of
the former Soviet Union as a zone of the Kremlin’s special geostrategic
interest, from which outside political—and even economic—influence
should be excluded.</p>
<p>In contrast, although Turkish aspirations for regional influence
retain some vestiges of an imperial, albeit more dated, past (the
Ottoman Empire reached its apogee in 1590 with the conquest of the
Caucasus and Azerbaijan, though it did not include Central Asia), they
tend to be more rooted in an ethnic-linguistic sense of identity with
the Turkic peoples of the area (see map on page 137). Given Turkey’s
much more limited political and military power, a sphere of exclusive
political influence is simply unattainable. Rather, Turkey sees itself
as potential leader of a loose Turkic-speaking community, taking
advantage to that end of its appealing relative modernity, its
linguistic affinity, and its economic means to establish itself as the
most influential force in the nation-building processes underway in the
area.</p>
<p>Iran’s aspirations are vaguer still, but in the long run no less
threatening to Russia’s ambitions. The Persian Empire is a much more
distant memory. At its peak, circa 500 B.C., it embraced the current
territory of the three Caucasian states, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and
Tajikistan, and Afghanistan, as well as Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon,
and Israel. Although Iran’s current geopolitical aspirations are
narrower than Turkey’s, pointing mainly at Azerbaijan and Afghanistan,
the entire Muslim population in the area—even within Russia itself—is
the object of Iranian religious interest. Indeed, the revival of Islam
in Central Asia has become an organic part of the aspirations of Iran’s
current rulers.</p>
<p>The competitive interests of Russia, Turkey, and Iran are represented
on the map on page 138: in the case of the geopolitical thrust of
Russia, by two arrows pointing directly south at Azerbaijan and
Kazakstan; in Turkey’s case, by a single arrow pointing eastward through
Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea at Central Asia; and in Iran’s case, by
two arrows aiming northward at Azerbaijan and northeast at Turkmenistan,
Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. These arrows not only crisscross; they can
collide.</p>
<p>At this stage, China’s role is more limited and its goals less
evident. It stands to reason that China prefers to face a collection of
relatively independent states in the West rather than a Russian Empire.
At a minimum, the new states serve as a buffer, but China is also
anxious that its own Turkic minorities in Xinjiang Province might see in
the newly independent Central Asian states an attractive example for
themselves, and for that reason, China has sought assurances from
Kazakstan that cross-border minority activism will be suppressed. In the
long run, the energy resources of the region are bound to be of special
interest to Beijing, and direct access to them, not subject to Moscow’s
control, has to be China’s central goal. Thus, the overall geopolitical
interest of China tends to clash with Russia’s quest for a dominant role
and is complementary to Turkish and Iranian aspirations.</p>
<p>For Ukraine, the central issues are the future character of the CIS
and freer access to energy sources, which would lessen Ukraine’s
dependence on Russia. In that regard, closer relations with Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have become important to Kiev, with
Ukrainian support for the more independent-minded states being an
extension of Ukraine’s efforts to enhance its own independence from
Moscow. Accordingly, Ukraine has supported Georgia’s efforts to become
the westward route for Azeri oil exports. Ukraine has also collaborated
with Turkey in order to weaken Russian influence in the Black Sea and
has supported Turkish efforts to direct oil flows from Central Asia to
Turkish terminals.</p>
<p>The involvement of Pakistan and India is more remote still, but
neither is indifferent to what may be transpiring in these new Eurasian
Balkans. For Pakistan, the primary interest is to gain geostrategic
depth through political influence in Afghanistan—and to deny to Iran the
exercise of such influence in Afghanistan and Tajikistan—and to benefit
eventually from any pipeline construction linking Central Asia with the
Arabian Sea. India, in reaction to Pakistan and possibly concerned about
China’s long-range influence in the region, views Iranian influence in
Afghanistan and a greater Russian presence in the former Soviet space
more favorably.</p>
<p>Although distant, the United States, with its stake in the
maintenance of geopolitical pluralism in post-Soviet Eurasia, looms in
the background as an increasingly important if indirect player, clearly
interested not only in developing the region’s resources but also in
preventing Russia from exclusively dominating the region’s geopolitical
space. In so doing, America is not only pursuing its larger Eurasian
geostrategic goals but is also representing its own growing economic
interest, as well as that of Europe and the Far East, in gaining
unlimited access to this hitherto closed area.</p>
<p>Thus, at stake in this conundrum are geopolitical power, access to
potentially great wealth, the fulfillment of national and/or religious
missions, and security. The particular focus of the contest, however, is
on access. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, access to the region
was monopolized by Moscow. All rail transport, gas and oil pipelines,
and even air travel were channeled through the center. Russian
geopoliticians would prefer it to remain so, since they know that
whoever either controls or dominates access to the region is the one
most likely to win the geopolitical and economic prize.</p>
<p>It is this consideration that has made the pipeline issue so central
to the future of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia. If the main
pipelines to the region continue to pass through Russian territory to
the Russian outlet on the Black Sea at Novorossiysk, the political
consequences of this condition will make themselves felt, even without
any overt Russian power plays. The region will remain a political
dependency, with Moscow in a strong position to determine how the
region’s new wealth is to be shared. Conversely, if another pipeline
crosses the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan and thence to the Mediterranean
through Turkey and if one more goes to the Arabian Sea through
Afghanistan, no single power will have monopoly over access.</p>
<p>The troubling fact is that some elements in the Russian political
elite act as if they prefer that the area’s resources not be developed
at all if Russia cannot have complete control over access. Let the
wealth remain unexploited if the alternative is that foreign investment
will lead to more direct presence by foreign economic, and thus also
political, interests. That proprietary attitude is rooted in history,
and it will take time and outside pressures before it changes.</p>
<p>The Tsarist expansion into the Caucasus and Central Asia occurred
over a period of about three hundred years, but its recent end was
shockingly abrupt. As the Ottoman Empire declined in vitality, the
Russian Empire pushed southward, along the shores of the Caspian Sea
toward Persia. It seized the Astrakhan khanate in 1556 and reached
Persia by 1607. It conquered Crimea during 1774–1784, then took over the
kingdom of Georgia in 1801 and overwhelmed the tribes astride the
Caucasian mountain range (with the Chechens resisting with unique
tenacity) during the second half of the 1800s, completing the takeover
of Armenia by 1878.</p>
<p>The conquest of Central Asia was less a matter of overcoming a rival
empire than of subjugating essentially isolated and quasi-tribal feudal
khanates and emirates, capable of offering only sporadic and isolated
resistance. Uzbekistan and Kazakstan were taken over through a series of
military expeditions during the years 1801–1881, with Turkmenistan
crushed and incorporated in campaigns lasting from 1873 to 1886.
However, by 1850, the conquest of most of Central Asia was essentially
completed, though periodic outbreaks of local resistance occurred even
during the Soviet era.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union produced a dramatic historical
reversal. In the course of merely a few weeks in December 1991, Russia’s
Asian space suddenly shrank by about 20 percent, and the population
Russia controlled in Asia was cut from 75 million to about 30 million.
In addition, another 18 million residents in the Caucasus were also
detached from Russia. Making these reversals even more painful to the
Russian political elite was the awareness that the economic potential of
these areas was now being targeted by foreign interests with the
financial means to invest in, develop, and exploit resources that until
very recently were accessible to Russia alone.</p>
<p>Yet Russia faces a dilemma: it is too weak politically to seal off
the region entirely from the outside and too poor financially to develop
the area exclusively on its own. Moreover, sensible Russian leaders
realize that the demographic explosion underway in the new states means
that their failure to sustain economic growth will eventually create an
explosive situation along Russia’s entire southern frontier. Russia’s
experience in Afghanistan and Chechnya could be repeated along the
entire borderline that stretches from the Black Sea to Mongolia,
especially given the national and Islamic resurgence now underway among
the previously subjugated peoples.</p>
<p>It follows that Russia must somehow find a way of accommodating to
the new postimperial reality, as it seeks to contain the Turkish and
Iranian presence, to prevent the gravitation of the new states toward
its principal rivals, to discourage the formation of any truly
independent Central Asian regional cooperation, and to limit American
geopolitical influence in the newly sovereign capitals. The issue thus
is no longer that of imperial restoration—which would be too costly and
would be fiercely resisted—but instead involves creating a new web of
relations that would constrain the new states and preserve Russia’s
dominant geopolitical and economic position.</p>
<p>The chosen instrument for accomplishing that task has primarily been
the CIS, though in some places the use of the Russian military and the
skillful employment of Russian diplomacy to “divide and rule” has served
the Kremlin’s interests just as well. Moscow has used its leverage to
seek from the new states the maximum degree of compliance to its vision
of an increasingly integrated “commonwealth” and has pressed for a
centrally directed system of control over the external borders of the
CIS; for closer military integration, within the framework of a common
foreign policy; and for the further expansion of the existing
(originally Soviet) pipeline network, to the exclusion of any new ones
that could skirt Russia. Russian strategic analyses have explicitly
stated that Moscow views the area as its own special geopolitical space,
even if it is no longer an integral part of its empire.</p>
<p>A clue to Russian geopolitical intentions is provided by the
insistence with which the Kremlin has sought to retain a Russian
military presence on the territories of the new states. Taking advantage
of the Abkhazian secession movement, Moscow obtained basing rights in
Georgia, legitimated its military presence on Armenian soil by
exploiting Armenia’s need for support in the war against Azerbaijan, and
applied political and financial pressure to obtain Kazakstan’s agreement
to Russian bases; in addition, the civil war in Tajikistan made possible
the continued presence there of the former Soviet army.</p>
<p>In defining its policy, Moscow has proceeded on the apparent
expectation that its postimperial web of relationships with Central Asia
will gradually emasculate the substance of the sovereignty of the
individually weak new states and that it will place them in a
subordinate relationship to the command center of the “integrated” CIS.
To accomplish that goal, Russia is discouraging the new states from
creating their own separate armies, from fostering the use of their
distinctive languages (in which they are gradually replacing the
Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin), from cultivating close ties with
outsiders, and from developing new pipelines directly to outlets in the
Arabian or Mediterranean Seas. If the policy succeeds, Russia could then
dominate their foreign relations and determine revenue sharing.</p>
<p>In pursuing that goal, Russian spokesmen often invoke, as we have
seen in chapter 4, the example of the European Union. In fact, however,
Russia’s policy toward the Central Asian states and the Caucasus is much
more reminiscent of the Francophone African community—with the French
military contingents and budgetary subsidies determining the politics
and policies of the French-speaking postcolonial African states.</p>
<p>While the restoration of the maximum feasible degree of Russian
political and economic influence in the region is the overall goal and
the reinforcement of the CIS is the principal mechanism for achieving
it, Moscow’s primary geopolitical targets for political subordination
appear to be Azerbaijan and Kazakstan. For a Russian political
counteroffensive to be successful, Moscow must not only cork access to
the region but must also penetrate its geographic shield.</p>
<p>For Russia, Azerbaijan has to be a priority target. Its subordination
would help to seal off Central Asia from the West, especially from
Turkey, thereby further increasing Russia’s leverage vis-à-vis the
recalcitrant Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. To that end, tactical
cooperation with Iran regarding such controversial issues as how to
divide the drilling concessions to the Caspian seabed serves the
important objective of compelling Baku to accommodate itself to Moscow’s
wishes. A subservient Azerbaijan would also facilitate the consolidation
of a dominant Russian position in both Georgia and Armenia.</p>
<p>Kazakstan offers an especially tempting primary target as well,
because its ethnic vulnerability makes it impossible for the Kazak
government to prevail in an open confrontation with Moscow. Moscow can
also exploit the Kazak fear of China’s growing dynamism, as well as the
likelihood of growing Kazak resentment over the Sinification of the
adjoining Xinjiang Province in China. Kazakstan’s gradual subordination
would have the geopolitical effect of almost automatically drawing
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into Moscow’s sphere of control, while
exposing both Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to more direct Russian
pressure.</p>
<p>The Russian strategy, however, runs counter to the aspirations of
almost all of the states located in the Eurasian Balkans. Their new
political elites will not voluntarily yield the power and privilege they
have gained through independence. As the local Russians gradually vacate
their previously privileged positions, the new elites are rapidly
developing a vested interest in sovereignty, a dynamic and socially
contagious process. Moreover, the once politically passive populations
are also becoming more nationalistic and, outside of Georgia and
Armenia, also more conscious of their Islamic identity.</p>
<p>Insofar as foreign affairs are concerned, both Georgia and Armenia
(despite the latter’s dependence on Russian support against Azerbaijan)
would like to become gradually more associated with Europe. The
resource-rich Central Asian states, along with Azerbaijan, would like to
maximize the economic presence on their soil of American, European,
Japanese, and lately Korean capital, hoping thereby to greatly
accelerate their own economic development and consolidate their
independence. To this end, they also welcome the increasing role of
Turkey and Iran, seeing in them a counterweight to Russian power and a
bridge to the large Muslim world to the south.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan—encouraged by both Turkey and America—has thus not only
rejected Russian demands for military bases but it also defied Russian
demands for a single pipeline to a Russian Black Sea port, opting
instead for a dual solution involving a second pipeline through Georgia
to Turkey. (A pipeline southward through Iran, to be financed by an
American company, had to be abandoned because of the U.S. financial
embargo on deals with Iran.) In 1995, amid much fanfare, a new rail link
between Turkmenistan and Iran was opened, making it feasible for Europe
to trade with Central Asia by rail, skirting Russia altogether. There
was a touch of symbolic drama to this reopening of the ancient Silk
Route, with Russia thus no longer able to separate Europe from Asia.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan has also become increasingly assertive in its opposition
to Russia’s efforts at “integration.” Its foreign minister declared
flatly in August 1996 that “Uzbekistan opposes the creation of CIS
supranational institutions which can be used as instruments of
centralized control.” Its strongly nationalistic posture had already
prompted sharp denunciations in the Russian press concerning
Uzbekistan’s</p>
<p>emphatically pro-West orientation in the economy, the harsh invective
apropos integration treaties within the CIS, the decisive refusal to
join even the Customs Union, and a methodical anti-Russian nationality
policy (even kindergartens which use Russian are being closed down)….
For the United States, which is pursuing in the Asia region a policy of
the weakening of Russia, this position is so attractive.20</p>
<p>Even Kazakstan, in reaction to Russian pressures, has come to favor a
secondary non-Russian route for its own outflows. As Umirserik Kasenov,
the adviser to the Kazak president, put it:</p>
<p>It is a fact that Kazakstan’s search for alternative pipelines has
been fostered by Russia’s own actions, such as the limitation of
shipments of Kazakstan’s oil to Novorossiysk and of Tyumen oil to the
Pavlodar Refinery. Turkmenistan’s efforts to promote the construction of
a gas line to Iran are partly due to the fact that the CIS countries pay
only 60 percent of the world price or do not pay for it at all.2</p>
<p>Turkmenistan, for much the same reason, has been actively exploring
the construction of a new pipeline through Afghanistan and Pakistan to
the Arabian Sea, in addition to the energetic construction of new rail
links with Kazakstan and Uzbekistan to the north and with Iran and
Afghanistan to the south. Very preliminary and exploratory talks have
also been held among the Kazaks, the Chinese, and the Japanese regarding
an ambitious pipeline project that would stretch from Central Asia to
the China Sea (see map on page 146). With long-term Western oil and gas
investment commitments in Azerbaijan reaching some 3 billion and in
Kazakstan going well over 0 billion (1996 figures), the economic and
political isolation of this area is clearly breaking down in the face of
global economic pressures and limited Russian financial options.</p>
<p>Fear of Russia has also had the effect of driving the Central Asian
states into greater regional cooperation. The initially dormant Central
Asian Economic Union, formed in January 1993, has been gradually
activated. Even President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, at first an
articulate advocate of a new “Eurasian Union,” gradually became a
convert to ideas of closer Central Asian cooperation, increased military
collaboration among the region’s states, support for Azerbaijan’s
efforts to channel Caspian Sea and Kazak oil through Turkey, and joint
opposition to Russian and Iranian efforts to prevent the sectoral
division of the Caspian Sea’s continental shelf and mineral resources
among the coastal states.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the governments in the area tend to be highly
authoritarian, perhaps even more important has been the personal
reconciliation among the principal leaders. It was common knowledge that
the presidents of Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan were not
particularly fond of one another (which they made eminently plain to
foreign visitors), and that personal antagonism initially made it easier
for the Kremlin to play off one against the other. By the mid-1990s, the
three had come to realize that closer cooperation among them was
essential to the preservation of their new sovereignty, and they began
to engage in highly publicized displays of their allegedly close
relations, stressing that henceforth they would coordinate their foreign
policies.</p>
<p>But more important still has been the emergence within the CIS of an
informal coalition, led by Ukraine and Uzbekistan, dedicated to the idea
of a “cooperative,” but not “integrated,” commonwealth. Toward this end,
Ukraine has signed agreements on military cooperation with Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, and Georgia; and in September 1996, the foreign ministers
of Ukraine and Uzbekistan even engaged in the highly symbolic act of
issuing a declaration, demanding that henceforth CIS summits not be
chaired by Russia’s president but that the chairmanship be rotated.</p>
<p>The example set by Ukraine and Uzbekistan has had an impact even on
the leaders who have been more deferential to Moscow’s central concerns.
The Kremlin must have been especially disturbed to hear Kazakstan’s
Nursultan Nazarbayev and Georgia’s Eduard Shevardnadze declare in
September 1996 that they would leave the CIS “if our independence is
threatened.” More generally, as a counter to the CIS, the Central Asian
states and Azerbaijan stepped up their level of activity in the
Organization of Economic Cooperation, a still relatively loose
association of the region’s Islamic states—including Turkey, Iran, and
Pakistan—dedicated to the enhancement of financial, economic, and
transportation links among its members. Moscow has been publicly
critical of these initiatives, viewing them, quite correctly, as
diluting the pertinent states’ membership in the CIS.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, there has been steady enhancement of ties with
Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Iran. The Turkic-speaking countries have
eagerly accepted Turkey’s offers of military training for the new
national officer corps and the laying down of the Turkish welcome mat
for some ten thousand students. The fourth summit meeting of the
Turkic-speaking countries, held in Tashkent in October 1996 and prepared
with Turkish backing, focused heavily on the enhancement of
transportation links, on increased trade, and also on common educational
standards as well as closer cultural cooperation with Turkey. Both
Turkey and Iran have been particularly active in assisting the new
states with their television programming, thereby directly influencing
large audiences.</p>
<p>A ceremony in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakstan, in December 1996
was particularly symbolic of Turkey’s identification with the
independence of the region’s states. On the occasion of the fifth
anniversary of Kazakstan’s independence, the Turkish president, Suleyman
Demirel, stood at the side of President Nazarbayev at the unveiling of a
gold-colored column twenty-eight meters high, crowned with a legendary
Kazak/Turkic warrior’s figure atop a griffinlike creature. At the event,
Kazakstan hailed Turkey for “standing by Kazakstan at every step of its
development as an independent state,” and the Turks reciprocated by
