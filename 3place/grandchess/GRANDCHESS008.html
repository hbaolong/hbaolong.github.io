<h4 id="americas-central-objective">AMERICA’S CENTRAL OBJECTIVE</h4>
<p>The central issue for America is how to construct a Europe that is
based on the Franco-German connection, a Europe that is viable, that
remains linked to the United States, and that widens the scope of the
cooperative democratic international system on which the effective
exercise of American global primacy so much depends. Hence, it is not a
matter of making a choice between France and Germany. Without either
France or Germany, there will be no Europe.</p>
<p>Three broad conclusions emerge from the foregoing discussion:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>American engagement in the cause of European unification is
needed to compensate for the internal crisis of morale and purpose that
has been sapping European vitality, to overcome the widespread European
suspicion that ultimately America does not favor genuine European unity,
and to infuse into the European undertaking the needed dose of
democratic fervor. That requires a clear-cut American commitment to the
eventual acceptance of Europe as America’s global partner.</p></li>
<li><p>In the short run, tactical opposition to French policy and
support for German leadership is justified; in the longer run, European
unity will have to involve a more distinctive European political and
military identity if a genuine Europe is actually to become reality.
That requires some progressive accommodation to the French view
regarding the distribution of power within transatlantic
institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither France nor Germany is sufficiently strong to construct
Europe on its own or to resolve with Russia the ambiguities inherent in
the definition of Europe’s geographic scope. That requires energetic,
focused, and determined American involvement, particularly with the
Germans, in defining Europe’s scope and hence also in coping with such
sensitive—especially to Russia—issues as the eventual status within the
European system of the Baltic republics and Ukraine.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Just one glance at the map of the vast Eurasian landmass underlines
the geopolitical significance to America of the European bridgehead—as
well as its geographic modesty. The preservation of that bridgehead and
its expansion as the springboard for democracy are directly relevant to
America’s security. The existing gap between America’s global concern
for stability and for the related dissemination of democracy and
Europe’s seeming indifference to these issues (despite France’s
self-proclaimed status as a global power) needs to be closed, and it can
only be narrowed if Europe increasingly assumes a more confederated
character. Europe cannot become a single nation-state, because of the
tenacity of its diverse national traditions, but it can become an entity
that through common political institutions cumulatively reflects shared
democratic values, identifies its own interests with their
universal-ization, and exercises a magnetic attraction on its
co-inhabitants of the Eurasian space.</p>
<p>Left to themselves, the Europeans run the risk of becoming absorbed
by their internal social concerns. Europe’s economic recovery has
obscured the longer-run costs of its seeming success. These costs are
damaging economically as well as politically. The crisis of political
legitimacy and economic vitality that Western Europe increasingly
confronts—but is unable to overcome—is deeply rooted in the pervasive
expansion of the state-sponsored social structure that favors
paternalism, protectionism, and parochialism. The result is a cultural
condition that combines escapist hedonism with spiritual emptiness—a
condition that can be exploited by nationalist extremists or dogmatic
ideologues.</p>
<p>This condition, if it becomes rampant, could prove deadly to
democracy and the idea of Europe. The two, in fact, are linked, for the
new problems of Europe—be they immigration or economic-technological
competitiveness with America or Asia, not to speak of the need for a
politically stable reform of existing socioeconomic structures—can only
be dealt with effectively in an increasingly continental context. A
Europe that is larger than the sum of its parts—that is, a Europe that
sees a global role for itself in the promotion of democracy and in the
wider proselytization of basic human values—is more likely to be a
Europe that is firmly uncongenial to political extremism, narrow
nationalism, or social hedonism.</p>
<p>One need neither evoke the old fears of a separate German-Russian
accommodation nor exaggerate the consequences of French tactical
flirtation with Moscow to entertain concern for the geopolitical
stability of Europe—and for America’s place in it—resulting from a
failure of Europe’s still ongoing efforts to unite. Any such failure
would in fact probably entail some renewed and rather traditional
European maneuvers. It would certainly generate opportunities for either
Russian or German geopolitical self-assertion, though if Europe’s modern
history contains any lesson, neither would be likely to gain an enduring
success in that regard. However, at the very least, Germany would
probably become more assertive and explicit in the definition of its
national interests.</p>
<p>Currently, Germany’s interests are congruent with, and even
sublimated within, those of the EU and of NATO. Even the spokesmen for
the leftist Alliance 90/Greens have advocated the expansion of both NATO
and the EU. But if the unification and enlargement of Europe should
stall, there is some reason to assume that a more nationalist definition
of Germany’s concept of the European “order” would then surface, to the
potential detriment of European stability. Wolfgang Schauble, the leader
of the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag and a possible successor to
Chancellor Kohl, expressed that mindset when he stated that Germany is
no longer “the western bulwark against the East; we have become the
center of Europe,” pointedly adding that in “the long periods during the
Middle Ages . . . Germany was involved in creating order in Europe.”9 In
this vision, Mitteleuropa—instead of being a European region in which
Germany economically preponderates—would become an area of overt German
political primacy as well as the basis for a more unilateral German
policy vis-à-vis the East and the West.</p>
<p>Europe would then cease to be the Eurasian bridgehead for American
power and the potential springboard for the democratic global system’s
expansion into Eurasia. This is why unambiguous and tangible American
support for Europe’s unification must be sustained. Although both during
Europe’s economic recovery and within the transatlantic security
alliance America has frequently proclaimed its support for European
unification and supported transnational cooperation in Europe, it has
also acted as if it preferred to deal on troubling economic and
political issues with individual European states and not with the
European Union as such. Occasional American insistence on a voice within
the European decision-making process has tended to reinforce European
suspicions that America favors cooperation among the Europeans when they
follow the American lead but not when they formulate Europe’s policies.
This is the wrong message to convey.</p>
<p>American commitment to Europe’s unity—reiterated forcefully in the
joint American-European Madrid Declaration of December 1995—will
continue to ring hollow until America is ready not only to declare
unambiguously that it is prepared to accept the consequences of Europe
becoming truly Europe but to act accordingly. For Europe, the ultimate
consequence would entail a true partnership with America rather than the
status of a favored but still junior ally. And a true partnership does
mean sharing in decisions as well as responsibilities. American support
for that cause would help to invigorate the transatlantic dialogue and
would stimulate among the Europeans a more serious concentration on the
role that a truly significant Europe might play in the world.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that at some point a truly united and powerful
European Union could become a global political rival to the United
States. It could certainly become a difficult economic-technological
competitor, while its geopolitical interests in the Middle East and
elsewhere could significantly diverge from those of America. But, in
fact, such a powerful and politically single-minded Europe is not likely
in the foreseeable future. Unlike the conditions prevailing in America
at the time of the formation of the United States, there are deep
historical roots to the resiliency of the European nation-states and the
passion for a transnational Europe has clearly waned.</p>
<p>The real alternatives for the next decade or two are either an
expanding and unifying Europe, pursuing—though hesitantly and
spasmodically—the goal of continental unity; a stalemated Europe, not
moving much beyond its current state of integration and geographic
scope, with Central Europe remaining a geopolitical no-man’s-land; or,
as a likely sequel to the stalemate, a progressively fragmenting Europe,
resuming its old power rivalries. In a stalemated Europe, it is almost
inevitable that Germany’s self-identification with Europe will wane,
prompting a more nationalist definition of the German state interest.
For America, the first option is clearly the best, but it is an option
that requires energizing American support if it is to come to pass.</p>
<p>At this stage of Europe’s hesitant construction, America need not get
directly involved in intricate debates regarding such issues as whether
the EU should make its foreign policy decisions by majority vote (a
position favored especially by the Germans); whether the European
Parliament should assume decisive legislative powers and the European
Commission in Brussels should become in effect the European executive;
whether the timetable for implementing the agreement on European
economic and monetary union should be relaxed; or, finally, whether
Europe should be a broad confederation or a multilayered entity, with a
federated inner core and a somewhat looser outer rim. These are matters
for the Europeans to thrash out among themselves—and it is more than
likely that progress on all of these issues will be uneven, punctuated
by pauses, and eventually pushed forward only by complex
compromises.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the Economic and
Monetary Union will come into being by the year 2000, perhaps initially
among six to ten of the EU’s current fifteen members. This will
accelerate Europe’s economic integration beyond the monetary dimension,
further encouraging its political integration. Thus, by fits and starts
and with an inner more integrated core as well as a looser outer layer,
a single Europe will increasingly become an important political player
on the Eurasian chessboard.</p>
<p>In any case, America should not convey the impression that it prefers
a vaguer, even if broader, European association, but it should
reiterate, through words and deeds, its willingness to deal eventually
with the EU as America’s global political and security partner and not
just as a regional common market made up of states allied with the
United States through NATO. To make that commitment more credible and
thus go beyond the rhetoric of partnership, joint planning with the EU
regarding new bilateral transatlantic decision-making mechanisms could
be proposed and initiated.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to NATO as such. Its preservation is vital
to the transatlantic connection. On this issue, there is overwhelming
American-European consensus. Without NATO, Europe not only would become
vulnerable but almost immediately would become politically fragmented as
well. NATO ensures European security and provides a stable framework for
the pursuit of European unity. That is what makes NATO historically so
vital to Europe.</p>
<p>However, as Europe gradually and hesitantly unifies, the internal
structure and processes of NATO will have to adjust. On this issue, the
French have a point. One cannot someday have a truly united Europe and
yet have an alliance that remains integrated on the basis of one
superpower plus fifteen dependent powers. Once Europe begins to assume a
genuine political identity of its own, with the EU increasingly taking
on some of the functions of a supranational government, NATO will have
to be altered on the basis of a 1 + 1 (US + EU) formula.</p>
<p>This will not happen overnight and all at once. Progress in that
direction, to repeat, will be hesitant. But such progress will have to
be reflected in the existing alliance arrangements, lest the absence of
such adjustment itself should become an obstacle to further progress. A
significant step in that direction was the 1996 decision of the alliance
to make room for the Combined Joint Task Forces, thereby envisaging the
possibility of some purely European military initiatives based on the
alliance’s logistics as well as on command, control, communications, and
intelligence. Greater U.S. willingness to accommodate French demands for
an increased role for the Western European Union within NATO, especially
in regard to command and decision making, would also betoken more
genuine American support for European unity and should help to narrow
somewhat the gap between America and France regarding Europe’s eventual
self-definition.</p>
<p>In the longer run, it is possible that the WEU will embrace some EU
member states that, for varying geopolitical or historical reasons, may
choose not to seek NATO membership. That could involve Finland or
Sweden, or perhaps even Austria, all of which have already acquired
observer status with the WEU.10 Other states may also seek a WEU
connection as a preliminary to eventual NATO membership. The WEU might
also choose at some point to emulate NATO’s Partnership for Peace
program with regard to would-be members of the EU. All of that would
help to spin a wider web of security cooperation in Europe, beyond the
formal scope of the transatlantic alliance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, until a larger and more united Europe emerges—and
that, even under the best of conditions, will not be soon—the United
States will have to work closely with both France and Germany in order
to help such a more united and larger Europe emerge. Thus, regarding
France, the central policy dilemma for America will continue to be how
to inveigle France into closer Atlantic political and military
integration without compromising the American-German connection, and
regarding Germany, how to 3 exploit U.S. reliance on German leadership
in an Atlanticist Europe without prompting concern in France and Britain
as well as in other European countries.</p>
<p>More demonstrable American flexibility on the future shape of the
alliance would be helpful in eventually mobilizing greater French
support for the alliance’s eastward expansion. In the long run, a NATO
zone of integrated military security on both sides of Germany would more
firmly anchor Germany within a multilateral framework, and that should
be a matter of consequence for France. Moreover, the expansion of the
alliance would increase the probability that the Weimar Triangle (of
Germany, France, and Poland) could become a subtle means for somewhat
balancing German leadership in Europe. Although Poland relies on German
support for gaining entrance into the alliance (and resents current
French hesitations regarding such expansion), once it is inside the
alliance a shared Franco-Polish geopolitical perspective is more likely
to emerge.</p>
<p>In any case, Washington should not lose sight of the fact that France
is only a short-term adversary on matters pertaining to the identity of
Europe or to the inner workings of NATO. More important, it should bear
in mind the fact that France is an essential partner in the important
task of permanently locking a democratic Germany into Europe. That is
the historic role of the Franco-German relationship, and the expansion
of both the EU and NATO eastward should enhance the importance of that
relationship as Europe’s inner core. Finally, France is not strong
enough either to obstruct America on the geostrategic fundamentals of
America’s European policy or to become by itself a leader of Europe as
such. Hence, its peculiarities and even its tantrums can be
tolerated.</p>
<p>It is also germane to note that France does play a constructive role
in North Africa and in the Francophone African countries. It is the
essential partner for Morocco and Tunisia, while also exercising a
stabilizing role in Algeria. There is a good domestic reason for such
French involvement: some 5 million Muslims now reside in France. France
thus has a vital stake in the stability and orderly development of North
Africa. But that interest is of wider benefit to Europe’s security.
Without the French sense of mission, Europe’s southern flank would be
much more unstable and threatening. All of southern Europe is becoming
increasingly concerned with the social-political threat posed by
instability along the Mediterranean’s southern littoral. France’s
intense concern for what transpires across the Mediterranean is thus
quite pertinent to NATO’s security concerns, and that consideration
should be taken into account when America occasionally has to cope with
France’s exaggerated claims of special leadership status.</p>
<p>Germany is another matter. Germany’s dominant role cannot be denied,
but caution must be exercised regarding any public endorsements of the
German leadership role in Europe. That leadership may be expedient to
some European states—like those in Central Europe that appreciate the
German initiative on behalf of Europe’s eastward expansion—and it may be
tolerable to the Western Europeans as long as it is subsumed under
America’s primacy, but in the long run, Europe’s construction cannot be
based on it. Too many memories still linger; too many fears are likely
to surface. A Europe constructed and led by Berlin is simply not
feasible. That is why Germany needs France, why Europe needs the
Franco-German connection, and why America cannot choose between Germany
and France.</p>
<p>The essential point regarding NATO expansion is that it is a process
integrally connected with Europe’s own expansion. If the European Union
is to become a geographically larger community—with a more-integrated
Franco-German leading core and less-integrated outer layers—and if such
a Europe is to base its security on a continued alliance with America,
then it follows that its geopolitically most exposed sector, Central
Europe, cannot be demonstratively excluded from partaking in the sense
of security that the rest of Europe enjoys through the transatlantic
alliance. On this, America and Germany agree. For them, the impulse for
enlargement is political, historical, and constructive. It is not driven
by animosity toward Russia, nor by fear of Russia, nor by the desire to
isolate Russia.</p>
<p>Hence, America must work particularly closely with Germany in
promoting the eastward expansion of Europe. American-German cooperation
and joint leadership regarding this issue are essential. Expansion will
happen if the United States and Germany jointly encourage the other NATO
allies to endorse the step and either negotiate effectively some
accommodation with Russia, if it is willing to compromise (see chapter
4), or act assertively, in the correct conviction that the task of
constructing Europe cannot be subordinated to Moscow’s objections.
Combined American-German pressure will be especially needed to obtain
the required unanimous agreement of all NATO members, but no NATO member
will be able to deny it if America and Germany jointly press for it.</p>
<p>Ultimately at stake in this effort is America’s long-range role in
Europe. A new Europe is still taking shape, and if that new Europe is to
remain geopolitically a part of the “Euro-Atlantic” space, the expansion
of NATO is essential. Indeed, a comprehensive U.S. policy for Eurasia as
a whole will not be possible if the effort to widen NATO, having been
launched by the United States, stalls and falters. That failure would
discredit American leadership; it would shatter the concept of an
expanding Europe; it would demoralize the Central Europeans; and it
could reignite currently dormant or dying Russian geopolitical
aspirations in Central Europe. For the West, it would be a
self-inflicted wound that would mortally damage the prospects for a
truly European pillar in any eventual Eurasian security architecture;
and for America, it would thus be not only a regional defeat but a
global defeat as well.</p>
<p>The bottom line guiding the progressive expansion of Europe has to be
the proposition that no power outside of the existing transatlantic
system has the right to veto the participation of any qualified European
state in the European system—and hence also in its transatlantic
security system—and that no qualified European state should be excluded
a priori from eventual membership in either the EU or NATO. Especially
the highly vulnerable and increasingly qualified Baltic states are
entitled to know that eventually they also can become full-fledged
members in both organizations—and that in the meantime, their
sovereignty cannot be threatened without engaging the interests of an
expanding Europe and its U.S. partner.</p>
<p>In essence, the West—especially America and its Western European
allies—must provide an answer to the question eloquently posed by Václav
Havel in Aachen on May 15, 1996:</p>
<p>I know that neither the European Union nor the North Atlantic
Alliance can open its doors overnight to all those who aspire to join
them. What both most assuredly can do—and what they should do before it
is too late—is to give the whole of Europe, seen as a sphere of common
values, the clear assurance that they are not closed clubs. They should
formulate a clear and detailed policy of gradual enlargement that not
only contains a timetable but also explains the logic of that timetable.
