<h4 id="a-geostrategy-for-eurasia">A GEOSTRATEGY FOR EURASIA</h4>
<p>The point of departure for the needed policy has to be hard-nosed
recognition of the three unprecedented conditions that currently define
the geopolitical state of world affairs: for the first time in history,
(1) a single state is a truly global power, (2) a non-Eurasian state is
globally the preeminent state, and (3) the globe’s central arena,
Eurasia, is dominated by a non-Eurasian power.</p>
<p>However, a comprehensive and integrated geostrategy for Eurasia must
also be based on recognition of the limits of America’s effective power
and the inevitable attrition over time of its scope. As noted earlier,
the very scale and diversity of Eurasia, as well as the potential power
of some of its states, limit the depth of American influence and the
degree of control over the course of events. This condition places a
premium on geostrategic insight and on the deliberately selective
deployment of America’s resources on the huge Eurasian chessboard. And
since America’s unprecedented power is bound to diminish over time, the
priority must be to manage the rise of other regional powers in ways
that do not threaten America’s global primacy.</p>
<p>As in chess, American global planners must think several moves ahead,
anticipating possible countermoves. A sustainable geostrategy must
therefore distinguish between the short-run perspective (the next five
or so years), the middle term (up to twenty or so years), and the long
run (beyond twenty years). Moreover, these phases must be viewed not as
watertight compartments but as part of a continuum. The first phase must
gradually and consistently lead into the second—indeed, be deliberately
pointed toward it—and the second must then lead subsequently into the
third.</p>
<p>In the short run, it is in America’s interest to consolidate and
perpetuate the prevailing geopolitical pluralism on the map of Eurasia.
That puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the
emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge
America’s primacy, not to mention the remote possibility of any one
particular state seeking to do so. By the middle term, the foregoing
should gradually yield to a greater emphasis on the emergence of
increasingly important but strategically compatible partners who,
prompted by American leadership, might help to shape a more cooperative
trans-Eurasian security system. Eventually, in the much longer run
still, the foregoing could phase into a global core of genuinely shared
political responsibility.</p>
<p>The most immediate task is to make certain that no state or
combination of states gains the capacity to expel the United States from
Eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitrating role.
However, the consolidation of transcontinental geopolitical pluralism
should not be viewed as an end in itself but only as a means to achieve
the middle-term goal of shaping genuine strategic partnerships in the
key regions of Eurasia. It is unlikely that democratic America will wish
to be permanently engaged in the difficult, absorbing, and costly task
of managing Eurasia by constant manipulation and maneuver, backed by
American military resources, in order to prevent regional domination by
any one power. The first phase must, therefore, logically and
deliberately lead into the second, one in which a benign American
hegemony still discourages others from posing a challenge not only by
making the costs of the challenge too high but also by not threatening
the vital interests of Eurasia’s potential regional aspirants.</p>
<p>What that requires specifically, as the middle-term goal, is the
fostering of genuine partnerships, predominant among them those with a
more united and politically defined Europe and with a regionally
preeminent China, as well as with (one hopes) a postimperial and
Europe-oriented Russia and, on the southern fringe of Eurasia, with a
regionally stabilizing and democratic India. But it will be the success
or failure of the effort to forge broader strategic relationships with
Europe and China, respectively, that will shape the defining context for
Russia’s role, either positive or negative.</p>
<p>It follows that a wider Europe and an enlarged NATO will serve well
both the short-term and the longer-term goals of U.S. policy. A larger
Europe will expand the range of American influence—and, through the
admission of new Central European members, also increase in the European
councils the number of states with a pro-American proclivity—without
simultaneously creating a Europe politically so integrated that it could
soon challenge the United States on geopolitical matters of high
importance to America elsewhere, particularly in the Middle East. A
politically defined Europe is also essential to the progressive
assimilation of Russia into a system of global cooperation.</p>
<p>Admittedly, America cannot on its own generate a more united
Europe—that is up to the Europeans, especially the French and the
Germans—but America can obstruct the emergence of a more united Europe.
And that could prove calamitous for stability in Eurasia and thus also
for America’s own interests. Indeed, unless Europe becomes more united,
it is likely to become more disunited again. Accordingly, as stated
earlier, it is vital that America work closely with both France and
Germany in seeking a Europe that is politically viable, a Europe that
remains linked to the United States, and a Europe that widens the scope
of the cooperative democratic international system. Making a choice
between France and Germany is not the issue. Without either France or
Germany, there will be no Europe, and without Europe there will be no
trans-Eurasian system.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the foregoing will require gradual accommodation
to a shared leadership in NATO, greater acceptance of France’s concerns
for a European role not only in Africa but also in the Middle East, and
continued support for the eastward expansion of the EU, even as the EU
becomes a more politically and economically assertive global player.32 A
Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement, already advocated by a number of
prominent Atlantic leaders, could also mitigate the risk of growing
economic rivalry between a more united EU and the United States. In any
case, the EU’s eventual success in burying the centuries-old European
nationalist antagonisms, with their globally disruptive effects, would
be well worth some gradual diminution in America’s decisive role as
Eurasia’s current arbitrator.</p>
<p>The enlargement of NATO and the EU would serve to reinvigorate
Europe’s own waning sense of a larger vocation, while consolidating, to
the benefit of both America and Europe, the democratic gains won through
the successful termination of the Cold War. At stake in this effort is
nothing less than America’s long-range relationship with Europe itself.
A new Europe is still taking shape, and if that new Europe is to remain
geopolitically a part of the “Euro-Atlantic” space, the expansion of
NATO is essential. By the same token, a failure to widen NATO, now that
the commitment has been made, would shatter the concept of an expanding
Europe and demoralize the Central Europeans. It could even reignite
currently dormant or dying Russian geopolitical aspirations in Central
Europe.</p>
<p>Indeed, the failure of the American-led effort to expand NATO could
reawaken even more ambitious Russian desires. It is not yet evident—and
the historical record is strongly to the contrary—that the Russian
political elite shares Europe’s desire for a strong and enduring
American political and military presence. Therefore, while the fostering
of an increasingly cooperative relationship with Russia is clearly
desirable, it is important for America to send a clear message about its
global priorities. If a choice has to be made between a larger
Euro-Atlantic system and a better relationship with Russia, the former
has to rank incomparably higher to America.</p>
<p>For that reason, any accommodation with Russia on the issue of NATO
enlargement should not entail an outcome that has the effect of making
Russia a de facto decision-making member of the alliance, thereby
diluting NATO’s special Euro-Atlantic character while simultaneously
relegating its newly admitted members to second-class status. That would
create opportunities for Russia to resume not only the effort to regain
a sphere of influence in Central Europe but to use its presence within
NATO to play on any American-European disagreements in order to reduce
the American role in European affairs.</p>
<p>It is also crucial that, as Central Europe enters NATO, any new
security assurances to Russia regarding the region be truly reciprocal
and thus mutually reassuring. Restrictions on the deployment of NATO
troops and nuclear weapons on the soil of new members can be an
important factor in allaying legitimate Russian concerns, but these
should be matched by symmetrical Russian assurances regarding the
demilitarization of the potentially strategically menacing salient of
Kaliningrad and by limits on major troop deployments near the borders of
the prospective new members of NATO and the EU. While all of Russia’s
newly independent western neighbors are anxious to have a stable and
cooperative relationship with Russia, the fact is that they continue to
fear it for historically understandable reasons. Hence, the emergence of
an equitable NATO/EU accommodation with Russia would be welcomed by all
Europeans as a signal that Russia is finally making the much-desired
postimperial choice in favor of Europe.</p>
<p>That choice could pave the way for a wider effort to enhance Russia’s
status and esteem. Formal membership in the G-7, as well as the
upgrading of the policy-making machinery of the OSCE (within which a
special security committee composed of America, Russia, and several key
European countries could be established), would create opportunities for
constructive Russian engagement in shaping both the political and
security dimensions of Europe. Coupled with ongoing Western financial
assistance to Russia, along with the development of much more ambitious
schemes for linking Russia more closely to Europe through new highway
and railroad networks, the process of giving substance to a Russian
choice in favor of Europe could move forward significantly.</p>
<p>Russia’s longer-term role in Eurasia will depend largely on the
historic choice that Russia has to make, perhaps still in the course of
this decade, regarding its own self-definition. Even with Europe and
China increasing the radius of their respective regional influence,
Russia will remain in charge of the world’s largest single piece of real
estate. It spans ten time zones and is territorially twice as large as
either the United States or China, dwarfing in that regard even an
enlarged Europe. Hence, territorial deprivation is not Russia’s central
problem. Rather, the huge Russia has to face squarely and draw the
proper implications from the fact that both Europe and China are already
economically more powerful and that China is also threatening to outpace
Russia on the road to social modernization.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, it should become more evident to the Russian
political elite that Russia’s first priority is to modernize itself
rather than to engage in a futile effort to regain its former status as
a global power. Given the enormous size and diversity of the country, a
decentralized political system, based on the free market, would be more
likely to unleash the creative potential of both the Russian people and
the country’s vast natural resources. In turn, such a more decentralized
Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization. A loosely
confederated Russia—composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic,
and a Far Eastern Republic—would also find it easier to cultivate closer
economic relations with Europe, with the new states of Central Asia, and
with the Orient, which would thereby accelerate Russia’s own
development. Each of the three confederated entities would also be more
able to tap local creative potential, stifled for centuries by Moscow’s
heavy bureaucratic hand.</p>
<p>A clear choice by Russia in favor of the European option over the
imperial one will be more likely if America successfully pursues the
second imperative strand of its strategy toward Russia: namely,
reinforcing the prevailing geopolitical pluralism in the post-Soviet
space. Such reinforcement will serve to discourage any imperial
temptations. A postimperial and Europe-oriented Russia should actually
view American efforts to that end as helpful in consolidating regional
stability and in reducing the possibility of conflicts along its new,
potentially unstable southern frontiers. But the policy of consolidating
geopolitical pluralism should not be conditioned on the existence of a
good relationship with Russia. Rather, it is also important insurance in
case such a good relationship fails to develop, as it creates
impediments to the reemergence of any truly threatening Russian imperial
policy.</p>
<p>It follows that political and economic support for the key newly
independent states is an integral part of a broader strategy for
Eurasia. The consolidation of a sovereign Ukraine, which in the meantime
redefines itself as a Central European state and engages in closer
integration with Central Europe, is a critically important component of
such a policy, as is the fostering of a closer relationship with such
strategically pivotal states as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, in addition
to the more generalized effort to open up Central Asia (in spite of
Russian impediments) to the global economy.</p>
<p>Large-scale international investment in an increasingly accessible
Caspian–Central Asian region would not only help to consolidate the
independence of its new countries but in the long run would also benefit
a postimperial and democratic Russia. The tapping of the region’s energy
and mineral resources would generate prosperity, prompting a greater
sense of stability and security in the area, while perhaps also reducing
the risks of Balkan-type conflicts. The benefits of accelerated regional
development, funded by external investment, would also radiate to the
adjoining Russian provinces, which tend to be economically
underdeveloped. Moreover, once the region’s new ruling elites come to
realize that Russia acquiesces in the region’s integration into the
global economy, they will become less fearful of the political
consequences of close economic relations with Russia. In time, a
nonimperial Russia could thus gain acceptance as the region’s preeminent
economic partner, even though no longer its imperial ruler.</p>
<p>To promote a stable and independent southern Caucasus and Central
Asia, America must be careful not to alienate Turkey and should explore
whether an improvement in American-Iranian relations is feasible. A
Turkey that feels that it is an outcast from Europe, which it has been
seeking to join, will become a more Islamic Turkey, more likely to veto
the enlargement of NATO out of spite and less likely to cooperate with
the West in seeking both to stabilize and integrate a secular Central
Asia into the world community.</p>
<p>Accordingly, America should use its influence in Europe to encourage
Turkey’s eventual admission to the EU and should make a point of
treating Turkey as a European state—provided internal Turkish politics
do not take a dramatic turn in the Islamist direction. Regular
consultations with Ankara regarding the future of the Caspian Sea basin
and Central Asia would foster in Turkey a sense of strategic partnership
with the United States. America should also strongly support Turkish
aspirations to have a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to Ceyhan on the
Turkish Mediterranean coast serve as major outlet for the Caspian Sea
basin energy sources.</p>
<p>In addition, it is not in America’s interest to perpetuate
American-Iranian hostility. Any eventual reconciliation should be based
on the recognition of a mutual strategic interest in stabilizing what
currently is a very volatile regional environment for Iran. Admittedly,
any such reconciliation must be pursued by both sides and is not a favor
granted by one to the other. A strong, even religiously motivated but
not fanatically anti-Western Iran is in the U.S. interest, and
ultimately even the Iranian political elite may recognize that reality.
In the meantime, American long-range interests in Eurasia would be
better served by abandoning existing U.S. objections to closer
Turkish-Iranian economic cooperation, especially in the construction of
new pipelines, and also to the construction of other links between Iran,
Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. Long-term American participation in the
financing of such projects would in fact also be in the American
interest.33</p>
<p>India’s potential role needs also to be highlighted, although it is
currently a relatively passive player on the Eurasian scene. India is
contained geopolitically by the Chinese-Pakistani coalition, while a
weak Russia cannot offer it the political support once provided by the
Soviet Union. However, the survival of its democracy is of importance in
that it refutes better than volumes of academic debate the notion that
human rights and democracy are purely a parochial Western manifestation.
India proves that antidemocratic “Asian values,” propagated by spokesmen
from Singapore to China, are simply antidemocratic but not necessarily
characteristic of Asia. India’s failure, by the same token, would be a
blow to the prospects for democracy and would remove from the scene a
power that contributes to greater balance on the Asian scene, especially
given China’s rise to geopolitical preeminence. It follows that a
progressive engagement of India in discussions pertaining to regional
stability, especially regarding the future of Central Asia, is becoming
timely, not to mention the promotion of more directly bilateral
connections between American and Indian defense communities.</p>
<p>Geopolitical pluralism in Eurasia as a whole will neither be
attainable nor stable without a deepening strategic understanding
between America and China. It follows that a policy of engaging China in
a serious strategic dialogue, eventually perhaps in a three-way effort
that involves Japan as well, is the necessary first step in enhancing
China’s interest in an accommodation with America that reflects the
several geopolitical interests (especially in Northeast Asia and in
Central Asia) the two countries in fact share in common. It also
behooves America to eliminate any uncertainties regarding America’s own
commitment to the one-China policy, lest the Taiwan issue fester and
worsen, especially after China’s absorption of Hong Kong. By the same
token, it is in China’s own interest to make that absorption a
successful demonstration of the principle that even a Greater China can
tolerate and safeguard increased diversity in its internal political
arrangements.</p>
<p>While—as argued earlier in chapters 4 and 6—any would-be
Chinese-Russian-Iranian coalition against America is unlikely to jell
beyond some occasional tactical posturing, it is important for the
United States to deal with China in a fashion that does not drive
Beijing in that direction. In any such “antihegemonic” alliance, China
would be the linchpin. It would be the strongest, the most dynamic, and
thus the leading component. Such a coalition could only emerge around a
disaffected, frustrated, and hostile China. Neither Russia nor Iran has
the wherewithal to be the central magnet for such a coalition.</p>
<p>An American-Chinese strategic dialogue regarding the areas that both
countries desire to see free of domination by other aspiring hegemons is
therefore imperative. But to make progress, the dialogue should be
sustained and serious. In the course of such communication, more
contentious issues pertaining to Taiwan and even to human rights could
then be addressed more persuasively. Indeed, the point can be made quite
credibly that the issue of China’s internal liberalization is not a
purely domestic Chinese affair, since only a democratizing and
prosperous China has any prospect of peacefully enticing Taiwan. Any
attempt at forcible reunification would not only place the
American-Chinese relationship in jeopardy but would inevitably generate
adverse consequences for China’s capacity to attract foreign capital and
sustain its development. China’s own aspirations to regional preeminence
and global status would thereby be victimized.</p>
<p>Although China is emerging as a regionally dominant power, it is not
likely to become a global one for a long time to come (for reasons
stated in chapter 6)—and paranoiac fears of China as a global power are
breeding megalomania in China, while perhaps also becoming the source of
a self-fulfilling prophesy of intensified American-Chinese hostility.
Accordingly, China should be neither contained nor propitiated. It
should be treated with respect as the world’s largest developing state,
and—so far at least—a rather successful one. Its geopolitical role not
only in the Far East but in Eurasia as a whole is likely to grow as
well. Hence, it would make sense to coopt China into the G-7 annual
summit of the world’s leading countries, especially since Russia’s
inclusion has widened the summit’s focus from economics to politics.</p>
<p>As China becomes more integrated into the world system and hence less
able and less inclined to exploit its regional primacy in a politically
obtuse fashion, it also follows that a de facto emergence of a Chinese
sphere of deference in areas of historic interest to China is likely to
be part of the emerging Eurasian structure of geopolitical
accommodation. Whether a united Korea will oscillate toward such a
sphere depends much on the degree of Japanese-Korean reconciliation
(which America should more actively encourage), but in any case, the
reunification of Korea without an accommodation with China is
unlikely.</p>
<p>A Greater China at some point will inevitably press for a resolution
of the issue of Taiwan, but the degree of China’s inclusion in an
increasingly binding set of international economic and political links
may also have a positive impact on the nature of Chinese domestic
politics. If China’s absorption of Hong Kong proves not to be
repressive, Deng’s formula for Taiwan of “one country, two systems” can
become redefined as “one country, several systems.” That might make
reunification more acceptable to the parties concerned—which again
reinforces the point that without some political evolution of China
itself, a peaceful reconstitution of one China will not be possible.</p>
<p>In any case, for historic as well as geopolitical reasons, China
should consider America its natural ally. Unlike Japan or Russia,
America has never had any territorial designs on China; and, unlike
Great Britain, it never humiliated China. Moreover, without a viable
strategic consensus with America, China is not likely to be able to keep
attracting the massive foreign investment so necessary to its economic
growth and thus also to its attainment of regional preeminence. For the
same reason, without an American-Chinese strategic accommodation as the
eastern anchor of America’s involvement in Eurasia, America will not
have a geostrategy for mainland Asia; and without a geostrategy for
mainland Asia, America will not have a geostrategy for Eurasia. Thus for
America, China’s regional power, co-opted into a wider framework of
international cooperation, can be a vitally important geostrategic
asset—in that regard coequally important with Europe and more weighty
than Japan—in assuring Eurasia’s stability.</p>
<p>However, unlike the European situation, a democratic bridgehead on
the eastern mainland will not emerge soon. That makes it all the more
important that America’s efforts to nurture a deepening strategic
relationship with China be based on the unambiguous acknowledgment that
a democratic and economically successful Japan is America’s premier
Pacific and key global partner. Although Japan cannot become a dominant
Asian regional power, given the strong regional aversion it evokes, it
can become a leading international one. Tokyo can carve out a globally
influential role by cooperating closely with the United States regarding
what might be called the new agenda of global concerns, while avoiding
any futile and potentially counterproductive effort to become a regional
power itself. The task of American statesmanship should hence be to
steer Japan in that direction. An American-Japanese free trade
agreement, creating a common economic space, would fortify the
connection and promote the goal, and hence its utility should be jointly
examined.</p>
<p>It is through a close political relationship with Japan that America
will more safely be able to accommodate China’s regional aspirations,
while opposing its more arbitrary manifestations. Only on that basis can
an intricate three-way accommodation—one that involves America’s global
power, China’s regional preeminence, and Japan’s international
leadership—be contrived. However, that broad geostrategic accommodation
could be undermined by an unwise expansion of American-Japanese military
cooperation. Japan’s central role should not be that of America’s
unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Far East, nor should it be America’s
principal Asian military partner or a potential Asian regional power.
Misguided efforts to promote any of the foregoing would serve to cut
America off from the Asian mainland, to vitiate the prospects for
reaching a strategic consensus with China, and thus to frustrate
America’s capacity to consolidate stable geopolitical pluralism
throughout Eurasia.</p>
