<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Superpower Politics</p>
<p>EVER SINCE THE CONTINENTS started interacting politically, some five
hundred years ago, Eurasia has been the center of world power. In
different ways, at different times, the peoples inhabiting
Eurasia—though mostly those from its Western European
periphery—penetrated and dominated the world’s other regions as
individual Eurasian states attained the special status and enjoyed the
privileges of being the world’s premier powers.</p>
<p>The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic
shift in world affairs. For the first time ever, a non-Eurasian power
has emerged not only as the key arbiter of Eurasian power relations but
also as the world’s paramount power. The defeat and collapse of the
Soviet Union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a Western
Hemisphere power, the United States, as the sole and, indeed, the first
truly global power.</p>
<p>Eurasia, however, retains its geopolitical importance. Not only is
its western periphery—Europe—still the location of much of the world’s
political and economic power, but its eastern region—Asia—has lately
become a vital center of economic growth and rising political influence.
Hence, the issue of how a globally engaged America copes with the
complex Eurasian power relationships—and particularly whether it
prevents the emergence of a dominant and antagonistic Eurasian
power—remains central to America’s capacity to exercise global
primacy.</p>
<p>It follows that—in addition to cultivating the various novel
dimensions of power (technology, communications, information, as well as
trade and finance)—American foreign policy must remain concerned with
the geopolitical dimension and must employ its influence in Eurasia in a
manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium, with the United
States as the political arbiter.</p>
<p>Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global
primacy continues to be played, and that struggle involves
geostrategy—the strategic management of geopolitical interests. It is
noteworthy that as recently as 1940 two aspirants to global power, Adolf
Hitler and Joseph Stalin, agreed explicitly (in the secret negotiations
of November of that year) that America should be excluded from Eurasia.
Each realized that the injection of American power into Eurasia would
preclude his ambitions regarding global domination. Each shared the
assumption that Eurasia is the center of the world and that he who
controls Eurasia controls the world. A half century later, the issue has
been redefined: will America’s primacy in Eurasia endure, and to what
ends might it be applied?</p>
<p>The ultimate objective of American policy should be benign and
visionary: to shape a truly cooperative global community, in keeping
with long-range trends and with the fundamental interests of humankind.
But in the meantime, it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger
emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging
America. The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian
geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book.</p>
<p>Zbigniew Brzezinski</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>April 1997</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>Hegemony of a New Type</p>
<p>HEGEMONY IS AS OLD AS MANKIND. But America’s current global supremacy
is distinctive in the rapidity of its emergence, in its global scope,
and in the manner of its exercise. In the course of a single century,
America has transformed itself—and has also been transformed by
international dynamics—from a country relatively isolated in the Western
Hemisphere into a power of unprecedented worldwide reach and grasp.</p>
<p>THE SHORT ROAD TO GLOBAL SUPREMACY</p>
<p>The Spanish-American War in 1898 was America’s first overseas war of
conquest. It thrust American power far into the Pacific, beyond Hawaii
to the Philippines. By the turn of the century, American strategists
were already busy developing doctrines for a two-ocean naval supremacy,
and the American navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain
“rules the waves.” American claims of a special status as the sole
guardian of the Western Hemisphere’s security—proclaimed earlier in the
century by the Monroe Doctrine and subsequently justified by America’s
alleged “manifest destiny”—were even further enhanced by the
construction of the Panama Canal, which facilitated naval domination
over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>The basis for America’s expanding geopolitical ambitions was provided
by the rapid industrialization of the country’s economy. By the outbreak
of World War I, America’s growing economic might already accounted for
about 33 percent of global GNP, which displaced Great Britain as the
world’s leading industrial power. This remarkable economic dynamism was
fostered by a culture that favored experimentation and innovation.
America’s political institutions and free market economy created
unprecedented opportunities for ambitious and iconoclastic inventors,
who were not inhibited from pursuing their personal dreams by archaic
privileges or rigid social hierarchies. In brief, national culture was
uniquely congenial to economic growth, and by attracting and quickly
assimilating the most talented individuals from abroad, the culture also
facilitated the expansion of national power.</p>
<p>World War I provided the first occasion for the massive projection of
American military force into Europe. A heretofore relatively isolated
power promptly transported several hundred thousand of its troops across
the Atlantic—a transoceanic military expedition unprecedented in its
size and scope, which signaled the emergence of a new major player in
the international arena. Just as important, the war also prompted the
first major American diplomatic effort to apply American principles in
seeking a solution to Europe’s international problems. Woodrow Wilson’s
famous Fourteen Points represented the injection into European
geopolitics of American idealism, reinforced by American might. (A
decade and a half earlier, the United States had played a leading role
in settling a Far Eastern conflict between Russia and Japan, thereby
also asserting its growing international stature.) The fusion of
American idealism and American power thus made itself fully felt on the
world scene.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, however, World War I was still predominantly a
European war, not a global one. But its self-destructive character
marked the beginning of the end of Europe’s political, economic, and
cultural preponderance over the rest of the world. In the course of the
war, no single European power was able to prevail decisively—and the
war’s outcome was heavily influenced by the entrance into the conflict
of the rising non-European power, America. Thereafter, Europe would
become increasingly the object, rather than the subject, of global power
politics.</p>
<p>However, this brief burst of American global leadership did not
produce a continuing American engagement in world affairs. Instead,
America quickly retreated into a self-gratifying combination of
isolationism and idealism. Although by the mid-twenties and early
thirties totalitarianism was gathering strength on the European
continent, American power—by then including a powerful two-ocean fleet
that clearly outmatched the British navy—remained disengaged. Americans
preferred to be bystanders to global politics.</p>
<p>Consistent with that predisposition was the American concept of
security, based on a view of America as a continental island. American
strategy focused on sheltering its shores and was thus narrowly national
in scope, with little thought given to international or global
considerations. The critical international players were still the
European powers and, increasingly, Japan.</p>
<p>The European era in world politics came to a final end in the course
of World War II, the first truly global war. Fought on three continents
simultaneously, with the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans also heavily
contested, its global dimension was symbolically demonstrated when
British and Japanese soldiers—representing, respectively, a remote
Western European island and a similarly remote East Asian
island—collided thousands of miles from their homes on the
Indian-Burmese frontier. Europe and Asia had become a single
battlefield.</p>
<p>Had the war’s outcome been a clear-cut victory for Nazi Germany, a
single European power might then have emerged as globally preponderant.
(Japan’s victory in the Pacific would have gained for that nation the
dominant Far Eastern role, but in all probability, Japan would still
have remained only a regional hegemon.) Instead, Germany’s defeat was
sealed largely by the two extra-European victors, the United States and
the Soviet Union, which became the successors to Europe’s unfulfilled
quest for global supremacy.</p>
<p>The next fifty years were dominated by the bipolar American-Soviet
contest for global supremacy. In some respects, the contest between the
United States and the Soviet Union represented the fulfillment of the
geopoliticians’ fondest theories: it pitted the world’s leading maritime
power, dominant over both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, against
the world’s leading land power, paramount on the Eurasian heartland
(with the Sino-Soviet bloc encompassing a space remarkably reminiscent
of the scope of the Mongol Empire). The geopolitical dimension could not
have been clearer: North America versus Eurasia, with the world at
stake. The winner would truly dominate the globe. There was no one else
to stand in the way, once victory was finally grasped.</p>
<p>Each rival projected worldwide an ideological appeal that was infused
with historical optimism, that justified for each the necessary
exertions while reinforcing its conviction in inevitable victory. Each
rival was clearly dominant within its own space—unlike the imperial
European aspirants to global hegemony, none of which ever quite
succeeded in asserting decisive preponderance within Europe itself. And
each used its ideology to reinforce its hold over its respective vassals
and tributaries, in a manner somewhat reminiscent of the age of
religious warfare.</p>
<p>The combination of global geopolitical scope and the proclaimed
universality of the competing dogmas gave the contest unprecedented
intensity. But an additional factor—also imbued with global
implications—made the contest truly unique. The advent of nuclear
weapons meant that a head-on war, of a classical type, between the two
principal contestants would not only spell their mutual destruction but
could unleash lethal consequences for a significant portion of humanity.
The intensity of the conflict was thus simultaneously subjected to
extraordinary self-restraint on the part of both rivals.</p>
<p>In the geopolitical realm, the conflict was waged largely on the
peripheries of Eurasia itself. The Sino-Soviet bloc dominated most of
Eurasia but did not control its peripheries. North America succeeded in
entrenching itself on both the extreme western and extreme eastern
shores of the great Eurasian continent. The defense of these continental
bridgeheads (epitomized on the western “front” by the Berlin blockade
and on the eastern by the Korean War) was thus the first strategic test
of what came to be known as the Cold War.</p>
<p>In the Cold War’s final phase, a third defensive “front”—the
southern—appeared on Eurasia’s map (see map above). The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan precipitated a two-pronged American response: direct U.S.
assistance to the native resistance in Afghanistan in order to bog down
the Soviet army; and a large-scale buildup of the U.S. military presence
in the Persian Gulf as a deterrent to any further southward projection
of Soviet political or military power. The United States committed
itself to the defense of the Persian Gulf region, on a par with its
western and eastern Eurasian security interests.</p>
<p>The successful containment by North America of the Eurasian bloc’s
efforts to gain effective sway over all of Eurasia—with both sides
deterred until the very end from a direct military collision for fear of
a nuclear war—meant that the outcome of the contest was eventually
decided by nonmilitary means. Political vitality, ideological
flexibility, economic dynamism, and cultural appeal became the decisive
dimensions.</p>
<p>The American-led coalition retained its unity, whereas the
Sino-Soviet bloc split within less than two decades. In part, this was
due to the democratic coalition’s greater flexibility, in contrast to
the hierarchical and dogmatic—but also brittle—character of the
Communist camp. The former involved shared values, but without a formal
doctrinal format. The latter emphasized dogmatic orthodoxy, with only
one valid interpretative center. America’s principal vassals were also
significantly weaker than America, whereas the Soviet Union could not
indefinitely treat China as a subordinate. The outcome was also due to
the fact that the American side proved to be economically and
technologically much more dynamic, whereas the Soviet Union gradually
stagnated and could not effectively compete either in economic growth or
in military technology. Economic decay in turn fostered ideological
demoralization.</p>
<p>In fact, Soviet military power—and the fear it inspired among
westerners—for a long time obscured the essential asymmetry between the
two contestants. America was simply much richer, technologically much
more advanced, militarily more resilient and innovative, socially more
creative and appealing. Ideological constraints also sapped the creative
potential of the Soviet Union, making its system increasingly rigid and
its economy increasingly wasteful and technologically less competitive.
As long as a mutually destructive war did not break out, in a protracted
competition the scales had to tip eventually in America’s favor.</p>
<p>The final outcome was also significantly influenced by cultural
considerations. The American-led coalition, by and large, accepted as
positive many attributes of America’s political and social culture.
America’s two most important allies on the western and eastern
peripheries of the Eurasian continent, Germany and Japan, both recovered
their economic health in the context of almost unbridled admiration for
all things American. America was widely perceived as representing the
future, as a society worthy of admiration and deserving of
emulation.</p>
<p>In contrast, Russia was held in cultural contempt by most of its
Central European vassals and even more so by its principal and
increasingly assertive eastern ally, China. For the Central Europeans,
Russian domination meant isolation from what the Central Europeans
considered their philosophical and cultural home: Western Europe and its
Christian religious traditions. Worse than that, it meant domination by
a people whom the Central Europeans, often unjustly, considered their
cultural inferior.</p>
<p>The Chinese, for whom the word “Russia” means “the hungry land,” were
even more openly contemptuous. Although initially the Chinese had only
quietly contested Moscow’s claims of universality for the Soviet model,
within a decade following the Chinese Communist revolution they mounted
an assertive challenge to Moscow’s ideological primacy and even began to
express openly their traditional contempt for the neighboring northern
barbarians.</p>
<p>Finally, within the Soviet Union itself, the 50 percent of the
population that was non-Russian eventually also rejected Moscow’s
domination. The gradual political awakening of the non-Russians meant
that the Ukrainians, Georgians, Armenians, and Azeris began to view
Soviet power as a form of alien imperial domination by a people to whom
they did not feel culturally inferior. In Central Asia, national
aspirations may have been weaker, but here these peoples were fueled in
addition by a gradually rising sense of Islamic identity, intensified by
the knowledge of the ongoing decolonization elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like so many empires before it, the Soviet Union eventually imploded
and fragmented, falling victim not so much to a direct military defeat
as to disintegration accelerated by economic and social strains. Its
fate confirmed a scholar’s apt observation that</p>
<ul>
<li>〔e〕mpires are inherently politically unstable because subordinate
units almost always prefer greater autonomy, and counter-elites in such
units almost always act, upon opportunity, to obtain greater autonomy.
In this sense, empires do not fall; rather, they fall apart, usually
very slowly, though sometimes remarkably quickly.1</li>
