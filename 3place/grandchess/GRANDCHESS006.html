<h4 id="critical-choices-and-potential-challenges">CRITICAL CHOICES AND
POTENTIAL CHALLENGES</h4>
<p>The identification of the central players and key pivots helps to
define America’s grand policy dilemmas and to anticipate the potential
major challenges on the Eurasian supercontinent. These can be
summarized, before more comprehensive discussion in subsequent chapters,
as involving five broad issues:</p>
<p>• What kind of Europe should America prefer and hence promote?</p>
<p>• What kind of Russia is in America’s interest, and what and how much
can America do about it?</p>
<p>• What are the prospects for the emergence in Central Eurasia of a
new “Balkans,” and what should America do to minimize the resulting
risks?</p>
<p>• What role should China be encouraged to assume in the Far East, and
what are the implications of the foregoing not only for the United
States but also for Japan?</p>
<p>• What new Eurasian coalitions are possible, which might be most
dangerous to U.S. interests, and what needs to be done to preclude
them?</p>
<p>The United States has always professed its fidelity to the cause of a
united Europe. Ever since the days of the Kennedy administration, the
standard invocation has been that of “equal partnership.” Official
Washington has consistently proclaimed its desire to see Europe emerge
as a single entity, powerful enough to share with America both the
responsibilities and the burdens of global leadership.</p>
<p>That has been the established rhetoric on the subject. But in
practice, the United States has been less clear and less consistent.
Does Washington truly desire a Europe that is a genuinely equal partner
in world affairs, or does it prefer an unequal alliance? For example, is
the United States prepared to share leadership with Europe in the Middle
East, a region not only much closer geographically to Europe than to
America but also one in which several European states have long-standing
interests? The issue of Israel instantly comes to mind. U.S.-European
differences over Iran and Iraq have also been treated by the United
States not as an issue between equals but as a matter of
insubordination.</p>
<p>Ambiguity regarding the degree of American support for European unity
also extends to the issue of how European unity is to be defined,
especially concerning which country, if any, should lead a united
Europe. Washington has not discouraged London’s divisive posture
regarding Europe’s integration, though Washington has also shown a clear
preference for German—rather than French—leadership in Europe. That is
understandable, given the traditional thrust of French policy, but the
preference has also had the effect of encouraging the occasional
appearance of a tactical Franco-British entente in order to thwart
Germany, as well as periodic French flirtation with Moscow in order to
offset the American-German coalition.</p>
<p>The emergence of a truly united Europe—especially if that should
occur with constructive American support—will require significant
changes in the structure and processes of the NATO alliance, the
principal link between America and Europe. NATO provides not only the
main mechanism for the exercise of U.S. influence regarding European
matters but the basis for the politically critical American military
presence in Western Europe. However, European unity will require that
structure to adjust to the new reality of an alliance based on two more
or less equal partners, instead of an alliance that, to use traditional
terminology, involves essentially a hegemon and its vassals. That issue
has so far been largely skirted, despite the modest steps taken in 1996
to enhance within NATO the role of the Western European Union (WEU), the
military coalition of the Western European states. A real choice in
favor of a united Europe will thus compel a far-reaching reordering of
NATO, inevitably reducing the American primacy within the alliance.</p>
<p>In brief, a long-range American geostrategy for Europe will have to
address explicitly the issues of European unity and real partnership
with Europe. An America that truly desires a united and hence also a
more independent Europe will have to throw its weight behind those
European forces that are genuinely committed to Europe’s political and
economic integration. Such a strategy will also mean junking the last
vestiges of the once-hallowed U.S.-U.K. special relationship.</p>
<p>A policy for a united Europe will also have to address—though jointly
with the Europeans—the highly sensitive issue of Europe’s geographic
scope. How far eastward should the European Union extend? And should the
eastern limits of the EU be synonymous with the eastern front line of
NATO? The former is more a matter for a European decision, but a
European decision on that issue will have direct implications for a NATO
decision. The latter, however, engages the United States, and the U.S.
voice in NATO is still decisive. Given the growing consensus regarding
the desirability of admitting the nations of Central Europe into both
the EU and NATO, the practical meaning of this question focuses
attention on the future status of the Baltic republics and perhaps also
that of Ukraine.</p>
<p>There is thus an important overlap between the European dilemma
discussed above and the second one pertaining to Russia. It is easy to
respond to the question regarding Russia’s future by professing a
preference for a democratic Russia, closely linked to Europe.
Presumably, a democratic Russia would be more sympathetic to the values
shared by America and Europe and hence also more likely to become a
junior partner in shaping a more stable and cooperative Eurasia. But
Russia’s ambitions may go beyond the attainment of recognition and
respect as a democracy. Within the Russian foreign policy establishment
(composed largely of former Soviet officials), there still thrives a
deeply ingrained desire for a special Eurasian role, one that would
consequently entail the subordination to Moscow of the newly independent
post-Soviet states.</p>
<p>In that context, even friendly western policy is seen by some
influential members of the Russian policy-making community as designed
to deny Russia its rightful claim to a global status. As two Russian
geopoliticians put it:</p>
<ul>
<li>〔T〕he United States and the NATO countries—while sparing Russia’s
self-esteem to the extent possible, but nevertheless firmly and
consistently—are destroying the geopolitical foundations which could, at
least in theory, allow Russia to hope to acquire the status as the
number two power in world politics that belonged to the Soviet
Union.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, America is seen as pursuing a policy in which</p>
<p>the new organization of the European space that is being engineered
by the West is, in essence, built on the idea of supporting, in this
part of the world, new, relatively small and weak national states
through their more or less close rapprochement with NATO, the EC, and so
forth.5</p>
<p>The above quotations define well—even though with some animus—the
dilemma that the United States faces. To what extent should Russia be
helped economically—which inevitably strengthens Russia politically and
militarily—and to what extent should the newly independent states be
simultaneously assisted in the defense and consolidation of their
independence? Can Russia be both powerful and a democracy at the same
time? If it becomes powerful again, will it not seek to regain its lost
imperial domain, and can it then be both an empire and a democracy?</p>
<p>U.S. policy toward the vital geopolitical pivots of Ukraine and
Azerbaijan cannot skirt that issue, and America thus faces a difficult
dilemma regarding tactical balance and strategic purpose. Internal
Russian recovery is essential to Russia’s democratization and eventual
Europeanization. But any recovery of its imperial potential would be
inimical to both of these objectives. Moreover, it is over this issue
that differences could develop between America and some European states,
especially as the EU and NATO expand. Should Russia be considered a
candidate for eventual membership in either structure? And what then
about Ukraine? The costs of the exclusion of Russia could be
high—creating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the Russian mindset—but the
results of dilution of either the EU or NATO could also be quite
destabilizing.</p>
<p>Another major uncertainty looms in the large and geopolitically fluid
space of Central Eurasia, maximized by the potential vulnerability of
the Turkish-Iranian pivots. In the area demarcated on the following map
from Crimea in the Black Sea directly eastward along the new southern
frontiers of Russia, all the way to the Chinese province of Xinjiang,
then down to the Indian Ocean and thence westward to the Red Sea, then
northward to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and back to Crimea, live
about 400 million people, located in some twenty-five states, almost all
of them ethnically as well as religiously heterogeneous and practically
none of them politically stable. Some of these states may be in the
process of acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>This huge region, torn by volatile hatreds and surrounded by
competing powerful neighbors, is likely to be a major battlefield, both
for wars among nation-states and, more likely, for protracted ethnic and
religious violence. Whether India acts as a restraint or whether it
takes advantage of some opportunity to impose its will on Pakistan will
greatly affect the regional scope of the likely conflicts. The internal
strains within Turkey and Iran are likely not only to get worse but to
greatly reduce the stabilizing role these states are capable of playing
within this volcanic region. Such developments will in turn make it more
difficult to assimilate the new Central Asian states into the
international community, while also adversely affecting the
American-dominated security of the Persian Gulf region. In any case,
both America and the international community may be faced here with a
challenge that will dwarf the recent crisis in the former
Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>A possible challenge to American primacy from Islamic fundamentalism
could be part of the problem in this unstable region. By exploiting
religious hostility to the American way of life and taking advantage of
the Arab-Israeli conflict, Islamic fundamentalism could undermine
several pro-Western Middle Eastern governments and eventually jeopardize
American regional interests, especially in the Persian Gulf. However,
without political cohesion and in the absence of a single genuinely
powerful Islamic state, a challenge from Islamic fundamentalism would
lack a geopolitical core and would thus be more likely to express itself
through diffuse violence.</p>
<p>A geostrategic issue of crucial importance is posed by China’s
emergence as a major power. The most appealing outcome would be to
co-opt a democratizing and free-marketing China into a larger Asian
regional framework of cooperation. But suppose China does not
democratize but continues to grow in economic and military power? A
“Greater China” may be emerging, whatever the desires and calculations
of its neighbors, and any effort to prevent that from happening could
entail an intensifying conflict with China. Such a conflict could strain
American-Japanese relations—for it is far from certain that Japan would
want to follow America’s lead in containing China—and could therefore
have potentially revolutionary consequences for Tokyo’s definition of
Japan’s regional role, perhaps even resulting in the termination of the
American presence in the Far East.</p>
<p>However, accommodation with China will also exact its own price. To
accept China as a regional power is not a matter of simply endorsing a
mere slogan. There will have to be substance to any such regional
preeminence. To put it very directly, how large a Chinese sphere of
influence, and where, should America be prepared to accept as part of a
policy of successfully co-opting China into world affairs? What areas
now outside of China’s political radius might have to be conceded to the
realm of the reemerging Celestial Empire?</p>
<p>In that context, the retention of the American presence in South
Korea becomes especially important. Without it, it is difficult to
envisage the American-Japanese defense arrangement continuing in its
present form, for Japan would have to become militarily more
self-sufficient. But any movement toward Korean reunification is likely
to disturb the basis for the continued U.S. military presence in South
Korea. A reunified Korea may choose not to perpetuate American military
protection; that, indeed, could be the price exacted by China for
throwing its decisive weight behind the reunification of the peninsula.
In brief, U.S. management of its relationship with China will inevitably
have direct consequences for the stability of the
American-Japanese-Korean triangular security relationship.</p>
<p>Finally, some possible contingencies involving future political
alignments should also be briefly noted, subject to fuller discussion in
pertinent chapters. In the past, international affairs were largely
dominated by contests among individual states for regional domination.
Henceforth, the United States may have to determine how to cope with
regional coalitions that seek to push America out of Eurasia, thereby
threatening America’s status as a global power. However, whether any
such coalitions do or do not arise to challenge American primacy will in
fact depend to a very large degree on how effectively the United States
responds to the major dilemmas identified here.</p>
<p>Potentially, the most dangerous scenario would be a grand coalition
of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an “antihegemonic” coalition united
not by ideology but by complementary grievances. It would be reminiscent
in scale and scope of the challenge once posed by the Sino-Soviet bloc,
though this time China would likely be the leader and Russia the
follower. Averting this contingency, however remote it may be, will
require a display of U.S. geostrategic skill on the western, eastern,
and southern perimeters of Eurasia simultaneously.</p>
<p>A geographically more limited but potentially even more consequential
challenge could involve a Sino-Japanese axis, in the wake of a collapse
of the American position in the Far East and a revolutionary change in
Japan’s world outlook. It would combine the power of two extraordinarily
productive peoples, and it could exploit some form of “Asianism” as a
unifying anti-American doctrine. However, it does not appear likely that
in the foreseeable future China and Japan will form an alliance, given
their recent historical experience; and a farsighted American policy in
the Far East should certainly be able to prevent this eventuality from
occurring.</p>
<p>Also quite remote, but not to be entirely excluded, is the
possibility of a grand European realignment, involving either a
German-Russian collusion or a Franco-Russian entente. There are obvious
historical precedents for both, and either could emerge if European
unification were to grind to a halt and if relations between Europe and
America were to deteriorate gravely. Indeed, in the latter eventuality,
one could imagine a European-Russian accommodation to exclude America
from the continent. At this stage, all of these variants seem
improbable. They would require not only a massive mishandling by America
of its European policy but also a dramatic reorientation on the part of
the key European states.</p>
<p>Whatever the future, it is reasonable to conclude that American
primacy on the Eurasian continent will be buffeted by turbulence and
perhaps at least by sporadic violence. America’s primacy is potentially
vulnerable to new challenges, either from regional contenders or novel
constellations. The currently dominant American global system, within
which “the threat of war is off the table,” is likely to be stable only
in those parts of the world in which American primacy, guided by a
long-term geostrategy, rests on compatible and congenial sociopolitical
systems, linked together by American-dominated multilateral
frameworks.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 3</p>
<p>The Democratic Bridgehead</p>
<p>EUROPE IS AMERICA’S NATURAL ALLY. It shares the same values;
partakes, in the main, of the same religious heritage; practices the
same democratic politics; and is the original homeland of a large
majority of Americans. By pioneering in the integration of nation-states
into a shared supranational economic and eventually political union,
Europe is also pointing the way toward larger forms of postnational
organization, beyond the narrow visions and the destructive passions of
the age of nationalism. It is already the most multilaterally organized
region of the world (see chart on page 58). Success in its political
unification would create a single entity of about 400 million people,
living under a democratic roof and enjoying a standard of living
comparable to that of the United States. Such a Europe would inevitably
be a global power.</p>
<p>Europe also serves as the springboard for the progressive expansion
of democracy deeper into Eurasia. Europe’s expansion eastward would
consolidate the democratic victory of the 1990s. It would match on the
political and economic plane the essential civilizational scope of
Europe—what has been called the Petrine Europe—as defined by Europe’s
ancient and common religious heritage, derived from Western-rite
Christianity. Such a Europe once existed, long before the age of
nationalism and even longer before the recent division of Europe into
its American- and Soviet-dominated halves. Such a larger Europe would be
able to exercise a magnetic attraction on the states located even
farther east, building a network of ties with Ukraine, Belarus, and
Russia, drawing them into increasingly binding cooperation while
proselytizing common democratic principles. Eventually, such a Europe
could become one of the vital pillars of an American-sponsored larger
Eurasian structure of security and cooperation.</p>
<p>European Organizations</p>
<p>But first of all, Europe is America’s essential geopolitical
bridgehead on the Eurasian continent. America’s geostrategic stake in
Europe is enormous. Unlike America’s links with Japan, the Atlantic
alliance entrenches American political influence and military power
directly on the Eurasian mainland. At this stage of American-European
relations, with the allied European nations still highly dependent on
U.S. security protection, any expansion in the scope of Europe becomes
automatically an expansion in the scope of direct U.S. influence as
well. Conversely, without close transatlantic ties, America’s primacy in
Eurasia promptly fades away. U.S. control over the Atlantic Ocean and
the ability to project influence and power deeper into Eurasia would be
severely circumscribed.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that a truly European “Europe” as such does
not exist. It is a vision, a concept, and a goal, but it is not yet
reality. Western Europe is already a common market, but it is still far
from being a single political entity. A political Europe has yet to
emerge. The crisis in Bosnia offered painful proof of Europe’s continued
absence, if proof were still needed. The brutal fact is that Western
Europe, and increasingly also Central Europe, remains largely an
American protectorate, with its allied states reminiscent of ancient
vassals and tributaries. This is not a healthy condition, either for
America or for the European nations.</p>
<p>Matters are made worse by a more pervasive decline in Europe’s
internal vitality. Both the legitimacy of the existing socioeconomic
system and even the surfacing sense of European identity appear to be
vulnerable. In a number of European states, one can detect a crisis of
confidence and a loss of creative momentum, as well as an inward
perspective that is both isolationist and escapist from the larger
dilemmas of the world. It is not clear whether most Europeans even want
Europe to be a major power and whether they are prepared to do what is
needed for it to become one. Even residual European anti-Americanism,
currently quite weak, is curiously cynical: the Europeans deplore
American “hegemony” but take comfort in being sheltered by it.</p>
<p>The political momentum for Europe’s unification was once driven by
three main impulses: the memories of the destructive two world wars, the
desire for economic recovery, and the insecurity generated by the Soviet
threat. By the mid-nineties, however, these impulses had faded. Economic
recovery by and large has been achieved; if anything, the problem Europe
increasingly faces is that of an excessively burdensome welfare system
that is sapping its economic vitality, while the passionate resistance
to any reform by special interests is diverting European political
attention inward. The Soviet threat has disappeared, while the desire of
some Europeans to gain independence from American tutelage has not
translated into a compelling impulse for continental unification.</p>
<p>The European cause has been increasingly sustained by the
bureaucratic momentum generated by the large institutional machinery
created by the European Community and its successor, the European Union.
The idea of unity still enjoys significant popular support, but it tends
to be lukewarm, lacking in passion and a sense of mission. In general,
the Western Europe of today conveys the impression of a troubled,
unfocused, comfortable yet socially uneasy set of societies, not
partaking of any larger vision. European unification is increasingly a
process and not a cause.</p>
<p>Still, the political elites of two leading European nations—France
and Germany—remain largely committed to the goal of shaping and defining
a Europe that would truly be Europe. They are thus Europe’s principal
architects. Working together, they could construct a Europe worthy of
its past and of its potential. But each is committed to a somewhat
different vision and design, and neither is strong enough to prevail by
itself.</p>
<p>This condition creates for the United States a special opportunity
for decisive intervention. It necessitates American engagement on behalf
of Europe’s unity, for otherwise unification could grind to a halt and
then gradually even be undone. But any effective American involvement in
Europe’s construction has to be guided by clarity in American thinking
regarding what kind of Europe America prefers and is ready to promote—an
equal partner or a junior ally—and regarding the eventual scope of both
the European Union and NATO. It also requires careful management of
Europe’s two principal architects.</p>
