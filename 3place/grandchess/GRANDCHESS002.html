<h4 id="the-first-global-power">THE FIRST GLOBAL POWER</h4>
<p>The collapse of its rival left the United States in a unique
position. It became simultaneously the first and the only truly global
power. And yet America’s global supremacy is reminiscent in some ways of
earlier empires, notwithstanding their more confined regional scope.
These empires based their power on a hierarchy of vassals, tributaries,
protectorates, and colonies, with those on the outside generally viewed
as barbarians. To some degree, that anachronistic terminology is not
altogether inappropriate for some of the states currently within the
American orbit. As in the past, the exercise of American “imperial”
power is derived in large measure from superior organization, from the
ability to mobilize vast economic and technological resources promptly
for military purposes, from the vague but significant cultural appeal of
the American way of life, and from the sheer dynamism and inherent
competitiveness of the American social and political elites.</p>
<p>Earlier empires, too, partook of these attributes. Rome comes first
to mind. Its empire was established over roughly two and a half
centuries through sustained territorial expansion northward and then
both westward and southeastward, as well as through the assertion of
effective maritime control over the entire shoreline of the
Mediterranean Sea. In geographic scope, it reached its high point around
the year A.D. 211 (see map on page 11). Rome’s was a centralized polity
and a single self-sufficient economy. Its imperial power was exercised
deliberately and purposefully through a complex system of political and
economic organization. A strategically designed system of roads and
naval routes, originating from the capital city, permitted the rapid
redeployment and concentration—in the event of a major security
threat—of the Roman legions stationed in the various vassal states and
tributary provinces.</p>
<p>At the empire’s apex, the Roman legions deployed abroad numbered no
less than three hundred thousand men—a remarkable force, made all the
more lethal by the Roman superiority in tactics and armaments as well as
by the center’s ability to direct relatively rapid redeployment. (It is
striking to note that in 1996, the vastly more populous supreme power,
America, was protecting the outer reaches of its dominion by stationing
296,000 professional soldiers overseas.)</p>
<p>Rome’s imperial power, however, was also derived from an important
psychological reality. Civis Romanus sum—“I am a Roman citizen”—was the
highest possible self-definition, a source of pride, and an aspiration
for many. Eventually granted even to those not of Roman birth, the
exalted status of the Roman citizen was an expression of cultural
superiority that justified the imperial power’s sense of mission. It not
only legitimated Rome’s rule, but it also inclined those subject to it
to desire assimilation and inclusion in the imperial structure. Cultural
superiority, taken for granted by the rulers and conceded by the
subjugated, thus reinforced imperial power.</p>
<p>That supreme, and largely uncontested, imperial power lasted about
three hundred years. With the exception of the challenge posed at one
stage by nearby Carthage and on the eastern fringes by the Parthian
Empire, the outside world was largely barbaric, not well organized,
capable for most of the time only of sporadic attacks, and culturally
patently inferior. As long as the empire was able to maintain internal
vitality and unity, the outside world was noncompetitive.</p>
<p>Three major causes led to the eventual collapse of the Roman Empire.
First, the empire became too large to be governed from a single center,
but splitting it into western and eastern halves automatically destroyed
the monopolistic character of its power. Second, at the same time, the
prolonged period of imperial hubris generated a cultural hedonism that
gradually sapped the political elite’s will to greatness. Third,
sustained inflation also undermined the capacity of the system to
sustain itself without social sacrifice, which the citizens were no
longer prepared to make. Cultural decay, political division, and
financial inflation conspired to make Rome vulnerable even to the
barbarians in its near abroad.</p>
<p>By contemporary standards, Rome was not truly a global power but a
regional one. However, given the sense of isolation prevailing at the
time between the various continents of the globe, its regional power was
self-contained and isolated, with no immediate or even distant rival.
The Roman Empire was thus a world unto itself, with its superior
political organization and cultural superiority making it a precursor of
later imperial systems of even greater geographic scope.</p>
<p>Even so, the Roman Empire was not unique. The Roman and the Chinese
empires emerged almost contemporaneously, though neither was aware of
the other. By the year 221 B.C. (the time of the Punic Wars between Rome
and Carthage), the unification by Chin’ of the existing seven states
into the first Chinese empire had prompted the construction of the Great
Wall in northern China, to seal off the inner kingdom from the barbarian
world beyond. The subsequent Han Empire, which had started to emerge by
140 B.C., was even more impressive in scope and organization. By the
onset of the Christian era, no fewer than 57 million people were subject
to its authority. That huge number, itself unprecedented, testified to
extraordinarily effective central control, exercised through a
centralized and punitive bureaucracy. Imperial sway extended to today’s
Korea, parts of Mongolia, and most of today’s coastal China. However,
rather like Rome, the Han Empire also became afflicted by internal ills,
and its eventual collapse was accelerated by its division in A.D. 220
into three independent realms.</p>
<p>China’s further history involved cycles of reunification and
expansion, followed by decay and fragmentation. More than once, China
succeeded in establishing imperial systems that were self-contained,
isolated, and unchallenged externally by any organized rivals. The
tripartite division of the Han realm was reversed in A.D. 589, with
something akin to an imperial system reemerging. But the period of
China’s greatest imperial self-assertion came under the Manchus,
specifically during the early Ch’ing dynasty. By the eighteenth century,
China was once again a full-fledged empire, with the imperial center
surrounded by vassal and tributary states, including today’s Korea,
Indochina, Thailand, Burma, and Nepal. China’s sway thus extended from
today’s Russian Far East all the way across southern Siberia to Lake
Baikal and into contemporary Kazakstan, then southward toward the Indian
Ocean, and then back east across Laos and northern Vietnam (see map on
page 14).</p>
<p>As in the Roman case, the empire was a complex financial, economic,
educational, and security organization. Control over the large territory
and the more than 300 million people living within it was exercised
through all these means, with a strong emphasis on centralized political
authority, supported by a remarkably effective courier service. The
entire empire was demarcated into four zones, radiating from Peking and
delimiting areas that could be reached by courier within one week, two
weeks, three weeks, and four weeks, respectively. A centralized
bureaucracy, professionally trained and competitively selected, provided
the sinews of unity.</p>
<p>That unity was reinforced, legitimated, and sustained—again, as in
the case of Rome—by a strongly felt and deeply ingrained sense of
cultural superiority that was augmented by Confucianism, an imperially
expedient philosophy, with its stress on harmony, hierarchy, and
discipline. China—the Celestial Empire—was seen as the center of the
universe, with only barbarians on its peripheries and beyond. To be
Chinese meant to be cultured, and for that reason, the rest of the world
owed China its due deference. That special sense of superiority
permeated the response given by the Chinese emperor—even in the phase of
China’s growing decline, in the late eighteenth century—to King George
III of Great Britain, whose emissaries had attempted to inveigle China
into a trading relationship by offering some British industrial products
as goodwill gifts:</p>
<p>We, by the Grace of Heaven, Emperor, instruct the King of England to
take note of our charge:</p>
<p>The Celestial Empire, ruling all within the four seas . . . does not
value rare and precious things . . . nor do we have the slightest need
of your country’s manufactures….</p>
<p>Hence we . . . have commanded your tribute envoys to return safely
home. You, O King, should simply act in conformity with our wishes by
strengthening your loyalty and swearing perpetual obedience.</p>
<p>The decline and fall of the several Chinese empires was also
primarily due to internal factors. Mongol and later occidental
“barbarians” prevailed because internal fatigue, decay, hedonism, and
loss of economic as well as military creativity sapped and then
accelerated the collapse of Chinese will. Outside powers exploited
China’s internal malaise—Britain in the Opium War of 1839–1842, Japan a
century later—which, in turn, generated the profound sense of cultural
humiliation that has motivated the Chinese throughout the twentieth
century, a humiliation all the more intense because of the collision
between their ingrained sense of cultural superiority and the demeaning
political realities of postimperial China.</p>
<p>Much as in the case of Rome, imperial China would be classified today
as a regional power. But in its heyday, China had no global peer, in the
sense that no other power was capable of challenging its imperial status
or even of resisting its further expansion if that had been the Chinese
inclination. The Chinese system was self-contained and self-sustaining,
based primarily on a shared ethnic identity, with relatively limited
projection of central power over ethnically alien and geographically
peripheral tributaries.</p>
<p>The large and dominant ethnic core made it possible for China to
achieve periodic imperial restoration. In that respect, China was quite
unlike other empires, in which numerically small but hege-monically
motivated peoples were able for a time to impose and maintain domination
over much larger ethnically alien populations. However, once the
domination of such small-core empires was undermined, imperial
restoration was out of the question.</p>
<p>To find a somewhat closer analogy to today’s definition of a global
power, we must turn to the remarkable phenomenon of the Mongol Empire.
Its emergence was achieved through an intense struggle with major and
well-organized opponents. Among those defeated were the kingdoms of
Poland and Hungary, the forces of the Holy Roman Empire, several Russian
and Rus’ principalities, the Caliphate of Baghdad, and later, even the
Sung dynasty of China.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan and his successors, by defeating their regional rivals,
established centralized control over the territory that latter-day
scholars of geopolitics have identified as the global heartland, or the
pivot for world power. Their Eurasian continental empire ranged from the
shores of the China Sea to Anatolia in Asia Minor and to Central Europe
(see map). It was not until the heyday of the Stalinist Sino-Soviet bloc
that the Mongol Empire on the Eurasian continent was finally matched,
insofar as the scope of centralized control over contiguous territory is
concerned.</p>
<p>The Roman, Chinese, and Mongol empires were regional precursors of
subsequent aspirants to global power. In the case of Rome and China, as
already noted, their imperial structures were highly developed, both
politically and economically, while the widespread acceptance of the
cultural superiority of the center exercised an important cementing
role. In contrast, the Mongol Empire sustained political control by
relying more directly on military conquest followed by adaptation (and
even assimilation) to local conditions.</p>
<p>Mongol imperial power was largely based on military domination.
Achieved through the brilliant and ruthless application of superior
military tactics that combined a remarkable capacity for rapid movement
of forces with their timely concentration, Mongol rule entailed no
organized economic or financial system, nor was Mongol authority derived
from any assertive sense of cultural superiority. The Mongol rulers were
too thin numerically to represent a self-regenerating ruling class, and
in any case, the absence of a defined and self-conscious sense of
cultural or even ethnic superiority deprived the imperial elite of the
needed subjective confidence.</p>
<p>In fact, the Mongol rulers proved quite susceptible to gradual
assimilation by the often culturally more advanced peoples they had
conquered. Thus, one of the grandsons of Genghis Khan, who had become
the emperor of the Chinese part of the great Khan’s realm, became a
fervent propagator of Confucianism; another became a devout Muslim in
his capacity as the sultan of Persia; and a third became the culturally
Persian ruler of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It was that factor—assimilation of the rulers by the ruled because of
the absence of a dominant political culture—as well as unresolved
problems of succession to the great Khan who had founded the empire,
that caused the empire’s eventual demise. The Mongol realm had become
too big to be governed from a single center, but the solution
attempted—dividing the empire into several self-contained parts—prompted
still more rapid local assimilation and accelerated the imperial
disintegration. After lasting two centuries, from 1206 to 1405, the
world’s largest land-based empire disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Europe became both the locus of global power and the
focus of the main struggles for global power. Indeed, in the course of
approximately three centuries, the small northwestern periphery of the
Eurasian continent attained—through the projection of maritime power and
for the first time ever—genuine global domination as European power
reached, and asserted itself on, every continent of the globe. It is
noteworthy that the Western European imperial hegemons were
demographically not very numerous, especially when compared to the
numbers effectively subjugated. Yet by the beginning of the twentieth
century, outside of the Western Hemisphere (which two centuries earlier
had also been subject to Western European control and which was
inhabited predominantly by European emigrants and their descendants),
only China, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Ethiopia were free of
Western Europe’s domination (see map on page 18).</p>
<p>However, Western European domination was not tantamount to the
attainment of global power by Western Europe. The essential reality was
that of Europe’s civilizational global supremacy and of fragmented
European continental power. Unlike the land conquest of the Eurasian
heartland by the Mongols or by the subsequent Russian Empire, European
overseas imperialism was attained through ceaseless transoceanic
exploration and the expansion of maritime trade. This process, however,
also involved a continuous struggle among the leading European states
not only for the overseas dominions but for hegemony within Europe
itself. The geopolitically consequential fact was that Europe’s global
hegemony did not derive from hegemony in Europe by any single European
power.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, until the middle of the seventeenth century, Spain
was the paramount European power. By the late fifteenth century, it had
also emerged as a major overseas imperial power, entertaining global
ambitions. Religion served as a unifying doctrine and as a source of
imperial missionary zeal. Indeed, it took papal arbitration between
Spain and its maritime rival, Portugal, to codify a formal division of
the world into Spanish and Portuguese colonial spheres in the Treaties
of Tordesilla (1494) and Saragossa (1529). Nonetheless, faced by
English, French, and Dutch challenges, Spain was never able to assert
genuine supremacy, either in Western Europe itself or across the
oceans.</p>
<p>Spain’s preeminence gradually gave way to that of France. Until 1815,
France was the dominant European power, though continuously checked by
its European rivals, both on the continent and overseas. Under Napoleon,
France came close to establishing true hegemony over Europe. Had it
succeeded, it might have also gained the status of the dominant global
power. However, its defeat by a European coalition reestablished the
continental balance of power.</p>
<p>For the next century, until World War I, Great Britain exercised
global maritime domination as London became the world’s principal
financial and trading center and the British navy “ruled the waves.”
Great Britain was clearly paramount overseas, but like the earlier
European aspirants to global hegemony, the British Empire could not
single-handedly dominate Europe. Instead, Britain relied on an intricate
balance-of-power diplomacy and eventually on an Anglo-French entente to
prevent continental domination by either Russia or Germany.</p>
<p>The overseas British Empire was initially acquired through a
combination of exploration, trade, and conquest. But much like its Roman
and Chinese predecessors or its French and Spanish rivals, it also
derived a great deal of its staying power from the perception of British
cultural superiority. That superiority was not only a matter of
subjective arrogance on the part of the imperial ruling class but was a
perspective shared by many of the non-British subjects. In the words of
South Africa’s first black president, Nelson Mandela: “I was brought up
in a British school, and at the time Britain was the home of everything
that was best in the world. I have not discarded the influence which
Britain and British history and culture exercised on us.” Cultural
superiority, successfully asserted and quietly conceded, had the effect
of reducing the need to rely on large military forces to maintain the
power of the imperial center. By 1914, only a few thousand British
military personnel and civil servants controlled about 11 million square
miles and almost 400 million non-British peoples (see map on page
20).</p>
<p>In brief, Rome exercised its sway largely through superior military
organization and cultural appeal. China relied heavily on an efficient
bureaucracy to rule an empire based on shared ethnic identity,
reinforcing its control through a highly developed sense of cultural
superiority. The Mongol Empire combined advanced military tactics for
conquest with an inclination toward assimilation as the basis for rule.
The British (as well as the Spanish, Dutch, and French) gained
preeminence as their flag followed their trade, their control likewise
reinforced by superior military organization and cultural assertiveness.
But none of these empires were truly global. Even Great Britain was not
a truly global power. It did not control Europe but only balanced it. A
stable Europe was crucial to British international preeminence, and
Europe’s self-destruction inevitably marked the end of British
primacy.</p>
<p>In contrast, the scope and pervasiveness of American global power
today are unique. Not only does the United States control all of the
world’s oceans and seas, but it has developed an assertive military
capability for amphibious shore control that enables it to project its
power inland in politically significant ways. Its military legions are
firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia, and
they also control the Persian Gulf. American vassals and tributaries,
some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington, dot
the entire Eurasian continent, as the map on page 22 shows.</p>
<p>America’s economic dynamism provides the necessary precondition for
the exercise of global primacy. Initially, immediately after World War
II, America’s economy stood apart from all others, accounting alone for
more than 50 percent of the world’s GNP. The economic recovery of
Western Europe and Japan, followed by the wider phenomenon of Asia’s
economic dynamism, meant that the American share of global GNP
eventually had to shrink from the disproportionately high levels of the
immediate postwar era. Nonetheless, by the time the subsequent Cold War
had ended, America’s share of global GNP, and more specifically its
share of the world’s manufacturing output, had stabilized at about 30
percent, a level that had been the norm for most of this century, apart
from those exceptional years immediately after World War II.</p>
<p>More important, America has maintained and has even widened its lead
in exploiting the latest scientific breakthroughs for military purposes,
thereby creating a technologically peerless military establishment, the
only one with effective global reach. All the while, it has maintained
its strong competitive advantage in the economically decisive
information technologies. American mastery in the cutting-edge sectors
of tomorrow’s economy suggests that American technological domination is
not likely to be undone soon, especially given that in the economically
decisive fields, Americans are maintaining or even widening their
advantage in productivity over their Western European and Japanese
rivals.</p>
<p>To be sure, Russia and China are powers that resent this American
hegemony. In early 1996, they jointly stated as much in the course of a
visit to Beijing by Russia’s President Boris Yeltsin. Moreover, they
possess nuclear arsenals that could threaten vital U.S. interests. But
the brutal fact is that for the time being, and for some time to come,
although they can initiate a suicidal nuclear war, neither one of them
can win it. Lacking the ability to project forces over long distances in
order to impose their political will and being technologically much more
backward than America, they do not have the means to exercise—nor soon
attain—sustained political clout worldwide.</p>
<p>In brief, America stands supreme in the four decisive domains of
global power: militarily, it has an unmatched global reach;
economically, it remains the main locomotive of global growth, even if
challenged in some aspects by Japan and Germany (neither of which enjoys
the other attributes of global might); technologically, it retains the
overall lead in the cutting-edge areas of innovation; and culturally,
despite some crassness, it enjoys an appeal that is unrivaled,
especially among the world’s youth—all of which gives the United States
a political clout that no other state comes close to matching. It is the
combination of all four that makes America the only comprehensive global
superpower.</p>
