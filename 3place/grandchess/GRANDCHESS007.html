<h4 id="grandeur-and-redemption">GRANDEUR AND REDEMPTION</h4>
<p>France seeks reincarnation as Europe; Germany hopes for redemption
through Europe. These varying motivations go a long way toward
explaining and defining the substance of the alternative French and
German designs for Europe.</p>
<p>For France, Europe is the means for regaining France’s past
greatness. Even before World War II, serious French thinkers on
international affairs already worried about the progressive decline of
Europe’s centrality in world affairs. During the several decades of the
Cold War, that worry turned into resentment over the “Anglo-Saxon”
domination of the West, not to speak of contempt for the related
“Americanization” of Western culture. The creation of a genuine
Europe—in Charles De Gaulle’s words, “from the Atlantic to the
Urals”—was to remedy that deplorable state of affairs. And such a
Europe, since it would be led by Paris, would simultaneously regain for
France the grandeur that the French still feel remains their nation’s
special destiny.</p>
<p>For Germany, a commitment to Europe is the basis for national
redemption, while an intimate connection to America is central to its
security. Accordingly, a Europe more assertively independent of America
is not a viable option. For Germany, redemption + security = Europe +
America. That formula defines Germany’s posture and policy, making
Germany simultaneously Europe’s truly good citizen and America’s
strongest European supporter.</p>
<p>Germany sees in its fervent commitment to Europe a historical
cleansing, a restoration of its moral and political credentials. By
redeeming itself through Europe, Germany is restoring its own greatness
while gaining a mission that would not automatically mobilize European
resentments and fears against Germany. If Germans seek the German
national interest, that runs the risk of alienating other Europeans; if
Germans promote Europe’s common interest, that garners European support
and respect.</p>
<p>On the central issues of the Cold War, France was a loyal, dedicated,
and determined ally. It stood shoulder to shoulder with America when the
chips were down. Whether during the two Berlin blockades or during the
Cuban missile crisis, there was no doubt about French steadfastness. But
France’s support for NATO was tempered by a simultaneous French desire
to assert a separate French political identity and to preserve for
France its essential freedom of action, especially on matters that
pertained to France’s global status or to the future of Europe.</p>
<p>There is an element of delusional obsession in the French political
elite’s preoccupation with the notion that France is still a global
power. When Prime Minister Alain Juppé, echoing his predecessors,
declared to the National Assembly in May 1995 that “France can and must
assert its vocation as a world power,” the gathering broke out into
spontaneous applause. The French insistence on the development of its
own nuclear deterrent was motivated largely by the view that France
would thereby enhance its own freedom of action and at the same time
gain the capacity to influence American life-and-death decisions
regarding the security of the Western alliance as a whole. It was not
vis-à-vis the Soviet Union that France sought to upgrade its status, for
the French nuclear deterrent had, at the very best, only a marginal
impact on Soviet war-making capabilities. Paris felt instead that its
own nuclear weapons would give France a role in the Cold War’s top-level
and most dangerous decision-making processes.</p>
<p>In French thinking, the possession of nuclear weapons fortified
France’s claim to being a global power, of having a voice that had to be
respected worldwide. It tangibly reinforced France’s position as one of
the five veto-wielding UN Security Council members, all five also
nuclear powers. In the French perspective, the British nuclear deterrent
was simply an extension of the American, especially given the British
commitment to the special relationship and the British abstention from
the effort to construct an independent Europe. (That the French nuclear
program significantly benefited from covert U.S. assistance was, to the
French, of no consequence for France’s strategic calculus.) The French
nuclear deterrent also consolidated, in the French mindset, France’s
commanding position as the leading continental power, the only truly
European state so endowed.</p>
<p>France’s global ambitions were also expressed through its determined
efforts to sustain a special security role in most of the Francophone
African countries. Despite the loss, after prolonged combat, of Vietnam
and Algeria and the abandonment of a wider empire, that security
mission, as well as continued French control over scattered Pacific
islands (which have provided the venue for controversial French atomic
tests), has reinforced the conviction of the French elite that France,
indeed, still has a global role to play, despite the reality of being
essentially a middle-rank postimperial European power.</p>
<p>All of the foregoing has sustained as well as motivated France’s
claim to the mantle of European leadership. With Britain
self-marginalized and essentially an appendage to U.S. power and with
Germany divided for much of the Cold War and still handicapped by its
twentieth-century history, France could seize the idea of Europe,
identify itself with it, and usurp it as identical with France’s
conception of itself. The country that first invented the idea of the
sovereign nation-state and made nationalism into a civic religion thus
found it quite natural to see itself—with the same emotional commitment
that was once invested in “la patrie”—as the embodiment of an
independent but united Europe. The grandeur of a French-led Europe would
then be France’s as well.</p>
<p>This special vocation, generated by a deeply felt sense of historical
destiny and fortified by a unique cultural pride, has major policy
implications. The key geopolitical space that France had to keep within
its orbit of influence—or, at least, prevent from being dominated by a
more powerful state than itself—can be drawn on the map in the form of a
semicircle. It includes the Iberian Peninsula, the northern shore of the
western Mediterranean, and Germany up to East-Central Europe (see map on
page 64). That is not only the minimal radius of French security; it is
also the essential zone of French political interest. Only with the
support of the southern states assured, and with Germany’s backing
guaranteed, can the goal of constructing a unified and independent
Europe, led by France, be effectively pursued. And obviously, within
that geopolitical orbit, the increasingly powerful Germany is bound to
be the most difficult to manage.</p>
<p>In the French vision, the central goal of a united and independent
Europe can be achieved by combining the unification of Europe under
French leadership with the simultaneous but gradual diminution of the
American primacy on the continent. But if France is to shape Europe’s
future, it must both engage and shackle Germany, while also seeking
step-by-step to strip Washington of its political leadership in European
affairs. The resulting key policy dilemmas for France are essentially
twofold: how to preserve the American security commitment to
Europe—which France recognizes is still essential—while steadily
reducing the American presence; and how to sustain Franco-German
partnership as the combined political-economic engine of European
unification while precluding German leadership in Europe.</p>
<p>If France were truly a global power, the resolution of these dilemmas
in the pursuit of France’s central goal might not be difficult. None of
the other European states, save Germany, are endowed with the same
ambition or driven by the same sense of mission. Even Germany could
perhaps be seduced into acceptance of French leadership in a united but
independent (of America) Europe, but only if it felt that France was in
fact a global power and could thus provide Europe with the security that
Germany cannot but America does.</p>
<p>Germany, however, knows the real limits of French power. France is
much weaker than Germany economically, while its military establishment
(as the Gulf War of 1991 showed) is not very competent. It is good
enough to squash internal coups in satellite African states, but it can
neither protect Europe nor project significant power far from Europe.
France is no more and no less than a middle-rank European power.
Accordingly, in order to construct Europe, Germany has been willing to
propitiate French pride, but in order to keep Europe truly secure, it
has not been willing to follow French leadership blindly. It has
continued to insist on a central role in European security for
America.</p>
<p>That reality, painful for French self-esteem, emerged more clearly
after Germany’s reunification. Until then, the Franco-German
reconciliation did have the appearance of French political leadership
riding comfortably on German economic dynamism. That perception actually
suited both parties. It mitigated the traditional European fears of
Germany, and it had the effect of fortifying and gratifying French
illusions by generating the impression that the construction of Europe
was led by France, backed by an economically dynamic West Germany.</p>
<p>Franco-German reconciliation, even with its misconceptions, was
nonetheless a positive development for Europe, and its importance cannot
be overstated. It has provided the crucial foundation for all of the
progress so far achieved in Europe’s difficult process of unification.
Thus, it was also fully compatible with American interests and in
keeping with the long-standing American commitment to the promotion of
transnational cooperation in Europe. A breakdown of Franco-German
cooperation would be a fatal setback for Europe and a disaster for
America’s position in Europe.</p>
<p>Tacit American support made it possible for France and Germany to
push the process of Europe’s unification forward. Germany’s
reunification, moreover, increased the incentive for the French to lock
Germany into a binding European framework. Thus, on December 6, 1990,
the French president and the German chancellor committed themselves to
the goal of a federal Europe, and ten days later, the Rome
intergovernmental conference on political union issued—British
reservations notwithstanding—a clear mandate to the twelve foreign
ministers of the European Community to prepare a Draft Treaty on
Political Union.</p>
<p>However, Germany’s reunification also dramatically changed the real
parameters of European politics. It was simultaneously a geopolitical
defeat for Russia and for France. United Germany not only ceased to be a
political junior partner of France, but it automatically became the
undisputed prime power in Western Europe and even a partial global
power, especially through its major financial contributions to the
support of the key international institutions. 6 The new reality bred
some mutual disenchantment in the Franco-German relationship, for
Germany was now able and willing to articulate and openly promote its
own vision of a future Europe, still as France’s partner but no longer
as its protégé.</p>
<p>For France, the resulting diminished political leverage dictated
several policy consequences. France somehow had to regain greater
influence within NATO—from which it had largely abstained as a protest
against U.S. domination—while also compensating for its relative
weakness through greater diplomatic maneuver. Returning to NATO might
enable France to influence America more; occasional flirtation with
Moscow or London might generate pressure from the outside on America as
well as on Germany.</p>
<p>Consequently, as part of its policy of maneuver rather than
contestation, France returned to NATO’s command structure. By 1994,
France was again a de facto active participant in NATO’s political and
military decision making; by late 1995, the French foreign and defense
ministers were again regular attendees at alliance sessions. But at a
price: once fully inside, they reaffirmed their determination to reform
the alliance’s structure in order to make for greater balance between
its American leadership and its European participation. They wanted a
higher profile and a bigger role for a collective European component. As
the French foreign minister, Hervé de Charette, stated in a speech on
April 8, 1996, “For France, the basic goal 〔of the rapprochement〕 is
to assert a European identity within the alliance that is operationally
credible and politically visible.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Paris was quite prepared to exploit tactically its
traditional links with Russia to constrain America’s European policy and
to resuscitate whenever expedient the old Franco-British entente to
offset Germany’s growing European primacy. The French foreign minister
came close to saying so explicitly in August 1996, when he declared that
“if France wants to play an international role, it stands to benefit
from the existence of a strong Russia, from helping it to reaffirm
itself as a major power,” prompting the Russian foreign minister to
reciprocate by stating that “of all the world leaders, the French are
the closest to having constructive attitudes in their relations with
Russia.”7</p>
<p>France’s initially lukewarm support for NATO’s eastward
expansion—indeed, a barely suppressed skepticism regarding its
desirability—was thus partially a tactic designed to gain leverage in
dealing with the United States. Precisely because America and Germany
were the chief proponents of NATO expansion, it suited France to play
cool, to go along reticently, to voice concern regarding the potential
impact of that initiative on Russia, and to act as Europe’s most
sensitive interlocutor with Moscow. To some Central Europeans, it
appeared that the French even conveyed the impression that they were not
averse to a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. The Russian
card thus not only balanced America and conveyed a none-too-subtle
message to Germany, but it also increased the pressure on the United
States to consider favorably French proposals for NATO reform.</p>
<p>Ultimately, NATO expansion will require unanimity among the
alliance’s sixteen members. Paris knew that its acquiescence was not
only vital for that unanimity but that France’s actual support was
needed to avoid obstruction from other alliance members. Thus, it made
no secret of the French intention to make support for NATO expansion a
hostage to America’s eventually satisfying the French determination to
alter both the balance of power within the alliance and its fundamental
organization.</p>
<p>France was at first similarly tepid in its support for the eastward
expansion of the European Union. Here the lead was taken largely by
Germany, with American support but without the same degree of U.S.
engagement as in the case of NATO expansion. Even though in NATO France
tended to argue that the EU’s expansion would provide a more suitable
umbrella for the former Communist states, as soon as Germany started
pressing for the more rapid enlargement of the EU to include Central
Europe, France began to raise technical concerns and also to demand that
the EU pay equal attention to Europe’s exposed Mediterranean southern
flank. (These differences emerged as early as the November 1994
Franco-German summit.) French emphasis on the latter issue also had the
effect of gaining for France the support of NATO’s southern members,
thereby maximizing France’s overall bargaining power. But the cost was a
widening gap in the respective geopolitical visions of Europe held by
France and Germany, a gap only partially narrowed by France’s belated
endorsement in the second half of 1996 of Poland’s accession to both
NATO and the EU.</p>
<p>That gap was inevitable, given the changing historical context. Ever
since the end of World War II, democratic Germany had recognized that
Franco-German reconciliation was required to build a European community
within the western half of divided Europe. That reconciliation was also
central to Germany’s historical rehabilitation. Hence, the acceptance of
French leadership was a fair price to pay. At the same time, the
continued Soviet threat to a vulnerable West Germany made loyalty to
America the essential precondition for survival—and even the French
recognized that. But after the Soviet collapse, to build a larger and
more united Europe, subordination to France was neither necessary nor
propitious. An equal Franco-German partnership, with the reunified
Germany in fact now being the stronger partner, was more than a fair
deal for Paris; hence, the French would simply have to accept Germany’s
preference for a primary security link with its transatlantic ally and
protector.</p>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, that link assumed new importance for
Germany. In the past, it had sheltered Germany from an external but very
proximate threat and was the necessary precondition for the eventual
reunification of the country. With the Soviet Union gone and Germany
reunified, the link to America now provided the umbrella under which
Germany could more openly assume a leadership role in Central Europe
without simultaneously threatening its neighbors. The American
connection provided more than the certificate of good behavior: it
reassured Germany’s neighbors that a close relationship with Germany
also meant a closer relationship with America. All of that made it
easier for Germany to define more openly its own geopolitical
priorities.</p>
<p>Germany—safely anchored in Europe and rendered harmless but secure by
the visible American military presence—could now promote the
assimilation of the newly freed Central Europe into the European
structures. It would not be the old Mitteleuropa of German imperialism
but a more benign community of economic renewal stimulated by German
investments and trade, with Germany also acting as the sponsor of the
eventually formal inclusion of the new Mitteleuropa in both the European
Union and NATO. With the Franco-German alliance providing the vital
platform for the assertion of a more decisive regional role, Germany no
longer needed to be shy in asserting itself within an orbit of its
special interest.</p>
<p>On the map of Europe, the zone of German special interest could be
sketched in the shape of an oblong, in the West including of course
France and in the East spanning the newly emancipated post-Communist
states of Central Europe, including the Baltic republics, embracing
Ukraine and Belarus, and reaching even into Russia (see map on page 64).
In many respects, that zone corresponds to the historical radius of
constructive German cultural influence, carved out in the prenationalist
era by German urban and agricultural colonists in East-Central Europe
and in the Baltic republics, all of whom were wiped out in the course of
World War II. More important, the areas of special concern to the French
(discussed earlier) and the Germans, when viewed together as in the map
below, in effect define the western and eastern limits of Europe, while
the overlap between them underlines the decisive geopolitical importance
of the Franco-German connection as the vital core of Europe.</p>
<p>The critical breakthrough for the more openly assertive German role
in Central Europe was provided by the German-Polish reconciliation that
occurred during the mid-nineties. Despite some initial reluctance, the
reunited Germany (with American prodding) did formally recognize as
permanent the Oder-Neisse border with Poland, and that step in turn
removed the single most important Polish reservation regarding a closer
relationship with Germany. Following some further mutual gestures of
goodwill and forgiveness, the relationship underwent a dramatic change.
Not only did German-Polish trade literally explode (in 1995 Poland
superseded Russia as Germany’s largest trading partner in the East), but
Germany became Poland’s principal sponsor for membership in the EU and
(together with the United States) in NATO. It is no exaggeration to say
that by the middle of the decade, Polish-German reconciliation was
assuming a geopolitical importance in Central Europe matching the
earlier impact on Western Europe of the Franco-German
reconciliation.</p>
<p>Through Poland, German influence could radiate northward—into the
Baltic states—and eastward—into Ukraine and Belarus. Moreover, the scope
of the German-Polish reconciliation was somewhat widened by Poland’s
occasional inclusion in important Franco-German discussions regarding
Europe’s future. The so-called Weimar Triangle (named after the German
city in which the first high-level trilateral Franco-German-Polish
consultations, which subsequently became periodic, had taken place)
created a potentially significant geopolitical axis on the European
continent, embracing some 180 million people from three nations with a
highly defined sense of national identity. On the one hand, this further
enhanced Germany’s dominant role in Central Europe, but on the other
hand, that role was somewhat balanced by the Franco-Polish participation
in the three-way dialogue.</p>
<p>Central European acceptance of German leadership—and such was even
more the case with the smaller Central European states—was eased by the
very evident German commitment to the eastward expansion of Europe’s key
institutions. In so committing itself, Germany undertook a historical
mission much at variance with some rather deeply rooted Western European
outlooks. In that latter perspective, events occurring east of Germany
and Austria were perceived as somehow beyond the limits of concern to
the real Europe. That attitude—articulated in the early eighteenth
century by Lord Bolingbroke,8 who argued that political violence in the
East was of no consequence to the Western Europeans—resurfaced during
the Munich crisis of 1938; and it made a tragic reappearance in the
British and French attitudes during the conflict of the mid-1990s in
Bosnia. It still lurks beneath the surface in the ongoing debates
regarding the future of Europe.</p>
<p>In contrast, the only real debate in Germany was whether NATO or the
EU should be expanded first—the defense minister favored the former, the
foreign minister advocated the latter—with the net result that Germany
became the undisputed apostle of a larger and more united Europe. The
German chancellor spoke of the year 2000 as the goal for the EU’s first
eastward enlargement, and the German defense minister was among the
first to suggest that the fiftieth anniversary of NATO’s founding was an
appropriately symbolic date for the alliance’s eastern expansion.
Germany’s conception of Europe’s future thus differed from its principal
European allies: the British proclaimed their preference for a larger
Europe because they saw in enlargement the means for diluting Europe’s
unity; the French feared that enlargement would enhance Germany’s role
and hence favored more narrowly based integration. Germany stood for
both and thus gained a standing in Central Europe all its own.</p>
