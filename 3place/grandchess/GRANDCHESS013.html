<h4 id="the-ethnic-cauldron">THE ETHNIC CAULDRON</h4>
<p>The Eurasian Balkans include nine countries that one way or another
fit the foregoing description, with two others as potential candidates.
The nine are Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia—all of them formerly part
of the defunct Soviet Union—as well as Afghanistan. The potential
additions to the list are Turkey and Iran, both of them much more
politically and economically viable, both active contestants for
regional influence within the Eurasian Balkans, and thus both
significant geostrategic players in the region. At the same time, both
are potentially vulnerable to internal ethnic conflicts. If either or
both of them were to be destabilized, the internal problems of the
region would become unmanageable, while efforts to restrain regional
domination by Russia could even become futile.</p>
<p>The three states of the Caucasus—Armenia, Georgia, and Azer-
baijan—can be said to be based on truly historic nations. As a result,
their nationalisms tend to be both pervasive and intense, and external
conflicts have tended to be the key challenge to their well-being. The
five new Central Asian states, by contrast, can be said to be rather
more in the nation-building phase, with tribal and ethnic identities
still strong, making internal dissension the major difficulty. In either
type of state, these vulnerabilities have tempted exploitation by their
more powerful and imperially minded neighbors.</p>
<p>The Eurasian Balkans are an ethnic mosaic (see preceding table and
map). The frontiers of its states were drawn arbitrarily by Soviet
cartographers in the 1920s and 1930s, when the respective Soviet
republics were formally established. (Afghanistan, never having been
part of the Soviet Union, is the exception.) Their borders were carved
out largely on the ethnic principle, but they also reflected the
Kremlin’s interest in keeping the southern region of the Russian Empire
internally divided and thus more subservient.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Moscow rejected proposals by Central Asian nationalists
to meld the various Central Asian peoples (most of whom were not yet
nationalistically motivated) into a single political unit—to be called
“Turkestan”—preferring instead to create five separate “republics,” each
with a distinctive new name and jigsaw borders. Presumably out of a
similar calculation, the Kremlin abandoned plans for a single Caucasian
federation. Therefore, it is not surprising that, upon the collapse of
the Soviet Union, neither the three states of the Caucasus nor the five
states of Central Asia were fully prepared for their newly independent
status nor for the needed regional cooperation.</p>
<p>In the Caucasus, Armenia’s less than 4 million people and
Azerbaijan’s more than 8 million promptly became embroiled in open
warfare over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely
Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan. The conflict generated
large-scale ethnic cleansings, with hundreds of thousands of refugees
and expellees fleeing in both directions. Given the fact that Armenia is
Christian and Azerbaijan Muslim, the war has some overtones of a
religious conflict. The economically devastating war made it much more
difficult for either country to establish itself as stably independent.
Armenia was driven to rely more on Russia, which had provided
significant military help, while Azerbaijan’s new independence and
internal stability were compromised by the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan’s vulnerability has wider regional implications because
the country’s location makes it a geopolitical pivot. It can be
described as the vitally important “cork” controlling access to the
“bottle” that contains the riches of the Caspian Sea basin and Central
Asia. An independent, Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan, with pipelines running
from it to the ethnically related and politically supportive Turkey,
would prevent Russia from exercising a monopoly on access to the region
and would thus also deprive Russia of decisive political leverage over
the policies of the new Central Asian states. Yet Azerbaijan is very
vulnerable to pressures from powerful Russia to the north and from Iran
to the south. There are twice as many Azeris—some estimate as many as 20
million—living in northwestern Iran as in Azerbaijan proper. That
reality makes Iran fearful of potential separatism among its Azeris and
hence quite ambivalent regarding Azerbaijan’s sovereign status, despite
the two nations’ shared Muslim faith. As a result, Azerbaijan has become
the object of combined Russian and Iranian pressures to restrict its
dealings with the West.</p>
<p>Unlike either Armenia or Azerbaijan, both of which are ethnically
quite homogeneous, about 30 percent of Georgia’s 6 million people are
minorities. Moreover, these small communities, rather tribal in
organization and identity, have intensely resented Georgian domination.
Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Os-setians and the
Abkhazians therefore took advantage of internal Georgian political
strife to attempt secession, which Russia quietly backed in order to
compel Georgia to accede to Russian pressures to remain within the CIS
(from which Georgia initially wanted to secede altogether) and to accept
Russian military bases on Georgian soil in order to seal the area off
from Turkey.</p>
<p>In Central Asia, internal factors have been more significant in
promoting instability. Culturally and linguistically, four of the five
newly independent Central Asian states are part of the Turkic world.
Tajikistan is linguistically and culturally Persian, while Afghanistan
(outside of the former Soviet Union) is a Pathan, Tajik, Pashtun, and
Persian ethnic mosaic. All six countries are Muslim. Most of them, over
the years, were under the passing influence of the Persian, Turkish, and
Russian empires, but that experience has not served to foster a spirit
of a shared regional interest among them. On the contrary, their diverse
ethnic composition makes them vulnerable to internal and external
conflicts, which cumulatively tempt intrusion by more powerful
neighbors.</p>
<p>Of the five newly independent Central Asian states, Kazakstan and
Uzbekistan are the most important. Regionally, Kazakstan is the shield
and Uzbekistan is the soul for the region’s diverse national awakenings.
Kazakstan’s geographic size and location shelter the others from direct
Russian physical pressure, since Kazakstan alone borders on Russia.
However, its population of about 18 million is approximately 35 percent
Russian (the Russian population throughout the area is steadily
declining), with another 20 percent also non-Kazak, a fact that has made
it much more difficult for the new Kazak rulers—themselves increasingly
nationalistic but representing only about one-half of the country’s
total population—to pursue the goal of nation building on the basis of
ethnicity and language.</p>
<p>The Russians residing in the new state are naturally resentful of the
new Kazak leadership, and being the formerly ruling colonial class and
thus also better educated and situated, they are fearful of the loss of
privilege. Furthermore, they tend to view the new Kazak nationalism with
barely concealed cultural disdain. With both the northwestern and
northeastern regions of Kazakstan heavily dominated by Russian
colonists, Kazakstan would face the danger of territorial secession if
Kazak-Russian relations were to deteriorate seriously. At the same time,
several hundred thousand Kazaks reside on the Russian side of the state
borders and in northeastern Uzbekistan, the state that the Kazaks view
as their principal rival for Central Asian leadership.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan is, in fact, the prime candidate for regional leadership
in Central Asia. Although smaller in size and less endowed with natural
resources than Kazakstan, it has a larger population (nearly 25 million)
and, much more important, a considerably more homogeneous population
than Kazakstan’s. Given higher indigenous birthrates and the gradual
exodus of the formerly dominant Russians, soon about 75 percent of its
people will be Uzbek, with only an insignificant Russian minority
remaining largely in Tashkent, the capital.</p>
<p>Moreover, the country’s political elite deliberately identifies the
new state as the direct descendant of the vast medieval empire of
Tamerlane (1336–1404), whose capital, Samarkand, became the region’s
renowned center for the study of religion, astronomy, and the arts. This
lineage imbues modern Uzbekistan with a deeper sense of historical
continuity and regional mission than its neighbors. Indeed, some Uzbek
leaders see Uzbekistan as the national core of a single Central Asian
entity, presumably with Tashkent as its capital. More than in any of the
other Central Asian states, Uzbekistan’s political elite and
increasingly also its people, already partake of the subjective makings
of a modern nation-state and are determined—domestic difficulties
notwithstanding—never to revert to colonial status.</p>
<p>That condition makes Uzbekistan both the leader in fostering a sense
of post-ethnic modern nationalism and an object of some uneasiness among
its neighbors. Even as the Uzbek leaders set the pace in nation building
and in the advocacy of greater regional self-sufficiency, the country’s
relatively greater national homogeneity and more intense national
consciousness inspire fear among the rulers of Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, and even Kazakstan that Uzbek regional leadership could
evolve into Uzbek regional domination. That concern inhibits regional
cooperation among the newly sovereign states—which is not encouraged by
the Russians in any case—and perpetuates regional vulnerability.</p>
<p>However, like the others, Uzbekistan is not entirely free of ethnic
tensions. Parts of southern Uzbekistan, particularly around the
historically and culturally important centers of Samarkand and Bukhara,
have significant Tajik populations, which remain resentful of the
frontiers drawn by Moscow. Complicating matters further is the presence
of Uzbeks in western Tajikistan and of both Uzbeks and Tajiks in
Kyrgyzstan’s economically important Fergana Valley (where in recent
years bloody ethnic violence has erupted), not to mention the presence
of Uzbeks in northern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Of the other three Central Asian states that have emerged from
Russian colonial rule—Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan—only the
third is relatively cohesive ethnically. Approximately 75 percent of its
4.5 million people are Turkmen, with Uzbeks and Russians each accounting
for less than 10 percent. Turkmenistan’s shielded geographic location
makes it relatively remote from Russia, with Uzbekistan and Iran of far
greater geopolitical relevance to the country’s future. Once pipelines
to the area have been developed, Turkmenistan’s truly vast natural gas
reserves augur a prosperous future for the country’s people.</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan’s 5 million people are much more diverse. The Kyr-gyz
themselves account for about 55 percent of the total and the Uzbeks for
about 13 percent, with the Russians lately dropping from over 20 percent
to slightly over 15 percent. Prior to independence, the Russians largely
composed the technical-engineering intelligentsia, and their exodus has
hurt the country’s economy. Although rich in minerals and endowed with a
natural beauty that has led some to describe the country as the
Switzerland of Central Asia (and thus potentially as a new tourist
frontier), Kyrgyzstan’s geopolitical location, squeezed between China
and Kazakstan, makes it highly dependent on the degree to which
Kazakstan itself succeeds in maintaining its independence.</p>
<p>Tajikistan is only somewhat more ethnically homogeneous. Of its 6.5
million people, fewer than two-thirds are Tajik and more than 25 percent
are Uzbek (who are viewed with some hostility by the Tajiks), while the
remaining Russians account for only about 3 percent. However, as
elsewhere, even the dominant ethnic community is sharply—even
violently—divided along tribal lines, with modern nationalism confined
largely to the urban political elite. As a result, independence has
produced not only civil strife but a convenient excuse for Russia to
continue deploying its army in the country. The ethnic situation is even
further complicated by the large presence of Tajiks across the border,
in northeastern Afghanistan. In fact, almost as many ethnic Tajiks live
in Afghanistan as in Tajikistan, another factor that serves to undermine
regional stability.</p>
<p>Afghanistan’s current state of disarray is likewise a Soviet legacy,
even though the country is not a former Soviet republic. Fragmented by
the Soviet occupation and the prolonged guerrilla warfare conducted
against it, Afghanistan is a nation-state in name only. Its 22 million
people have become sharply divided along ethnic lines, with growing
divisions among the country’s Pashtuns, Tajiks, and Hazaras. At the same
time, the jihad against the Russian occupiers has made religion the
dominant dimension of the country’s political life, infusing dogmatic
fervor into already sharp political differences. Afghanistan thus has to
be seen not only as a part of the Central Asian ethnic conundrum but
also as politically very much part of the Eurasian Balkans.</p>
<p>Although all of the formerly Soviet Central Asian states, as well as
Azerbaijan, are populated predominantly by Muslims, their political
elites—still largely the products of the Soviet era—are almost uniformly
nonreligious in outlook and the states are formally secular. However, as
their populations shift from a primarily traditional clannish or tribal
identity to a more modern national awareness, they are likely to become
imbued with an intensifying Islamic consciousness. In fact, an Islamic
revival—already abetted from the outside not only by Iran but also by
Saudi Arabia—is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the
increasingly pervasive new nationalisms, determined to oppose any
reintegration under Russian—and hence infidel—control.</p>
<p>Indeed, the process of Islamization is likely to prove contagious
also to the Muslims who have remained within Russia proper. They number
about 20 million—more than twice the number of disaffected Russians
(circa 9.5 million) who continue to live under foreign rule in the
independent Central Asian states. The Russian Muslims thus account for
about 13 percent of Russia’s population, and it is almost inevitable
that they will become more assertive in claiming their rights to a
distinctive religious and political identity. Even if that claim does
not take the form of a quest for outright independence, as it has in
Chechnya, it will overlap with the dilemmas that Russia, given its
recent imperial involvement and the Russian minorities in the new
states, will continue to face in Central Asia.</p>
<p>Gravely increasing the instability of the Eurasian Balkans and making
the situation potentially much more explosive is the fact that two of
the adjoining major nation-states, each with a historically imperial,
cultural, religious, and economic interest in the region—namely, Turkey
and Iran—are themselves volatile in their geopolitical orientation and
are internally potentially vulnerable. Were these two states to become
destabilized, it is quite likely that the entire region would be plunged
into massive disorder, with the ongoing ethnic and territorial conflicts
spinning out of control and the region’s already delicate balance of
power severely disrupted. Accordingly, Turkey and Iran are not only
important geostrategic players but are also geopolitical pivots, whose
own internal condition is of critical importance to the fate of the
region. Both are middle-sized powers, with strong regional aspirations
and a sense of their historical significance. Yet the future
geopolitical orientation and even the national cohesion of both states
remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Turkey, a postimperial state still in the process of redefining its
identity, is pulled in three directions: the modernists would like to
see it become a European state and thus look to the west; the Is-lamists
lean in the direction of the Middle East and a Muslim community and thus
look to the south; and the historically minded nationalists see in the
Turkic peoples of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia a new mission
for a regionally dominant Turkey and thus look eastward. Each of these
perspectives posits a different strategic axis, and the clash between
them introduces for the first time since the Kemalist revolution a
measure of uncertainty regarding Turkey’s regional role.</p>
<p>Moreover, Turkey itself could become at least a partial victim of the
region’s ethnic conflicts. Although its population of about 65 million
is predominantly Turkish, with about 80 percent Turkic stock (though
including a variety of Circassians, Albanians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, and
Arabs), as much as 20 percent or perhaps even more are Kurdish.
Concentrated in the country’s eastern regions, the Turkish Kurds have
increasingly been drawn into the struggle for national independence
waged by the Iraqi and Iranian Kurds. Any internal tensions within
Turkey regarding the country’s overall direction would doubtless
encourage the Kurds to press even more violently for a separate national
status.</p>
<p>Iran’s future orientation is even more problematic. The
fundamentalist Shiite revolution that triumphed in the late 1970s may be
entering its “Thermidorian” phase, and that heightens the uncertainty
regarding Iran’s geostrategic role. On the one hand, the collapse of the
atheistic Soviet Union opened up Iran’s newly independent northern
neighbors to religious proselytizing but, on the other, Iran’s hostility
to the United States has inclined Teheran to adopt at least a tactically
pro-Moscow orientation, reinforced by Iran’s concerns regarding the
impact on its own cohesion of Azerbaijan’s new independence.</p>
<p>That concern is derived from Iran’s vulnerability to ethnic tensions.
Of the country’s 65 million people (almost identical in number to
Turkey’s), only somewhat more than one-half are Persians. Roughly
one-fourth are Azeri, and the remainder include Kurds, Baluchis,
Turkmens, Arabs, and other tribes. Outside of the Kurds and the Azeris,
the others at present do not have the capacity to threaten Iran’s
national integrity, especially given the high degree of national, even
imperial, consciousness among the Persians. But that could change quite
quickly, particularly in the event of a new political crisis in Iranian
politics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the very fact that several newly independent “stans” now
exist in the area and that even the 1 million Chechens have been able to
assert their political aspirations is bound to have an infectious effect
on the Kurds as well as on all the other ethnic minorities in Iran. If
Azerbaijan succeeds in stable political and economic development, the
Iranian Azeris will probably become increasingly committed to the idea
of a greater Azerbaijan. Thus, political instability and divisions in
Teheran could expand into a challenge to the cohesion of the Iranian
state, thereby dramatically extending the scope and increasing the
stakes of what is involved in the Eurasian Balkans.</p>
