<h4 id="japan-not-regional-but-international">JAPAN: NOT REGIONAL BUT
INTERNATIONAL</h4>
<p>How the American-Japanese relationship evolves is thus a critical
dimension in China’s geopolitical future. Since the end of the Chinese
civil war in 1949, America’s policy in the Far East has been based on
Japan. At first only the site for the occupying American military, Japan
has since become the basis for America’s political-military presence in
the Asia-Pacific region and America’s centrally important global ally,
yet also a security protectorate. The emergence of China, however, does
pose the question whether—and to what end—the close American-Japanese
relationship can endure in the altering regional context. Japan’s role
in an anti-China alliance would be clear; but what should Japan’s role
be if China’s rise is to be accommodated in some fashion even as it
reduces America’s primacy in the region?</p>
<p>Like China, Japan is a nation-state with a deeply ingrained sense of
its unique character and special status. Its insular history, even its
imperial mythology, has predisposed the highly industrious and
disciplined Japanese people to see themselves as endowed with a
distinctive and superior way of life, which Japan first defended by
splendid isolation and then, when the world imposed itself in the
nineteenth century, by emulating the European empires in seeking to
create one of its own on the Asian mainland. The disaster of World War
II then focused the Japanese people on the one-dimensional goal of
economic recovery, but it also left them uncertain regarding their
country’s wider mission.</p>
<p>Current American fears of a dominant China are reminiscent of the
relatively recent American paranoia regarding Japan. Japanopho-bia has
now yielded to Sinophobia. A mere decade ago, predictions of Japan’s
inevitable and imminent appearance as the world’s “superstate”—poised
not only to dethrone America (even to buy it out!) but to impose some
sort of a “Pax Nipponica”—were a veritable cottage industry among
American commentators and politicians. But not only among the Americans.
The Japanese themselves soon became eager imitators, with a series of
best-sellers in Japan propounding the thesis that Japan was destined to
prevail in its high-tech rivalry with the United States and that Japan
would soon become the center of a global “information empire,” while
America was allegedly sliding into a decline because of historical
fatigue and social self-indulgence.</p>
<p>These facile analyses obscured the degree to which Japan was, and
remains, a vulnerable country. It is vulnerable to the slightest
disruptions in the orderly global flow of resources and trade, not to
mention global stability more generally, and it is beset by surfacing
domestic weaknesses—demographic, social, and political. Japan is
simultaneously rich, dynamic, and economically powerful, but it is also
regionally isolated and politically limited by its security dependence
on a powerful ally that happens to be the principal keeper of global
stability (on which Japan so depends) as well as Japan’s main economic
rival.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Japan’s current position—on the one hand, as a
globally respected economic powerhouse and, on the other, as a
geopolitical extension of American power—will remain acceptable to the
new generations of Japanese, no longer traumatized and shamed by the
experience of World War II. For reasons of both history and self-esteem,
Japan is a country not entirely satisfied with the global status quo,
though in a more subdued fashion than China. It feels, with some
justification, that it is entitled to formal recognition as a world
power but is also aware that the regionally useful (and, to its Asian
neighbors, reassuring) security dependence on America inhibits that
recognition.</p>
<p>Moreover, China’s growing power on the mainland of Asia, along with
the prospect that its influence may soon radiate into the maritime
regions of economic importance to Japan, intensifies the Japanese sense
of ambiguity regarding the country’s geopolitical future. On the one
hand, there is in Japan a strong cultural and emotional identification
with China as well as a latent sense of a common Asian identity. Some
Japanese may also feel that the emergence of a stronger China has the
expedient effect of enhancing Japan’s importance to the United States as
America’s regional paramountcy is reduced. On the other hand, for many
Japanese, China is the traditional rival, a former enemy, and a
potential threat to the stability of the region. That makes the security
tie with America more important than ever, even if it increases the
resentment of some of the more nationalistic Japanese concerning the
irksome restraints on Japan’s political and military independence.</p>
<p>There is a superficial similarity between Japan’s situation in
Eurasia’s Far East and Germany’s in Eurasia’s Far West. Both are the
principal regional allies of the United States. Indeed, American power
in Europe and Asia is derived directly from the close alliances with
these two countries. Both have respectable military establishments, but
neither is independent in that regard: Germany is constrained by its
military integration into NATO, while Japan is restricted by its own
(though American-designed) constitutional limitations and the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty. Both are trade and financial powerhouses, regionally
dominant and also preeminent on the global scale. Both can be classified
as quasi-global powers, and both chafe at the continuing denial to them
of formal recognition through permanent seats on the UN Security
Council.</p>
<p>But the differences in their respective geopolitical conditions are
pregnant with potentially significant consequences. Germany’s actual
relationship with NATO places the country on a par with its principal
European allies, and under the North Atlantic Treaty, Germany has formal
reciprocal defense obligations with the United States. The U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty stipulates American obligations to defend Japan, but it
does not provide (even if only formally) for the use of the Japanese
military in the defense of America. The treaty in effect codifies a
protective relationship.</p>
<p>Moreover, Germany, by its proactive membership in the European Union
and NATO, is no longer seen as a threat by those neighbors who in the
past were victims of its aggression but is viewed instead as a desirable
economic and political partner. Some even welcome the potential
emergence of a German-led Mitteleuropa, with Germany seen as a benign
regional power. That is far from the case with Japan’s Asian neighbors,
who harbor lingering animosity toward Japan over World War II. A
contributing factor to neighborly resentment is the appreciation of the
yen, which has not only prompted bitter complaints but has impeded
reconciliation with Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and even
China, 30 percent of whose large long-term debts to Japan are in
yen.</p>
<p>Japan also has no equivalent in Asia to Germany’s France: that is, a
genuine and more or less equal regional partner. There is admittedly a
strong cultural attraction to China, mingled perhaps with a sense of
guilt, but that attraction is politically ambiguous in that neither side
trusts the other and neither is prepared to accept the other’s regional
leadership. Japan also has no equivalent to Germany’s Poland: that is, a
much weaker but geopolitically important neighbor with whom
reconciliation and even cooperation is becoming a reality. Perhaps
Korea, especially so after eventual reunification, could become that
equivalent, but Japanese-Korean relations are only formally good, with
the Korean memories of past domination and the Japanese sense of
cultural superiority impeding any genuine social reconciliation.27
Finally, Japan’s relations with Russia have been much cooler than
Germany’s. Russia still retains the southern Kuril Islands by force,
which it seized just before the end of World War II, thereby freezing
the Russo-Japanese relationship. In brief, Japan is politically isolated
in its region, whereas Germany is not.</p>
<p>In addition, Germany shares with its neighbors both common democratic
principles and Europe’s broader Christian heritage. It also seeks to
identify and even sublimate itself within an entity and a cause larger
than itself, namely, that of “Europe.” In contrast, there is no
comparable “Asia.” Indeed, Japan’s insular past and even its current
democratic system tend to separate it from the rest of the region, in
spite of the emergence in recent years of democracy in several Asian
countries. Many Asians view Japan not only as nationally selfish but
also as overly imitative of the West and reluctant to join them in
questioning the West’s views on human rights and on the importance of
individualism. Thus, Japan is perceived as not truly Asian by many
Asians, even as the West occasionally wonders to what degree Japan has
truly become Western.</p>
<p>In effect, though in Asia, Japan is not comfortably Asian. That
condition greatly limits its geostrategic options. A genuinely regional
option, that of a regionally preponderant Japan that overshadows
China—even if no longer based on Japanese domination but rather on
benign Japanese-led regional cooperation—does not seem viable for solid
historical, political, and cultural reasons. Furthermore, Japan remains
dependent on American military protection and international sponsorship.
The abrogation or even the gradual emasculation of the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty would render Japan instantly vulnerable to the
disruptions that any serious manifestation of regional or global turmoil
might produce. The only alternatives then would be either to accept
China’s regional predominance or to undertake a massive—and not only
costly but also very dangerous—program of military rearmament.</p>
<p>Understandably, many Japanese find their country’s present
position—simultaneously a quasi-global power and a security
protectorate—to be anomalous. But dramatic and viable alternatives to
the existing arrangements are not self-evident. If it can be said that
China’s national goals, notwithstanding the inescapable variety of views
among the Chinese strategists on specific aspects, are reasonably clear
and the regional thrust of China’s geopolitical ambitions relatively
predictable, Japan’s geostrategic vision tends to be relatively cloudy
and the Japanese public mood much more ambiguous.</p>
<p>Most Japanese realize that a strategically significant and abrupt
change of course could be dangerous. Can Japan become a regional power
in a region where it is still the object of resentment and where China
is emerging as the regionally preeminent power? Yet should Japan simply
acquiesce in such a Chinese role? Can Japan become a truly comprehensive
global power (in all its dimensions) without jeopardizing American
support and galvanizing even more regional animosity? And will America,
in any case, stay put in Asia, and if it does, how will its reaction to
China’s growing influence impinge on the priority so far given to the
American-Japanese connection? For most of the Cold War, none of these
questions ever had to be raised. Today, they have become strategically
salient and are propelling an increasingly lively debate in Japan.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, Japanese foreign policy has been guided by four
basic principles promulgated by postwar Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida.
The Yoshida Doctrine postulated that (1) Japan’s main goal should be
economic development, (2) Japan should be lightly armed and should avoid
involvement in international conflicts, (3) Japan should follow the
political leadership of and accept military protection from the United
States, and (4) Japanese diplomacy should be nonideological and should
focus on international cooperation. However, since many Japanese also
felt uneasy about the extent of Japan’s involvement in the Cold War, the
fiction of semineutrality was simultaneously cultivated. Indeed, as late
as 1981, Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito was forced to resign for having
permitted the term “alliance” (domei) to be used in characterizing
U.S.-Japan relations.</p>
<p>That is now all past. Japan was then recovering, China was
self-isolated, and Eurasia was polarized. By contrast, Japan’s political
elite now senses that a rich Japan, economically involved in the world,
can no longer define self-enrichment as its central national purpose
without provoking international resentment. Further, an economically
powerful Japan, especially one that competes with America, cannot simply
be an extension of American foreign policy while at the same time
avoiding any international political responsibilities. A politically
more influential Japan, especially one that seeks global recognition
(for example, a permanent seat on the UN Security Council), cannot avoid
taking stands on the more critical security or geopolitical issues
affecting world peace.</p>
<p>As a result, recent years have seen a proliferation of special
studies and reports by a variety of Japanese public and private bodies,
as well as a plethora of often controversial books by well-known
politicians and professors, outlining new missions for Japan in the
post–Cold War era.28 Many of these have involved speculation regarding
the durability and desirability of the American-Japanese security
alliance and have advocated a more active Japanese diplomacy, especially
toward China, or a more energetic Japanese military role in the region.
If one were to judge the state of the American-Japanese connection on
the basis of the public dialogue, one would be justified in concluding
that by the mid-1990s relations between the two countries had entered a
crisis stage.</p>
<p>However, on the level of public policy, the seriously discussed
recommendations have been, on the whole, relatively sober, measured, and
moderate. The extreme options—that of outright pacifism (tinged with an
anti-U.S. flavor) or of unilateral and major rearmament (requiring a
revision of the Constitution and pursued presumably in defiance of an
adverse American and regional reaction) —have won few adherents. The
public appeal of pacifism has, if anything, waned in recent years, and
unilateralism and militarism have also failed to gain much public
support, despite the advocacy of some flamboyant spokesmen. The public
at large and certainly the influential business elite viscerally sense
that neither option provides a real policy choice and, in fact, could
only endanger Japan’s well-being.</p>
<p>The politically dominant public discussions have primarily involved
differences in emphasis regarding Japan’s basic international posture,
with some secondary variations concerning geopolitical priorities. In
broad terms, three major orientations, and perhaps a minor fourth one,
can be identified and labeled as follows: the unabashed “America
Firsters,” the global mercantilists, the proactive realists, and the
international visionaries. However, in the final analysis, all four
share the same rather general goal and partake of the same central
concern: to exploit the special relationship with the United States in
order to gain global recognition for Japan, while avoiding Asian
hostility and without prematurely jeopardizing the American security
umbrella.</p>
<p>The first orientation takes as its point of departure the proposition
that the maintenance of the existing (and admittedly asymmetrical)
American-Japanese relationship should remain the central core of Japan’s
geostrategy. Its adherents desire, as do most Japanese, greater
international recognition for Japan and more equality in the alliance,
but it is their cardinal article of faith, as Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa put it in January 1993, that “the outlook for the world going
into the twenty-first century will largely depend on whether or not
Japan and the United States . . . are able to provide coordinated
leadership under a shared vision.” This viewpoint has been dominant
within the internationalist political elite and the foreign policy
establishment that has held power over the course of the last two or so
decades. On the key geostrategic issues of China’s regional role and
America’s presence in Korea, that leadership has been supportive of the
United States, but it also sees its role as a source of restraint on any
American propensity to adopt a confrontationist posture toward China. In
fact, even this group has become increasingly inclined to emphasize the
need for closer Japanese-Chinese relations, ranking them in importance
just below the ties with America.</p>
<p>The second orientation does not contest the geostrategic
identification of Japan’s policy with America’s, but it sees Japanese
interests as best served by the frank recognition and acceptance of the
fact that Japan is primarily an economic power. This outlook is most
often associated with the traditionally influential bureaucracy of the
MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) and with the
country’s trading and export business leadership. In this view, Japan’s
relative demilitarization is an asset worth preserving. With America
assuring the security of the country, Japan is free to pursue a policy
of global economic engagement, which quietly enhances its global
standing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, the second orientation would be inclined to favor
a policy of at least de facto neutralism, with America offsetting
China’s regional power and thereby protecting Taiwan and South Korea,
thus making Japan free to cultivate a closer economic relationship with
the mainland and with Southeast Asia. However, given the existing
political realities, the global mercantilists accept the
American-Japanese alliance as a necessary arrangement, including the
relatively modest budgetary outlays for the Japanese armed forces (still
not much exceeding 1 percent of the country’s GDP), but they are not
eager to infuse the alliance with any regionally significant
substance.</p>
<p>The third group, the proactive realists, tend to be the new breed of
politicians and geopolitical thinkers. They believe that as a rich and
successful democracy Japan has both the opportunity and the obligation
to make a real difference in the post–Cold War world. By doing so, it
can also gain the global recognition to which Japan is entitled as an
economic powerhouse that historically ranks among the world’s few truly
great nations. The appearance of such a more muscular Japanese posture
was foreshadowed in the 1980s by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, but
perhaps the best-known exposition of that perspective was contained in
the controversial Ozawa Committee report, published in 1994 and entitled
suggestively “Blueprint for a New Japan: The Rethinking of a
Nation.”</p>
<p>Named after the committee’s chairman, Ichiro Ozawa, a rapidly rising
centrist political leader, the report advocated both a democratization
of the country’s hierarchical political culture and a rethinking of
Japan’s international posture. Urging Japan to become “a normal
country,” the report recommended the retention of the American-Japanese
security connection but also counseled that Japan should abandon its
international passivity by becoming actively engaged in global politics,
especially by taking the lead in international peacekeeping efforts. To
that end, the report recommended that the country’s constitutional
limitations on the dispatch abroad of Japanese armed forces be
lifted.</p>
<p>Left unsaid but implied by the emphasis on “a normal country” was
also the notion of a more significant geopolitical emancipation from
America’s security blanket. The advocates of this viewpoint tended to
argue that on matters of global importance, Japan should not hesitate to
speak up for Asia, instead of automatically following the American lead.
However, they remained characteristically vague on such sensitive
matters as the growing regional role of China or the future of Korea,
not differing much from their more traditionalist colleagues. Thus, in
regard to regional security, they partook of the still strong Japanese
inclination to let both matters remain primarily the responsibility of
America, with Japan merely exercising a moderating role on any excessive
American zeal.</p>
<p>By the second half of the 1990s, this proactive realist orientation
was beginning to dominate public thinking and affect the formulation of
Japanese foreign policy. In the first half of 1996, the Japanese
government started to speak of Japan’s “independent diplomacy” (jishu
gaiko), even though the ever-cautious Japanese Foreign Ministry chose to
translate the Japanese phrase as the vaguer (and to America presumably
less pointed) term “proactive diplomacy.”</p>
<p>The fourth orientation, that of the international visionaries, has
been less influential than any of the preceding, but it occasionally
serves to infuse the Japanese viewpoint with more idealistic rhetoric.
It tends to be associated publicly with outstanding individuals—like
Akio Morita of Sony—who personally dramatize the importance to Japan of
a demonstrative commitment to morally desirable global goals. Often
invoking the notion of “a new global order,” the visionaries call on
Japan—precisely because it is not burdened by geopolitical
responsibilities—to be a global leader in the development and
advancement of a truly humane agenda for the world community.</p>
<p>All four orientations are in agreement on one key regional issue:
that the emergence of more multilateral Asia-Pacific cooperation is in
Japan’s interest. Such cooperation can have, over time, three positive
effects: it can help to engage (and also subtly to restrain) China; it
can help to keep America in Asia, even while gradually reducing its
predominance; and it can help to mitigate anti-Japanese resentment and
thus increase Japan’s influence. Although it is unlikely to create a
Japanese sphere of regional influence, it might gain Japan some degree
of regional deference, especially in the offshore maritime countries
that may be uneasy over China’s growing power.</p>
<p>All four viewpoints also agree that a cautious cultivation of China
is much to be preferred over any American-led effort toward the direct
containment of China. In fact, the notion of an American-led strategy to
contain China, or even the idea of an informal balancing coalition
confined to the island states of Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, and
Indonesia, backed by Japan and America, has had no significant appeal
for the Japanese foreign policy establishment. In the Japanese
perspective, any effort of that sort would not only require an
indefinite and major American military presence in both Japan and Korea
but—by creating an incendiary geopolitical overlap between Chinese and
American-Japanese regional interests (see map on page 184)—would be
likely to become a self-fulfilling prophesy of a collision with China.29
The result would be to inhibit Japan’s evolutionary emancipation and
threaten the Far East’s economic well-being.</p>
<p>By the same token, few favor the opposite: a grand accommodation
between Japan and China. The regional consequences of such a classical
reversal of alliances would be too unsettling: an American withdrawal
from the region as well as the prompt subordination of both Taiwan and
Korea to China, leaving Japan at China’s mercy. This is not an appealing
prospect, save perhaps to a few extremists. With Russia geopolitically
marginalized and historically despised, there is thus no alternative to
the basic consensus that the link with America remains Japan’s central
lifeline. Without it, Japan can neither ensure itself a steady supply of
oil nor protect itself from a Chinese (and perhaps soon, also a Korean)
nuclear bomb. The only real policy issue is how best to manipulate the
American connection in order to advance Japanese interests.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Japanese have gone along with American desires to
enhance American-Japanese military cooperation, including the seemingly
increased scope from the more specific “Far East” to a broader
“Asia-Pacific formula.” Consistent with this, in early 1996 in its
review of the so-called Japan-U.S. defense guidelines, the Japanese
government also broadened its reference to the possible use of Japanese
defense forces from in “Far East emergencies” to “emergencies in Japan’s
neighboring regions.” Japanese willingness to accommodate America on
this matter has also been driven by percolating doubts regarding
America’s long-term staying power in Asia and by concerns that China’s
rise—and America’s seeming anxiety over it—could at some point in the
future still impose on Japan an unacceptable choice: to stand with
America against China or without America and allied with China.</p>
<p>For Japan, that fundamental dilemma also contains a historic
imperative: since becoming a dominant regional power is not a viable
goal and since without a regional base the attainment of truly
comprehensive global power is unrealistic, it follows that Japan can
best attain the status of a global leader through active involvement in
worldwide peacekeeping and economic development. By taking advantage of
the American-Japanese military alliance to ensure the stability of the
Far East—but without letting it evolve into an anti-Chinese
coalition—Japan can safely carve out a distinctive and influential
global mission as the power that promotes the emergence of genuinely
international and more effectively institutionalized cooperation. Japan
could thus become a much more powerful and globally influential
equivalent of Canada: a state that is respected for the constructive use
of its wealth and power but one that is neither feared nor resented.</p>
