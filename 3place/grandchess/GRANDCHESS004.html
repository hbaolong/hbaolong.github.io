<h4 id="geopolitics-and-geostrategy">GEOPOLITICS AND GEOSTRATEGY</h4>
<p>The exercise of American global primacy must be sensitive to the fact
that political geography remains a critical consideration in
international affairs. Napoleon reportedly once said that to know a
nation’s geography was to know its foreign policy. Our understanding of
the importance of political geography, however, must adapt to the new
realities of power.</p>
<p>For most of the history of international affairs, territorial control
was the focus of political conflict. Either national self-gratification
over the acquisition of larger territory or the sense of national
deprivation over the loss of “sacred” land has been the cause of most of
the bloody wars fought since the rise of nationalism. It is no
exaggeration to say that the territorial imperative has been the main
impulse driving the aggressive behavior of nation-states. Empires were
also built through the careful seizure and retention of vital geographic
assets, such as Gibraltar or the Suez Canal or Singapore, which served
as key choke points or linchpins in a system of imperial control.</p>
<p>The most extreme manifestation of the linkage between nationalism and
territorial possession was provided by Nazi Germany and imperial Japan.
The effort to build the “one-thousand-year Reich” went far beyond the
goal of reuniting all German-speaking peoples under one political roof
and focused also on the desire to control “the granaries” of Ukraine as
well as other Slavic lands, whose populations were to provide cheap
slave labor for the imperial domain. The Japanese were similarly fixated
on the notion that direct territorial possession of Manchuria, and later
of the important oil-producing Dutch East Indies, was essential to the
fulfillment of the Japanese quest for national power and global status.
In a similar vein, for centuries the definition of Russian national
greatness was equated with the acquisition of territory, and even at the
end of the twentieth century, the Russian insistence on retaining
control over such non-Russian people as the Chechens, who live around a
vital oil pipeline, has been justified by the claim that such control is
essential to Russia’s status as a great power.</p>
<p>Nation-states continue to be the basic units of the world system.
Although the decline in big-power nationalism and the fading of ideology
has reduced the emotional content of global politics— while nuclear
weapons have introduced major restraints on the use of force—competition
based on territory still dominates world affairs, even if its forms
currently tend to be more civil. In that competition, geographic
location is still the point of departure for the definition of a
nation-state’s external priorities, and the size of national territory
also remains one of the major criteria of status and power.</p>
<p>However, for most nation-states, the issue of territorial possession
has lately been waning in salience. To the extent that territorial
disputes are still important in shaping the foreign policy of some
states, they are more a matter of resentment over the denial of
self-determination to ethnic brethren said to be deprived of the right
to join the “motherland” or a grievance over alleged mistreatment by a
neighbor of ethnic minorities than they are a quest for enhanced
national status through territorial enlargement.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the ruling national elites have come to recognize that
factors other than territory are more crucial in determining the
international status of a state or the degree of its international
influence. Economic prowess, and its translation into technological
innovation, can also be a key criterion of power. Japan provides the
supreme example. Nonetheless, geographic location still tends to
determine the immediate priorities of a state—and the greater its
military, economic, and political power, the greater the radius, beyond
its immediate neighbors, of that state’s vital geopolitical interests,
influence, and involvement.</p>
<p>Until recently, the leading analysts of geopolitics have debated
whether land power was more significant than sea power and what specific
region of Eurasia is vital to gain control over the entire continent.
One of the most prominent, Harold Mackinder, pioneered the discussion
early in this century with his successive concepts of the Eurasian
“pivot area” (which was said to include all of Siberia and much of
Central Asia) and, later, of the Central–East European “heartland” as
the vital springboards for the attainment of continental domination. He
popularized his heartland concept by the famous dictum:</p>
<p>Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland;</p>
<p>Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island;</p>
<p>Who rules the World-Island commands the world.</p>
<p>Geopolitics was also invoked by some leading German political
geographers to justify their country’s “Drang nach Osten,” notably with
Karl Haushofer adapting Mackinder’s concept to Germany’s strategic
needs. Its much-vulgarized echo could also be heard in Adolf Hitler’s
emphasis on the German people’s need for “Lebensraum.” Other European
thinkers of the first half of this century anticipated an eastward shift
in the geopolitical center of gravity, with the Pacific region—and
specifically America and Japan—becoming the likely inheritors of
Europe’s fading domination. To forestall such a shift, the French
political geographer Paul Demangeon, as well as other French
geopoliticians, advocated greater unity among the European states even
before World War II.</p>
<p>Today, the geopolitical issue is no longer what geographic part of
Eurasia is the point of departure for continental domination, nor
whether land power is more significant than sea power. Geopolitics has
moved from the regional to the global dimension, with preponderance over
the entire Eurasian continent serving as the central basis for global
primacy. The United States, a non-Eurasian power, now enjoys
international primacy, with its power directly deployed on three
peripheries of the Eurasian continent, from which it exercises a
powerful influence on the states occupying the Eurasian hinterland. But
it is on the globe’s most important playing field—Eurasia—that a
potential rival to America might at some point arise. Thus, focusing on
the key players and properly assessing the terrain has to be the point
of departure for the formulation of American geostrategy for the
long-term management of America’s Eurasian geopolitical interests.</p>
<p>Two basic steps are thus required:</p>
<p>• first, to identify the geostrategically dynamic Eurasian states
that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the
international distribution of power and to decipher the central external
goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences
of their seeking to attain them; and to pinpoint the geopolitically
critical Eurasian states whose location and/or existence have catalytic
effects either on the more active geostrategic players or on regional
conditions;</p>
<p>• second, to formulate specific U.S. policies to offset, co-opt,
and/or control the above, so as to preserve and promote vital U.S.
interests, and to conceptualize a more comprehensive geostrategy that
establishes on a global scale the interconnection between the more
specific U.S. policies.</p>
<p>In brief, for the United States, Eurasian geostrategy involves the
purposeful management of geostrategically dynamic states and the careful
handling of geopolitically catalytic states, in keeping with the twin
interests of America in the short-term preservation of its unique global
power and in the long-run transformation of it into increasingly
institutionalized global cooperation. To put it in a terminology that
hearkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand
imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and
maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries
pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming
together.</p>
