<h4 id="china-not-global-but-regional">CHINA: NOT GLOBAL BUT
REGIONAL</h4>
<p>China’s history is one of national greatness. The currently intense
nationalism of the Chinese people is new only in its social
pervasiveness, for it engages the self-identification and the emotions
of an unprecedented number of Chinese. It is no longer a phenomenon
confined largely to the students who, in the early years of this
century, formed the precursors of the Kuomintang and the Chinese
Communist Party. Chinese nationalism is now a mass phenomenon, defining
the mindset of the world’s most populous state.</p>
<p>That mindset has deep historical roots. History has predisposed the
Chinese elite to think of China as the natural center of the world. In
fact, the Chinese word for China—Chung-kuo, or the “Middle Kingdom”—both
conveys the notion of China’s centrality in world affairs and reaffirms
the importance of national unity. That perspective also implies a
hierarchical radiation of influence from the center to the peripheries,
and thus China as the center expects deference from others.</p>
<p>Moreover, since time immemorial, China, with its vast population, has
been a distinctive and proud civilization all its own. That civilization
was highly advanced in all areas: philosophy, culture, the arts, social
skills, technical inventiveness, and political power. The Chinese recall
that until approximately 1600, China led the world in agricultural
productivity, industrial innovation, and standard of living. But unlike
the European and the Islamic civilizations, which have spawned some
seventy-five-odd states, China has remained for most of its history a
single state, which at the time of America’s declaration of independence
already contained more than 200 million people and was also the world’s
leading manufacturing power.</p>
<p>From that perspective, China’s fall from greatness—the last 150 years
of China’s humiliation—is an aberration, a desecration of China’s
special quality, and a personal insult to every individual Chinese. It
must be erased, and its perpetrators deserve due punishment. These
perpetrators, in varying degrees, have primarily been four: Great
Britain, Japan, Russia, and America—Great Britain, because of the Opium
War and its consequent shameful debasement of China; Japan, because of
the predatory wars spanning the last century, resulting in terrible (and
still unrepented) infliction of suffering on the Chinese people; Russia,
because of protracted encroachment on Chinese territories in the North
as well as Stalin’s domineering insensitivity toward Chinese
self-esteem; and finally America, because through its Asian presence and
support of Japan, it stands in the way of China’s external
aspirations.</p>
<p>In the Chinese view, two of these four powers have already been
punished, so to speak, by history. Great Britain is no longer an empire,
and the lowering of the Union Jack in Hong Kong forever closes that
particularly painful chapter. Russia remains next door, though much
diminished in stature, prestige, and territory. It is America and Japan
that pose the most serious problems for China, and it is in the
interaction with them that China’s regional and global role will be
substantively defined.</p>
<p>That definition, however, will depend in the first instance on how
China itself evolves, on how much of an economic and military power it
actually becomes. On this score, the prognosis for China is generally
promising, though not without some major uncertainties and
qualifications. Both the pace of China’s economic growth and the scale
of foreign investment in China—each among the highest in the
world—provide the statistical basis for the conventional prognosis that
within two decades or so China will become a global power, roughly on a
par with the United States and Europe (assuming that the latter both
unites and expands further). China might by then have a GDP considerably
in excess of Japan’s, and it already exceeds Russia’s by a significant
margin. That economic momentum should permit China to acquire military
power on a scale that will be intimidating to all its neighbors, perhaps
even to the more geographically distant opponents of China’s
aspirations. Further strengthened by the incorporation of Hong Kong and
Macao, and perhaps also eventually by the political subordination of
Taiwan, a Greater China will emerge not only as the dominant state in
the Far East but as a world power of the first rank.</p>
<p>However, there are pitfalls in any such prognosis for the “Middle
Kingdom’s” inevitable resurrection as a central global power, the most
obvious of which pertains to the mechanical reliance on statistical
projection. That very error was made not long ago by those who
prophesied that Japan would supplant the United States as the world’s
leading economy and that Japan was destined to be the new superstate.
That perspective failed to take into account both the factor of Japan’s
economic vulnerability and the problem of political discontinuity—and
the same error is being made by those who proclaim, and also fear, the
inevitable emergence of China as a world power.</p>
<p>First of all, it is far from certain that China’s explosive growth
rates can be maintained over the next two decades. An economic slowdown
cannot be excluded, and that by itself would discredit the conventional
prognosis. In fact, for these rates to be sustained over a historically
long period of time would require an unusually felicitous combination of
effective national leadership, political tranquillity, domestic social
discipline, high rates of savings, continued very high inflow of foreign
investment, and regional stability. A prolonged combination of all of
these positive factors is problematic.</p>
<p>Moreover, China’s fast pace of growth is likely to produce political
side effects that could limit its freedom of action. Chinese consumption
of energy is already expanding at a rate that far exceeds domestic
production. That excess will widen in any case, but especially so if
China’s rate of growth continues to be very high. The same is the case
with food. Even given the slowdown in China’s demographic growth, the
Chinese population is still increasing in large absolute numbers, with
food imports becoming more essential to internal well-being and
political stability. Dependence on imports will not only impose strains
on Chinese economic resources because of higher costs, but they will
also make China more vulnerable to external pressures.</p>
<p>Militarily, China might partially qualify as a global power, since
the very size of its economy and its high growth rates should enable its
rulers to divert a significant ratio of the country’s GDP to sustain a
major expansion and modernization of China’s armed forces, including a
further buildup of its strategic nuclear arsenal. However, if that
effort is excessive (and according to some Western estimates, in the
mid-1990s it was already consuming about 20 percent of China’s GDP), it
could have the same negative effect on China’s long-term economic growth
that the failed attempt by the Soviet Union to compete in the arms race
with the United States had on the Soviet economy. Furthermore, a major
Chinese effort in this area would be likely to precipitate a
countervailing Japanese arms buildup, thereby negating some of the
political benefits of China’s growing military prowess. And one must not
ignore the fact that outside of its nuclear forces, China is likely to
lack the means, for some time to come, to project its military power
beyond its regional perimeter.</p>
<p>Tensions within China could also intensify, as a result of the
inevitable unevenness of highly accelerated economic growth, driven
heavily by the uninhibited exploitation of marginal advantages. The
coastal South and East as well as the principal urban centers—more
accessible to foreign investment and overseas trade—have so far been the
major beneficiaries of China’s impressive economic growth. In contrast,
the inland rural areas in general and some of the outlying regions have
lagged (with upward of 100 million rural unemployed).</p>
<p>The resulting resentment over regional disparities could begin to
interact with anger over social inequality. China’s rapid growth is
widening the social gap in the distribution of wealth. At some point,
either because the government may seek to limit such differences or
because of social resentment from below, the regional disparities and
the wealth gap could in turn impact on the country’s political
stability.</p>
<p>The second reason for cautious skepticism regarding the widespread
prognoses of China’s emergence during the next quarter of a century as a
dominating power in global affairs is, indeed, the future of China’s
politics. The dynamic character of China’s nonsta-tist economic
transformation, including its social openness to the rest of the world,
is not mutually compatible in the long run with a relatively closed and
bureaucratically rigid Communist dictatorship. The proclaimed communism
of that dictatorship is progressively less a matter of ideological
commitment and more a matter of bureaucratic vested interest. The
Chinese political elite remains organized as a self-contained, rigid,
disciplined, and monopolisti-cally intolerant hierarchy, still
ritualistically proclaiming its fidelity to a dogma that is said to
justify its power but that the same elite is no longer implementing
socially. At some point, these two dimensions of life will collide
head-on, unless Chinese politics begin to adapt gradually to the social
imperatives of China’s economics.</p>
<p>Thus, the issue of democratization cannot be evaded indefinitely,
unless China suddenly makes the same decision it made in the year 1474:
to isolate itself from the world, somewhat like contemporary North
Korea. To do that, China would have to recall its more than seventy
thousand students currently studying in America, expel foreign
businessmen, shut down its computers, and tear down satellite dishes
from millions of Chinese homes. It would be an act of madness,
reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. Perhaps for a brief moment, in
the context of a domestic struggle for power, a dogmatic wing of the
ruling but fading Chinese Communist Party might attempt to emulate North
Korea, but it could not be more than a brief episode. More likely than
not, it would produce economic stagnation and then prompt a political
explosion.</p>
<p>In any case, self-isolation would mean the end of any serious Chinese
aspirations not only to global power but even to regional primacy.
Moreover, the country has too much of a stake in access to the world,
and that world, unlike that of 1474, is simply too intrusive to be
effectively excluded. There is thus no practical, economically
productive, and politically viable alternative to China’s continued
openness to the world.</p>
<p>Democratization will thus increasingly haunt China. Neither that
issue nor the related question of human rights can be evaded for too
long. China’s future progress, as well as its emergence as a major
power, will thus depend to a large degree on how skillfully the ruling
Chinese elite handles the two related problems of power succession from
the present generation of rulers to a younger team and of coping with
the growing tension between the country’s economic and political
systems.</p>
<p>The Chinese leaders might perhaps succeed in promoting a slow and
evolutionary transition to a very limited electoral authoritarianism, in
which some low-level political choice is tolerated, and only thereafter
move toward more genuine political pluralism, including more emphasis on
incipient constitutional rule. Such a controlled transition would be
more compatible with the imperatives of the increasingly open economic
dynamics of the country than persistence in maintaining exclusive Party
monopoly on political power.</p>
<p>To accomplish such controlled democratization, the Chinese political
elite will have to be led with extraordinary skill, guided by pragmatic
common sense, and stay relatively united and willing to yield some of
its monopoly on power (and personal privilege)—while the population at
large will have to be both patient and undemanding. That combination of
felicitous circumstances may prove difficult to attain. Experience
teaches that pressures for democratization from below, either from those
who have felt themselves politically suppressed (intellectuals and
students) or economically exploited (the new urban labor class and the
rural poor), generally tend to outpace the willingness of rulers to
yield. At some point, the politically and the socially disaffected in
China are likely to join forces in demanding more democracy, freedom of
expression, and respect for human rights. That did not happen in
Tiananmen Square in 1989, but it might well happen the next time.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is unlikely that China will be able to avoid a phase
of political unrest. Given its size, the reality of growing regional
differences, and the legacy of some fifty years of doctrinal
dictatorship, such a phase could be disruptive both politically and
economically. Even the Chinese leaders themselves seem to expect as
much, with internal Communist Party studies undertaken in the early
1990s foreseeing potentially serious political unrest.21 Some China
experts have even prophesied that China might spin into one of its
historic cycles of internal fragmentation, thereby halting China’s march
to greatness altogether. But the probability of such an extreme
eventuality is diminished by the twin impacts of mass nationalism and
modern communications, both of which work in favor of a unified Chinese
state.</p>
<p>There is, finally, a third reason for skepticism regarding the
prospects of China’s emergence in the course of the next twenty or so
years as a truly major—and to some Americans, already menacing—global
power. Even if China avoids serious political disruptions and even if it
somehow manages to sustain its extraordinarily high rates of economic
growth over a quarter of a century—which are both rather big “ifs”—China
would still be relatively very poor. Even a tripling of GDP would leave
China’s population in the lower ranks of the world’s nations in per
capita income, not to mention the actual poverty of a significant
portion of its people.22 Its comparative standing in per capita access
to telephones, cars, and computers, let alone consumer goods, would be
very low.</p>
<p>To sum up: even by the year 2020, it is quite unlikely even under the
best of circumstances that China could become truly competitive in the
key dimensions of global power. Even so, however, China is well on the
way to becoming the preponderant regional power in East Asia. It is
already geopolitically dominant on the mainland. Its military and
economic power dwarfs its immediate neighbors, with the exception of
India. It is, therefore, only natural that China will increasingly
assert itself regionally, in keeping with the dictates of its history,
geography, and economics.</p>
<p>Chinese students of their country’s history know that as recently as
1840, China’s imperial sway extended throughout Southeast Asia, all the
way down to the Strait of Malacca, including Burma, parts of today’s
Bangladesh as well as Nepal, portions of today’s Kazakstan, all of
Mongolia, and the region that today is called the Russian Far Eastern
Province, north of where the Amur River flows into the ocean (see map on
page 14 in chapter 1). These areas were either under some form of
Chinese control or paid tribute to China. Franco-British colonial
expansion ejected Chinese influence from Southeast Asia during the years
1885–95, while two treaties imposed by Russia in 1858 and 1864 resulted
in territorial losses in the Northeast and Northwest. In 1895, following
the Sino-Japanese War, China also lost Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is almost certain that history and geography will make the Chinese
increasingly insistent—even emotionally charged—regarding the necessity
of the eventual reunification of Taiwan with the mainland. It is also
reasonable to assume that China, as its power grows, will make that goal
its principal objective during the first decade of the next century,
following the economic absorption and political digestion of Hong Kong.
Perhaps a peaceful reunification—maybe under a formula of “one nation,
several systems” (a variant of Deng Xiaoping’s 1984 slogan “one country,
two systems”)—might become appealing to Taiwan and would not be resisted
by America, but only if China has been successful in sustaining its
economic progress and adopting significant democratizing reforms.
Otherwise, even a regionally dominant China is still likely to lack the
military means to impose its will, especially in the face of American
opposition, in which case the issue is bound to continue galvanizing
Chinese nationalism while souring American-Chinese relations.</p>
<p>Geography is also an important factor driving the Chinese interest in
making an alliance with Pakistan and establishing a military presence in
Burma. In both cases, India is the geostrategic target. Close military
cooperation with Pakistan increases India’s security dilemmas and limits
India’s ability to establish itself as the regional hegemon in South
Asia and as a geopolitical rival to China. Military cooperation with
Burma gains China access to naval facilities on several Burmese offshore
islands in the Indian Ocean, thereby also providing some further
strategic leverage in Southeast Asia generally and in the Strait of
Malacca particularly. And if China were to control the Strait of Malacca
and the geostrategic choke point at Singapore, it would control Japan’s
access to Middle Eastern oil and European markets.</p>
<p>Geography, reinforced by history, also dictates China’s interest in
Korea. At one time a tributary state, a reunited Korea as an extension
of American (and indirectly also of Japanese) influence would be
intolerable to China. At the very minimum, China would insist that a
reunited Korea be a nonaligned buffer between China and Japan and would
also expect that the historically rooted Korean animosity toward Japan
would of itself draw Korea into the Chinese sphere of influence. For the
time being, however, a divided Korea suits China best, and thus China is
likely to favor the continued existence of the North Korean regime.</p>
<p>Economic considerations are also bound to influence the thrust of
China’s regional ambitions. In that regard, the rapidly growing demand
for new energy sources has already made China insistent on a dominant
role in any regional exploitation of the seabed deposits of the South
China Sea. For the same reason, China is beginning to display an
increasing interest in the independence of the energy-rich Central Asian
states. In April 1996, China, Russia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
Tajikistan signed a joint border and security agreement; and during
President Jiang Zemin’s visit to Kazakstan in July of the same year, the
Chinese side was quoted as having provided assurances of China’s support
for “the efforts made by Kazakstan to defend its independence,
sovereignty, and territorial integrity.” The foregoing clearly signaled
China’s growing involvement in the geopolitics of Central Asia.</p>
<p>History and economics also conspire to increase the interest of a
regionally more powerful China in Russia’s Far East. For the first time
since China and Russia have come to share a formal border, China is the
economically more dynamic and politically stronger party. Seepage into
the Russian area by Chinese immigrants and traders has already assumed
significant proportions, and China is becoming more active in promoting
Northeast Asian economic cooperation that also engages Japan and Korea.
In that cooperation, Russia now holds a much weaker card, while the
Russian Far East increasingly becomes economically dependent on closer
links with China’s Manchuria. Similar economic forces are also at work
in China’s relations with Mongolia, which is no longer a Russian
satellite and whose formal independence China has reluctantly
recognized.</p>
<p>A Chinese sphere of regional influence is thus in the making. A
sphere of influence, however, should not be confused with a zone of
exclusive political domination, such as the Soviet Union exercised in
Eastern Europe. It is socioeconomically more porous and politically less
monopolistic. Nonetheless, it entails a geographic space in which its
various states, when formulating their own policies, pay special
deference to the interests, views, and anticipated reactions of the
regionally predominant power. In brief, a Chinese sphere of
influence—perhaps a sphere of deference would be a more accurate
formulation—can be defined as one in which the very first question asked
in the various capitals regarding any given issue is “What is Beijing’s
view on this?”</p>
<p>The map that follows traces out the potential range over the next
quarter of a century of a regionally dominant China and also of China as
a global power, in the event that—despite the internal and external
obstacles already noted—China should actually become one. A regionally
dominant Greater China, which would mobilize the political support of
its enormously rich and economically</p>
<p>powerful diaspora in Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and
Jakarta, not to speak of Taiwan and Hong Kong (see footnote below for
some startling data)23 and which would penetrate into both Central Asia
and the Russian Far East, would thus approximate in its radius the scope
of the Chinese Empire before the onset of its decline some 150 years
ago, even expanding its geopolitical range through the alliance with
Pakistan. As China rises in power and prestige, the wealthy overseas
Chinese are likely to identify themselves more and more with China’s
aspirations and will thus become a powerful vanguard of China’s imperial
momentum. The Southeast Asian states may find it prudent to defer to
China’s political sensitivities and economic interests—and they are
increasingly doing so.24 Similarly, the new Central Asian states
increasingly view China as a power that has a stake in their
independence and in their role as buffers between China and Russia.</p>
<p>The scope of China as a global power would most probably involve a
significantly deeper southern bulge, with both Indonesia and the
Philippines compelled to adjust to the reality of the Chinese navy as
the dominant force in the South China Sea. Such a China might be much
more tempted to resolve the issue of Taiwan by force, irrespective of
America’s attitude. In the West, Uzbekistan, the Central Asian state
most determined to resist Russian encroachments on its former imperial
domain, might favor a countervailing alliance with China, as might
Turkmenistan; and China might also become more assertive in the
ethnically divided and thus nationally vulnerable Kazakstan. A China
that becomes truly both a political and an economic giant might also
project more overt political influence into the Russian Far East, while
sponsoring Korea’s unification under its aegis (see map on page
167).</p>
<p>But such a bloated China would also be more likely to encounter
strong external opposition. The previous map makes it evident that in
the West, both Russia and India would have good geopolitical reasons to
ally in seeking to push back China’s challenge. Cooperation between them
would be likely to focus heavily on Central Asia and Pakistan, whence
China would threaten their interests the most. In the south, opposition
would be strongest from Vietnam and Indonesia (probably backed by
Australia). In the east, America, probably backed by Japan, would react
adversely to any Chinese efforts to gain predominance in Korea and to
incorporate Taiwan by force, actions that would reduce the American
political presence in the Far East to a potentially unstable and
solitary perch in Japan.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the probability of either scenario sketched out on the
maps fully coming to pass depends not only on how China itself develops
but also very much on American conduct and presence. A disengaged
America would make the second scenario much more likely, but even the
comprehensive emergence of the first would require some American
accommodation and self-restraint. The Chinese know this, and hence
Chinese policy has to be focused primarily on influencing both American
conduct and, especially, the critical American-Japanese connection, with
China’s other relationships manipulated tactically with that strategic
concern in mind.</p>
<p>China’s principal objection to America relates less to what America
actually does than to what America currently is and where it is. America
is seen by China as the world’s current hegemon, whose very presence in
the region, based on its dominant position in Japan, works to contain
China’s influence. In the words of a Chinese analyst employed in the
research arm of the Chinese Foreign Ministry: “The U.S. strategic aim is
to seek hegemony in the whole world and it cannot tolerate the
appearance of any big power on the European and Asian continents that
will constitute a threat to its leading position.”25 Hence, simply by
being what it is and where it is, America becomes China’s unintentional
adversary rather than its natural ally.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the task of Chinese policy—in keeping with Sun Tsu’s
ancient strategic wisdom—is to use American power to peacefully defeat
American hegemony, but without unleashing any latent Japanese regional
aspirations. To that end, China’s geostrategy must pursue two goals
simultaneously, as somewhat obliquely defined in August 1994 by Deng
Xiaoping: “First, to oppose hegemonism and power politics and safeguard
world peace; second, to build up a new international political and
economic order.” The first obviously targets the United States and has
as its purpose the reduction in American preponderance, while carefully
avoiding a military collision that would end China’s drive for economic
power; the second seeks to revise the distribution of global power,
capitalizing on the resentment in some key states against the current
global pecking order, in which the United States is perched at the top,
supported by Europe (or Germany) in the extreme west of Eurasia and by
Japan in the extreme east.</p>
<p>China’s second objective prompts Beijing to pursue a regional
geostrategy that seeks to avoid any serious conflicts with its immediate
neighbors, even while continuing its quest for regional preponderance. A
tactical improvement in Sino-Russian relations is particularly timely,
especially since Russia is now weaker than China. Accordingly, in April
1997, both countries joined in denouncing “hegemonism” and declaring
NATO’s expansion “impermissible.” However, it is unlikely that China
would seriously consider any long-term and comprehensive Russo-Chinese
alliance against America. That would work to deepen and widen the scope
of the American-Japanese alliance, which China would like to dilute
slowly, and it would also isolate China from critically important
sources of modern technology and capital.</p>
<p>As in Sino-Russian relations, it suits China to avoid any direct
collision with India, even while continuing to sustain its close
military cooperation with Pakistan and Burma. A policy of overt
antagonism would have the negative effect of complicating China’s
tactically expedient accommodation with Russia, while also pushing India
toward a more cooperative relationship with America. To the extent that
India also shares an underlying and somewhat anti-Western predisposition
against the existing global “hegemony,” a reduction in Sino-Indian
tensions is also in keeping with China’s broader geostrategic focus.</p>
<p>The same considerations generally apply to China’s ongoing relations
with Southeast Asia. Even while unilaterally asserting their claims to
the South China Sea, the Chinese have simultaneously cultivated
Southeast Asian leaders (with the exception of the historically hostile
Vietnamese), exploiting the more outspoken anti-Western sentiments
(particularly on the issue of Western values and human rights) that in
recent years have been voiced by the leaders of Malaysia and Singapore.
They have especially welcomed the occasionally strident anti-American
rhetoric of Prime Minister Datuk Mahathir of Malaysia, who in a May 1996
forum in Tokyo even publicly questioned the need for the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty, demanding to know the identity of the enemy the
alliance is supposed to defend against and asserting that Malaysia does
not need allies. The Chinese clearly calculate that their influence in
the region will be automatically enhanced by any diminution of America’s
standing.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, patient pressure appears to be the motif of
China’s current policy toward Taiwan. While adopting an uncompromising
position with regard to Taiwan’s international status—to the point of
even being willing to deliberately generate international tensions in
order to convey China’s seriousness on this matter (as in March
1996)—the Chinese leaders presumably realize that for the time being
they will continue to lack the power to compel a satisfactory solution.
They realize that a premature reliance on force would only serve to
precipitate a self-defeating clash with America, while strengthening
America’s role as the regional guarantor of peace. Moreover, the Chinese
themselves acknowledge that how effectively Hong Kong is first absorbed
into China will greatly determine the prospects for the emergence of a
Greater China.</p>
<p>The accommodation that has been taking place in China’s relations
with South Korea is also an integral part of the policy of consolidating
its flanks in order to be able to concentrate more effectively on the
central goal. Given Korean history and public emotions, a Sino-Korean
accommodation of itself contributes to a reduction in Japan’s potential
regional role and prepares the ground for the reemergence of the more
traditional relationship between China and (either a reunited or a
still-divided) Korea.</p>
<p>Most important, the peaceful enhancement of China’s regional standing
will facilitate the pursuit of the central objective, which ancient
China’s strategist Sun Tsu might have formulated as follows: to dilute
American regional power to the point that a diminished America will come
to need a regionally dominant China as its ally and eventually even a
globally powerful China as its partner. This goal is to be sought and
accomplished in a manner that does not precipitate either a defensive
expansion in the scope of the American-Japanese alliance or the regional
replacement of America’s power by that of Japan.</p>
<p>To attain the central objective, in the short run, China seeks to
prevent the consolidation and expansion of American-Japanese security
cooperation. China was particularly alarmed at the implied increase in
early 1996 in the range of U.S.-Japanese security cooperation from the
narrower “Far East” to a wider “Asia-Pacific,” perceiving in it not only
an immediate threat to China’s interests but also the point of departure
for an American-dominated Asian system of security aimed at containing
China (in which Japan would be the vital linchpin,26 much as Germany was
in NATO during the Cold War). The agreement was generally perceived in
Beijing as facilitating Japan’s eventual emergence as a major military
power, perhaps even capable of relying on force to resolve outstanding
economic or maritime disputes on its own. China thus is likely to fan
energetically the still strong Asian fears of any significant Japanese
military role in the region, in order to restrain America and intimidate
Japan.</p>
<p>However, in the longer run, according to China’s strategic calculus,
American hegemony cannot last. Although some Chinese, especially among
the military, tend to view America as China’s im-placable foe, the
predominant expectation in Beijing is that America will become
regionally more isolated because of its excessive reliance on Japan and
that consequently America’s dependence on Japan will grow even further,
but so will American-Japanese contradictions and American fears of
Japanese militarism. That will then make it possible for China to play
off America and Japan against each other, as China did earlier in the
case of the United States and the Soviet Union. In Beijing’s view, the
time will come when America will realize that—to remain an influential
Asia-Pacific power—it has no choice but to turn to its natural partner
on the Asian mainland.</p>
