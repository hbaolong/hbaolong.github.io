<h4 id="russias-new-geopolitical-setting">RUSSIA’S NEW GEOPOLITICAL
SETTING</h4>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union was the final stage in the
progressive fragmentation of the vast Sino-Soviet Communist bloc that
for a brief period of time matched, and in some areas even surpassed,
the scope of Genghis Khan’s realm. But the more modern transcontinental
Eurasian bloc lasted very briefly, with the defection by Tito’s
Yugoslavia and the insubordination of Mao’s China signaling early on the
Communist camp’s vulnerability to nationalist aspirations that proved to
be stronger than ideological bonds. The Sino-Soviet bloc lasted roughly
ten years; the Soviet Union about seventy.</p>
<p>However, even more geopolitically significant was the undoing of the
centuries-old Moscow-ruled Great Russian Empire. The disintegration of
that empire was precipitated by the general socioeconomic and political
failure of the Soviet system—though much of its malaise was obscured
almost until the very end by its systemic secrecy and self-isolation.
Hence, the world was stunned by the seeming rapidity of the Soviet
Union’s self-destruction. In the course of two short weeks in December
1991, the Soviet Union was first defiantly declared as dissolved by the
heads of its Russian, Ukrainian, and Belorussian republics, then
formally replaced by a vaguer entity—called the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS)—embracing all of the Soviet republics but the
Baltic ones; then the Soviet president reluctantly resigned and the
Soviet flag was lowered for the last time from the tower of the Kremlin;
and, finally, the Russian Federation—now a predominantly Russian
national state of 150 million people—emerged as the de facto successor
to the former Soviet Union, while the other republics—accounting for
another 150 million people—asserted in varying degrees their independent
sovereignty.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union produced monumental geopolitical
confusion. In the course of a mere fortnight, the Russian people—who,
generally speaking, were even less forewarned than the outside world of
the Soviet Union’s approaching disintegration—suddenly discovered that
they were no longer the masters of a transcontinental empire but that
the frontiers of Russia had been rolled back to where they had been in
the Caucasus in the early 1800s, in Central Asia in the mid-1800s,
and—much more dramatically and painfully—in the West in approximately
1600, soon after the reign of Ivan the Terrible. The loss of the
Caucasus revived strategic fears of resurgent Turkish influence; the
loss of Central Asia generated a sense of deprivation regarding the
enormous energy and mineral resources of the region as well as anxiety
over a potential Islamic challenge; and Ukraine’s independence
challenged the very essence of Russia’s claim to being the divinely
endowed standard-bearer of a common pan-Slavic identity.</p>
<p>The space occupied for centuries by the Tsarist Empire and for
three-quarters of a century by the Russian-dominated Soviet Union was
now to be filled by a dozen states, with most (except for Russia) hardly
prepared for genuine sovereignty and ranging in size from the relatively
large Ukraine with its 52 million people to Armenia with its 3.5
million. Their viability seemed uncertain, while Moscow’s willingness to
accommodate permanently to the new reality was similarly unpredictable.
The historic shock suffered by the Russians was magnified by the fact
that some 20 million Russian-speaking people were now inhabitants of
foreign states dominated politically by increasingly nationalistic
elites determined to assert their own identities after decades of more
or less coercive Russification.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Russian Empire created a power void in the very
heart of Eurasia. Not only was there weakness and confusion in the newly
independent states, but in Russia itself, the upheaval produced a
massive systemic crisis, especially as the political upheaval was
accompanied by the simultaneous attempt to undo the old Soviet
socioeconomic model. The national trauma was made worse by Russia’s
military involvement in Tajikistan, driven by fears of a Muslim takeover
of that newly independent state, and was especially heightened by the
tragic, brutal, and both economically and politically very costly
intervention in Chechnya. Most painful of all, Russia’s international
status was significantly degraded, with one of the world’s two
superpowers now viewed by many as little more than a Third World
regional power, though still possessing a significant but increasingly
antiquated nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>The geopolitical void was magnified by the scale of Russia’s social
crisis. Three-quarters of a century of Communist rule had inflicted
unprecedented biological damage on the Russian people. A very high
proportion of its most gifted and enterprising individuals were killed
or perished in the Gulag, in numbers to be counted in the millions. In
addition, during this century the country also suffered the ravages of
World War I, the killings of a protracted civil war, and the atrocities
and deprivations of World War II. The ruling Communist regime imposed a
stifling doctrinal orthodoxy, while isolating the country from the rest
of the world. Its economic policies were totally indifferent to
ecological concerns, with the result that both the environment and the
health of the people suffered greatly. According to official Russian
statistics, by the mid-l990s only about 40 percent of newborns came into
the world healthy, while roughly one-fifth of Russian first graders
suffered from some form of mental retardation. Male longevity had
declined to 57.3 years, and more Russians were dying than were being
born. Russia’s social condition was, in fact, typical of a middle-rank
Third World country.</p>
<p>One cannot overstate the horrors and tribulations that have befallen
the Russian people in the course of this century. Hardly a single
Russian family has had the opportunity to lead a normal civilized
existence. Consider the social implications of the following sequence of
events:</p>
<p>• the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, ending in Russia’s humiliating
defeat;</p>
<p>• the first “proletarian” revolution of 1905, igniting large-scale
urban violence;</p>
<p>• World War I of 1914–1917, with its millions of casualties and
massive economic dislocation;</p>
<p>• the civil war of 1918–1921, again consuming several million lives
and devastating the land;</p>
<p>• the Russo-Polish War of 1919–1920, ending in a Russian defeat;</p>
<p>• the launching of the Gulag in the early 1920s, including the
decimation of the prerevolutionary elite and its large-scale exodus from
Russia;</p>
<p>• the industrialization and collectivization drives of the early and
mid-1930s, which generated massive famines and millions of deaths in
Ukraine and Kazakstan;</p>
<p>• the Great Purges and Terror of the mid- and late l930s, with
millions incarcerated in labor camps and upward of 1 million shot and
several million dying from maltreatment;</p>
<p>• World War II of 1941–1945, with its multiple millions of military
and civilian casualties and vast economic devastation;</p>
<p>• the reimposition of Stalinist terror in the late 1940s, again
involving large-scale arrests and frequent executions;</p>
<p>• the forty-year-long arms race with the United States, lasting from
the late 1940s to the late 1980s, with its socially impoverishing
effects;</p>
<p>• the economically exhausting efforts to project Soviet power into
the Caribbean, Middle East, and Africa during the 1970s and 1980s;</p>
<p>• the debilitating war in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989;</p>
<p>• the sudden breakup of the Soviet Union, followed by civil
disorders, a painful economic crisis, and the bloody and humiliating war
against Chechnya.</p>
<p>Not only was the crisis in Russia’s internal condition and the loss
of international status distressingly unsettling, especially for the
Russian political elite, but Russia’s geopolitical situation was also
adversely affected. In the West, as a consequence of the Soviet Union’s
disintegration, Russia’s frontiers had been altered most painfully, and
its sphere of geopolitical influence had dramatically shrunk (see map on
page 94). The Baltic states had been Russian-controlled since the 1700s,
and the loss of the ports of Riga and Tallinn made Russia’s access to
the Baltic Sea more limited and subject to winter freezes. Although
Moscow managed to retain a politically dominant position in the formally
newly independent but highly Russified Belarus, it was far from certain
that the nationalist contagion would not eventually also gain the upper
hand there as well. And beyond the frontiers of the former Soviet Union,
the collapse of the Warsaw Pact meant that the former satellite states
of Central Europe, foremost among them Poland, were rapidly gravitating
toward NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p>Most troubling of all was the loss of Ukraine. The appearance of an
independent Ukrainian state not only challenged all Russians to rethink
the nature of their own political and ethnic identity, but it
represented a vital geopolitical setback for the Russian state. The
repudiation of more than three hundred years of Russian imperial history
meant the loss of a potentially rich industrial and agricultural economy
and of 52 million people ethnically and religiously sufficiently close
to the Russians to make Russia into a truly large and confident imperial
state. Ukraine’s independence also deprived Russia of its dominant
position on the Black Sea, where Odessa had served as Russia’s vital
gateway to trade with the Mediterranean and the world beyond.</p>
<p>The loss of Ukraine was geopolitically pivotal, for it drastically
limited Russia’s geostrategic options. Even without the Baltic states
and Poland, a Russia that retained control over Ukraine could still seek
to be the leader of an assertive Eurasian empire, in which Moscow could
dominate the non-Slavs in the South and Southeast of the former Soviet
Union. But without Ukraine and its 52 million fellow Slavs, any attempt
by Moscow to rebuild the Eurasian empire was likely to leave Russia
entangled alone in protracted conflicts with the nationally and
religiously aroused non-Slavs, the war with Chechnya perhaps simply
being the first example. Moreover, given Russia’s declining birthrate
and the explosive birthrate among the Central Asians, any new Eurasian
entity based purely on Russian power, without Ukraine, would inevitably
become less European and more Asiatic with each passing year.</p>
<p>The loss of Ukraine was not only geopolitically pivotal but also
geopolitically catalytic. It was Ukrainian actions—the Ukrainian
declaration of independence in December 1991, its insistence in the
critical negotiations in Bela Vezha that the Soviet Union should be
replaced by a looser Commonwealth of Independent States, and especially
the sudden coup-like imposition of Ukrainian command over the Soviet
army units stationed on Ukrainian soil—that prevented the CIS from
becoming merely a new name for a more con-federal USSR. Ukraine’s
political self-determination stunned Moscow and set an example that the
other Soviet republics, though initially more timidly, then
followed.</p>
<p>Russia’s loss of its dominant position on the Baltic Sea was
replicated on the Black Sea not only because of Ukraine’s independence
but also because the newly independent Caucasian states—Georgia,
Armenia, and Azerbaijan—enhanced the opportunities for Turkey to
reestablish its once-lost influence in the region. Prior to 1991, the
Black Sea was the point of departure for the projection of Russian naval
power into the Mediterranean. By the mid-1990s, Russia was left with a
small coastal strip on the Black Sea and with an unresolved debate with
Ukraine over basing rights in Crimea for the remnants of the Soviet
Black Sea Fleet, while observing, with evident irritation, joint
NATO-Ukrainian naval and shore-landing maneuvers and a growing Turkish
role in the Black Sea region. Russia also suspected Turkey of having
provided effective aid to the Chechen resistance.</p>
<p>Farther to the southeast, the geopolitical upheaval produced a
similarly significant change in the status of the Caspian Sea basin and
of Central Asia more generally. Before the Soviet Union’s collapse, the
Caspian Sea was in effect a Russian lake, with a small southern sector
falling within Iran’s perimeter. With the emergence of the independent
and strongly nationalist Azerbaijan—reinforced by the influx of eager
Western oil investors—and the similarly independent Kazakstan and
Turkmenistan, Russia became only one of five claimants to the riches of
the Caspian Sea basin. It could no longer confidently assume that it
could dispose of these resources on its own.</p>
<p>The emergence of the independent Central Asian states meant that in
some places Russia’s southeastern frontier had been pushed back
northward more than one thousand miles. The new states now controlled
vast mineral and energy deposits that were bound to attract foreign
interests. It was almost inevitable that not only the elites but, before
too long, also the peoples of these states would become more
nationalistic and perhaps increasingly Islamic in outlook. In Kazakstan,
a vast country endowed with enormous natural resources but with its
nearly 20 million people split almost evenly between Kazaks and Slavs,
linguistic and national frictions are likely to intensify.
Uzbekistan—with its much more ethnically homogeneous population of
approximately 25 million and its leaders emphasizing the country’s
historic glories—has become increasingly assertive in affirming the
region’s new postcolonial status. Turkmenistan, geographically shielded
by Kazakstan from any direct contact with Russia, has actively developed
new links with Iran in order to diminish its prior dependence on the
Russian communications system for access to the global markets.</p>
<p>Supported from the outside by Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi
Arabia, the Central Asian states have not been inclined to trade their
new political sovereignty even for the sake of beneficial economic
integration with Russia, as many Russians continued to hope they would.
At the very least, some tension and hostility in their relationship with
Russia is unavoidable, while the painful precedents of Chechnya and
Tajikistan suggest that something worse cannot be altogether excluded.
For the Russians, the specter of a potential conflict with the Islamic
states along Russia’s entire southern flank (which, adding in Turkey,
Iran, and Pakistan, account for more than 300 million people) has to be
a source of serious concern.</p>
<p>Finally, at the time its empire dissolved, Russia was also facing an
ominous new geopolitical situation in the Far East, even though no
territorial or political changes had taken place. For several centuries,
China had been weaker and more backward than Russia, at least in the
political-military domains. No Russian concerned with the country’s
future and perplexed by the dramatic changes of this decade can ignore
the fact that China is on its way to being a more advanced, more
dynamic, and more successful state than Russia. China’s economic power,
wedded to the dynamic energy of its 1.2 billion people, is fundamentally
reversing the historical equation between the two countries, with the
empty spaces of Siberia almost beckoning for Chinese colonization.</p>
<p>This staggering new reality was bound to affect the Russian sense of
security in its Far Eastern region as well as Russian interests in
Central Asia. Before long, this development might even overshadow the
geopolitical importance of Russia’s loss of Ukraine. Its strategic
implications were well expressed by Vladimir Lukin, Russia’s first
post-Communist ambassador to the United States and later the chairman of
the Duma’s Foreign Affairs Committee:</p>
<p>In the past, Russia saw itself as being ahead of Asia, though lagging
behind Europe. But since then, Asia has developed much faster. . . . we
find ourselves to be not so much between “modern Europe” and “backward
Asia” but rather occupying some strange middle space between two
“Europes.”11</p>
<p>In brief, Russia, until recently the forger of a great territorial
empire and the leader of an ideological bloc of satellite states
extending into the very heart of Europe and at one point to the South
China Sea, had become a troubled national state, without easy geographic
access to the outside world and potentially vulnerable to debilitating
conflicts with its neighbors on its western, southern, and eastern
flanks. Only the uninhabitable and inaccessible northern spaces, almost
permanently frozen, seemed geopolitically secure.</p>
