<h4 id="geostrategic-players-and-geopolitical-pivots">GEOSTRATEGIC
PLAYERS AND GEOPOLITICAL PIVOTS</h4>
<p>Active geostrategic players are the states that have the capacity and
the national will to exercise power or influence beyond their borders in
order to alter—to a degree that affects America’s interests—the existing
geopolitical state of affairs. They have the potential and/or the
predisposition to be geopolitically volatile. For whatever reason—the
quest for national grandeur, ideological fulfillment, religious
messianism, or economic aggrandizement—some states do seek to attain
regional domination or global standing. They are driven by deeply rooted
and complex motivations, best explained by Robert Browning’s phrase: “ .
. . a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?” They
thus take careful stock of America’s power, determine the extent to
which their interests overlap or collide with America, and shape their
own more limited Eurasian objectives, sometimes in collusion but
sometimes in conflict with America’s policies. To the Eurasian states so
driven, the United States must pay special attention.</p>
<p>Geopolitical pivots are the states whose importance is derived not
from their power and motivation but rather from their sensitive location
and from the consequences of their potentially vulnerable condition for
the behavior of geostrategic players. Most often, geopolitical pivots
are determined by their geography, which in some cases gives them a
special role either in defining access to important areas or in denying
resources to a significant player. In some cases, a geopolitical pivot
may act as a defensive shield for a vital state or even a region.
Sometimes, the very existence of a geopolitical pivot can be said to
have very significant political and cultural consequences for a more
active neighboring geostrategic player. The identification of the
post–Cold War key Eurasian geopolitical pivots, and protecting them, is
thus also a crucial aspect of America’s global geostrategy.</p>
<p>It should also be noted at the outset that although all geostrategic
players tend to be important and powerful countries, not all important
and powerful countries are automatically geostrategic players. Thus,
while the identification of the geostrategic players is thus relatively
easy, the omission from the list that follows of some obviously
important countries may require more justification.</p>
<p>In the current global circumstances, at least five key geostrategic
players and five geopolitical pivots (with two of the latter perhaps
also partially qualifying as players) can be identified on Eurasia’s new
political map. France, Germany, Russia, China, and India are major and
active players, whereas Great Britain, Japan, and Indonesia, while
admittedly very important countries, do not so qualify. Ukraine,
Azerbaijan, South Korea, Turkey, and Iran play the role of critically
important geopolitical pivots, though both Turkey and Iran are to some
extent—within their more limited capabilities—also geostrategically
active. More will be said about each in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>At this stage, suffice it to say that in the western extremity of
Eurasia the key and dynamic geostrategic players are France and Germany.
Both of them are motivated by a vision of a united Europe, though they
differ on how much and in what fashion such a Europe should remain
linked to America. But both want to shape something ambitiously new in
Europe, thus altering the status quo. France in particular has its own
geostrategic concept of Europe, one that differs in some significant
respects from that of the United States, and is inclined to engage in
tactical maneuvers designed to play off Russia against America and Great
Britain against Germany, even while relying on the Franco-German
alliance to offset its own relative weakness.</p>
<p>Moreover, both France and Germany are powerful enough and assertive
enough to exercise influence within a wider regional radius. France not
only seeks a central political role in a unifying Europe but also sees
itself as the nucleus of a Mediterranean–North African cluster of states
that share common concerns. Germany is increasingly conscious of its
special status as Europe’s most important state—as the area’s economic
locomotive and the emerging leader of the European Union (EU). Germany
feels it has a special responsibility for the newly emancipated Central
Europe, in a manner vaguely reminiscent of earlier notions of a
German-led Mitteleuropa. Moreover, both France and Germany consider
themselves entitled to represent European interests in dealings with
Russia, and Germany even retains, because of its geographic location, at
least theoretically, the grand option of a special bilateral
accommodation with Russia.</p>
<p>In contrast, Great Britain is not a geostrategic player. It has fewer
major options, it entertains no ambitious vision of Europe’s future, and
its relative decline has also reduced its capacity to play the
traditional role of the European balancer. Its ambivalence regarding
European unification and its attachment to a waning special relationship
with America have made Great Britain increasingly irrelevant insofar as
the major choices confronting Europe’s future are concerned. London has
largely dealt itself out of the European game.</p>
<p>Sir Roy Denman, a former British senior official in the European
Commission, recalls in his memoirs that as early as the 1955 conference
in Messina, which previewed the formation of a European Union, the
official spokesman for Britain flatly asserted to the assembled would-be
architects of Europe:</p>
<p>The future treaty which you are discussing has no chance of being
agreed; if it was agreed, it would have no chance of being applied. And
if it was applied, it would be totally unacceptable to Britain…. au
revoir et bonne chance.4</p>
<p>More than forty years later, the above dictum remains essentially the
definition of the basic British attitude toward the construction of a
genuinely united Europe. Britain’s reluctance to participate in the
Economic and Monetary Union, targeted for January 1999, reflects the
country’s unwillingness to identify British destiny with that of Europe.
The substance of that attitude was well summarized in the early 1990s as
follows:</p>
<p>• Britain rejects the goal of political unification.</p>
<p>• Britain favors a model of economic integration based on free
trade.</p>
<p>• Britain prefers foreign policy, security, and defense coordination
outside the EC 〔European Community〕 framework.</p>
<p>• Britain has rarely maximized its influence with the EC.3</p>
<p>Great Britain, to be sure, still remains important to America. It
continues to wield some degree of global influence through the
Commonwealth, but it is neither a restless major power nor is it
motivated by an ambitious vision. It is America’s key supporter, a very
loyal ally, a vital military base, and a close partner in critically
important intelligence activities. Its friendship needs to be nourished,
but its policies do not call for sustained attention. It is a retired
geostrategic player, resting on its splendid laurels, largely disengaged
from the great European adventure in which France and Germany are the
principal actors.</p>
<p>The other medium-sized European states, with most being members of
NATO and/or the European Union, either follow America’s lead or quietly
line up behind Germany or France. Their policies do not have a wider
regional impact, and they are not in a position to alter their basic
alignments. At this stage, they are neither geostrategic players nor
geopolitical pivots. The same is true of the most important potential
Central European member of NATO and the EU, namely, Poland. Poland is
too weak to be a geostrategic player, and it has only one option: to
become integrated into the West. Moreover, the disappearance of the old
Russian Empire and Poland’s deepening ties with both the Atlantic
alliance and the emerging Europe increasingly give Poland historically
unprecedented security, while confining its strategic choices.</p>
<p>Russia, it hardly needs saying, remains a major geostrategic player,
in spite of its weakened state and probably prolonged malaise. Its very
presence impacts massively on the newly independent states within the
vast Eurasian space of the former Soviet Union. It entertains ambitious
geopolitical objectives, which it increasingly proclaims openly. Once it
has recovered its strength, it will also impact significantly on its
western and eastern neighbors. Moreover, Russia has still to make its
fundamental geostrategic choice regarding its relationship with America:
is it a friend or foe? It may well feel that it has major options on the
Eurasian continent in that regard. Much depends on how its internal
politics evolve and especially on whether Russia becomes a European
democracy or a Eurasian empire again. In any case, it clearly remains a
player, even though it has lost some of its “pieces,” as well as some
key spaces on the Eurasian chessboard.</p>
<p>Similarly, it hardly needs arguing that China is a major player.
China is already a significant regional power and is likely to entertain
wider aspirations, given its history as a major power and its view of
the Chinese state as the global center. The choices China makes are
already beginning to affect the geopolitical distribution of power in
Asia, while its economic momentum is bound to give it both greater
physical power and increasing ambitions. The rise of a “Greater China”
will not leave the Taiwan issue dormant, and that will inevitably impact
on the American position in the Far East. The dismantling of the Soviet
Union has also created on the western edge of China a series of states,
regarding which the Chinese leaders cannot be indifferent. Thus, Russia
will also be much affected by China’s more active emergence on the world
scene.</p>
<p>The eastern periphery of Eurasia poses a paradox. Japan is clearly a
major power in world affairs, and the American-Japanese alliance has
often—and correctly—been defined as America’s most important bilateral
relationship. As one of the very top economic powers in the world, Japan
clearly possesses the potential for the exercise of first-class
political power. Yet it does not act on this, eschewing any aspirations
for regional domination and preferring instead to operate under American
protection. Like Great Britain in the case of Europe, Japan prefers not
to become engaged in the politics of the Asian mainland, though at least
a partial reason for this is the continued hostility of many fellow
Asians to any Japanese quest for a regionally preeminent political
role.</p>
<p>This self-restrained Japanese political profile in turn permits the
United States to play a central security role in the Far East. Japan is
thus not a geostrategic player, though its obvious potential for quickly
becoming one—especially if either China or America were suddenly to
alter its current policies—imposes on the United States a special
obligation to carefully nurture the American-Japanese relationship. It
is not Japanese foreign policy that America must watch, but it is
Japan’s self-restraint that America must very subtly cultivate. Any
significant reduction in American-Japanese political ties would impact
directly on the region’s stability.</p>
<p>The case for not listing Indonesia as a dynamic geostrategic player
is easier to make. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is the most important
country, but even in the region itself, its capacity for projecting
significant influence is limited by the relatively underdeveloped state
of the Indonesian economy, its continued internal political
uncertainties, its dispersed archipelago, and its susceptibility to
ethnic conflicts that are exacerbated by the central role exercised in
its internal financial affairs by the Chinese minority. At some point,
Indonesia could become an important obstacle to Chinese southward
aspirations. That eventuality has already been recognized by Australia,
which once feared Indonesian expansionism but lately has begun to favor
closer Australian-Indonesian security cooperation. But a period of
political consolidation and continued economic success is needed before
Indonesia can be viewed as the regionally dominant actor.</p>
<p>In contrast, India is in the process of establishing itself as a
regional power and views itself as potentially a major global player as
well. It also sees itself as a rival to China. That may be a matter of
overestimating its own long-term capabilities, but India is
unquestionably the most powerful South Asian state, a regional hegemon
of sorts. It is also a semisecret nuclear power, and it became one not
only in order to intimidate Pakistan but especially to balance China’s
possession of a nuclear arsenal. India has a geostrategic vision of its
regional role, both vis-à-vis its neighbors and in the Indian Ocean.
However, its ambitions at this stage only peripherally intrude on
America’s Eurasian interests, and thus, as a geostrategic player, India
is not—at least, not to the same degree as either Russia or China—a
source of geopolitical concern.</p>
<p>Ukraine, a new and important space on the Eurasian chessboard, is a
geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country
helps to transform Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a
Eurasian empire. Russia without Ukraine can still strive for imperial
status, but it would then become a predominantly Asian imperial state,
more likely to be drawn into debilitating conflicts with aroused Central
Asians, who would then be resentful of the loss of their recent
independence and would be supported by their fellow Islamic states to
the south. China would also be likely to oppose any restoration of
Russian domination over Central Asia, given its increasing interest in
the newly independent states there. However, if Moscow regains control
over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as
its access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the
wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and
Asia. Ukraine’s loss of independence would have immediate consequences
for Central Europe, transforming Poland into the geopolitical pivot on
the eastern frontier of a united Europe.</p>
<p>Despite its limited size and small population, Azerbaijan, with its
vast energy resources, is also geopolitically critical. It is the cork
in the bottle containing the riches of the Caspian Sea basin and Central
Asia. The independence of the Central Asian states can be rendered
nearly meaningless if Azerbaijan becomes fully subordinated to Moscow’s
control. Azerbaijan’s own and very significant oil resources can also be
subjected to Russian control, once Azerbaijan’s independence has been
nullified. An independent Azerbaijan, linked to Western markets by
pipelines that do not pass through Russian-controlled territory, also
becomes a major avenue of access from the advanced and energy-consuming
economies to the energy rich Central Asian republics. Almost as much as
in the case of Ukraine, the future of Azerbaijan and Central Asia is
also crucial in defining what Russia might or might not become.</p>
<p>Turkey and Iran are engaged in establishing some degree of influence
in the Caspian Sea–Central Asia region, exploiting the retraction of
Russian power. For that reason, they might be considered as geostrategic
players. However, both states confront serious domestic problems, and
their capacity for effecting major regional shifts in the distribution
of power is limited. They are also rivals and thus tend to negate each
other’s influence. For example, in Azerbaijan, where Turkey has gained
an influential role, the Iranian posture (arising out of concern over
possible Azeri national stirrings within Iran itself) has been more
helpful to the Russians.</p>
<p>Both Turkey and Iran, however, are primarily important geopolitical
pivots. Turkey stabilizes the Black Sea region, controls access from it
to the Mediterranean Sea, balances Russia in the Caucasus, still offers
an antidote to Muslim fundamentalism, and serves as the southern anchor
for NATO. A destabilized Turkey would be likely to unleash more violence
in the southern Balkans, while facilitating the reimposition of Russian
control over the newly independent states of the Caucasus. Iran, despite
the ambiguity of its attitude toward Azerbaijan, similarly provides
stabilizing support for the new political diversity of Central Asia. It
dominates the eastern shoreline of the Persian Gulf, while its
independence, irrespective of current Iranian hostility toward the
United States, acts as a barrier to any long-term Russian threat to
American interests in the Persian Gulf region.</p>
<p>Finally, South Korea is a Far Eastern geopolitical pivot. Its close
links to the United States enable America to shield Japan and thereby to
keep Japan from becoming an independent and major military power,
without an overbearing American presence within Japan itself. Any
significant change in South Korea’s status, either through unification
and/or through a shift into an expanding Chinese sphere of influence,
would necessarily alter dramatically America’s role in the Far East,
thus altering Japan’s as well. In addition, South Korea’s growing
economic power also makes it a more important “space” in its own right,
control over which becomes increasingly valuable.</p>
<p>The above list of geostrategic players and geopolitical pivots is
neither permanent nor fixed. At times, some states might have to be
added or subtracted. Certainly, in some respects, the case could be made
that Taiwan, or Thailand, or Pakistan, or perhaps Kazakstan or
Uzbekistan should also be included in the latter category. However, at
this stage, the case for none of the above seems compelling. Changes in
the status of any of them would represent major events and involve some
shifts in the distribution of power, but it is doubtful that the
catalytic consequences would be far-reaching. The only exception might
involve the issue of Taiwan, if one chooses to view it apart from China.
Even then, that issue would only arise if China were to use major force
to conquer the island, in successful defiance of the United States,
thereby threatening more generally America’s political credibility in
the Far East. The probability of such a course of events seems low, but
that consideration still has to be kept in mind when framing U.S. policy
toward China.</p>
