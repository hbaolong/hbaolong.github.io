<h4 id="neither-dominion-nor-exclusion">NEITHER DOMINION NOR
EXCLUSION</h4>
<p>The geostrategic implications for America are clear: America is too
distant to be dominant in this part of Eurasia but too powerful not to
be engaged. All the states in the area view American engagement as
necessary to their survival. Russia is too weak to regain imperial
domination over the region or to exclude others from it, but it is also
too close and too strong to be excluded. Turkey and Iran are strong
enough to be influential, but their own vulnerabilities could make the
area unable to cope with both the challenge from the north and the
region’s internal conflicts. China is too powerful not to be feared by
Russia and the Central Asian states, yet its very presence and economic
dynamism facilitates Central Asia’s quest for wider global outreach.</p>
<p>It follows that America’s primary interest is to help ensure that no
single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the
global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it.
Geopolitical pluralism will become an enduring reality only when a
network of pipeline and transportation routes links the region directly
to the major centers of global economic activity via the Mediterranean
and Arabian Seas, as well as overland. Hence, Russian efforts to
monopolize access need to be opposed as inimical to regional
stability.</p>
<p>However, the exclusion of Russia from the area is neither desirable
nor feasible, nor is the fanning of hostility between the area’s new
states and Russia. In fact, Russia’s active economic participation in
the region’s development is essential to the area’s stability—and having
Russia as a partner, but not as an exclusive dominator, can also reap
significant economic benefits as a result. Greater stability and
increased wealth within the region would contribute directly to Russia’s
well-being and give real meaning to the “commonwealth” promised by the
acronym CIS. But that cooperative option will become Russia’s policy
only when much more ambitious, historically anachronistic designs that
are painfully reminiscent of the original Balkans are effectively
precluded.</p>
<p>The states deserving America’s strongest geopolitical support are
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and (outside this region) Ukraine, all three
being geopolitically pivotal. Indeed, Kiev’s role reinforces the
argument that Ukraine is the critical state, insofar as Russia’s own
future evolution is concerned. At the same time, Kazakstan—given its
size, economic potential, and geographically important location—is also
deserving of prudent international backing and especially of sustained
economic assistance. In time, economic growth in Kazakstan might help to
bridge the ethnic split that makes this Central Asian “shield” so
vulnerable to Russian pressure.</p>
<p>In this region, America shares a common interest not only with a
stable, pro-Western Turkey but also with Iran and China. A gradual
improvement in American-Iranian relations would greatly increase global
access to the region and, more specifically, reduce the more immediate
threat to Azerbaijan’s survival. China’s growing economic presence in
the region and its political stake in the area’s independence are also
congruent with America’s interests. China’s backing of Pakistan’s
efforts in Afghanistan is also a positive factor, for closer
Pakistani-Afghan relations would make international access to
Turkmenistan more feasible, thereby helping to reinforce both that state
and Uzbekistan (in the event that Kazakstan were to falter).</p>
<p>Turkey’s evolution and orientation are likely to be especially
decisive for the future of the Caucasian states. If Turkey sustains its
path to Europe—and if Europe does not close its doors to Turkey—the
states of the Caucasus are also likely to gravitate into the European
orbit, a prospect they fervently desire. But if Turkey’s Europeanization
grinds to a halt, for either internal or external reasons, then Georgia
and Armenia will have no choice but to adapt to Russia’s inclinations.
Their future will then become a function of Russia’s own evolving
relationship with the expanding Europe, for good or ill.</p>
<p>Iran’s role is likely to be even more problematic. A return to a
pro-Western posture would certainly facilitate the stabilization and
consolidation of the region, and it is therefore strategically desirable
for America to encourage such a turn in Iran’s conduct. But until that
happens, Iran is likely to play a negative role, adversely affecting
Azerbaijan’s prospects, even as it takes positive steps like opening
Turkmenistan to the world and, despite Iran’s current fundamentalism,
reinforcing the Central Asians’ sense of their religious heritage.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Central Asia’s future is likely to be shaped by an even
more complex set of circumstances, with the fate of its states
determined by the intricate interplay of Russian, Turkish, Iranian, and
Chinese interests, as well as by the degree to which the United States
conditions its relations with Russia on Russia’s respect for the
independence of the new states. The reality of that interplay precludes
either empire or monopoly as a meaningful goal for any of the
geostrategic players involved. Rather, the basic choice is between a
delicate regional balance—which would permit the gradual inclusion of
the area in the emerging global economy while the states of the region
consolidate themselves and probably also acquire a more pronounced
Islamic identity—or ethnic conflict, political fragmentation, and
possibly even open hostilities along Russia’s southern frontiers. The
attainment and consolidation of that regional balance has to be a major
goal in any comprehensive U.S. geostrategy for Eurasia.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 6</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Anchor</p>
<p>AN EFFECTIVE AMERICAN POLICY for Eurasia has to have a Far Eastern
anchor. That need will not be met if America is excluded or excludes
itself from the Asian mainland. A close relationship with maritime Japan
is essential for America’s global policy, but a cooperative relationship
with mainland China is imperative for America’s Eurasian geostrategy.
The implications of that reality need to be faced, for the ongoing
interaction in the Far East between three major powers—America, China,
and Japan—creates a potentially dangerous regional conundrum and is
almost certain to generate geopolitically tectonic shifts.</p>
<p>For China, America across the Pacific should be a natural ally since
America has no designs on the Asian mainland and has historically
opposed both Japanese and Russian encroachments on a weaker China. To
the Chinese, Japan has been the principal enemy over the last century;
Russia, “the hungry land” in Chinese, has long been distrusted; and
India, too, now looms as a potential rival. The principle “my neighbor’s
neighbor is my ally” thus fits the geopolitical and historical
relationship between China and America.</p>
<p>However, America is no longer Japan’s adversary across the ocean but
is now closely allied with Japan. America also has strong ties with
Taiwan and with several of the Southeast Asian nations. The Chinese are
also sensitive to America’s doctrinal reservations regarding the
internal character of the current Chinese regime. Thus, America is also
seen as the principal obstacle in China’s quest not only to become
globally preeminent but even just regionally predominant. Is a collision
between America and China, therefore, inevitable?</p>
<p>For Japan, America has been the umbrella under which the country
could safely recover from a devastating defeat, regain its economic
momentum, and on that basis progressively attain a position as one of
the world’s prime powers. But the very fact of that umbrella imposes a
limit on Japan’s freedom of action, creating the paradoxical situation
of a world-class power being simultaneously a protectorate. For Japan,
America continues to be the vital partner in Japan’s emergence as an
international leader. But America is also the main reason for Japan’s
continued lack of national self-reliance in the security area. How long
can this situation endure?</p>
<p>In other words, in the foreseeable future two centrally important—and
very directly interacting—geopolitical issues will define America’s role
in Eurasia’s Far East:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is the practical definition and—from America’s point of
view—the acceptable scope of China’s potential emergence as the dominant
regional power and of its growing aspirations for the status of a global
power?</p></li>
<li><p>As Japan seeks to define a global role for itself, how should
America manage the regional consequences of the inevitable reduction in
the degree of Japan’s acquiescence in its status as an American
protectorate?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The East Asian geopolitical scene is currently characterized by
metastable power relations. Metastability involves a condition of
external rigidity but of relatively little flexibility, in that regard
more reminiscent of iron than steel. It is vulnerable to a destructive
chain reaction generated by a powerful jarring blow. Today’s Far East is
experiencing extraordinary economic dynamism alongside growing political
uncertainty. Asian economic growth may in fact even contribute to that
uncertainty, because prosperity obscures the region’s political
vulnerabilities even as it intensifies national ambitions and expands
social expectations.</p>
<p>That Asia is an economic success without parallel in human
development goes without saying. Just a few basic statistics
dramatically highlight that reality. Less than four decades ago, East
Asia (including Japan) accounted for a mere 4 percent or so of the
world’s total GNP, while North America led with approximately 35–40
percent; by the mid-1990s, the two regions were roughly equal (in the
neighborhood of 25 percent). Moreover, Asia’s pace of growth has been
historically unprecedented. Economists have noted that in the takeoff
stage of industrialization, Great Britain took more than fifty years and
America just somewhat less than fifty years to double their respective
outputs per head, whereas both China and South Korea accomplished the
same gain in approximately ten years. Barring some massive regional
disruption, within a quarter of a century, Asia is likely to outstrip
both North America and Europe in total GNP.</p>
<p>However, in addition to becoming the world’s center of economic
gravity, Asia is also its potential political volcano. Although
surpassing Europe in economic development, Asia is singularly deficient
in regional political development. It lacks the cooperative multilateral
structures that so dominate the European political landscape and that
dilute, absorb, and contain Europe’s more traditional territorial,
ethnic, and national conflicts. There is nothing comparable in Asia to
either the European Union or NATO. None of the three regional
associations—ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), ARF (Asian
Regional Forum, ASEAN’s platform for a political-security dialogue), and
APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Group)—even remotely
approximates the web of multilateral and regional cooperative ties that
bind Europe together.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Asia is today the seat of the world’s greatest
concentration of rising and recently awakened mass nationalisms, fueled
by sudden access to mass communications, hyperactivated by expanding
social expectations generated by growing economic prosperity as well as
by widening disparities in social wealth, and made more susceptible to
political mobilization by the explosive increase both in population and
urbanization. This condition is rendered even more ominous by the scale
of Asia’s arms buildup. In 1995, the region became—according to the
International Institute of Strategic Studies—the world’s biggest
importer of arms, outstripping Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>In brief, East Asia is seething with dynamic activity, which so far
has been channeled in peaceful directions by the region’s rapid pace of
economic growth. But that safety valve could at some point be
overwhelmed by unleashed political passions, once they have been
triggered by some flash point, even a relatively trivial one. The
potential for such a flash point is present in a large number of
contentious issues, each vulnerable to demagogic exploitation and thus
potentially explosive:</p>
<p>• China’s resentment of Taiwan’s separate status is intensifying as
China gains in strength and as the increasingly prosperous Taiwan begins
to flirt with a formally separate status as a nation-state.</p>
<p>• The Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea pose the
risk of a collision between China and several Southeast Asian states
over access to potentially valuable seabed energy sources, with China
imperially viewing the South China Sea as its legitimate national
patrimony.</p>
<p>• The Senkaku Islands are contested by both Japan and China (with the
rivals Taiwan and mainland China ferociously of a single mind on this
issue), and the historical rivalry for regional preeminence between
Japan and China infuses this issue with symbolic significance as
well.</p>
<p>• The division of Korea and the inherent instability of North
Korea—made all the more dangerous by North Korea’s quest for nuclear
capability—pose the risk that a sudden explosion could engulf the
peninsula in warfare, which in turn would engage the United States and
indirectly involve Japan.</p>
<p>• The issue of the southernmost Kuril Islands, unilaterally seized in
1945 by the Soviet Union, continues to paralyze and poison
Russo-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>• Other latent territorial-ethnic conflicts involve Russo-Chinese,
Chinese-Vietnamese, Japanese-Korean, and Chinese-Indian border issues;
ethnic unrest in Xinjiang Province; and Chinese-Indonesian disputes over
oceanic boundaries. (See map above.)</p>
<p>The distribution of power in the region is also unbalanced. China,
with its nuclear arsenal and its large armed forces, is clearly the
dominant military power (see table on page 156). The Chinese navy has
already adopted a strategic doctrine of “offshore active defense,”
seeking to acquire within the next fifteen years an oceangoing
capability for “effective control of the seas within the first island
chain,” meaning the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. To be sure,
Japan’s military capability is also increasing, and in terms of quality,
it has no regional peer. At present, however, the Japanese armed forces
are not a tool of Japanese foreign policy and are</p>
<p>Asian Armed Forces</p>
<p>largely viewed as an extension of the American military presence in
the region.</p>
<p>The emergence of China has already prompted its southeastern
neighbors to be increasingly deferential to Chinese concerns. It is
noteworthy that during the minicrisis of early 1996 concerning Taiwan
(in which China engaged in some threatening military maneuvers and
barred air and sea access to a zone near Taiwan, precipitating a
demonstrative U.S. naval deployment), the foreign minister of Thailand
hastily declared that such a ban was normal, his Indonesian counterpart
stated that this was purely a Chinese affair, and the Philippines and
Malaysia declared a policy of neutrality on the issue.</p>
<p>The absence of a regional balance of power has in recent years
prompted both Australia and Indonesia—heretofore rather wary of each
other—to initiate growing military coordination. Both countries made
little secret of their anxiety over the longer-range prospects of
Chinese regional military domination and over the staying power of the
United States as the region’s security guarantor. This concern has also
caused Singapore to explore closer security cooperation with these
nations. In fact, throughout the region, the central but unanswered
question among strategists has become this: “For how long can peace in
the world’s most populated and increasingly most armed region be assured
by one hundred thousand American soldiers, and for how much longer in
any case are they likely to stay?”</p>
<p>It is in this volatile setting of intensifying nationalisms,
increasing populations, growing prosperity, exploding expectations, and
overlapping power aspirations that genuinely tectonic shifts are
occurring in East Asia’s geopolitical landscape:</p>
<p>• China, whatever its specific prospects, is a rising and potentially
dominant power.</p>
<p>• America’s security role is becoming increasingly dependent on
collaboration with Japan.</p>
<p>• Japan is groping for a more defined and autonomous political
role.</p>
<p>• Russia’s role has greatly diminished, while the formerly
Russian-dominated Central Asia has become an object of international
rivalry.</p>
<p>• The division of Korea is becoming less tenable, making Korea’s
future orientation a matter of increasing geostrategic interest to its
major neighbors.</p>
<p>These tectonic shifts give added salience to the two central issues
posed at the outset of this chapter.</p>
