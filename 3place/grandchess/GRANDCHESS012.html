<h4 id="the-dilemma-of-the-one-alternative">THE DILEMMA OF THE ONE
ALTERNATIVE</h4>
<p>Russia’s only real geostrategic option—the option that could give
Russia a realistic international role and also maximize the opportunity
of transforming and socially modernizing itself—is Europe. And not just
any Europe, but the transatlantic Europe of the enlarging EU and NATO.
Such a Europe is taking shape, as we have seen in chapter 3, and it is
also likely to remain linked closely to America. That is the Europe to
which Russia will have to relate, if it is to avoid dangerous
geopolitical isolation.</p>
<p>For America, Russia is much too weak to be a partner but still too
strong to be simply its patient. It is more likely to become a problem,
unless America fosters a setting that helps to convince the Russians
that the best choice for their country is an increasingly organic
connection with a transatlantic Europe. Although a long-term
Russo-Chinese and Russo-Iranian strategic alliance is not likely, it is
obviously important for America to avoid policies that could distract
Russia from making the needed geopolitical choice. To the extent
possible, American relations with China and Iran should, therefore, be
formulated with their impact on Russian geopolitical calculations also
kept in mind. Perpetuating illusions regarding grand geostrategic
options can only delay the historic choice that Russia must make in
order to bring to an end its deep malaise.</p>
<p>Only a Russia that is willing to accept the new realities of Europe,
both economic and geopolitical, will be able to benefit internally from
the enlarging scope of transcontinental European cooperation in
commerce, communications, investment, and education. Russia’s
participation in the Council of Europe is thus a step very much in the
right direction. It is a foretaste of further institutional links
between the new Russia and the growing Europe. It also implies that if
Russia pursues this path, it will have no choice other than eventually
to emulate the course chosen by post-Ottoman Turkey, when it decided to
shed its imperial ambitions and embarked very deliberately on the road
of modernization, Europeanization, and democratization.</p>
<p>No other option can offer Russia the benefits that a modern, rich,
and democratic Europe linked to America can. Europe and America are not
a threat to a Russia that is a nonexpansive national and democratic
state. They have no territorial designs on Russia, which China someday
might have, nor do they share an insecure and potentially violent
frontier, which is certainly the case with Russia’s ethnically and
territorially unclear border with the Muslim nations to the south. On
the contrary, for Europe as well as for America, a national and
democratic Russia is a geopolitically desirable entity, a source of
stability in the volatile Eurasian complex.</p>
<p>Russia consequently faces the dilemma that the choice in favor of
Europe and America, in order for it to yield tangible benefits,
requires, first of all, a clear-cut abjuration of the imperial past and,
second, no tergiversation regarding the enlarging Europe’s political and
security links with America. The first requirement means accommodation
to the geopolitical pluralism that has come to prevail in the space of
the former Soviet Union. Such accommodation does not exclude economic
cooperation, rather on the model of the old European Free Trade Area,
but it cannot include limits on the political sovereignty of the new
states—for the simple reason that they do not wish it. Most important in
that respect is the need for clear and unambiguous acceptance by Russia
of Ukraine’s separate existence, of its borders, and of its distinctive
national identity.</p>
<p>The second requirement may be even more difficult to swallow. A truly
cooperative relationship with the transatlantic community cannot be
based on the notion that those democratic states of Europe that wish to
be part of it can be excluded because of a Russian say-so. The expansion
of that community need not be rushed, and it certainly should not be
promoted on an anti-Russian theme. But neither can it, nor should it, be
halted by a political fiat that itself reflects an antiquated notion of
European security relations. An expanding and democratic Europe has to
be an open-ended historical process, not subject to politically
arbitrary geographic limits.</p>
<p>For many Russians, the dilemma of the one alternative may at first,
and for some time to come, be too difficult to resolve. It will require
an enormous act of political will and perhaps also an outstanding
leader, capable of making the choice and articulating the vision of a
democratic, national, truly modern and European Russia. That may not
happen for some time. Overcoming the post-Communist and postimperial
crises will require not only more time than is the case with the
post-Communist transformation of Central Europe but also the emergence
of a farsighted and stable political leadership. No Russian Ataturk is
now in sight. Nonetheless, Russians will eventually have to come to
recognize that Russia’s national redefinition is not an act of
capitulation but one of liberation.19 They will have to accept that what
Yeltsin said in Kiev in 1990 about a nonimperial future for Russia was
absolutely on the mark. And a genuinely nonimperial Russia will still be
a great power, spanning Eurasia, the world’s largest territorial unit by
far.</p>
<p>In any case, a redefinition of “What is Russia and where is Russia”
will probably occur only by stages, and it will require a wise and firm
Western posture. America and Europe will have to help. They should offer
Russia not only a special treaty or charter with NATO, but they should
also begin the process of exploring with Russia the shaping of an
eventual transcontinental system of security and cooperation that goes
considerably beyond the loose structure of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). And if Russia consolidates its
internal democratic institutions and makes tangible progress in
free-market-based economic development, its ever-closer association with
NATO and the EU should not be ruled out.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is equally important for the West, especially
for America, to pursue policies that perpetuate the dilemma of the one
alternative for Russia. The political and economic stabilization of the
new post-Soviet states is a major factor in necessitating Russia’s
historical self-redefinition. Hence, support for the new post-Soviet
states—for geopolitical pluralism in the space of the former Soviet
empire—has to be an integral part of a policy designed to induce Russia
to exercise unambiguously its European option. Among these states, three
are geopolitically especially important: Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and
Ukraine.</p>
<p>An independent Azerbaijan can serve as a corridor for Western access
to the energy-rich Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia. Conversely, a
subdued Azerbaijan would mean that Central Asia can be sealed off from
the outside world and thus rendered politically vulnerable to Russian
pressures for reintegration. Uzbekistan, nationally the most vital and
the most populous of the Central Asian states, represents a major
obstacle to any renewed Russian control over the region. Its
independence is critical to the survival of the other Central Asian
states, and it is the least vulnerable to Russian pressures.</p>
<p>Most important, however, is Ukraine. As the EU and NATO expand,
Ukraine will eventually be in the position to choose whether it wishes
to be part of either organization. It is likely that, in order to
reinforce its separate status, Ukraine will wish to join both, once they
border upon it and once its own internal transformation begins to
qualify it for membership. Although that will take time, it is not too
early for the West—while further enhancing its economic and security
ties with Kiev—to begin pointing to the decade 2005–2015 as a reasonable
time frame for the initiation of Ukraine’s progressive inclusion,
thereby reducing the risk that the Ukrainians may fear that Europe’s
expansion will halt on the Polish-Ukrainian border.</p>
<p>Russia, despite its protestations, is likely to acquiesce in the
expansion of NATO in 1999 to include several Central European countries,
because the cultural and social gap between Russia and Central Europe
has widened so much since the fall of communism. By contrast, Russia
will find it incomparably harder to acquiesce in Ukraine’s accession to
NATO, for to do so would be to acknowledge that Ukraine’s destiny is no
longer organically linked to Russia’s. Yet if Ukraine is to survive as
an independent state, it will have to become part of Central Europe
rather than Eurasia, and if it is to be part of Central Europe, then it
will have to partake fully of Central Europe’s links to NATO and the
European Union. Russia’s acceptance of these links would then define
Russia’s own decision to be also truly a part of Europe. Russia’s
refusal would be tantamount to the rejection of Europe in favor of a
solitary “Eurasian” identity and existence.</p>
<p>The key point to bear in mind is that Russia cannot be in Europe
without Ukraine also being in Europe, whereas Ukraine can be in Europe
without Russia being in Europe. Assuming that Russia decides to cast its
lot with Europe, it follows that ultimately it is in Russia’s own
interest that Ukraine be included in the expanding European structures.
Indeed, Ukraine’s relationship to Europe could be the turning point for
Russia itself. But that also means that the defining moment for Russia’s
relationship to Europe is still some time off—“defining” in the sense
that Ukraine’s choice in favor of Europe will bring to a head Russia’s
decision regarding the next phase of its history: either to be a part of
Europe as well or to become a Eurasian outcast, neither truly of Europe
nor Asia and mired in its “near abroad” conflicts.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that a cooperative relationship between an
enlarging Europe and Russia can move from formal bilateral links to more
organic and binding economic, political, and security ties. In that
manner, in the course of the first two decades of the next century,
Russia could increasingly become an integral part of a Europe that
embraces not only Ukraine but reaches to the Urals and even beyond. An
association or even some form of membership for Russia in the European
and transatlantic structures would in turn open the doors to the
inclusion of the three Caucasian countries—Georgia, Armenia, and
Azerbaijan—that so desperately aspire to a European connection.</p>
<p>One cannot predict how fast that process can move, but one thing is
certain: it will move faster if a geopolitical context is shaped that
propels Russia in that direction, while foreclosing other temptations.
And the faster Russia moves toward Europe, the sooner the black hole of
Eurasia will be filled by a society that is increasingly modern and
democratic. Indeed, for Russia the dilemma of the one alternative is no
longer a matter of making a geopolitical choice but of facing up to the
imperatives of survival.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5</p>
<p>The Eurasian Balkans</p>
<p>IN EUROPE, THE WORD “BALKANS” conjures up images of ethnic conflicts
and great-power regional rivalries. Eurasia, too, has its “Balkans,” but
the Eurasian Balkans are much larger, more populated, even more
religiously and ethnically heterogeneous. They are located within that
large geographic oblong that demarcates the central zone of global
instability identified in chapter 2 and that embraces portions of
southeastern Europe, Central Asia and parts of South Asia, the Persian
Gulf area, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Eurasian Balkans form the inner core of that large oblong (see
map on page 124), and they differ from its outer zone in one
particularly significant way: they are a power vacuum. Although most of
the states located in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East are also
unstable, American power is that region’s ultimate arbiter. The unstable
region in the outer zone is thus an area of single power hegemony and is
tempered by that hegemony. In contrast, the Eurasian Balkans are truly
reminiscent of the older, more familiar Balkans of southeastern Europe:
not only are its political entities unstable but they tempt and invite
the intrusion of more powerful neighbors, each of whom is determined to
oppose the region’s domination by another. It is this familiar
combination of a power vacuum and power suction that justifies the
appellation “Eurasian Balkans.”</p>
<p>The traditional Balkans represented a potential geopolitical prize in
the struggle for European supremacy. The Eurasian Balkans, astride the
inevitably emerging transportation network meant to link more directly
Eurasia’s richest and most industrious western and eastern extremities,
are also geopolitically significant. Moreover, they are of importance
from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least
three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors, namely,
Russia, Turkey, and Iran, with China also signaling an increasing
political interest in the region. But the Eurasian Balkans are
infinitely more important as a potential economic prize: an enormous
concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region,
in addition to important minerals, including gold.</p>
<p>The world’s energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the
next two or three decades. Estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy
anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between
1993 and 2015, with the most significant increase in consumption
occurring in the Far East. The momentum of Asia’s economic development
is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and
exploitation of new sources of energy, and the Central Asian region and
the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and
oil that dwarf those of Kuwait, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North
Sea.</p>
<p>Access to that resource and sharing in its potential wealth represent
objectives that stir national ambitions, motivate corporate interests,
rekindle historical claims, revive imperial aspirations, and fuel
international rivalries. The situation is made all the more volatile by
the fact that the region is not only a power vacuum but is also
internally unstable. Every one of its countries suffers from serious
internal difficulties, all of them have frontiers that are either the
object of claims by neighbors or are zones of ethnic resentment, few are
nationally homogeneous, and some are already embroiled in territorial,
ethnic, or religious violence.</p>
