<h4 id="geostrategic-phantasmagoria">GEOSTRATEGIC PHANTASMAGORIA</h4>
<p>A period of historic and strategic confusion in postimperial Russia
was hence unavoidable. The shocking collapse of the Soviet Union and
especially the stunning and generally unexpected disintegration of the
Great Russian Empire have given rise in Russia to enormous
soul-searching, to a wide-ranging debate over what ought to be Russia’s
current historical self-definition, to intense public and private
arguments over questions that in most major nations are not even raised:
What is Russia? Where is Russia? What does it mean to be a Russian?</p>
<p>These questions are not merely theoretical: any reply contains
significant geopolitical content. Is Russia a national state, based on
purely Russian ethnicity, or is Russia by definition something more (as
Britain is more than England) and hence destined to be an imperial
state? What are—historically, strategically, and ethnically—the proper
frontiers of Russia? Should the independent Ukraine be viewed as a
temporary aberration when assessed in such historic, strategic, and
ethnic terms? (Many Russians are inclined to feel that way.) To be a
Russian, does one have to be ethnically a Russian (“Russkyi”), or can
one be a Russian politically but not ethnically (that is, be a
“Rossyanin”—the equivalent to “British” but not to “English”)? For
example, Yeltsin and some Russians have argued (with tragic
consequences) that the Chechens could—indeed, should—be considered
Russians.</p>
<p>A year before the Soviet Union’s demise, a Russian nationalist, one
of the few who saw the end approaching, cried out in a desperate
affirmation:</p>
<p>If the terrible disaster, which is unthinkable to the Russian people,
does occur and the state is torn apart, and the people, robbed and
deceived by their 1,000-year history, suddenly end up alone, and their
recent “brothers” have taken their belongings and disappeared into their
“national lifeboats” and sail away from the listing ship—well, we have
nowhere to go….</p>
<p>Russian statehood, which embodies the “Russian idea” politically,
economically, and spiritually, will be built anew. It will gather up all
the best from its long 1,000-year kingdom and the 70 years of Soviet
history that have flown by in a moment.12</p>
<p>But how? The difficulty of defining an answer that would be
acceptable to the Russian people and yet realistic has been compounded
by the historic crisis of the Russian state itself. Throughout almost
its entire history, that state was simultaneously an instrument of
territorial expansion and economic development. It was also a state that
deliberately did not conceive itself to be a purely national instrument,
in the West European tradition, but defined itself as the executor of a
special supranational mission, with the “Russian idea” variously defined
in religious, geopolitical, or ideological terms. Now, suddenly, that
mission was repudiated as the state shrank territorially to a largely
ethnic dimension.</p>
<p>Moreover, the post-Soviet crisis of the Russian state (of its
“essence,” so to speak) was compounded by the fact that Russia was not
only faced with the challenge of having been suddenly deprived of its
imperial missionary vocation but, in order to close the yawning gap
between Russia’s social backwardness and the more advanced parts of
Eurasia, was now being pressed by domestic modernizers (and their
Western consultants) to withdraw from its traditional economic role as
the mentor, owner, and disposer of social wealth. This called for
nothing short of a politically revolutionary limitation of the
international and domestic role of the Russian state. This was
profoundly disruptive to the most established patterns of Russian
domestic life and contributed to a divisive sense of geopolitical
disorientation within the Russian political elite.</p>
<p>In that perplexing setting, as one might have expected, “Whither
Russia and what is Russia?” prompted a variety of responses. Russia’s
extensive Eurasian location has long predisposed that elite to think in
geopolitical terms. The first foreign minister of the postimperial and
post-Communist Russia, Andrei Kozyrev, reaffirmed that mode of thought
in one of his early attempts to define how the new Russia should conduct
itself on the international scene. Barely a month after the dissolution
of the Soviet Union, he noted: “In abandoning messianism we set course
for pragmatism…. we rapidly came to understand that geopolitics . . . is
replacing ideology.”13</p>
<p>Generally speaking, three broad and partially overlapping
geostrategic options, each ultimately related to Russia’s preoccupation
with its status vis-à-vis America and each also containing some internal
variants, can be said to have emerged in reaction to the Soviet Union’s
collapse. These several schools of thought can be classified as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>priority for “the mature strategic partnership” with America,
which for some of its adherents was actually a code term for a global
condominium;</p></li>
<li><p>emphasis on the “near abroad” as Russia’s central concern, with
some advocating a form of Moscow-dominated economic integration but with
others also expecting an eventual restoration of some measure of
imperial control, thereby creating a power more capable of balancing
America and Europe; and</p></li>
<li><p>a counteralliance, involving some sort of a Eurasian anti-U. S.
coalition designed to reduce the American preponderance in
Eurasia.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Although the first of the foregoing was initially dominant among
President Yeltsin’s new ruling team, the second option surfaced into
political prominence shortly thereafter, in part as a critique of
Yeltsin’s geopolitical priorities; the third made itself heard somewhat
later, around the mid-1990s, in reaction to the spreading sense that
Russia’s post-Soviet geostrategy was both unclear and failing. As it
happens, all three proved to be historically maladroit and derived from
rather phantasmagoric views of Russia’s current power, international
potential, and foreign interests.</p>
<p>In the immediate wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse, Yeltsin’s
initial posture represented the cresting of the old but never entirely
successful “westernizer” conception in Russian political thought: that
Russia belonged in the West, should be part of the West, and should as
much as possible imitate the West in its own domestic development. That
view was espoused by Yeltsin himself and by his foreign minister, with
Yeltsin being quite explicit in denouncing the Russian imperial legacy.
Speaking in Kiev on November 19, 1990, in words that the Ukrainians or
Chechens could subsequently turn against him, Yeltsin eloquently
declared:</p>
<p>Russia does not aspire to become the center of some sort of new
empire . . . Russia understands better than others the perniciousness of
that role, inasmuch as it was Russia that performed that role for a long
time. What did it gain from this? Did Russians become freer as a result?
Wealthier? Happier? . . . history has taught us that a people that rules
over others cannot be fortunate.</p>
<p>The deliberately friendly posture adopted by the West, especially by
the United States, toward the new Russian leadership was a source of
encouragement to the post-Soviet “westernizers” in the Russian foreign
policy establishment. It both reinforced its pro-American inclinations
and seduced its membership personally. The new leaders were flattered to
be on a first-name basis with the top policy makers of the world’s only
superpower, and they found it easy to deceive themselves into thinking
that they, too, were the leaders of a superpower. When the Americans
launched the slogan of “the mature strategic partnership” between
Washington and Moscow, to the Russians it seemed as if a new democratic
American-Russian condominium—replacing the former contest—had thus been
sanctified.</p>
<p>That condominium would be global in scope. Russia thereby would not
only be the legal successor to the former Soviet Union but the de facto
partner in a global accommodation, based on genuine equality. As the new
Russian leaders never tired of asserting, that meant not only that the
rest of the world should recognize Russia as America’s equal but that no
global problem could be tackled or resolved without Russia’s
participation and/or permission. Although it was not openly stated,
implicit in this illusion was also the notion that Central Europe would
somehow remain, or might even choose to remain, a region of special
political proximity to Russia. The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and
Comecon would not be followed by the gravitation of their former members
either toward NATO or even only toward the EU.</p>
<p>Western aid, in the meantime, would enable the Russian government to
undertake domestic reforms, withdrawing the state from economic life and
permitting the consolidation of democratic institutions. Russia’s
economic recovery, its special status as America’s coequal partner, and
its sheer attractiveness would then encourage the recently independent
states of the new CIS—grateful that the new Russia was not threatening
them and increasingly aware of the benefits of some form of union with
Russia—to engage in ever-closer economic and then political integration
with Russia, thereby also enhancing Russia’s scope and power.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach was that it was devoid of either
international or domestic realism. While the concept of “mature
strategic partnership” was flattering, it was also deceptive. America
was neither inclined to share global power with Russia nor could it,
even if it had wanted to do so. The new Russia was simply too weak, too
devastated by three-quarters of a century of Communist rule, and too
socially backward to be a real global partner. In Washington’s view,
Germany, Japan, and China were at least as important and influential.
Moreover, on some of the central geostrategic issues of national
interest to America—in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East—it was
far from the case that American and Russian aspirations were the same.
Once differences inevitably started to surface, the disproportion in
political power, financial clout, technological innovation, and cultural
appeal made the “mature strategic partnership” seem hollow—and it struck
an increasing number of Russians as deliberately designed to deceive
Russia.</p>
<p>Perhaps that disappointment might have been averted if earlier
on—during the American-Russian honeymoon—America had embraced the
concept of NATO expansion and had at the same time offered Russia “a
deal it could not refuse,” namely, a special cooperative relationship
between Russia and NATO. Had America clearly and decisively embraced the
idea of widening the alliance, with the stipulation that Russia should
somehow be included in the process, perhaps Moscow’s subsequent sense of
disappointment with “the mature partnership” as well as the progressive
weakening of the political position of the westernizers in the Kremlin
might have been averted.</p>
<p>The moment to have done so was during the second half of 1993, right
after Yeltsin’s public endorsement in August of Poland’s interest in
joining the transatlantic alliance as being consistent with “the
interests of Russia.” Instead, the Clinton administration, then still
pursuing its “Russia first” policy, agonized for two more years, while
the Kremlin changed its tune and became increasingly hostile to the
emerging but indecisive signals of the American intention to widen NATO.
By the time Washington decided, in 1996, to make NATO enlargement a
central goal in America’s policy of shaping a larger and more secure
Euro-Atlantic community, the Russians had locked themselves into rigid
opposition. Hence, the year 1993 might be viewed as the year of a missed
historic opportunity.</p>
<p>Admittedly, not all of the Russian concerns regarding NATO expansion
lacked legitimacy or were motivated by malevolent motives. Some
opponents, to be sure, especially among the Russian military, partook of
a Cold War mentality, viewing NATO expansion not as an integral part of
Europe’s own growth but rather as the advance toward Russia of an
American-led and still hostile alliance. Some of the Russian foreign
policy elite—most of whom were actually former Soviet
officials—persisted in the long-standing geostrategic view that America
had no place in Eurasia and that NATO expansion was largely driven by
the American desire to increase its sphere of influence. Some of their
opposition also derived from the hope that an unattached Central Europe
would some day again revert to Moscow’s sphere of geopolitical
influence, once Russia had regained its health.</p>
<p>But many Russian democrats also feared that the expansion of NATO
would mean that Russia would be left outside of Europe, ostracized
politically, and considered unworthy of membership in the institutional
framework of European civilization. Cultural insecurity compounded the
political fears, making NATO expansion seem like the culmination of the
long-standing Western policy designed to isolate Russia, leaving it
alone in the world and vulnerable to its various enemies. Moreover, the
Russian democrats simply could not grasp the depth either of the Central
Europeans’ resentment over half a century of Moscow’s domination or of
their desire to be part of a larger Euro-Atlantic system.</p>
<p>On balance, it is probable that neither the disappointment nor the
weakening of the Russian westernizers could have been avoided. For one
thing, the new Russian elite, quite divided within itself and with
neither its president nor its foreign minister capable of providing
consistent geostrategic leadership, was not able to define clearly what
the new Russia wanted in Europe, nor could it realistically assess the
actual limitations of Russia’s weakened condition. Moscow’s politically
embattled democrats could not bring themselves to state boldly that a
democratic Russia does not oppose the enlargement of the transatlantic
democratic community and that it wishes to be associated with it. The
delusion of a shared global status with America made it difficult for
the Moscow political elite to abandon the idea of a privileged
geopolitical position for Russia, not only in the area of the former
Soviet Union itself but even in regard to the former Central European
satellite states.</p>
<p>These developments played into the hands of the nationalists, who by
1994 were beginning to recover their voices, and the militarists, who by
then had become Yeltsin’s critically important domestic supporters.
Their increasingly shrill and occasionally threatening reactions to the
aspirations of the Central Europeans merely intensified the
determination of the former satellite states—mindful of their only
recently achieved liberation from Russian rule—to gain the safe haven of
NATO.</p>
<p>The gulf between Washington and Moscow was widened further by the
Kremlin’s unwillingness to disavow all of Stalin’s conquests. Western
public opinion, especially in Scandinavia but also in the United States,
was especially troubled by the ambiguity of the Russian attitude toward
the Baltic republics. While recognizing their independence and not
pressing for their membership in the CIS, even the democratic Russian
leaders periodically resorted to threats in order to obtain preferential
treatment for the large communities of Russian colonists who had
deliberately been settled in these countries during the Stalinist years.
The atmosphere was further clouded by the pointed unwillingness of the
Kremlin to denounce the secret Nazi-Soviet agreement of 1939 that had
paved the way for the forcible incorporation of these republics into the
Soviet Union. Even five years after the Soviet Union’s collapse,
spokesmen for the Kremlin insisted (in the official statement of
September 10, 1996) that in 1940 the Baltic states had voluntarily
“joined” the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The post-Soviet Russian elite had apparently also expected that the
West would aid in, or at least not impede, the restoration of a central
Russian role in the post-Soviet space. They thus resented the West’s
willingness to help the newly independent post-Soviet states consolidate
their separate political existence. Even while warning that a
“confrontation with the United States . . . is an option that should be
avoided,” senior Russian analysts of American foreign policy argued (not
altogether incorrectly) that the United States was seeking “the
reorganization of interstate relations in the whole of Eurasia . . .
whereby there was not one sole leading power on the continent but many
medium, relatively stable, and moderately strong ones . . . but
necessarily inferior to the United States in their individual or even
collective capabilities.”14</p>
<p>In this regard, Ukraine was critical. The growing American
inclination, especially by 1994, to assign a high priority to
American-Ukrainian relations and to help Ukraine sustain its new
national freedom was viewed by many in Moscow—even by its
“westernizers”—as a policy directed at the vital Russian interest in
eventually bringing Ukraine back into the common fold. That Ukraine will
eventually somehow be “reintegrated” remains an article of faith among
many members of the Russian political elite.15 As a result, Russia’s
geopolitical and historical questioning of Ukraine’s separate status
collided head-on with the American view that an imperial Russia could
not be a democratic Russia.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were purely domestic reasons that a “mature
strategic partnership” between two “democracies” proved to be illusory.
Russia was just too backward and too devastated by Communist rule to be
a viable democratic partner of the United States. That central reality
could not be obscured by high-sounding rhetoric about partnership.
Post-Soviet Russia, moreover, had made only a partial break with the
past. Almost all of its “democratic” leaders—even if genuinely
disillusioned with the Soviet past—were not only the products of the
Soviet system but former senior members of its ruling elite. They were
not former dissidents, as in Poland or the Czech Republic. The key
institutions of Soviet power—though weakened, demoralized, and
corrupted—were still there. Symbolic of that reality and of the
lingering hold of the Communist past was the historic centerpiece of
Moscow: the continued presence of the Lenin mausoleum. It was as if
post-Nazi Germany were governed by former middle-level Nazi “Gauleiters”
spouting democratic slogans, with a Hitler mausoleum still standing in
the center of Berlin.</p>
<p>The political weakness of the new democratic elite was compounded by
the very scale of the Russian economic crisis. The need for massive
reforms—for the withdrawal of the Russian state from the
economy—generated excessive expectations of Western, especially
American, aid. Although that aid, especially from Germany and America,
gradually did assume large proportions, even under the best of
circumstances it still could not prompt a quick economic recovery. The
resulting social dissatisfaction provided additional underpinning for a
mounting chorus of disappointed critics who alleged that the partnership
with the United States was a sham, beneficial to America but damaging to
Russia.</p>
<p>In brief, neither the objective nor the subjective preconditions for
an effective global partnership existed in the immediate years following
the Soviet Union’s collapse. The democratic “westernizers” simply wanted
too much and could deliver too little. They desired an equal
partnership—or, rather, a condominium—with America, a relatively free
hand within the CIS, and a geopolitical no-man’s-land in Central Europe.
Yet their ambivalence about Soviet history, their lack of realism
regarding global power, the depth of the economic crisis, and the
absence of widespread social support meant that they could not deliver
the stable and truly democratic Russia that the concept of equal
partnership implied. Russia first had to go through a prolonged process
of political reform, an equally long process of democratic
stabilization, and an even longer process of socioeconomic modernization
and then manage a deeper shift from an imperial to a national mindset
regarding the new geopolitical realities not only in Central Europe but
especially within the former Russian Empire before a real partnership
with America could become a viable geopolitical option.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the “near
abroad” priority became both the major critique of the pro-West option
as well as an early foreign policy alternative. It was based on the
argument that the “partnership” concept slighted what ought to be most
important to Russia: namely, its relations with the former Soviet
republics. The “near abroad” came to be the shorthand formulation for
advocacy of a policy that would place primary emphasis on the need to
reconstruct some sort of a viable framework, with Moscow as the
decision-making center, in the geopolitical space once occupied by the
Soviet Union. On this premise, there was widespread agreement that a
policy of concentration on the West, especially on America, was yielding
little and costing too much. It simply made it easier for the West to
exploit the opportunities created by the Soviet Union’s collapse.</p>
<p>However, the “near abroad” school of thought was a broad umbrella
under which several varying geopolitical conceptions could cluster. It
embraced not only the economic functionalists and determinists
(including some “westernizers”) who believed that the CIS could evolve
into a Moscow-led version of the EU but also others who saw in economic
integration merely one of several tools of imperial restoration that
could operate either under the CIS umbrella or through special
arrangements (formulated in 1996) between Russia and Belarus or among
Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan, and Kyrgyzstan; it also included Slavophile
romantics who advocated a Slavic Union of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus,
and, finally, proponents of the somewhat mystical notion of Eurasianism
as the substantive definition of Russia’s enduring historical
mission.</p>
<p>In its narrowest form, the “near abroad” priority involved the
perfectly reasonable proposition that Russia must first concentrate on
relations with the newly independent states, especially as all of them
remained tied to Russia by the realities of the deliberately fostered
Soviet policy of promoting economic interdependence among them. That
made both economic and geopolitical sense. The “common economic space,”
of which the new Russian leaders spoke often, was a reality that could
not be ignored by the leaders of the newly independent states.
Cooperation, and even some integration, was an economic necessity. Thus,
it was not only normal but desirable to promote joint CIS institutions
in order to reverse the economic disruptions and fragmentation produced
by the political breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>For some Russians, the promotion of economic integration was thus a
functionally effective and politically responsible reaction to what had
transpired. The analogy with the EU was often cited as pertinent to the
post-Soviet situation. A restoration of the empire was explicitly
rejected by the more moderate advocates of economic integration. For
example, an influential report entitled “A Strategy for Russia,” which
was issued as early as August 1992 by the Council for Foreign and
Defense Policy, a group of prominent personalities and government
officials, very pointedly advocated “post-imperial enlightened
integration” as the proper program for the post-Soviet “common economic
space.”</p>
<p>However, emphasis on the “near abroad” was not merely a politically
benign doctrine of regional economic cooperation. Its geopolitical
content had imperial overtones. Even the relatively moderate 1992 report
spoke of a recovered Russia that would eventually establish a strategic
partnership with the West, in which Russia would have the role of
“regulating the situation in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Far
East.” Other advocates of this priority were more unabashed, speaking
explicitly of Russia’s “exclusive role” in the post-Soviet space and
accusing the West of engaging in an anti-Russian policy by providing aid
to Ukraine and the other newly independent states.</p>
<p>A typical but by no means extreme example was the argument made by Y.
Ambartsumov, the chairman in 1993 of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs
Committee and a former advocate of the “partnership” priority, who
openly asserted that the former Soviet space was an exclusive Russian
sphere of geopolitical influence. In January 1994, he was echoed by the
heretofore energetic advocate of the pro-Western priority, Foreign
Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who stated that Russia “must preserve its
military presence in regions that have been in its sphere of interest
for centuries.” In fact, Izvestiia reported on April 8, 1994, that
Russia had succeeded in retaining no fewer than twenty-eight military
bases on the soil of the newly independent states—and a line drawn on a
map linking the Russian military deployments in Kaliningrad, Moldova,
Crimea, Armenia, Tajikistan, and the Kuril Islands would roughly
approximate the outer limits of the former Soviet Union, as in the map
on page 108.</p>
<p>In September 1995, President Yeltsin issued an official document on
Russian policy toward the CIS that codified Russian goals as
follows:</p>
<p>The main objective of Russia’s policy toward the CIS is to create an
economically and politically integrated association of states capable of
claiming its proper place in the world community . . . to consolidate
Russia as the leading force in the formation of a new system of
interstate political and economic relations on the territory of the
post-Union space.</p>
<p>One should note the emphasis placed on the political dimension of the
effort, on the reference to a single entity claiming “its” place in the
world system, and on Russia’s dominant role within that new entity. In
keeping with this emphasis, Moscow insisted that political and military
ties between Russia and the newly constituted CIS also be reinforced:
that a common military command be created; that the armed forces of the
CIS states be linked by a formal treaty; that the “external” borders of
the CIS be subject to centralized (meaning Moscow’s) control; that
Russian forces play the decisive role in any peacekeeping actions within
the CIS; and that a common foreign policy be shaped within the CIS,
whose main institutions have come to be located in Moscow (and not in
Minsk, as originally agreed in l991), with the Russian president
presiding at the CIS summit meetings.</p>
<p>And that was not all. The September 1995 document also declared
that</p>
<p>Russian television and radio broadcasting in the near abroad should
be guaranteed, the dissemination of Russian press in the region should
be supported, and Russia should train national cadres for CIS
states.</p>
<p>Special attention should be given to restoring Russia’s position as
the main educational center on the territory of the post-Soviet space,
bearing in mind the need to educate the young generation in CIS states
in a spirit of friendly relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Reflecting this mood, in early 1996 the Russian Duma went so far as
to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union to be invalid. Moreover,
during spring of the same year, Russia signed two agreements providing
for closer economic and political integration between Russia and the
more accommodating members of the CIS. One agreement, signed with great
pomp and circumstance, in effect provided for a union between Russia and
Belarus within a new “Community of Sovereign Republics” (the Russian
abbreviation “SSR” was pointedly reminiscent of the Soviet Union’s
“SSSR”), and the other—signed by Russia, Kazakstan, Belarus, and
Kyrgyzstan—postulated the creation in the long term of a “Community of
Integrated States.” Both initiatives indicated impatience over the slow
progress of integration within the CIS and Russia’s determination to
persist in promoting it.</p>
<p>The “near abroad” emphasis on enhancing the central mechanisms of the
CIS thus combined some elements of reliance on objective economic
determinism with a strong dose of subjective imperial determination. But
neither provided a more philosophical and also a geopolitical answer to
the still gnawing question “What is Russia, what is its true mission and
rightful scope?”</p>
<p>It was this void that the increasingly appealing doctrine of
Eurasianism—with its focus also on the “near abroad”—attempted to fill.
The point of departure for this orientation—defined in rather cultural
and even mystical terminology—was the premise that geopolitically and
culturally, Russia is neither quite European nor quite Asian and that,
therefore, it has a distinctive Eurasian identity of its own. That
identity is the legacy of Russia’s unique spatial control over the
enormous landmass between Central Europe and the shores of the Pacific
Ocean, the legacy of the imperial statehood that Moscow forged through
four centuries of eastward expansion. That expansion assimilated into
Russia a large non-Russian and non-European population, creating thereby
also a singular Eurasian political and cultural personality.</p>
<p>Eurasianism as a doctrine was not a post-Soviet emanation. It first
surfaced in the nineteenth century but became more pervasive in the
twentieth, as an articulate alternative to Soviet communism and as a
reaction to the alleged decadence of the West. Russian émigrés were
especially active in propagating the doctrine as an alternative to
Sovietism, realizing that the national awakening of the non-Russians
within the Soviet Union required an overarching supranational doctrine,
lest the eventual fall of communism lead also to the disintegration of
the old Great Russian Empire.</p>
<p>As early as the mid-1920s, this case was articulated persuasively by
Prince N. S. Trubetzkoy, a leading exponent of Eurasianism, who wrote
that</p>
<ul>
<li>〔c〕ommunism was in fact a disguised version of Europeanism in
destroying the spiritual foundations and national uniqueness of Russian
life, in propagating there the materialist frame of reference that
actually governs both Europe and America . . .</li>
</ul>
<p>Our task is to create a completely new culture, our own culture,
which will not resemble European civilization . . . when Russia ceases
to be a distorted reflection of European civilization . . . when she
becomes once again herself: Russia-Eurasia, the conscious heir to and
bearer of the great legacy of Genghis Khan.16</p>
<p>That view found an eager audience in the confused post-Soviet
setting. On the one hand, communism was condemned as a betrayal of
Russian orthodoxy and of the special, mystical “Russian idea”; and on
the other, westernism was repudiated because the West, especially
America, was seen as corrupt, anti-Russian culturally, and inclined to
deny to Russia its historically and geographically rooted claim to
exclusive control over the Eurasian landmass.</p>
<p>Eurasianism was given an academic gloss in the much-quoted writings
of Lev Gumilev, a historian, geographer, and ethnographer , whose books
Medieval Russia and the Great Steppe, The Rhythms of Eurasia, and The
Geography of Ethnos in Historical Time make a powerful case for the
proposition that Eurasia is the natural geographic setting for the
Russian people’s distinctive “ethnos,” the consequence of a historic
symbiosis between them and the non-Russian inhabitants of the open
steppes, creating thereby a unique Eurasian cultural and spiritual
identity. Gumilev warned that adaptation to the West would mean nothing
less for the Russian people than the loss of their own “ethnos and
soul.”</p>
<p>These views were echoed, though more primitively, by a variety of
Russian nationalist politicians. Yeltsin’s former vice president,
Aleksandr Rutskoi, for example, asserted that “it is apparent from
looking at our country’s geopolitical situation that Russia represents
the only bridge between Asia and Europe. Whoever becomes the master of
this space will become the master of the world.”17 Yeltsin’s 1996
Communist challenger, Gennadii Zyuganov, despite his Marxist-Leninist
vocation, embraced Eurasianism’s mystical emphasis on the special
spiritual and missionary role of the Russian people in the vast spaces
of Eurasia, arguing that Russia was thereby endowed both with a unique
cultural vocation and with a specially advantageous geographic basis for
the exercise of global leadership.</p>
<p>A more sober and pragmatic version of Eurasianism was also advanced
by the leader of Kazakstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Faced at home with an
almost even demographic split between native Kazaks and Russian settlers
and seeking a formula that would somewhat dilute Moscow’s pressures for
political integration, Nazarbayev propagated the concept of the
“Eurasian Union” as an alternative to the faceless and ineffective CIS.
Although his version lacked the mystical content of the more traditional
Eurasianist thinking and certainly did not posit a special missionary
role for the Russians as leaders of Eurasia, it was derived from the
notion that Eurasia—defined geographically in terms analogous to that of
the Soviet Union—constituted an organic whole, which must also have a
political dimension.</p>
<p>To a degree, the attempt to assign to the “near abroad” the highest
priority in Russian geopolitical thinking was justified in the sense
that some measure of order and accommodation between postimperial Russia
and the newly independent states was an absolute necessity, in terms of
security and economics. However, what gave much of the discussion a
surrealistic touch was the lingering notion that in some fashion,
whether it came about either voluntarily (because of economics) or as a
consequence of Russia’s eventual recovery of its lost power—not to speak
of Russia’s special Eurasian or Slavic mission—the political
“integration” of the former empire was both desirable and feasible.</p>
<p>In this regard, the frequently invoked comparison with the EU
neglects a crucial distinction: the EU, even allowing for Germany’s
special influence, is not dominated by a single power that alone
overshadows all the other members combined, in relative GNP, population,
or territory. Nor is the EU the successor to a national empire, with the
liberated members deeply suspicious that “integration” is a code word
for renewed subordination. Even so, one can easily imagine what the
reaction of the European states would have been if Germany had declared
formally that its goal was to consolidate and expand its leading role in
the EU along the lines of Russia’s pronouncement of September 1995 cited
earlier.</p>
<p>The analogy with the EU suffers from yet another deficiency. The open
and relatively developed Western European economies were ready for
democratic integration, and the majority of Western Europeans perceived
tangible economic and political benefits in such integration. The poorer
West European countries were also able to benefit from substantial
subsidies. In contrast, the newly independent states viewed Russia as
politically unstable, as still entertaining domineering ambitions, and,
economically, as an obstacle to their participation in the global
economy and to their access to much-needed foreign investment.</p>
<p>Opposition to Moscow’s notions of “integration” was particularly
strong in Ukraine. Its leaders quickly recognized that such
“integration,” especially in light of Russian reservations regarding the
legitimacy of Ukrainian independence, would eventually lead to the loss
of national sovereignty. Moreover, the heavy-handed Russian treatment of
the new Ukrainian state—its unwillingness to grant recognition of
Ukraine’s borders, its questioning of Ukraine’s right to Crimea, its
insistence on exclusive extraterritorial control over the port of
Sevastopol—gave the aroused Ukrainian nationalism a distinctively
anti-Russian edge. The self-definition of Ukrainian nationhood, during
the critical formative stage in the history of the new state, was thus
diverted from its traditional anti-Polish or anti-Romanian orientation
and became focused instead on opposition to any Russian proposals for a
more integrated CIS, for a special Slavic community (with Russia and
Belarus), or for a Eurasian Union, deciphering them as Russian imperial
tactics.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s determination to preserve its independence was encouraged
by external support. Although initially the West, especially the United
States, had been tardy in recognizing the geopolitical importance of a
separate Ukrainian state, by the mid-l990s both America and Germany had
become strong backers of Kiev’s separate identity. In July 1996, the
U.S. secretary of defense declared, “I cannot overestimate the
importance of Ukraine as an independent country to the security and
stability of all of Europe,” while in September, the German
chancellor—notwithstanding his strong support for President Yeltsin—went
even further in declaring that “Ukraine’s firm place in Europe can no
longer be challenged by anyone . . . No one will be able any more to
dispute Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity.” American
policy makers also came to describe the American-Ukrainian relationship
as “a strategic partnership,” deliberately invoking the same phrase used
to describe the American-Russian relationship.</p>
<p>Without Ukraine, as already noted, an imperial restoration based
either on the CIS or on Eurasianism was not a viable option. An empire
without Ukraine would eventually mean a Russia that would become more
“Asianized” and more remote from Europe. Moreover, Eurasianism was also
not especially appealing to the newly independent Central Asians, few of
whom were eager for a new union with Moscow. Uzbekistan became
particularly assertive in supporting Ukraine’s objections to any
elevation of the CIS into a supranational entity and in opposing the
Russian initiatives designed to enhance the CIS.</p>
<p>Other CIS states, also wary of Moscow’s intentions, tended to cluster
around Ukraine and Uzbekistan in opposing or evading Moscow’s pressures
for closer political and military integration. Moreover, a sense of
national consciousness was deepening in almost all of the new states, a
consciousness increasingly focused on repudiating past submission to
Moscow as colonialism and on eradicating its various legacies. Thus,
even the ethnically vulnerable Kazakstan joined the other Central Asian
states in abandoning the Cyrillic alphabet and replacing it with the
Latin script as adapted earlier by Turkey. In effect, by the mid-l990s a
bloc, quietly led by Ukraine and comprising Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Azerbaijan, and sometimes also Kazakstan, Georgia, and Moldova, had
informally emerged to obstruct Russian efforts to use the CIS as the
tool for political integration.</p>
<p>Ukrainian insistence on only limited and largely economic integration
had the further effect of depriving the notion of a “Slavic Union” of
any practical meaning. Propagated by some Slavophiles and given
prominence by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s support, this idea automatically
became geopolitically meaningless once it was repudiated by Ukraine. It
left Belarus alone with Russia; and it also implied a possible partition
of Kazakstan, with its Russian-populated northern regions potentially
part of such a union. Such an option was understandably not reassuring
to the new rulers of Kazakstan and merely intensified the anti-Russian
thrust of their nationalism. In Belarus, a Slavic Union without Ukraine
meant nothing less than incorporation into Russia, thereby also igniting
more volatile feelings of nationalist resentment.</p>
<p>These external obstacles to a “near abroad” policy were powerfully
reinforced by an important internal restraint: the mood of the Russian
people. Despite the rhetoric and the political agitation among the
political elite regarding Russia’s special mission in the space of the
former empire, the Russian people—partially out of sheer fatigue but
also out of pure common sense—showed little enthusiasm for any ambitious
program of imperial restoration. They favored open borders, open trade,
freedom of movement, and special status for the Russian language, but
political integration, especially if it was to involve economic costs or
require bloodshed, evoked little enthusiasm. The disintegration of the
“union” was regretted, its restoration favored; but public reaction to
the war in Chechnya indicated that any policy that went beyond the
application of economic leverage and/or political pressure would lack
popular support.</p>
<p>In brief, the ultimate geopolitical inadequacy of the “near abroad”
priority was that Russia was not strong enough politically to impose its
will and not attractive enough economically to be able to seduce the new
states. Russian pressure merely made them seek more external ties, first
and foremost with the West but in some cases also with China and the key
Islamic countries to the south. When Russia threatened to form its own
military bloc in response to NATO’s expansion, it begged the question
“With whom?” And it begged the even more painful answer: at the most,
maybe with Belarus and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The new states, if anything, were increasingly inclined to distrust
even perfectly legitimate and needed forms of economic integration with
Russia, fearing their potential political consequences. At the same
time, the notions of Russia’s alleged Eurasian mission and of the Slavic
mystique served only to isolate Russia further from Europe and, more
generally, from the West, thereby perpetuating the post-Soviet crisis
and delaying the needed modernization and westernization of Russian
society along the lines of what Kemal Ataturk did in Turkey in the wake
of the Ottoman Empire’s collapse. The “near abroad” option thus offered
Russia not a geopolitical solution but a geopolitical illusion.</p>
<p>If not a condominium with America and if not the “near abroad,” then
what other geostrategic option was open to Russia? The failure of the
Western orientation to produce the desired global co-equality with
America for a “democratic Russia,” which was more a slogan than reality,
caused a letdown among the democrats, whereas the reluctant recognition
that “reintegration” of the old empire was at best a remote possibility
tempted some Russian geopoliticians to toy with the idea of some sort of
counteralliance aimed at America’s hegemonic position in Eurasia.</p>
<p>In early 1996, President Yeltsin replaced his Western-oriented
foreign minister, Kozyrev, with the more experienced but also orthodox
former Communist international specialist Evgenniy Primakov, whose
long-standing interest has been Iran and China. Some Russian
commentators speculated that Primakov’s orientation might precipitate an
effort to forge a new “antihegemonic” coalition, formed around the three
powers with the greatest geopolitical stake in reducing America’s
primacy in Eurasia. Some of Primakov’s initial travel and comments
reinforced that impression. Moreover, the existing Sino-Iranian
connection in weapons trade as well as the Russian inclination to
cooperate in Iran’s efforts to increase its access to nuclear energy
seemed to provide a perfect fit for closer political dialogue and
eventual alliance. The result could, at least theoretically, bring
together the world’s leading Slavic power, the world’s most militant
Islamic power, and the world’s most populated and powerful Asian power,
thereby creating a potent coalition.</p>
<p>The necessary point of departure for any such counteralliance option
involved a renewal of the bilateral Sino-Russian connection,
capitalizing on the resentment among the political elites of both states
over the emergence of America as the only global superpower. In early
1996, Yeltsin traveled to Beijing and signed a declaration that
explicitly denounced global “hegemonic” tendencies, thereby implying
that the two states would align themselves against the United States. In
December, the Chinese prime minister, Li Peng, returned the visit, and
both sides not only reiterated their opposition to an international
system “dominated by one power” but also endorsed the reinforcement of
existing alliances. Russian commentators welcomed this development,
viewing it as a positive shift in the global correlation of power and as
an appropriate response to America’s sponsorship of NATO’s expansion.
Some even sounded gleeful that the Sino-Russian alliance would give
America its deserved comeuppance.</p>
<p>However, a coalition allying Russia with both China and Iran can
develop only if the United States is shortsighted enough to antagonize
China and Iran simultaneously. To be sure, that eventuality cannot be
excluded, and American conduct in 1995–1996 almost seemed consistent
with the notion that the United States was seeking an antagonistic
relationship with both Teheran and Beijing. However, neither Iran nor
China was prepared to cast its lot strategically with a Russia that was
both unstable and weak. Both realized that any such coalition, once it
went beyond some occasional tactical orchestration, would risk their
respective access to the more advanced world, with its exclusive
capacity for investment and with its needed cutting-edge technology.
Russia had too little to offer to make it a truly worthy partner in an
antihegemonic coalition.</p>
<p>In fact, lacking any shared ideology and united merely by an
“antihegemonic” emotion, any such coalition would be essentially an
alliance of a part of the Third World against the most advanced portions
of the First World. None of its members would gain much, and China
especially would risk losing its enormous investment inflows. For
Russia, too, “the phantom of a Russia-China alliance . . . would sharply
increase the chances that Russia would once again become restricted from
Western technology and capital,” as a critical Russian geopolitician
noted.18 The alignment would eventually condemn all of its participants,
whether two or three in number, to prolonged isolation and shared
backwardness.</p>
<p>Moreover, China would be the senior partner in any serious Russian
effort to jell such an “antihegemonic” coalition. Being more populous,
more industrious, more innovative, more dynamic, and harboring some
potential territorial designs on Russia, China would inevitably consign
Russia to the status of a junior partner, while at the same time lacking
the means (and probably any real desire) to help Russia overcome its
backwardness. Russia would thus become a buffer between an expanding
Europe and an expansionist China.</p>
<p>Finally, some Russian foreign affairs experts continued to entertain
the hope that a stalemate in European integration, including perhaps
internal Western disagreements over the future shape of NATO, might
eventually create at least tactical opportunities for a Russo-German or
a Russo-French flirtation, in either case to the detriment of Europe’s
transatlantic connection with America. This perspective was hardly new,
for throughout the Cold War, Moscow periodically tried to play either
the German or the French card. Nonetheless, it was not unreasonable for
some of Moscow’s geopoliticians to calculate that a stalemate in
European affairs could create tactical openings that might be exploited
to America’s disadvantage.</p>
<p>But that is about all that could thereby be attained: purely tactical
options. Neither France nor Germany is likely to forsake the American
connection. An occasional flirtation, especially with the French,
focused on some narrow issue, cannot be excluded—but a geopolitical
reversal of alliances would have to be preceded by a massive upheaval in
European affairs, a breakdown in European unification and in
transatlantic ties. And even then, it is unlikely that the European
states would be inclined to pursue a truly comprehensive geopolitical
alignment with a disoriented Russia.</p>
<p>Thus, none of the counteralliance options, in the final analysis,
offer a viable alternative. The solution to Russia’s new geopolitical
dilemmas will not be found in counteralliance, nor will it come about
through the illusion of a coequal strategic partnership with America or
in the effort to create some new politically and economically
“integrated” structure in the space of the former Soviet Union. All
evade the only choice that is in fact open to Russia.</p>
