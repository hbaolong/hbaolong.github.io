<h4 id="the-american-global-system">THE AMERICAN GLOBAL SYSTEM</h4>
<p>Although America’s international preeminence unavoidably evokes
similarities to earlier imperial systems, the differences are more
essential. They go beyond the question of territorial scope. American
global power is exercised through a global system of distinctively
American design that mirrors the domestic American experience. Central
to that domestic experience is the pluralistic character of both the
American society and its political system.</p>
<p>The earlier empires were built by aristocratic political elites and
were in most cases ruled by essentially authoritarian or absolutist
regimes. The bulk of the populations of the imperial states were either
politically indifferent or, in more recent times, infected by
imperialist emotions and symbols. The quest for national glory, “the
white man’s burden,” “la mission civilisatrice,” not to speak of the
opportunities for personal profit—all served to mobilize support for
imperial adventures and to sustain essentially hierarchical imperial
power pyramids.</p>
<p>The attitude of the American public toward the external projection of
American power has been much more ambivalent. The public supported
America’s engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect
of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The engagement of the United
States in the Cold War was initially endorsed more reluctantly, until
the Berlin blockade and the subsequent Korean War. After the Cold War
had ended, the emergence of the United States as the single global power
did not evoke much public gloating but rather elicited an inclination
toward a more limited definition of American responsibilities abroad.
Public opinion polls conducted in 1995 and 1996 indicated a general
public preference for “sharing” global power with others, rather than
for its monopolistic exercise.</p>
<p>Because of these domestic factors, the American global system
emphasizes the technique of co-optation (as in the case of defeated
rivals—Germany, Japan, and lately even Russia) to a much greater extent
than the earlier imperial systems did. It likewise relies heavily on the
indirect exercise of influence on dependent foreign elites, while
drawing much benefit from the appeal of its democratic principles and
institutions. All of the foregoing are reinforced by the massive but
intangible impact of the American domination of global communications,
popular entertainment, and mass culture and by the potentially very
tangible clout of America’s technological edge and global military
reach.</p>
<p>Cultural domination has been an underappreciated facet of American
global power. Whatever one may think of its aesthetic values, America’s
mass culture exercises a magnetic appeal, especially on the world’s
youth. Its attraction may be derived from the hedonistic quality of the
lifestyle it projects, but its global appeal is undeniable. American
television programs and films account for about three-fourths of the
global market. American popular music is equally dominant, while
American fads, eating habits, and even clothing are increasingly
imitated worldwide. The language of the Internet is English, and an
overwhelming proportion of the global computer chatter also originates
from America, influencing the content of global conversation. Lastly,
America has become a Mecca for those seeking advanced education, with
approximately half a million foreign students flocking to the United
States, with many of the ablest never returning home. Graduates from
American universities are to be found in almost every Cabinet on every
continent.</p>
<p>The style of many foreign democratic politicians also increasingly
emulates the American. Not only did John F. Kennedy find eager imitators
abroad, but even more recent (and less glorified) American political
leaders have become the object of careful study and political imitation.
Politicians from cultures as disparate as the Japanese and the British
(for example, the Japanese prime minister of the mid-1990s, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, and the British prime minister, Tony Blair—and note the
“Tony,” imitative of “Jimmy” Carter, “Bill” Clinton, or “Bob” Dole) find
it perfectly appropriate to copy Bill Clinton’s homey mannerisms,
populist common touch, and public relations techniques.</p>
<p>Democratic ideals, associated with the American political tradition,
further reinforce what some perceive as America’s “cultural
imperialism.” In the age of the most massive spread of the democratic
form of government, the American political experience tends to serve as
a standard for emulation. The spreading emphasis worldwide on the
centrality of a written constitution and on the supremacy of law over
political expediency, no matter how short-changed in practice, has drawn
upon the strength of American constitutionalism. In recent times, the
adoption by the former Communist countries of civilian supremacy over
the military (especially as a precondition for NATO membership) has also
been very heavily influenced by the U.S. system of civil-military
relations.</p>
<p>The appeal and impact of the democratic American political system has
also been accompanied by the growing attraction of the American
entrepreneurial economic model, which stresses global free trade and
uninhibited competition. As the Western welfare state, including its
German emphasis on “codetermination” between entrepreneurs and trade
unions, begins to lose its economic momentum, more Europeans are voicing
the opinion that the more competitive and even ruthless American
economic culture has to be emulated if Europe is not to fall further
behind. Even in Japan, greater individualism in economic behavior is
becoming recognized as a necessary concomitant of economic success.</p>
<p>The American emphasis on political democracy and economic development
thus combines to convey a simple ideological message that appeals to
many: the quest for individual success enhances freedom while generating
wealth. The resulting blend of idealism and egoism is a potent
combination. Individual self-fulfillment is said to be a God-given right
that at the same time can benefit others by setting an example and by
generating wealth. It is a doctrine that attracts the energetic, the
ambitious, and the highly competitive.</p>
<p>As the imitation of American ways gradually pervades the world, it
creates a more congenial setting for the exercise of the indirect and
seemingly consensual American hegemony. And as in the case of the
domestic American system, that hegemony involves a complex structure of
interlocking institutions and procedures, designed to generate consensus
and obscure asymmetries in power and influence. American global
supremacy is thus buttressed by an elaborate system of alliances and
coalitions that literally span the globe.</p>
<p>The Atlantic alliance, epitomized institutionally by NATO, links the
most productive and influential states of Europe to America, making the
United States a key participant even in intra-European affairs. The
bilateral political and military ties with Japan bind the most powerful
Asian economy to the United States, with Japan remaining (at least for
the time being) essentially an American protectorate. America also
participates in such nascent trans-Pacific multilateral organizations as
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), making itself a key
participant in that region’s affairs. The Western Hemisphere is
generally shielded from outside influences, enabling America to play the
central role in existing hemispheric multilateral organizations. Special
security arrangements in the Persian Gulf, especially after the brief
punitive mission in 1991 against Iraq, have made that economically vital
region into an American military preserve. Even the former Soviet space
is permeated by various American-sponsored arrangements for closer
cooperation with NATO, such as the Partnership for Peace.</p>
<p>In addition, one must consider as part of the American system the
global web of specialized organizations, especially the “international”
financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank can be said to represent “global” interests, and their
constituency may be construed as the world. In reality, however, they
are heavily American dominated and their origins are traceable to
American initiative, particularly the Bretton Woods Conference of
1944.</p>
<p>Unlike earlier empires, this vast and complex global system is not a
hierarchical pyramid. Rather, America stands at the center of an
interlocking universe, one in which power is exercised through
continuous bargaining, dialogue, diffusion, and quest for formal
consensus, even though that power originates ultimately from a single
source, namely, Washington, D.C. And that is where the power game has to
be played, and played according to America’s domestic rules. Perhaps the
highest compliment that the world pays to the centrality of the
democratic process in American global hegemony is the degree to which
foreign countries are themselves drawn into the domestic American
political bargaining. To the extent that they can, foreign governments
strive to mobilize those Americans with whom they share a special ethnic
or religious identity. Most foreign governments also employ American
lobbyists to advance their case, especially in Congress, in addition to
approximately one thousand special foreign interest groups registered as
active in America’s capital. American ethnic communities also strive to
influence U.S. foreign policy, with the Jewish, Greek, and Armenian
lobbies standing out as the most effectively organized.</p>
<p>American supremacy has thus produced a new international order that
not only replicates but institutionalizes abroad many of the features of
the American system itself. Its basic features include</p>
<p>• a collective security system, including integrated command and
forces (NATO, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and so forth);</p>
<p>• regional economic cooperation (APEC, NAFTA 〔North American Free
Trade Agreement〕) and specialized global cooperative institutions (the
World Bank, IMF, WTO 〔World Trade Organization〕);</p>
<p>• procedures that emphasize consensual decision making, even if
dominated by the United States;</p>
<p>• a preference for democratic membership within key alliances;</p>
<p>• a rudimentary global constitutional and judicial structure (ranging
from the World Court to a special tribunal to try Bosnian war
crimes).</p>
<p>Most of that system emerged during the Cold War, as part of America’s
effort to contain its global rival, the Soviet Union. It was thus
ready-made for global application, once that rival faltered and America
emerged as the first and only global power. Its essence has been well
encapsulated by the political scientist G. John Ikenberry:</p>
<p>It was hegemonic in the sense that it was centered around the United
States and reflected American-styled political mechanisms and organizing
principles. It was a liberal order in that it was legitimate and marked
by reciprocal interactions. Europeans 〔one may also add, the Japanese〕
were able to reconstruct and integrate their societies and economies in
ways that were congenial with American hegemony but also with room to
experiment with their own autonomous and semi-independent political
systems . . . The evolution of this complex system served to
“domesticate” relations among the major Western states. There have been
tense conflicts between these states from time to time, but the
important point is that conflict has been contained within a deeply
embedded, stable, and increasingly articulated political order. . . .
The threat of war is off the table.2</p>
<p>Currently, this unprecedented American global hegemony has no rival.
But will it remain unchallenged in the years to come?</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2</p>
<p>The Eurasian Chessboard</p>
<p>FOR AMERICA, THE CHIEF geopolitical prize is Eurasia. For half a
millennium, world affairs were dominated by Eurasian powers and peoples
who fought with one another for regional domination and reached out for
global power. Now a non-Eurasian power is preeminent in Eurasia—and
America’s global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how
effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is
sustained.</p>
<p>Obviously, that condition is temporary. But its duration, and what
follows it, is of critical importance not only to America’s well-being
but more generally to international peace. The sudden emergence of the
first and only global power has created a situation in which an equally
quick end to its supremacy—either because of America’s withdrawal from
the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival—would
produce massive international instability. In effect, it would prompt
global anarchy. The Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington is
right in boldly asserting:</p>
<p>A world without U.S. primacy will be a world with more violence and
disorder and less democracy and economic growth than a world where the
United States continues to have more influence than any other country in
shaping global affairs. The sustained international primacy of the
United States is central to the welfare and security of Americans and to
the future of freedom, democracy, open economies, and international
order in the world.3</p>
<p>In that context, how America “manages” Eurasia is critical. Eurasia
is the globe’s largest continent and is geopolitically axial. A power
that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most
advanced and economically productive regions. A mere glance at the map
also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically
entail Africa’s subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphere and
Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world’s central continent (see
map on page 32). About 75 percent of the world’s people live in Eurasia,
and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its
enterprises and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for about 60
percent of the world’s GNP and about three-fourths of the world’s known
energy resources (see tables on page 33).</p>
<p>Eurasia is also the location of most of the world’s politically
assertive and dynamic states. After the United States, the next six
largest economies and the next six biggest spenders on military weaponry
are located in Eurasia. All but one of the world’s overt nuclear powers
and all but one of the covert ones are located in Eurasia. The world’s
two most populous aspirants to regional hegemony and global influence
are Eurasian. All of the potential political and/or economic challengers
to American primacy are Eurasian. Cumulatively, Eurasia’s power vastly
overshadows America’s. Fortunately for America, Eurasia is too big to be
politically one.</p>
<p>Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global
primacy continues to be played. Although geostrategy—the strategic
management of geopolitical interests—may be compared to chess, the
somewhat oval-shaped Eurasian chessboard engages not just two but
several players, each possessing differing amounts of power. The key
players are located on the chessboard’s west, east, center, and south.
Both the western and the eastern extremities of the chessboard contain
densely populated regions, organized on relatively congested space into
several powerful states. In the case of Eurasia’s small western
periphery, American power is deployed directly on it. The far eastern
mainland is the seat of an increasingly powerful and independent player,
controlling an enormous population, while the territory of its energetic
rival—confined on several nearby islands—and half of a small far-eastern
peninsula provide a perch for American power.</p>
<p>The Continents: Area</p>
<p>The Continents: Population</p>
<p>The Continents: GNP</p>
<p>Stretching between the western and eastern extremities is a sparsely
populated and currently politically fluid and organizationally
fragmented vast middle space that was formerly occupied by a powerful
rival to U.S. preeminence—a rival that was once committed to the goal of
pushing America out of Eurasia. To the south of that large central
Eurasian plateau lies a politically anarchic but energy-rich region of
potentially great importance to both the western and the eastern
Eurasian states, including in the southernmost area a highly populated
aspirant to regional hegemony.</p>
<p>This huge, oddly shaped Eurasian chessboard—extending from Lisbon to
Vladivostok—provides the setting for “the game.” If the middle space can
be drawn increasingly into the expanding orbit of the West (where
America preponderates), if the southern region is not subjected to
domination by a single player, and if the East is not unified in a
manner that prompts the expulsion of America from its offshore bases,
America can then be said to prevail. But if the middle space rebuffs the
West, becomes an assertive single entity, and either gains control over
the South or forms an alliance with the major Eastern actor, then
America’s primacy in Eurasia shrinks dramatically. The same would be the
case if the two major Eastern players were somehow to unite. Finally,
any ejection of America by its Western partners from its perch on the
western periphery would automatically spell the end of America’s
participation in the game on the Eurasian chessboard, even though that
would probably also mean the eventual subordination of the western
extremity to a revived player occupying the middle space.</p>
<p>The scope of America’s global hegemony is admittedly great, but its
depth is shallow, limited by both domestic and external restraints.
American hegemony involves the exercise of decisive influence but,
unlike the empires of the past, not of direct control. The very scale
and diversity of Eurasia, as well as the power of some of its states,
limits the depth of American influence and the scope of control over the
course of events. That megacontinent is just too large, too populous,
culturally too varied, and composed of too many historically ambitious
and politically energetic states to be compliant toward even the most
economically successful and politically preeminent global power. This
condition places a premium on geostrategic skill, on the careful,
selective, and very deliberate deployment of America’s resources on the
huge Eurasian chessboard.</p>
<p>It is also a fact that America is too democratic at home to be
autocratic abroad. This limits the use of America’s power, especially
its capacity for military intimidation. Never before has a populist
democracy attained international supremacy. But the pursuit of power is
not a goal that commands popular passion, except in conditions of a
sudden threat or challenge to the public’s sense of domestic well-being.
The economic self-denial (that is, defense spending) and the human
sacrifice (casualties even among professional soldiers) required in the
effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts. Democracy is inimical to
imperial mobilization.</p>
<p>Moreover, most Americans by and large do not derive any special
gratification from their country’s new status as the sole global
superpower. Political “triumphalism” connected with America’s victory in
the Cold War has generally tended to receive a cold reception and has
been the object of some derision on the part of the more liberal-minded
commentators. If anything, two rather varying views of the implications
for America of its historic success in the competition with the former
Soviet Union have been politically more appealing: on the one hand,
there is the view that the end of the Cold War justifies a significant
reduction in America’s global engagement, irrespective of the
consequences for America’s global standing; and on the other hand, there
is the perspective that the time has come for genuine international
multilateralism, to which America should even yield some of its
sovereignty. Both schools of thought have commanded the loyalty of
committed constituencies.</p>
<p>Compounding the dilemmas facing the American leadership are the
changes in the character of the global situation itself: the direct use
of power now tends to be more constrained than was the case in the past.
Nuclear weapons have dramatically reduced the utility of war as a tool
of policy or even as a threat. The growing economic interdependence
among nations is making the political exploitation of economic blackmail
less compelling. Thus maneuver, diplomacy, coalition building,
co-optation, and the very deliberate deployment of one’s political
assets have become the key ingredients of the successful exercise of
geostrategic power on the Eurasian chessboard.</p>
