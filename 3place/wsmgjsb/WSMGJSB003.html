<h4 id="theories-that-dont-work">2. THEORIES THAT DON’T WORK</h4>
<p>THE LAY OF THE LAND</p>
<p>THE FOCUS OF our book is on explaining world inequality and also some
of the easily visible broad patterns that nest within it. The first
country to experience sustained economic growth was England—or Great
Britain, usually just Britain, as the union of England, Wales, and
Scotland after 1707 is known. Growth emerged slowly in the second half
of the eighteenth century as the Industrial Revolution, based on major
technological breakthroughs and their application in industry, took
root. Industrialization in England was soon followed by
industrialization in most of Western Europe and the United States.
English prosperity also spread rapidly to Britain’s “settler colonies”
of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. A list of the thirty richest
countries today would include them, plus Japan, Singapore, and South
Korea. The prosperity of these latter three is in turn part of a broader
pattern in which many East Asian nations, including Taiwan and
subsequently China, have experienced recent rapid growth. The bottom of
the world income distribution paints as sharp and as distinctive a
picture as the top. If you instead make a list of the poorest thirty
countries in the world today, you will find almost all of them in
sub-Saharan Africa. They are joined by countries such as Afghanistan,
Haiti, and Nepal, which, though not in Africa, all share something
critical with African nations, as we’ll explain. If you went back fifty
years, the countries in the top and bottom thirty wouldn’t be greatly
different. Singapore and South Korea would not be among the richest
countries, and there would be several different countries in the bottom
thirty, but the overall picture that emerged would be remarkably
consistent with what we see today. Go back one hundred years, or a
hundred and fifty, and you’d find nearly the same countries in the same
groups. Map 3 shows the lay of the land in 2008. The countries shaded in
the darkest color are the poorest in the world, those where average
per-capita incomes (called by economists GDP, gross domestic product)
are less than ,000 annually. Most of Africa is in this color, as are
Afghanistan, Haiti, and parts of Southeast Asia (for example, Cambodia
and Laos). North Korea is also among this group of countries. The
countries in white are the richest, those with annual income per-capita
of 0,000 or more. Here we find the usual suspects: North America,
western Europe, Australasia, and Japan. Another interesting pattern can
be discerned in the Americas. Make a list of the nations in the Americas
from richest to poorest. You will find that at the top are the United
States and Canada, followed by Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and
Uruguay, and maybe also Venezuela, depending on the price of oil. After
that you have Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru. At
the bottom there is another distinct, much poorer group, comprising
Bolivia, Guatemala, and Paraguay. Go back fifty years, and you’ll find
an identical ranking. One hundred years: same thing. One hundred and
fifty years: again the same. So it is not just that the United States
and Canada are richer than Latin America; there is also a definite and
persistent divide between the rich and poor nations within Latin
America. A final interesting pattern is in the Middle East. There we
find oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which have income
levels close to those of our top thirty. Yet if the oil price fell, they
would quickly fall back down the table. Middle Eastern countries with
little or no oil, such as Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, all cluster around a
level of income similar to that of Guatemala or Peru. Without oil,
Middle Eastern countries are also all poor, though, like those in
Central America and the Andes, not so poor as those in sub-Saharan
Africa. While there is a lot of persistence in the patterns of
prosperity we see around us today, these patterns are not unchanging or
immutable. First, as we have already emphasized, most of current world
inequality emerged since the late eighteenth century, following on the
tails of the Industrial Revolution. Not only were gaps in prosperity
much smaller as late as the middle of the eighteenth century, but the
rankings which have been so stable since then are not the same when we
go further back in history. In the Americas, for example, the ranking we
see for the last hundred and fifty years was completely different five
hundred years ago. Second, many nations have experienced several decades
of rapid growth, such as much of East Asia since the Second World War
and, more recently, China. Many of these subsequently saw that growth go
into reverse. Argentina, for example, grew rapidly for five decades up
until 1920, becoming one of the richest countries in the world, but then
started a long slide. The Soviet Union is an even more noteworthy
example, growing rapidly between 1930 and 1970, but subsequently
experiencing a rapid collapse. What explains these major differences in
poverty and prosperity and the patterns of growth? Why did Western
European nations and their colonial offshoots filled with European
settlers start growing in the nineteenth century, scarcely looking back?
What explains the persistent ranking of inequality within the Americas?
Why have sub-Saharan African and Middle Eastern nations failed to
achieve the type of economic growth seen in Western Europe, while much
of East Asia has experienced breakneck rates of economic growth?</p>
<p>One might think that the fact that world inequality is so huge and
consequential and has such sharply drawn patterns would mean that it
would have a well-accepted explanation. Not so. Most hypotheses that
social scientists have proposed for the origins of poverty and
prosperity just don’t work and fail to convincingly explain the lay of
the land.</p>
<p>THE GEOGRAPHY HYPOTHESIS</p>
<p>One widely accepted theory of the causes of world inequality is the
geography hypothesis, which claims that the great divide between rich
and poor countries is created by geographical differences. Many poor
countries, such as those of Africa, Central America, and South Asia, are
between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Rich nations, in contrast,
tend to be in temperate latitudes. This geographic concentration of
poverty and prosperity gives a superficial appeal to the geography
hypothesis, which is the starting point of the theories and views of
many social scientists and pundits alike. But this doesn’t make it any
less wrong. As early as the late eighteenth century, the great French
political philosopher Montesquieu noted the geographic concentration of
prosperity and poverty, and proposed an explanation for it. He argued
that people in tropical climates tended to be lazy and to lack
inquisitiveness. As a consequence, they didn’t work hard and were not
innovative, and this was the reason why they were poor. Montesquieu also
speculated that lazy people tended to be ruled by despots, suggesting
that a tropical location could explain not just poverty but also some of
the political phenomena associated with economic failure, such as
dictatorship. The theory that hot countries are intrinsically poor,
though contradicted by the recent rapid economic advance of countries
such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Botswana, is still forcefully advocated
by some, such as the economist Jeffrey Sachs. The modern version of this
view emphasizes not the direct effects of climate on work effort or
thought processes, but two additional arguments: first, that tropical
diseases, particularly malaria, have very adverse consequences for
health and therefore labor productivity; and second, that tropical soils
do not allow for productive agriculture. The conclusion, though, is the
same: temperate climates have a relative advantage over tropical and
semitropical areas. World inequality, however, cannot be explained by
climate or diseases, or any version of the geography hypothesis. Just
think of Nogales. What separates the two parts is not climate,
geography, or disease environment, but the U.S.-Mexico border. If the
geography hypothesis cannot explain differences between the north and
south of Nogales, or North and South Korea, or those between East and
West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall, could it still be a
useful theory for explaining differences between North and South
America? Between Europe and Africa? Simply, no. History illustrates that
there is no simple or enduring connection between climate or geography
and economic success. For instance, it is not true that the tropics have
always been poorer than temperate latitudes. As we saw in the last
chapter, at the time of the conquest of the Americas by Columbus, the
areas south of the Tropic of Cancer and north of the Tropic of
Capricorn, which today include Mexico, Central America, Peru, and
Bolivia, held the great Aztec and Inca civilizations. These empires were
politically centralized and complex, built roads, and provided famine
relief. The Aztecs had both money and writing, and the Incas, even
though they lacked both these two key technologies, recorded vast
amounts of information on knotted ropes called quipus. In sharp
contrast, at the time of the Aztecs and Incas, the north and south of
the area inhabited by the Aztecs and Incas, which today includes the
United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile, were mostly inhabited by
Stone Age civilizations lacking these technologies. The tropics in the
Americas were thus much richer than the temperate zones, suggesting that
the “obvious fact” of tropical poverty is neither obvious nor a fact.
Instead, the greater riches in the United States and Canada represent a
stark reversal of fortune relative to what was there when the Europeans
arrived. This reversal clearly had nothing to do with geography and, as
we have already seen, something to do with the way these areas were
colonized. This reversal was not confined to the Americas. People in
South Asia, especially the Indian subcontinent, and in China were more
prosperous than those in many other parts of Asia and certainly more
than the peoples inhabiting Australia and New Zealand. This, too, was
reversed, with South Korea, Singapore, and Japan emerging as the richest
nations in Asia, and Australia and New Zealand surpassing almost all of
Asia in terms of prosperity. Even within sub-Saharan Africa there was a
similar reversal. More recently, before the start of intense European
contact with Africa, the southern Africa region was the most sparsely
settled and the farthest from having developed states with any kind of
control over their territories. Yet South Africa is now one of the most
prosperous nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Further back in history we
again see much prosperity in the tropics; some of the great premodern
civilizations, such as Angkor in modern Cambodia, Vijayanagara in
southern India, and Aksum in Ethiopia, flourished in the tropics, as did
the great Indus Valley civilizations of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa in
modern Pakistan. History thus leaves little doubt that there is no
simple connection between a tropical location and economic success.
Tropical diseases obviously cause much suffering and high rates of
infant mortality in Africa, but they are not the reason Africa is poor.
Disease is largely a consequence of poverty and of governments being
unable or unwilling to undertake the public health measures necessary to
eradicate them. England in the nineteenth century was also a very
unhealthy place, but the government gradually invested in clean water,
in the proper treatment of sewage and effluent, and, eventually, in an
effective health service. Improved health and life expectancy were not
the cause of England’s economic success but one of the fruits of its
previous political and economic changes. The same is true for Nogales,
Arizona. The other part of the geography hypothesis is that the tropics
are poor because tropical agriculture is intrinsically unproductive.
Tropical soils are thin and unable to maintain nutrients, the argument
goes, and emphasizes how quickly these soils are eroded by torrential
rains. There certainly is some merit in this argument, but as we’ll
show, the prime determinant of why agricultural
productivity—agricultural output per acre—is so low in many poor
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, has little to do with
soil quality. Rather, it is a consequence of the ownership structure of
the land and the incentives that are created for farmers by the
governments and institutions under which they live. We will also show
that world inequality cannot be explained by differences in agricultural
productivity. The great inequality of the modern world that emerged in
the nineteenth century was caused by the uneven dissemination of
industrial technologies and manufacturing production. It was not caused
by divergence in agricultural performance. Another influential version
of the geography hypothesis is advanced by the ecologist and
evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond. He argues that the origins of
intercontinental inequality at the start of the modern period, five
hundred years ago, rested in different historical endowments of plant
and animal species, which subsequently influenced agricultural
productivity. In some places, such as the Fertile Crescent in the modern
Middle East, there were a large number of species that could be
domesticated by humans. Elsewhere, such as the Americas, there were not.
Having many species capable of being domesticated made it very
attractive for societies to make the transition from a hunter-gatherer
to a farming lifestyle. As a consequence, farming developed earlier in
the Fertile Crescent than in the Americas. Population density grew,
allowing specialization of labor, trade, urbanization, and political
development. Crucially, in places where farming dominated, technological
innovation took place much more rapidly than in other parts of the
world. Thus, according to Diamond, the differential availability of
animal and plant species created differential intensities of farming,
which led to different paths of technological change and prosperity
across different continents. Though Diamond’s thesis is a powerful
approach to the puzzle on which he focuses, it cannot be extended to
explain modern world inequality. For example, Diamond argues that the
Spanish were able to dominate the civilizations of the Americas because
of their longer history of farming and consequent superior technology.
But we now need to explain why the Mexicans and Peruvians inhabiting the
former lands of the Aztecs and Incas are poor. While having access to
wheat, barley, and horses might have made the Spanish richer than the
Incas, the gap in incomes between the two was not very large. The
average income of a Spaniard was probably less than double that of a
citizen of the Inca Empire. Diamond’s thesis implies that once the Incas
had been exposed to all the species and resulting technologies that they
had not been able to develop themselves, they ought quickly to have
attained the living standards of the Spanish. Yet nothing of the sort
happened. On the contrary, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a
much larger gap in incomes between Spain and Peru emerged. Today the
average Spaniard is more than six times richer than the average
Peruvian. This gap in incomes is closely connected to the uneven
dissemination of modern industrial technologies, but this has little to
do either with the potential for animal and plant domestication or with
intrinsic agricultural productivity differences between Spain and Peru.
While Spain, albeit with a lag, adopted the technologies of steam power,
railroads, electricity, mechanization, and factory production, Peru did
not, or at best did so very slowly and imperfectly. This technological
gap persists today and reproduces itself on a bigger scale as new
technologies, in particular those related to information technology,
fuel further growth in many developed and some rapidly developing
nations. Diamond’s thesis does not tell us why these crucial
technologies are not diffusing and equalizing incomes across the world
and does not explain why the northern half of Nogales is so much richer
than its twin just to the south of the fence, even though both were part
of the same civilization five hundred years ago. The story of Nogales
highlights another major problem in adapting Diamond’s thesis: as we
have already seen, whatever the drawbacks of the Inca and Aztec empires
were in 1532, Peru and Mexico were undoubtedly more prosperous than
those parts of the Americas that went on to become the United States and
Canada. North America became more prosperous precisely because it
enthusiastically adopted the technologies and advances of the Industrial
Revolution. The population became educated and railways spread out
across the Great Plains in stark contrast to what happened in South
America. This cannot be explained by pointing to differential geographic
endowments of North and South America, which, if anything, favored South
America. Inequality in the modern world largely results from the uneven
dissemination and adoption of technologies, and Diamond’s thesis does
include important arguments about this. For instance, he argues,
following the historian William McNeill, that the east–west orientation
of Eurasia enabled crops, animals, and innovations to spread from the
Fertile Crescent into Western Europe, while the north–south orientation
of the Americas accounts for why writing systems, which were created in
Mexico, did not spread to the Andes or North America. Yet the
orientation of continents cannot provide an explanation for today’s
world inequality. Consider Africa. Though the Sahara Desert did present
a significant barrier to the movement of goods and ideas from the north
to sub-Saharan Africa, this was not insurmountable. The Portuguese, and
then other Europeans, sailed around the coast and eliminated differences
in knowledge at a time when gaps in incomes were very small compared
with what they are today. Since then, Africa has not caught up with
Europe; on the contrary, there is now a much larger income gap between
most African and European countries. It should also be clear that
Diamond’s argument, which is about continental inequality, is not well
equipped to explain variation within continents—an essential part of
modern world inequality. For example, while the orientation of the
Eurasian landmass might explain how England managed to benefit from the
innovations of the Middle East without having to reinvent them, it
doesn’t explain why the Industrial Revolution happened in England rather
than, say, Moldova. In addition, as Diamond himself points out, China
and India benefited greatly from very rich suites of animals and plants,
and from the orientation of Eurasia. But most of the poor people of the
world today are in those two countries. In fact, the best way to see the
scope of Diamond’s thesis is in terms of his own explanatory variables.
Map 4 shows data on the distribution of Sus scrofa, the ancestor of the
modern pig, and the aurochs, ancestor of the modern cow. Both species
were widely distributed throughout Eurasia and even North Africa. Map 5
(this page) shows the distribution of some of the wild ancestors of
modern domesticated crops, such as Oryza sativa, the ancestor of Asian
cultivated rice, and the ancestors of modern wheat and barley. It
demonstrates that the wild ancestor of rice was distributed widely
across south and southeast Asia, while the ancestors of barley and wheat
were distributed along a long arc from the Levant, reaching through Iran
and into Afghanistan and the cluster of “stans” (Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan, and Krgyzistan). These ancestral species are present in much
of Eurasia. But their wide distribution suggests that inequality within
Eurasia cannot be explained by a theory based on the incidence of the
species. The geography hypothesis is not only unhelpful for explaining
the origins of prosperity throughout history, and mostly incorrect in
its emphasis, but also unable to account for the lay of the land we
started this chapter with. One might argue that any persistent pattern,
such as the hierarchy of incomes within the Americas or the sharp and
long-ranging differences between Europe and the Middle East, can be
explained by unchanging geography. But this is not so. We have already
seen that the patterns within the Americas are highly unlikely to have
been driven by geographical factors. Before 1492 it was the
civilizations in the central valley of Mexico, Central America, and the
Andes that had superior technology and living standards to North America
or places such as Argentina and Chile. While the geography stayed the
same, the institutions imposed by European colonists created a “reversal
of fortune.” Geography is also unlikely to explain the poverty of the
Middle East for similar reasons. After all, the Middle East led the
world in the Neolithic Revolution, and the first towns developed in
modern Iraq. Iron was first smelted in Turkey, and as late as the Middle
Ages the Middle East was technologically dynamic. It was not the
geography of the Middle East that made the Neolithic Revolution flourish
in that part of the world, as we will see in chapter 5, and it was,
again, not geography that made the Middle East poor. Instead, it was the
expansion and consolidation of the Ottoman Empire, and it is the
institutional legacy of this empire that keeps the Middle East poor
today.</p>
<p>Finally, geographic factors are unhelpful for explaining not only the
differences we see across various parts of the world today but also why
many nations such as Japan or China stagnate for long periods and then
start a rapid growth process. We need another, better theory.</p>
<p>THE CULTURE HYPOTHESIS</p>
<p>The second widely accepted theory, the culture hypothesis, relates
prosperity to culture. The culture hypothesis, just like the geography
hypothesis, has a distinguished lineage, going back at least to the
great German sociologist Max Weber, who argued that the Protestant
Reformation and the Protestant ethic it spurred played a key role in
facilitating the rise of modern industrial society in Western Europe.
The culture hypothesis no longer relies solely on religion, but stresses
other types of beliefs, values, and ethics as well. Though it is not
politically correct to articulate in public, many people still maintain
that Africans are poor because they lack a good work ethic, still
believe in witchcraft and magic, or resist new Western technologies.
Many also believe that Latin America will never be rich because its
people are intrinsically profligate and impecunious, and because they
suffer from some “Iberian” or “mañana” culture. Of course, many once
believed that the Chinese culture and Confucian values were inimical to
economic growth, though now the importance of the Chinese work ethic as
the engine of growth in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore is trumpeted. Is
the culture hypothesis useful for understanding world inequality? Yes
and no. Yes, in the sense that social norms, which are related to
culture, matter and can be hard to change, and they also sometimes
support institutional differences, this book’s explanation for world
inequality. But mostly no, because those aspects of culture often
emphasized—religion, national ethics, African or Latin values—are just
not important for understanding how we got here and why the inequalities
in the world persist. Other aspects, such as the extent to which people
trust each other or are able to cooperate, are important but they are
mostly an outcome of institutions, not an independent cause. Let us go
back to Nogales. As we noted earlier, many aspects of culture are the
same north and south of the fence. Nevertheless, there may be some
marked differences in practices, norms, and values, though these are not
causes but outcomes of the two places’ divergent development paths. For
example, in surveys Mexicans typically say they trust other people less
than the citizens of the United States say they trust others. But it is
not a surprise that Mexicans lack trust when their government cannot
eliminate drug cartels or provide a functioning unbiased legal system.
The same is true with North and South Korea, as we discuss in the next
chapter. The South is one of the richest countries in the world, while
the North grapples with periodic famine and abject poverty. While
“culture” is very different between the South and the North today, it
played no role in causing the diverging economic fortunes of these two
half nations. The Korean peninsula has a long period of common history.
Before the Korean War and the division at the 38th parallel, it had an
unprecedented homogeneity in terms of language, ethnicity, and culture.
Just as in Nogales, what matters is the border. To the north is a
different regime, imposing different institutions, creating different
incentives. Any difference in culture between south and north of the
border cutting through the two parts of Nogales or the two parts of
Korea is thus not a cause of the differences in prosperity but, rather,
a consequence. What about Africa and African culture? Historically,
sub-Saharan Africa was poorer than most other parts of the world, and
its ancient civilizations did not develop the wheel, writing (with the
exception of Ethiopia and Somalia), or the plow. Though these
technologies were not widely used until the advent of formal European
colonization in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, African
societies knew about them much earlier. Europeans began sailing around
the west coast in the late fifteenth century, and Asians were
continually sailing to East Africa from much earlier times. We can
understand why these technologies were not adopted from the history of
the Kingdom of Kongo at the mouth of the Congo River, which has given
its name to the modern Democratic Republic of Congo. Map 6 shows where
the Kongo was along with another important central African state, the
Kuba Kingdom, which we discuss later in the book. Kongo came into
intense contact with the Portuguese after it was first visited by the
mariner Diogo Cão in 1483. At the time, Kongo was a highly centralized
polity by African standards, whose capital, Mbanza, had a population of
sixty thousand, which made it about the same size as the Portuguese
capital of Lisbon and larger than London, which had a population of
about fifty thousand in 1500. The king of Kongo, Nzinga a Nkuwu,
converted to Catholicism and changed his name to João I. Later Mbanza’s
name was changed to São Salvador. Thanks to the Portuguese, the
Kongolese learned about the wheel and the plow, and the Portuguese even
encouraged their adoption with agricultural missions in 1491 and 1512.
But all these initiatives failed. Still, the Kongolese were far from
averse to modern technologies in general. They were very quick to adopt
one venerable Western innovation: the gun. They used this new and
powerful tool to respond to market incentives: to capture and export
slaves. There is no sign here that African values or culture prevented
the adoption of new technologies and practices. As their contacts with
Europeans deepened, the Kongolese adopted other Western practices:
literacy, dress styles, and house designs. In the nineteenth century,
many African societies also took advantage of the rising economic
opportunities created by the Industrial Revolution by changing their
production patterns. In West Africa there was rapid economic development
based on the export of palm oil and ground nuts; throughout southern
Africa, Africans developed exports to the rapidly expanding industrial
and mining areas of the Rand in South Africa. Yet these promising
economic experiments were obliterated not by African culture or the
inability of ordinary Africans to act in their own self-interest, but
first by European colonialism and then by postindependence African
governments. The real reason that the Kongolese did not adopt superior
technology was because they lacked any incentives to do so. They faced a
high risk of all their output being expropriated and taxed by the
all-powerful king, whether or not he had converted to Catholicism. In
fact, it wasn’t only their property that was insecure. Their continued
existence was held by a thread. Many of them were captured and sold as
slaves—hardly the environment to encourage investment to increase
long-term productivity. Neither did the king have incentives to adopt
the plow on a large scale or to make increasing agricultural
productivity his main priority; exporting slaves was so much more
profitable. It might be true today that Africans trust each other less
than people in other parts of the world. But this is an outcome of a
long history of institutions which have undermined human and property
rights in Africa. The potential to be captured and sold as a slave no
doubt influenced the extent to which Africans trusted others
historically. What about Max Weber’s Protestant ethic? Though it may be
true that predominantly Protestant countries, such as the Netherlands
and England, were the first economic successes of the modern era, there
is little relationship between religion and economic success. France, a
predominantly Catholic country, quickly mimicked the economic
performance of the Dutch and English in the nineteenth century, and
Italy is as prosperous as any of these nations today. Looking farther
east, you’ll see that none of the economic successes of East Asia have
anything to do with any form of Christian religion, so there is not much
support for a special relationship between Protestantism and economic
success there, either. Let’s turn to a favorite area for the enthusiasts
of the culture hypothesis: the Middle East. Middle Eastern countries are
primarily Islamic, and the non–oil producers among them are very poor,
as we have already noted. Oil producers are richer, but this windfall of
wealth has done little to create diversified modern economies in Saudi
Arabia or Kuwait. Don’t these facts show convincingly that religion
matters? Though plausible, this argument is not right, either. Yes,
countries such as Syria and Egypt are poor, and their populations are
primarily Muslim. But these countries also systemically differ in other
ways that are far more important for prosperity. For one, they were all
provinces of the Ottoman Empire, which heavily, and adversely, shaped
the way they developed. After Ottoman rule collapsed, the Middle East
was absorbed into the English and French colonial empires, which, again,
stunted their possibilities. After independence, they followed much of
the former colonial world by developing hierarchical, authoritarian
political regimes with few of the political and economic institutions
that, we will argue, are crucial for generating economic success. This
development path was forged largely by the history of Ottoman and
European rule. The relationship between the Islamic religion and poverty
in the Middle East is largely spurious. The role of these historical
events, rather than cultural factors, in shaping the Middle East’s
economic trajectory is also seen in the fact that the parts of the
Middle East that temporarily broke away from the hold of the Ottoman
Empire and the European powers, such as Egypt between 1805 and 1848
under Muhammad Ali, could embark on a path of rapid economic change.
Muhammad Ali usurped power following the withdrawal of the French forces
that had occupied Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte. Exploiting the
weakness of the Ottoman hold over the Egyptian territory at the time, he
was able to found his own dynasty, which would, in one form or another,
rule until the Egyptian Revolution under Nasser in 1952. Muhammad Ali’s
reforms, though coercive, did bring growth to Egypt as the state
bureaucracy, the army, and the tax system were modernized and there was
growth in agriculture and industry. Nevertheless, this process of
modernization and growth came to an end after Ali’s death, as Egypt fell
under European influence. But perhaps this is the wrong way to think
about culture. Maybe the cultural factors that matter are not tied to
religion but rather to particular “national cultures.” Perhaps it is the
influence of English culture that is important and explains why
countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia are so
prosperous? Though this idea sounds initially appealing, it doesn’t
work, either. Yes, Canada and the United States were English colonies,
but so were Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The variation in prosperity within
former English colonies is as great as that in the entire world. The
English legacy is not the reason for the success of North America. There
is yet one more version of the culture hypothesis: perhaps it is not
English versus non-English that matters but, rather, European versus
non-European. Could it be that Europeans are superior somehow because of
their work ethic, outlook on life, Judeo-Christian values, or Roman
heritage? It is true that Western Europe and North America, filled
primarily by people of European descent, are the most prosperous parts
of the world. Perhaps it is the superior European cultural legacy that
is at the root of prosperity—and the last refuge of the culture
hypothesis. Alas, this version of the culture hypothesis has as little
explanatory potential as the others. A greater proportion of the
population of Argentina and Uruguay, compared with the population of
Canada and the United States, is of European descent, but Argentina’s
and Uruguay’s economic performance leaves much to be desired. Japan and
Singapore never had more than a sprinkling of inhabitants of European
descent, yet they are as prosperous as many parts of Western Europe.
China, despite many imperfections in its economic and political system,
has been the most rapidly growing nation of the past three decades.
Chinese poverty until Mao Zedong’s death had nothing to do with Chinese
culture; it was due to the disastrous way Mao organized the economy and
conducted politics. In the 1950s, he promoted the Great Leap Forward, a
drastic industrialization policy that led to mass starvation and famine.
In the 1960s, he propagated the Cultural Revolution, which led to the
mass persecution of intellectuals and educated people—anyone whose party
loyalty might be doubted. This again led to terror and a huge waste of
the society’s talent and resources. In the same way, current Chinese
growth has nothing to do with Chinese values or changes in Chinese
culture; it results from a process of economic transformation unleashed
by the reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping and his allies, who, after
Mao Zedong’s death, gradually abandoned socialist economic policies and
institutions, first in agriculture and then in industry. Just like the
geography hypothesis, the culture hypothesis is also unhelpful for
explaining other aspects of the lay of the land around us today. There
are of course differences in beliefs, cultural attitudes, and values
between the United States and Latin America, but just like those that
exist between Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, or those between
South and North Korea, these differences are a consequence of the two
places’ different institutions and institutional histories. Cultural
factors that emphasize how “Hispanic” or “Latin” culture molded the
Spanish Empire can’t explain the differences within Latin America—for
example, why Argentina and Chile are more prosperous than Peru and
Bolivia. Other types of cultural arguments—for instance, those that
stress contemporary indigenous culture—fare equally badly. Argentina and
Chile have few indigenous people compared with Peru and Bolivia. Though
this is true, indigenous culture as an explanation does not work,
either. Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru have similar income levels, but
Colombia has very few indigenous people today, while Ecuador and Peru
have many. Finally, cultural attitudes, which are in general slow to
change, are unlikely to account by themselves for the growth miracles in
East Asia and China. Though institutions are persistent, too, in certain
circumstances they do change rapidly, as we’ll see.</p>
<p>THE IGNORANCE HYPOTHESIS</p>
<p>The final popular theory for why some nations are poor and some are
rich is the ignorance hypothesis, which asserts that world inequality
exists because we or our rulers do not know how to make poor countries
rich. This idea is the one held by most economists, who take their cue
from the famous definition proposed by the English economist Lionel
Robbins in 1935 that “economics is a science which studies human
behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have
alternative uses.”</p>
<p>It is then a small step to conclude that the science of economics
should focus on the best use of scarce means to satisfy social ends.
Indeed, the most famous theoretical result in economics, the so-called
First Welfare Theorem, identifies the circumstances under which the
allocation of resources in a “market economy” is socially desirable from
an economic point of view. A market economy is an abstraction that is
meant to capture a situation in which all individuals and firms can
freely produce, buy, and sell any products or services that they wish.
When these circumstances are not present there is a “market failure.”
Such failures provide the basis for a theory of world inequality, since
the more that market failures go unaddressed, the poorer a country is
likely to be. The ignorance hypothesis maintains that poor countries are
poor because they have a lot of market failures and because economists
and policymakers do not know how to get rid of them and have heeded the
wrong advice in the past. Rich countries are rich because they have
figured out better policies and have successfully eliminated these
failures. Could the ignorance hypothesis explain world inequality? Could
it be that African countries are poorer than the rest of the world
because their leaders tend to have the same mistaken views of how to run
their countries, leading to the poverty there, while Western European
leaders are better informed or better advised, which explains their
relative success? While there are famous examples of leaders adopting
disastrous policies because they were mistaken about those policies’
consequences, ignorance can explain at best a small part of world
inequality. On the face of it, the sustained economic decline that soon
set in in Ghana after independence from Britain was caused by ignorance.
The British economist Tony Killick, then working as an adviser for the
government of Kwame Nkrumah, recorded many of the problems in great
detail. Nkrumah’s policies focused on developing state industry, which
turned out to be very inefficient. Killick recalled:</p>
<p>The footwear factory … that would have linked the meat factory in the
North through transportation of the hides to the South (for a distance
of over 500 miles) to a tannery (now abandoned); the leather was to have
been backhauled to the footwear factory in Kumasi, in the center of the
country and about 200 miles north of the tannery. Since the major
footwear market is in the Accra metropolitan area, the shoes would then
have to be transported an additional 200 miles back to the South.</p>
<p>Killick somewhat understatedly remarks that this was an enterprise
“whose viability was undermined by poor siting.” The footwear factory
was one of many such projects, joined by the mango canning plant
situated in a part of Ghana which did not grow mangos and whose output
was to be more than the entire world demand for the product. This
endless stream of economically irrational developments was not caused by
the fact that Nkrumah or his advisers were badly informed or ignorant of
the right economic policies. They had people like Killick and had even
been advised by Nobel laureate Sir Arthur Lewis, who knew the policies
were not good. What drove the form the economic policies took was the
fact that Nkrumah needed to use them to buy political support and
sustain his undemocratic regime. Neither Ghana’s disappointing
performance after independence nor the countless other cases of apparent
economic mismanagement can simply be blamed on ignorance. After all, if
ignorance were the problem, well-meaning leaders would quickly learn
what types of policies increased their citizens’ incomes and welfare,
and would gravitate toward those policies. Consider the divergent paths
of the United States and Mexico. Blaming this disparity on the ignorance
of the leaders of the two nations is, at best, highly implausible. It
wasn’t differences in knowledge or intentions between John Smith and
Cortés that laid the seeds of divergence during the colonial period, and
it wasn’t differences in knowledge between later U.S. presidents, such
as Teddy Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson, and Porfirio Díaz that made Mexico
choose economic institutions that enriched elites at the expense of the
rest of society at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the
twentieth centuries while Roosevelt and Wilson did the opposite. Rather,
it was the differences in the institutional constraints the countries’
presidents and elites were facing. Similarly, leaders of African nations
that have languished over the last half century under insecure property
rights and economic institutions, impoverishing much of their
populations, did not allow this to happen because they thought it was
good economics; they did so because they could get away with it and
enrich themselves at the expense of the rest, or because they thought it
was good politics, a way of keeping themselves in power by buying the
support of crucial groups or elites. The experience of Ghana’s prime
minister in 1971, Kofi Busia, illustrates how misleading the ignorance
hypothesis can be. Busia faced a dangerous economic crisis. After coming
to power in 1969, he, like Nkrumah before him, pursued unsustainable
expansionary economic policies and maintained various price controls
through marketing boards and an overvalued exchange rate. Though Busia
had been an opponent of Nkrumah, and led a democratic government, he
faced many of the same political constraints. As with Nkrumah, his
economic policies were adopted not because he was “ignorant” and
believed that these policies were good economics or an ideal way to
develop the country. The policies were chosen because they were good
politics, enabling Busia to transfer resources to politically powerful
groups, for example in urban areas, who needed to be kept contented.
Price controls squeezed agriculture, delivering cheap food to the urban
constituencies and generating revenues to finance government spending.
But these controls were unsustainable. Ghana was soon suffering from a
series of balance-of-payment crises and foreign exchange shortages.
Faced with these dilemmas, on December 27, 1971, Busia signed an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund that included a massive
devaluation of the currency. The IMF, the World Bank, and the entire
international community put pressure on Busia to implement the reforms
contained in the agreement. Though the international institutions were
blissfully unaware, Busia knew he was taking a huge political gamble.
The immediate consequence of the currency’s devaluation was rioting and
discontent in Accra, Ghana’s capital, that mounted uncontrollably until
Busia was overthrown by the military, led by Lieutenant Colonel
Acheampong, who immediately reversed the devaluation. The ignorance
hypothesis differs from the geography and culture hypotheses in that it
comes readily with a suggestion about how to “solve” the problem of
poverty: if ignorance got us here, enlightened and informed rulers and
policymakers can get us out and we should be able to “engineer”
prosperity around the world by providing the right advice and by
convincing politicians of what is good economics. Yet Busia’s experience
underscores the fact that the main obstacle to the adoption of policies
that would reduce market failures and encourage economic growth is not
the ignorance of politicians but the incentives and constraints they
face from the political and economic institutions in their societies.
Although the ignorance hypothesis still rules supreme among most
economists and in Western policymaking circles—which, almost to the
exclusion of anything else, focus on how to engineer prosperity—it is
just another hypothesis that doesn’t work. It explains neither the
origins of prosperity around the world nor the lay of the land around
us—for example, why some nations, such as Mexico and Peru, but not the
United States or England, adopted institutions and policies that would
impoverish the majority of their citizens, or why almost all sub-Saharan
Africa and most of Central America are so much poorer than Western
Europe or East Asia. When nations break out of institutional patterns
condemning them to poverty and manage to embark on a path to economic
growth, this is not because their ignorant leaders suddenly have become
better informed or less self-interested or because they’ve received
advice from better economists. China, for example, is one of the
countries that made the switch from economic policies that caused
poverty and the starvation of millions to those encouraging economic
growth. But, as we will discuss in greater detail later, this did not
happen because the Chinese Communist Party finally understood that the
collective ownership of agricultural land and industry created terrible
economic incentives. Instead, Deng Xiaoping and his allies, who were no
less self-interested than their rivals but who had different interests
and political objectives, defeated their powerful opponents in the
Communist Party and masterminded a political revolution of sorts,
radically changing the leadership and direction of the party. Their
economic reforms, which created market incentives in agriculture and
then subsequently in industry, followed from this political revolution.
It was politics that determined the switch from communism and toward
market incentives in China, not better advice or a better understanding
of how the economy worked.</p>
<p>WE WILL ARGUE that to understand world inequality we have to
understand why some societies are organized in very inefficient and
socially undesirable ways. Nations sometimes do manage to adopt
efficient institutions and achieve prosperity, but alas, these are the
rare cases. Most economists and policymakers have focused on “getting it
right,” while what is really needed is an explanation for why poor
nations “get it wrong.” Getting it wrong is mostly not about ignorance
or culture. As we will show, poor countries are poor because those who
have power make choices that create poverty. They get it wrong not by
mistake or ignorance but on purpose. To understand this, you have to go
beyond economics and expert advice on the best thing to do and, instead,
study how decisions actually get made, who gets to make them, and why
those people decide to do what they do. This is the study of politics
and political processes. Traditionally economics has ignored politics,
but understanding politics is crucial for explaining world inequality.
As the economist Abba Lerner noted in the 1970s, “Economics has gained
the title Queen of the Social Sciences by choosing solved political
problems as its domain.”</p>
<p>We will argue that achieving prosperity depends on solving some basic
political problems. It is precisely because economics has assumed that
political problems are solved that it has not been able to come up with
a convincing explanation for world inequality. Explaining world
inequality still needs economics to understand how different types of
policies and social arrangements affect economic incentives and
behavior. But it also needs politics.</p>
