<h4 id="understanding-prosperity-and-poverty">15. UNDERSTANDING
PROSPERITY AND POVERTY</h4>
<p>HISTORICAL ORIGINS</p>
<p>THERE ARE HUGE DIFFERENCES in living standards around the world. Even
the poorest citizens of the United States have incomes and access to
health care, education, public services, and economic and social
opportunities that are far superior to those available to the vast mass
of people living in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.
The contrast of South and North Korea, the two Nogaleses, and the United
States and Mexico reminds us that these are relatively recent phenomena.
Five hundred years ago, Mexico, home to the Aztec state, was certainly
richer than the polities to the north, and the United States did not
pull ahead of Mexico until the nineteenth century. The gap between the
two Nogaleses is even more recent. South and North Korea were
economically, as well as socially and culturally, indistinguishable
before the country was divided at the 38th parallel after the Second
World War. Similarly, most of the huge economic differences we observe
around us today emerged over the last two hundred years. Did this all
need to be so? Was it historically—or geographically or culturally or
ethnically—predetermined that Western Europe, the United States, and
Japan would become so much richer than sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America, and China over the last two hundred years or so? Was it
inevitable that the Industrial Revolution would get under way in the
eighteenth century in Britain, and then spread to Western Europe and
Europe’s offshoots in North America and Australasia? Is a counterfactual
world where the Glorious Revolution and the Industrial Revolution take
place in Peru, which then colonizes Western Europe and enslaves whites,
possible, or is it just a form of historical science fiction?</p>
<p>To answer—in fact, even to reason about—these questions, we need a
theory of why some nations are prosperous while others fail and are
poor. This theory needs to delineate both the factors that create and
retard prosperity and their historical origins. This book has proposed
such a theory. Any complex social phenomenon, such as the origins of the
different economic and political trajectories of hundreds of polities
around the world, likely has a multitude of causes, making most social
scientists shun monocausal, simple, and broadly applicable theories and
instead seek different explanations for seemingly similar outcomes
emerging in different times and areas. Instead we’ve offered a simple
theory and used it to explain the main contours of economic and
political development around the world since the Neolithic Revolution.
Our choice was motivated not by a naïve belief that such a theory could
explain everything, but by the belief that a theory should enable us to
focus on the parallels, sometimes at the expense of abstracting from
many interesting details. A successful theory, then, does not faithfully
reproduce details, but provides a useful and empirically well-grounded
explanation for a range of processes while also clarifying the main
forces at work. Our theory has attempted to achieve this by operating on
two levels. The first is the distinction between extractive and
inclusive economic and political institutions. The second is our
explanation for why inclusive institutions emerged in some parts of the
world and not in others. While the first level of our theory is about an
institutional interpretation of history, the second level is about how
history has shaped institutional trajectories of nations. Central to our
theory is the link between inclusive economic and political institutions
and prosperity. Inclusive economic institutions that enforce property
rights, create a level playing field, and encourage investments in new
technologies and skills are more conducive to economic growth than
extractive economic institutions that are structured to extract
resources from the many by the few and that fail to protect property
rights or provide incentives for economic activity. Inclusive economic
institutions are in turn supported by, and support, inclusive political
institutions, that is, those that distribute political power widely in a
pluralistic manner and are able to achieve some amount of political
centralization so as to establish law and order, the foundations of
secure property rights, and an inclusive market economy. Similarly,
extractive economic institutions are synergistically linked to
extractive political institutions, which concentrate power in the hands
of a few, who will then have incentives to maintain and develop
extractive economic institutions for their benefit and use the resources
they obtain to cement their hold on political power. These tendencies do
not imply that extractive economic and political institutions are
inconsistent with economic growth. On the contrary, every elite would,
all else being equal, like to encourage as much growth as possible in
order to have more to extract. Extractive institutions that have
achieved at least a minimal degree of political centralization are often
able to generate some amount of growth. What is crucial, however, is
that growth under extractive institutions will not be sustained, for two
key reasons. First, sustained economic growth requires innovation, and
innovation cannot be decoupled from creative destruction, which replaces
the old with the new in the economic realm and also destabilizes
established power relations in politics. Because elites dominating
extractive institutions fear creative destruction, they will resist it,
and any growth that germinates under extractive institutions will be
ultimately short lived. Second, the ability of those who dominate
extractive institutions to benefit greatly at the expense of the rest of
society implies that political power under extractive institutions is
highly coveted, making many groups and individuals fight to obtain it.
As a consequence, there will be powerful forces pushing societies under
extractive institutions toward political instability. The synergies
between extractive economic and political institutions create a vicious
circle, where extractive institutions, once in place, tend to persist.
Similarly, there is a virtuous circle associated with inclusive economic
and political institutions. But neither the vicious nor the virtuous
circle is absolute. In fact, some nations live under inclusive
institutions today because, though extractive institutions have been the
norm in history, some societies have been able to break the mold and
transition toward inclusive institutions. Our explanation for these
transitions is historical, but not historically predetermined. Major
institutional change, the requisite for major economic change, takes
place as a result of the interaction between existing institutions and
critical junctures. Critical junctures are major events that disrupt the
existing political and economic balance in one or many societies, such
as the Black Death, which killed possibly as much as half the population
of most areas in Europe during the fourteenth century; the opening of
Atlantic trade routes, which created enormous profit opportunities for
many in Western Europe; and the Industrial Revolution, which offered the
potential for rapid but also disruptive changes in the structure of
economies around the world. Existing institutional differences among
societies themselves are a result of past institutional changes. Why
does the path of institutional change differ across societies? The
answer to this question lies in institutional drift. In the same way
that the genes of two isolated populations of organisms will drift apart
slowly because of random mutations in the so-called process of
evolutionary or genetic drift, two otherwise similar societies will also
drift apart institutionally—albeit, again, slowly. Conflict over income
and power, and indirectly over institutions, is a constant in all
societies. This conflict often has a contingent outcome, even if the
playing field over which it transpires is not level. The outcome of this
conflict leads to institutional drift. But this is not necessarily a
cumulative process. It does not imply that the small differences that
emerge at some point will necessarily become larger over time. On the
contrary, as our discussion of Roman Britain in chapter 6 illustrates,
small differences open up, and then disappear, and then reappear again.
However, when a critical juncture arrives, these small differences that
have emerged as a result of institutional drift may be the small
differences that matter in leading otherwise quite similar societies to
diverge radically. We saw in chapters 7 and 8 that despite the many
similarities between England, France, and Spain, the critical juncture
of the Atlantic trade had the most transformative impact on England
because of such small differences—the fact that because of developments
during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the English Crown could
not control all overseas trade, as this trade was mostly under Crown
monopoly in France and Spain. As a result, in France and Spain, it was
the monarchy and the groups allied with it who were the main
beneficiaries of the large profits created by Atlantic trade and
colonial expansion, while in England it was groups strongly opposed to
the monarchy who gained from economic opportunities thrown open by this
critical juncture. Though institutional drift leads to small
differences, its interplay with critical junctures leads to
institutional divergence, and thus this divergence then creates the now
more major institutional differences that the next critical juncture
will affect. History is key, since it is historical processes that, via
institutional drift, create the differences that may become
consequential during critical junctures. Critical junctures themselves
are historical turning points. And the vicious and virtuous circles
imply that we have to study history to understand the nature of
institutional differences that have been historically structured. Yet
our theory does not imply historical determinism—or any other kind of
determinism. It is for this reason that the answer to the question we
started with in this chapter is no: there was no historical necessity
that Peru end up so much poorer than Western Europe or the United
States. To start with, in contrast with the geography and culture
hypotheses, Peru is not condemned to poverty because of its geography or
culture. In our theory, Peru is so much poorer than Western Europe and
the United States today because of its institutions, and to understand
the reasons for this, we need to understand the historical process of
institutional development in Peru. As we saw in the second chapter, five
hundred years ago the Inca Empire, which occupied contemporary Peru, was
richer, more technologically sophisticated, and more politically
centralized than the smaller polities occupying North America. The
turning point was the way in which this area was colonized and how this
contrasted with the colonization of North America. This resulted not
from a historically predetermined process but as the contingent outcome
of several pivotal institutional developments during critical junctures.
At least three factors could have changed this trajectory and led to
very different long-run patterns. First, institutional differences
within the Americas during the fifteenth century shaped how these areas
were colonized. North America followed a different institutional
trajectory than Peru because it was sparsely settled before colonization
and attracted European settlers who then successfully rose up against
the elite whom entities such as the Virginia Company and the English
Crown had tried to create. In contrast, Spanish conquistadors found a
centralized, extractive state in Peru they could take over and a large
population they could put to work in mines and plantations. There was
also nothing geographically predetermined about the lay of the land
within the Americas at the time the Europeans arrived. In the same way
that the emergence of a centralized state led by King Shyaam among the
Bushong was a result of a major institutional innovation, or perhaps
even of political revolution, as we saw in chapter 5, the Inca
civilization in Peru and the large populations in this area resulted
from major institutional innovations. These could instead have taken
place in North America, in places such as the Mississippi Valley or even
the northeastern United States. Had this been the case, Europeans might
have encountered empty lands in the Andes and centralized states in
North America, and the roles of Peru and the United States could have
been reversed. Europeans would then have settled in areas around Peru,
and the conflict between the majority of settlers and the elite could
have led to the creation of inclusive institutions there instead of in
North America. The subsequent paths of economic development would then
likely have been different. Second, the Inca Empire might have resisted
European colonialism, as Japan did when Commodore Perry’s ships arrived
in Edo Bay. Though the greater extractiveness of the Inca Empire in
contrast with Tokugawa, Japan, certainly made a political revolution
akin to the Meiji Restoration less likely in Peru, there was no
historical necessity that the Inca completely succumb to European
domination. If they had been able to resist and even institutionally
modernize in response to the threats, the whole path of the history of
the New World, and with it the entire history of the world, could have
been different. Third and most radically, it is not even historically or
geographically or culturally predetermined that Europeans should have
been the ones colonizing the world. It could have been the Chinese or
even the Incas. Of course, such an outcome is impossible when we look at
the world from the vantage point of the fifteenth century, by which time
Western Europe had pulled ahead of the Americas, and China had already
turned inward. But Western Europe of the fifteenth century was itself an
outcome of a contingent process of institutional drift punctuated by
critical junctures, and nothing about it was inevitable. Western
European powers could not have surged ahead and conquered the world
without several historic turning points. These included the specific
path that feudalism took, replacing slavery and weakening the power of
monarchs on the way; the fact that the centuries following the turn of
the first millennium in Europe witnessed the development of independent
and commercially autonomous cities; the fact that European monarchs were
not as threatened by, and consequently did not try to discourage,
overseas trade as the Chinese emperors did during the Ming dynasty; and
the arrival of the Black Death, which shook up the foundations of the
feudal order. If these events had transpired differently, we could be
living in a very different world today, one in which Peru might be
richer than Western Europe or the United States.</p>
<p>NATURALLY, THE PREDICTIVE POWER of a theory where both small
differences and contingency play key roles will be limited. Few would
have predicted in the fifteenth or even the sixteenth centuries, let
alone in the many centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire, that
the major breakthrough toward inclusive institutions would happen in
Britain. It was only the specific process of institutional drift and the
nature of the critical juncture created by the opening of Atlantic trade
that made this possible. Neither would many have believed in the midst
of the Cultural Revolution during the 1970s that China would soon be on
a path toward radical changes in its economic institutions and
subsequently on a breakneck growth trajectory. It is similarly
impossible to predict with any certainty what the lay of the land will
be in five hundred years. Yet these are not shortcomings of our theory.
The historical account we have presented so far indicates that any
approach based on historical determinism—based on geography, culture, or
even other historical factors—is inadequate. Small differences and
contingency are not just part of our theory; they are part of the shape
of history. Even if making precise predictions about which societies
will prosper relative to others is difficult, we have seen throughout
the book that our theory explains the broad differences in the
prosperity and poverty of nations around the world fairly well. We will
see in the rest of this chapter that it also provides some guidelines as
to what types of societies are more likely to achieve economic growth
over the next several decades. First, vicious and virtuous circles
generate a lot of persistence and sluggishness. There should be little
doubt that in fifty or even a hundred years, the United States and
Western Europe, based on their inclusive economic and political
institutions, will be richer, most likely considerably richer, than
sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Central America, or Southeast Asia.
However, within these broad patterns there will be major institutional
changes in the next century, with some countries breaking the mold and
transitioning from poor to rich. Nations that have achieved almost no
political centralization, such as Somalia and Afghanistan, or those that
have undergone a collapse of the state, such as Haiti did over the last
several decades—long before the massive earthquake there in 2010 led to
the devastation of the country’s infrastructure—are unlikely either to
achieve growth under extractive political institutions or to make major
changes toward inclusive institutions. Instead, nations likely to grow
over the next several decades—albeit probably under extractive
institutions—are those that have attained some degree of political
centralization. In sub-Saharan Africa this includes Burundi, Ethiopia,
Rwanda, nations with long histories of centralized states, and Tanzania,
which has managed to build such centralization, or at least put in place
some of the prerequisites for centralization, since independence. In
Latin America, it includes Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, which have not
only achieved political centralization but also made significant strides
toward nascent pluralism. Our theory would suggest that sustained
economic growth is very unlikely in Colombia. Our theory also suggests
that growth under extractive political institutions, as in China, will
not bring sustained growth, and is likely to run out of steam. Beyond
these cases, there is much uncertainty. Cuba, for example, might
transition toward inclusive institutions and experience a major economic
transformation, or it may linger on under extractive political and
economic institutions. The same is true of North Korea and Burma
(Myanmar) in Asia. Thus, while our theory provides the tools for
thinking about how institutions change and the consequences of such
changes, the nature of this change—the role of small differences and
contingency—makes more precise predictions difficult. Even greater
caution is necessary in drawing policy recommendations from this broad
account of the origins of prosperity and poverty. In the same way that
the impact of critical junctures depends on existing institutions, how a
society will respond to the same policy intervention depends on the
institutions that are in place. Of course, our theory is all about how
nations can take steps toward prosperity—by transforming their
institutions from extractive to inclusive. But it also makes it very
clear from the outset that there are no easy recipes for achieving such
a transition. First, the vicious circle implies that changing
institutions is much harder than it first appears. In particular,
extractive institutions can re-create themselves under different guises,
as we saw with the iron law of oligarchy in chapter 12. Thus the fact
that the extractive regime of President Mubarak was overturned by
popular protest in February 2011 does not guarantee that Egypt will move
onto a path to more inclusive institutions. Instead extractive
institutions may re-create themselves despite the vibrant and hopeful
pro-democracy movement. Second, because the contingent path of history
implies that it is difficult to know whether a particular interplay of
critical junctures and existing institutional differences will lead
toward more inclusive or extractive institutions, it would be heroic to
formulate general policy recommendations to encourage change toward
inclusive institutions. Nevertheless, our theory is still useful for
policy analysis, as it enables us to recognize bad policy advice, based
on either incorrect hypotheses or inadequate understanding of how
institutions can change. In this, as in most things, avoiding the worst
mistakes is as important as—and more realistic than—attempting to
develop simple solutions. Perhaps this is most clearly visible when we
consider current policy recommendations encouraging “authoritarian
growth” based on the successful Chinese growth experience of the last
several decades. We next explain why these policy recommendations are
misleading and why Chinese growth, as it has unfolded so far, is just
another form of growth under extractive political institutions, unlikely
to translate into sustained economic development.</p>
<p>THE IRRESISTIBLE CHARM OF AUTHORITARIAN GROWTH</p>
<p>Dai Guofang recognized the coming urban boom in China early on. New
highways, business centers, residences, and skyscrapers were sprawling
everywhere around China in the 1990s, and Dai thought this growth would
only pick up speed in the next decade. He reasoned that his company,
Jingsu Tieben Iron and Steel, could capture a large market as a low-cost
producer, especially compared with the inefficient state-owned steel
factories. Dai planned to build a true steel giant, and with support
from the local party bosses in Changzhou, he started building in 2003.
By March 2004, however, the project had been stopped by order of the
Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, and Dai was arrested for reasons
never clearly articulated. The authorities may have presumed that they
would find some incriminating evidence in Dai’s accounts. In the event,
he spent the next five years in jail and home detention, and was found
guilty on a minor charge in 2009. His real crime was to start a large
project that would compete with state-sponsored companies and do so
without the approval of the higher-ups in the Communist Party. This was
certainly the lesson that others drew from the case. The Communist
Party’s reaction to entrepreneurs such as Dai should not be a surprise.
Chen Yun, one of Deng Xiaoping’s closest associates and arguably the
major architect behind the early market reforms, summarized the views of
most party cadres with a “bird in a cage” analogy for the economy:
China’s economy was the bird; the party’s control, the cage, had to be
enlarged to make the bird healthier and more dynamic, but it could not
be unlocked or removed, lest the bird fly away. Jiang Zemin, shortly
after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party in 1989, the
most powerful position in China, went even further and summarized the
party’s suspicion of entrepreneurs by characterizing them as
“self-employed traders and peddlers 〔who〕 cheat, embezzle, bribe and
evade taxation.” Throughout the 1990s, even as foreign investment was
pouring into China and state-owned enterprises were encouraged to
expand, private entrepreneurship was greeted with suspicion, and many
entrepreneurs were expropriated or even jailed. Jiang Zemin’s view of
entrepreneurs, though in relative decline, is still widespread in China.
In the words of a Chinese economist, “Big state companies can get
involved in huge projects. But when private companies do so, especially
in competition with the state, then trouble comes from every corners
〔sic〕.”</p>
<p>While scores of private companies are now profitably operating in
China, many elements of the economy are still under the party’s command
and protection. Journalist Richard McGregor reports that on the desk of
the head of each of the biggest state companies in China stands a red
phone. When it rings, it is the party calling with orders on what the
company should do, where it should invest, and what its targets will be.
These giant companies are still under the command of the party, a fact
we are reminded of when the party decides to shuffle their chief
executives, fire them, or promote them, with little explanation. These
stories of course do not deny that China has made great strides toward
inclusive economic institutions, strides that underpin its spectacular
growth rates over the past thirty years. Most entrepreneurs have some
security, not least because they cultivate the support of local cadres
and Communist Party elites in Beijing. Most state-owned enterprises seek
profits and compete in international markets. This is a radical change
from the China of Mao. As we saw in the previous chapter, China was
first able to grow because under Deng Xiaoping there were radical
reforms away from the most extractive economic institutions and toward
inclusive economic institutions. Growth has continued as Chinese
economic institutions have been on a path toward greater inclusiveness,
albeit at a slow pace. China is also greatly benefiting from its large
supply of cheap labor and its access to foreign markets, capital, and
technologies. Even if Chinese economic institutions are incomparably
more inclusive today than three decades ago, the Chinese experience is
an example of growth under extractive political institutions. Despite
the recent emphasis in China on innovation and technology, Chinese
growth is based on the adoption of existing technologies and rapid
investment, not creative destruction. An important aspect of this is
that property rights are not entirely secure in China. Every now and
then, just like Dai, some entrepreneurs are expropriated. Labor mobility
is tightly regulated, and the most basic of property rights, the right
to sell one’s own labor in the way one wishes, is still highly
imperfect. The extent to which economic institutions are still far from
being truly inclusive is illustrated by the fact that only a few
businessmen and -women would even venture into any activity without the
support of the local party cadre or, even more important, of Beijing.
The connection between business and the party is highly lucrative for
both. Businesses supported by the party receive contracts on favorable
terms, can evict ordinary people to expropriate their land, and violate
laws and regulations with impunity. Those who stand in the path of this
business plan will be trampled and can even be jailed or murdered. The
all-too-present weight of the Communist Party and extractive
institutions in China remind us of the many similarities between Soviet
growth in the 1950s and ’60s and Chinese growth today, though there are
also notable differences. The Soviet Union achieved growth under
extractive economic institutions and extractive political institutions
because it forcibly allocated resources toward industry under a
centralized command structure, particularly armaments and heavy
industry. Such growth was feasible partly because there was a lot of
catching up to be done. Growth under extractive institutions is easier
when creative destruction is not a necessity. Chinese economic
institutions are certainly more inclusive than those in the Soviet
Union, but China’s political institutions are still extractive. The
Communist Party is all-powerful in China and controls the entire state
bureaucracy, the armed forces, the media, and large parts of the
economy. Chinese people have few political freedoms and very little
participation in the political process. Many have long believed that
growth in China would bring democracy and greater pluralism. There was a
real sense in 1989 that the Tiananmen Square demonstrations would lead
to greater opening and perhaps even the collapse of the communist
regime. But tanks were unleashed on the demonstrators, and instead of a
peaceful revolution, history books now call it the Tiananmen Square
Massacre. In many ways, Chinese political institutions became more
extractive in the aftermath of Tiananmen; reformers such as Zhao Ziyang,
who as general secretary of the Communist Party lent his support to the
students in Tiananmen Square, were purged, and the party clamped down on
civil liberties and press freedom with greater zeal. Zhao Ziyang was put
under house arrest for more than fifteen years, and his public record
was gradually erased, so that he would not be even a symbol for those
who supported political change. Today the party’s control over the
media, including the Internet, is unprecedented. Much of this is
achieved through self-censorship: media outlets know that they should
not mention Zhao Ziyang or Liu Xiaobo, the government critic demanding
greater democratization, who is still languishing in prison even after
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Self-censorship is supported by an
Orwellian apparatus that can monitor conversations and communications,
close Web sites and newspapers, and even selectively block access to
individual news stories on the Internet. All of this was on display when
news about corruption charges against the son of the general secretary
of the party since 2002, Hu Jintao, broke out in 2009. The party’s
apparatus immediately sprang into action and was not only able to
prevent Chinese media from covering the case but also managed to
selectively block stories about the case on the New York Times and
Financial Times Web sites. Because of the party’s control over economic
institutions, the extent of creative destruction is heavily curtailed,
and it will remain so until there is radical reform in political
institutions. Just as in the Soviet Union, the Chinese experience of
growth under extractive political institutions is greatly facilitated
because there is a lot of catching up to do. Income per capita in China
is still a fraction of that in the United States and Western Europe. Of
course, Chinese growth is considerably more diversified than Soviet
growth; it doesn’t rely on only armaments or heavy industry, and Chinese
entrepreneurs are showing a lot of ingenuity. All the same, this growth
will run out of steam unless extractive political institutions make way
for inclusive institutions. As long as political institutions remain
extractive, growth will be inherently limited, as it has been in all
other similar cases. The Chinese experience does raise several
interesting questions about the future of Chinese growth and, more
important, the desirability and viability of authoritarian growth. Such
growth has become a popular alternative to the “Washington consensus,”
which emphasizes the importance of market and trade liberalization and
certain forms of institutional reform for kick-starting economic growth
in many less developed parts of the world. While part of the appeal of
authoritarian growth comes as a reaction to the Washington consensus,
perhaps its greater charm—certainly to the rulers presiding over
extractive institutions—is that it gives them free rein in maintaining
and even strengthening their hold on power and legitimizes their
extraction. As our theory highlights, particularly in societies that
have undergone some degree of state centralization, this type of growth
under extractive institutions is possible and may even be the most
likely scenario for many nations, ranging from Cambodia and Vietnam to
Burundi, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. But it also implies that like all
examples of growth under extractive political institutions, it will not
be sustained. In the case of China, the growth process based on
catch-up, import of foreign technology, and export of low-end
manufacturing products is likely to continue for a while. Nevertheless,
Chinese growth is also likely to come to an end, particularly once China
reaches the standards of living level of a middle-income country. The
most likely scenario may be for the Chinese Communist Party and the
increasingly powerful Chinese economic elite to manage to maintain their
very tight grip on power in the next several decades. In this case,
history and our theory suggest that growth with creative destruction and
true innovation will not arrive, and the spectacular growth rates in
China will slowly evaporate. But this outcome is far from preordained;
it can be avoided if China transitions to inclusive political
institutions before its growth under extractive institutions reaches its
limit. Nevertheless, as we will see next, there is little reason to
expect that a transition in China toward more inclusive political
institutions is likely or that it will take place automatically and
painlessly. Even some voices within the Chinese Communist Party are
recognizing the dangers on the road ahead and are throwing around the
idea that political reform—that is, a transition to more inclusive
political institutions, to use our terminology—is necessary. The
powerful premier Wen Jiabao has recently warned of the danger that
economic growth will be hampered unless political reform gets under way.
We think Wen’s analysis is prescient, even if some people doubt his
sincerity. But many in the West do not agree with Wen’s pronouncements.
To them, China reveals an alternative path to sustained economic growth,
one under authoritarianism rather than inclusive economic and political
institutions. But they are wrong. We have already seen the important
salient roots of Chinese success: a radical change in economic
institutions away from rigidly communist ones and toward institutions
that provide incentives to increase productivity and to trade. Looked at
from this perspective, there is nothing fundamentally different about
China’s experience relative to that of countries that have managed to
take steps away from extractive and toward inclusive economic
institutions, even when this takes place under extractive political
institutions, as in the Chinese case. China has thus achieved economic
growth not thanks to its extractive political institutions, but despite
them: its successful growth experience over the last three decades is
due to a radical shift away from extractive economic institutions and
toward significantly more inclusive economic institutions, which was
made more difficult, not easier, by the presence of highly
authoritarian, extractive political institutions.</p>
<p>A DIFFERENT TYPE of endorsement of authoritarian growth recognizes
its unattractive nature but claims that authoritarianism is just a
passing stage. This idea goes back to one of the classical theories of
political sociology, the theory of modernization, formulated by Seymour
Martin Lipset. Modernization theory maintains that all societies, as
they grow, are headed toward a more modern, developed, and civilized
existence, and in particular toward democracy. Many followers of
modernization theory also claim that, like democracy, inclusive
institutions will emerge as a by-product of the growth process.
Moreover, even though democracy is not the same as inclusive political
institutions, regular elections and relatively unencumbered political
competition are likely to bring forth the development of inclusive
political institutions. Different versions of modernization theory also
claim that an educated workforce will naturally lead to democracy and
better institutions. In a somewhat postmodern version of modernization
theory, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman went so far as to
suggest that once a country got enough McDonald’s restaurants, democracy
and institutions were bound to follow. All this paints an optimistic
picture. Over the past sixty years, most countries, even many of those
with extractive institutions, have experienced some growth, and most
have witnessed notable increases in the educational attainment of their
workforces. So, as their incomes and educational levels continue to
rise, one way or another, all other good things, such as democracy,
human rights, civil liberties, and secure property rights, should
follow. Modernization theory has a wide following both within and
outside academia. Recent U.S. attitudes toward China, for example, have
been shaped by this theory. George H. W. Bush summarized U.S. policy
toward Chinese democracy as “Trade freely with China and time is on our
side.” The idea was that as China traded freely with the West, it would
grow, and that growth would bring democracy and better institutions in
China, as modernization theory predicted. Yet the rapid increase in
U.S.-China trade since the mid-1980s has done little for Chinese
democracy, and the even closer integration that is likely to follow
during the next decade will do equally little. The attitudes of many
about the future of Iraqi society and democracy in the aftermath of the
U.S.-led invasion were similarly optimistic because of modernization
theory. Despite its disastrous economic performance under Saddam
Hussein’s regime, Iraq was not as poor in 2002 as many sub-Saharan
African nations, and it had a comparatively well-educated population, so
it was believed to be ripe ground for the development of democracy and
civil liberties, and perhaps even what we would describe as pluralism.
These hopes were quickly dashed as chaos and civil war descended upon
Iraqi society. Modernization theory is both incorrect and unhelpful for
thinking about how to confront the major problems of extractive
institutions in failing nations. The strongest piece of evidence in
favor of modernization theory is that rich nations are the ones that
have democratic regimes, respect civil and human rights, and enjoy
functioning markets and generally inclusive economic institutions. Yet
interpreting this association as supporting modernization theory ignores
the major effect of inclusive economic and political institutions on
economic growth. As we have argued throughout this book, it is the
societies with inclusive institutions that have grown over the past
three hundred years and have become relatively rich today. That this
accounts for what we see around us is shown clearly if we look at the
facts slightly differently: while nations that have built inclusive
economic and political institutions over the last several centuries have
achieved sustained economic growth, authoritarian regimes that have
grown more rapidly over the past sixty or one hundred years, contrary to
what Lipset’s modernization theory would claim, have not become more
democratic. And this is in fact not surprising. Growth under extractive
institutions is possible precisely because it doesn’t necessarily or
automatically imply the demise of these very institutions. In fact, it
is often generated because those in control of the extractive
institutions view economic growth as not a threat but a support to their
regime, as the Chinese Communist Party has done since the 1980s. It is
also not surprising that growth generated by increases in the value of
the natural resources of a nation, such as in Gabon, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, and Venezuela, is unlikely to lead to a fundamental
transformation of these authoritarian regimes toward inclusive
institutions. The historical record is even less generous to
modernization theory. Many relatively prosperous nations have succumbed
to and supported repressive dictatorships and extractive institutions.
Both Germany and Japan were among the richest and most industrialized
nations in the world in the first half of the twentieth century, and had
comparatively well-educated citizens. This did not prevent the rise of
the National Socialist Party in Germany or a militaristic regime intent
on territorial expansion via war in Japan—making both political and
economic institutions take a sharp turn toward extractive institutions.
Argentina was also one of the richest countries in the world in the
nineteenth century, as rich as or even richer than Britain, because it
was the beneficiary of the worldwide resource boom; it also had the most
educated population in Latin America. But democracy and pluralism were
no more successful, and were arguably less successful, in Argentina than
in much of the rest of Latin America. One coup followed another, and as
we saw in chapter 11, even democratically elected leaders acted as
rapacious dictators. Even more recently there has been little progress
toward inclusive economic institutions, and as we saw in chapter 13,
twenty-first-century Argentinian governments can still expropriate their
citizens’ wealth with impunity. All of this highlights several important
ideas. First, growth under authoritarian, extractive political
institutions in China, though likely to continue for a while yet, will
not translate into sustained growth, supported by truly inclusive
economic institutions and creative destruction. Second, contrary to the
claims of modernization theory, we should not count on authoritarian
growth leading to democracy or inclusive political institutions. China,
Russia, and several other authoritarian regimes currently experiencing
some growth are likely to reach the limits of extractive growth before
they transform their political institutions in a more inclusive
direction—and in fact, probably before there is any desire among the
elite for such changes or any strong opposition forcing them to do so.
Third, authoritarian growth is neither desirable nor viable in the long
run, and thus should not receive the endorsement of the international
community as a template for nations in Latin America, Asia, and
sub-Saharan Africa, even if it is a path that many nations will choose
precisely because it is sometimes consistent with the interests of the
economic and political elites dominating them.</p>
<p>YOU CAN’T ENGINEER PROSPERITY</p>
<p>Unlike the theory we have developed in this book, the ignorance
hypothesis comes readily with a suggestion about how to “solve” the
problem of poverty: if ignorance got us here, enlightening and informing
rulers and policymakers can get us out, and we should be able to
“engineer” prosperity around the world by providing the right advice and
by convincing politicians of what is good economics. In chapter 2, when
we discussed this hypothesis, we showed how the experience of Ghana’s
prime minister Kofi Busia in the early 1970s underscored the fact that
the main obstacle to the adoption of policies that would reduce market
failures and encourage economic growth is not the ignorance of
politicians, but the incentives and constraints they face from the
political and economic institutions in their societies. Nevertheless,
the ignorance hypothesis still rules supreme in Western policymaking
circles, which, almost to the exclusion of anything else, focus on how
to engineer prosperity. These engineering attempts come in two flavors.
The first, often advocated by international organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund, recognizes that poor development is caused
by bad economic policies and institutions, and then proposes a list of
improvements these international organizations attempt to induce poor
countries to adopt. (The Washington consensus makes up one such list.)
These improvements focus on sensible things such as macroeconomic
stability and seemingly attractive macroeconomic goals such as a
reduction in the size of the government sector, flexible exchange rates,
and capital account liberalization. They also focus on more
microeconomic goals, such as privatization, improvements in the
efficiency of public service provision, and perhaps also suggestions as
to how to improve the functioning of the state itself by emphasizing
anticorruption measures. Though on their own many of these reforms might
be sensible, the approach of international organizations in Washington,
London, Paris, and elsewhere is still steeped in an incorrect
perspective that fails to recognize the role of political institutions
and the constraints they place on policymaking. Attempts by
international institutions to engineer economic growth by hectoring poor
countries into adopting better policies and institutions are not
successful because they do not take place in the context of an
explanation of why bad policies and institutions are there in the first
place, except that the leaders of poor countries are ignorant. The
consequence is that the policies are not adopted and not implemented, or
are implemented in name only. For example, many economies around the
world ostensibly implementing such reforms, most notably in Latin
America, stagnated throughout the 1980s and ’90s. In reality, such
reforms were foisted upon these countries in contexts where politics
went on as usual. Hence, even when reforms were adopted, their intent
was subverted, or politicians used other ways to blunt their impact. All
this is illustrated by the “implementation” of one of the key
recommendations of international institutions aimed at achieving
macroeconomic stability, central bank independence. This recommendation
either was implemented in theory but not in practice or was undermined
by the use of other policy instruments. It was quite sensible in
principle. Many politicians around the world were spending more than
they were raising in tax revenue and were then forcing their central
banks to make up the difference by printing money. The resulting
inflation was creating instability and uncertainty. The theory was that
independent central banks, just like the Bundesbank in Germany, would
resist political pressure and put a lid on inflation. Zimbabwe’s
president Mugabe decided to heed international advice; he declared the
Zimbabwean central bank independent in 1995. Before this, the inflation
rate in Zimbabwe was hovering around 20 percent. By 2002 it had reached
140 percent; by 2003, almost 600 percent; by 2007, 66,000 percent; and
by 2008, 230 million percent! Of course, in a country where the
president wins the lottery (this page–this page), it should surprise
nobody that passing a law making the central bank independent means
nothing. The governor of the Zimbabwean central bank probably knew how
his counterpart in Sierra Leone had “fallen” from the top floor of the
central bank building when he disagreed with Siaka Stevens (this page).
Independent or not, complying with the president’s demands was the
prudent choice for his personal health, even if not for the health of
the economy. Not all countries are like Zimbabwe. In Argentina and
Colombia, central banks were also made independent in the 1990s, and
they actually did their job of reducing inflation. But since in neither
country was politics changed, political elites could use other ways to
buy votes, maintain their interests, and reward themselves and their
followers. Since they couldn’t do this by printing money anymore, they
had to use a different way. In both countries the introduction of
central bank independence coincided with a big expansion in government
expenditures, financed largely by borrowing. The second approach to
engineering prosperity is much more in vogue nowadays. It recognizes
that there are no easy fixes for lifting a nation from poverty to
prosperity overnight or even in the course of a few decades. Instead, it
claims, there are many “micro-market failures” that can be redressed
with good advice, and prosperity will result if policymakers take
advantage of these opportunities—which, again, can be achieved with the
help and vision of economists and others. Small market failures are
everywhere in poor countries, this approach claims—for example, in their
education systems, health care delivery, and the way their markets are
organized. This is undoubtedly true. But the problem is that these small
market failures may be only the tip of the iceberg, the symptom of
deeper-rooted problems in a society functioning under extractive
institutions. Just as it is not a coincidence that poor countries have
bad macroeconomic policies, it is not a coincidence that their
educational systems do not work well. These market failures may not be
due solely to ignorance. The policymakers and bureaucrats who are
supposed to act on well-intentioned advice may be as much a part of the
problem, and the many attempts to rectify these inefficiencies may
backfire precisely because those in charge are not grappling with the
institutional causes of the poverty in the first place. These problems
are illustrated by intervention engineered by the nongovernmental
organization (NGO) Seva Mandir to improve health care delivery in the
state of Rajasthan in India. The story of health care delivery in India
is one of deep-rooted inefficiency and failure. Government-provided
health care is, at least in theory, widely available and cheap, and the
personnel are generally qualified. But even the poorest Indians do not
use government health care facilities, opting instead for the much more
expensive, unregulated, and sometimes even deficient private providers.
This is not because of some type of irrationality: people are unable to
get any care from government facilities, which are plagued by
absenteeism. If an Indian visited his government-run facility, not only
would there be no nurses there, but he would probably not even be able
to get in the building, because health care facilities are closed most
of the time. In 2006 Seva Mandir, together with a group of economists,
designed an incentive scheme to encourage nurses to turn up for work in
the Udaipur district of Rajasthan. The idea was simple: Seva Mandir
introduced time clocks that would stamp the date and time when nurses
were in the facility. Nurses were supposed to stamp their time cards
three times a day, to ensure that they arrived on time, stayed around,
and left on time. If such a scheme worked, and increased the quality and
quantity of health care provision, it would be a strong illustration of
the theory that there were easy solutions to key problems in
development. In the event, the intervention revealed something very
different. Shortly after the program was implemented, there was a sharp
increase in nurse attendance. But this was very short lived. In a little
more than a year, the local health administration of the district
deliberately undermined the incentive scheme introduced by Seva Mandir.
Absenteeism was back to its usual level, yet there was a sharp increase
in “exempt days,” which meant that nurses were not actually around—but
this was officially sanctioned by the local health administration. There
was also a sharp increase in “machine problems,” as the time clocks were
broken. But Seva Mandir was unable to replace them because local health
ministers would not cooperate. Forcing nurses to stamp a time clock
three times a day doesn’t seem like such an innovative idea. Indeed, it
is a practice used throughout the industry, even Indian industry, and it
must have occurred to health administrators as a potential solution to
their problems. It seems unlikely, then, that ignorance of such a simple
incentive scheme was what stopped its being used in the first place.
What occurred during the program simply confirmed this. Health
administrators sabotaged the program because they were in cahoots with
the nurses and complicit in the endemic absenteeism problems. They did
not want an incentive scheme forcing nurses to turn up or reducing their
pay if they did not. What this episode illustrates is a micro version of
the difficulty of implementing meaningful changes when institutions are
the cause of the problems in the first place. In this case, it was not
corrupt politicians or powerful businesses undermining institutional
reform, but rather, the local health administration and nurses who were
able to sabotage Seva Mandir’s and the development economists’ incentive
scheme. This suggests that many of the micro-market failures that are
apparently easy to fix may be illusory: the institutional structure that
creates market failures will also prevent implementation of
interventions to improve incentives at the micro level. Attempting to
engineer prosperity without confronting the root cause of the
problems—extractive institutions and the politics that keeps them in
place—is unlikely to bear fruit.</p>
<p>THE FAILURE OF FOREIGN AID</p>
<p>Following the September 11, 2001, attacks by Al Qaeda, U.S.-led
forces swiftly toppled the repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan,
which was harboring and refusing to hand over key members of Al Qaeda.
The Bonn Agreement of December 2001 between leaders of the former Afghan
mujahideen who had cooperated with the U.S. forces and key members of
the Afghan diaspora, including Hamid Karzai, created a plan for the
establishment of a democratic regime. A first step was the nationwide
grand assembly, the Loya Jirga, which elected Karzai to lead the interim
government. Things were looking up for Afghanistan. A majority of the
Afghan people were longing to leave the Taliban behind. The
international community thought that all that Afghanistan needed now was
a large infusion of foreign aid. Representatives from the United Nations
and several leading NGOs soon descended on the capital, Kabul. What
ensued should not have been a surprise, especially given the failure of
foreign aid to poor countries and failed states over the past five
decades. Surprise or not, the usual ritual was repeated. Scores of aid
workers and their entourages arrived in town with their own private
jets, NGOs of all sorts poured in to pursue their own agendas, and
high-level talks began between governments and delegations from the
international community. Billions of dollars were now coming to
Afghanistan. But little of it was used for building infrastructure,
schools, or other public services essential for the development of
inclusive institutions or even for restoring law and order. While much
of the infrastructure remained in tatters, the first tranche of the
money was used to commission an airline to shuttle around UN and other
international officials. The next thing they needed were drivers and
interpreters. So they hired the few English-speaking bureaucrats and the
remaining teachers in Afghan schools to chauffeur and chaperone them
around, paying them multiples of current Afghan salaries. As the few
skilled bureaucrats were shunted into jobs servicing the foreign aid
community, the aid flows, rather than building infrastructure in
Afghanistan, started by undermining the Afghan state they were supposed
to build upon and strengthen. Villagers in a remote district in the
central valley of Afghanistan heard a radio announcement about a new
multimillion-dollar program to restore shelter to their area. After a
long while, a few wooden beams, carried by the trucking cartel of Ismail
Khan, famous former warlord and member of the Afghan government, were
delivered. But they were too big to be used for anything in the
district, and the villagers put them to the only possible use: firewood.
So what had happened to the millions of dollars promised to the
villagers? Of the promised money, 20 percent of it was taken as UN head
office costs in Geneva. The remainder was subcontracted to an NGO, which
took another 20 percent for its own head office costs in Brussels, and
so on, for another three layers, with each party taking approximately
another 20 percent of what was remaining. The little money that reached
Afghanistan was used to buy wood from western Iran, and much of it was
paid to Ismail Khan’s trucking cartel to cover the inflated transport
prices. It was a bit of a miracle that those oversize wooden beams even
arrived in the village. What happened in the central valley of
Afghanistan is not an isolated incident. Many studies estimate that only
about 10 or at most 20 percent of aid ever reaches its target. There are
dozens of ongoing fraud investigations into charges of UN and local
officials siphoning off aid money. But most of the waste resulting from
foreign aid is not fraud, just incompetence or even worse: simply
business as usual for aid organizations. The Afghan experience with aid
was in fact probably a qualified success compared to others. Throughout
the last five decades, hundreds of billions of dollars have been paid to
governments around the world as “development” aid. Much of it has been
wasted in overhead and corruption, just as in Afghanistan. Worse, a lot
of it went to dictators such as Mobutu, who depended on foreign aid from
his Western patrons both to buy support from his clients to shore up his
regime and to enrich himself. The picture in much of the rest of
sub-Saharan Africa was similar. Humanitarian aid given for temporary
relief in times of crises, for example, most recently in Haiti and
Pakistan, has certainly been more useful, even though its delivery, too,
has been marred in similar problems. Despite this unflattering track
record of “development” aid, foreign aid is one of the most popular
policies that Western governments, international organizations such as
the United Nations, and NGOs of different ilk recommend as a way of
combating poverty around the world. And of course, the cycle of the
failure of foreign aid repeats itself over and over again. The idea that
rich Western countries should provide large amounts of “developmental
aid” in order to solve the problem of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, the
Caribbean, Central America, and South Asia is based on an incorrect
understanding of what causes poverty. Countries such as Afghanistan are
poor because of their extractive institutions—which result in lack of
property rights, law and order, or well-functioning legal systems and
the stifling dominance of national and, more often, local elites over
political and economic life. The same institutional problems mean that
foreign aid will be ineffective, as it will be plundered and is unlikely
to be delivered where it is supposed to go. In the worst-case scenario,
it will prop up the regimes that are at the very root of the problems of
these societies. If sustained economic growth depends on inclusive
institutions, giving aid to regimes presiding over extractive
institutions cannot be the solution. This is not to deny that, even
beyond humanitarian aid, considerable good comes out of specific aid
programs that build schools in areas where none existed before and that
pay teachers who would otherwise go unpaid. While much of the aid
community that poured into Kabul did little to improve life for ordinary
Afghans, there have also been notable successes in building schools,
particularly for girls, who were entirely excluded from education under
the Taliban and even before. One solution—which has recently become more
popular, partly based on the recognition that institutions have
something to do with prosperity and even the delivery of aid—is to make
aid “conditional.” According to this view, continued foreign aid should
depend on recipient governments meeting certain conditions—for example,
liberalizing markets or moving toward democracy. The George W. Bush
administration undertook the biggest step toward this type of
conditional aid by starting the Millennium Challenge Accounts, which
made future aid payments dependent on quantitative improvements in
several dimensions of economic and political development. But the
effectiveness of conditional aid appears no better than the
unconditional kind. Countries failing to meet these conditions typically
receive as much aid as those that do. There is a simple reason: they
have a greater need for aid of either the developmental or humanitarian
kind. And quite predictably, conditional aid seems to have little effect
on a nation’s institutions. After all, it would have been quite
surprising for somebody such as Siaka Stevens in Sierra Leone or Mobutu
in the Congo suddenly to start dismantling the extractive institutions
on which he depended just for a little more foreign aid. Even in
sub-Saharan Africa, where foreign aid is a significant fraction of many
governments’ total budget, and even after the Millennium Challenge
Accounts, which increased the extent of conditionality, the amount of
additional foreign aid that a dictator can obtain by undermining his own
power is both small and not worth the risk either to his continued
dominance over the country or to his life. But all this does not imply
that foreign aid, except the humanitarian kind, should cease. Putting an
end to foreign aid is impractical and would likely lead to additional
human suffering. It is impractical because citizens of many Western
nations feel guilt and unease about the economic and humanitarian
disasters around the world, and foreign aid makes them believe that
something is being done to combat the problems. Even if this something
is not very effective, their desire for doing it will continue, and so
will foreign aid. The enormous complex of international organizations
and NGOs will also ceaselessly demand and mobilize resources to ensure
the continuation of the status quo. Also, it would be callous to cut the
aid given to the neediest nations. Yes, much of it is wasted. But if out
of every dollar given to aid, ten cents makes it to the poorest people
in the world, that is ten cents more than they had before to alleviate
the most abject poverty, and it might still be better than nothing.
There are two important lessons here. First, foreign aid is not a very
effective means of dealing with the failure of nations around the world
today. Far from it. Countries need inclusive economic and political
institutions to break out of the cycle of poverty. Foreign aid can
typically do little in this respect, and certainly not with the way that
it is currently organized. Recognizing the roots of world inequality and
poverty is important precisely so that we do not pin our hopes on false
promises. As those roots lie in institutions, foreign aid, within the
framework of given institutions in recipient nations, will do little to
spur sustained growth. Second, since the development of inclusive
economic and political institutions is key, using the existing flows of
foreign aid at least in part to facilitate such development would be
useful. As we saw, conditionality is not the answer here, as it requires
existing rulers to make concessions. Instead, perhaps structuring
foreign aid so that its use and administration bring groups and leaders
otherwise excluded from power into the decision-making process and
empowering a broad segment of population might be a better prospect.</p>
<p>EMPOWERMENT</p>
<p>May 12, 1978, seemed as if it were going to be a normal day at the
Scânia truck factory in the city of São Bernardo in the Brazilian state
of São Paulo. But the workers were restless. Strikes had been banned in
Brazil since 1964, when the military overthrew the democratic government
of President João Goulart. But news had just broken that the government
had been fixing the national inflation figures so that the rise in the
cost of living had been underestimated. As the 7:00 a.m. shift began,
workers put down their tools. At 8:00 a.m., Gilson Menezes, a union
organizer working at the plant, called the union. The president of the
São Bernardo Metalworkers was a thirty-three-year-old activist called
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (“Lula”). By noon Lula was at the factory.
When the company asked him to persuade the employees to go back to work,
he refused. The Scânia strike was the first in a wave of strikes that
swept across Brazil. On the face of it these were about wages, but as
Lula later noted,</p>
<p>I think we can’t separate economic and political factors.… The …
struggle was over wages, but in struggling for wages, the working class
won a political victory.</p>
<p>The resurgence of the Brazilian labor movement was just part of a
much broader social reaction to a decade and a half of military rule.
The left-wing intellectual Fernando Henrique Cardoso, like Lula destined
to become president of Brazil after the re-creation of democracy, argued
in 1973 that democracy would be created in Brazil by the many social
groups that opposed the military coming together. He said that what was
needed was a “reactivation of civil society … the professional
associations, the trade unions, the churches, the student organizations,
the study groups and the debating circles, the social movements”—in
other words, a broad coalition with the aim of re-creating democracy and
changing Brazilian society. The Scânia factory heralded the formation of
this coalition. By late 1978, Lula was floating the idea of creating a
new political party, the Workers’ Party. This was to be the party not
just of trade unionists, however. Lula insisted that it should be a
party for all wage earners and the poor in general. Here the attempts of
union leaders to organize a political platform began to coalesce with
the many social movements that were springing up. On August 18, 1979, a
meeting was held in São Paulo to discuss the formation of the Workers’
Party, which brought together former opposition politicians, union
leaders, students, intellectuals, and people representing one hundred
diverse social movements that had begun to organize in the 1970s across
Brazil. The Workers’ Party, launched at the São Judas Tadeo restaurant
in São Bernardo in October 1979, would come to represent all these
diverse groups. The party quickly began to benefit from the political
opening that the military was reluctantly organizing. In the local
elections of 1982, it ran candidates for the first time, and won two
races for mayor. Throughout the 1980s, as democracy was gradually
re-created in Brazil, the Workers’ Party began to take over more and
more local governments. By 1988 it controlled the governments in
thirty-six municipalities, including large cities such as São Paulo and
Porto Alegre. In 1989, in the first free presidential elections since
the military coup, Lula won 16 percent of the vote in the first round as
the party’s candidate. In the runoff race with Fernando Collor, he won
44 percent. In taking over many local governments, something that
accelerated in the 1990s, the Workers’ Party began to enter into a
symbiotic relationship with many local social movements. In Porto Alegre
the first Workers’ Party administration after 1988 introduced
“participatory budgeting,” which was a mechanism for bringing ordinary
citizens into the formulation of the spending priorities of the city. It
created a system that has become a world model for local government
accountability and responsiveness, and it went along with huge
improvements in public service provision and the quality of life in the
city. The successful governance structure of the party at the local
level mapped into greater political mobilization and success at the
national level. Though Lula was defeated by Fernando Henrique Cardoso in
the presidential elections of 1994 and 1998, he was elected president of
Brazil in 2002. The Workers’ Party has been in power ever since. The
formation of a broad coalition in Brazil as a result of the coming
together of diverse social movements and organized labor has had a
remarkable impact on the Brazilian economy. Since 1990 economic growth
has been rapid, with the proportion of the population in poverty falling
from 45 percent to 30 percent in 2006. Inequality, which rose rapidly
under the military, has fallen sharply, particularly after the Workers’
Party took power, and there has been a huge expansion of education, with
the average years of schooling of the population increasing from six in
1995 to eight in 2006. Brazil has now become part of the BRIC nations
(Brazil, Russia, India, and China), the first Latin American country
actually to have weight in international diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>THE RISE OF BRAZIL since the 1970s was not engineered by economists
of international institutions instructing Brazilian policymakers on how
to design better policies or avoid market failures. It was not achieved
with injections of foreign aid. It was not the natural outcome of
modernization. Rather, it was the consequence of diverse groups of
people courageously building inclusive institutions. Eventually these
led to more inclusive economic institutions. But the Brazilian
transformation, like that of England in the seventeenth century, began
with the creation of inclusive political institutions. But how can
society build inclusive political institutions?</p>
<p>History, as we have seen, is littered with examples of reform
movements that succumbed to the iron law of oligarchy and replaced one
set of extractive institutions with even more pernicious ones. We have
seen that England in 1688, France in 1789, and Japan during the Meiji
Restoration of 1868 started the process of forging inclusive political
institutions with a political revolution. But such political revolutions
generally create much destruction and hardship, and their success is far
from certain. The Bolshevik Revolution advertised its aim as replacing
the exploitative economic system of tsarist Russia with a more just and
efficient one that would bring freedom and prosperity to millions of
Russians. Alas, the outcome was the opposite, and much more repressive
and extractive institutions replaced those of the government the
Bolsheviks overthrew. The experiences in China, Cuba, and Vietnam were
similar. Many noncommunist, top-down reforms fared no better. Nasser
vowed to build a modern egalitarian society in Egypt, but this led only
to Hosni Mubarak’s corrupt regime, as we saw in chapter 13. Robert
Mugabe was viewed by many as a freedom fighter ousting Ian Smith’s
racist and highly extractive Rhodesian regime. But Zimbabwe’s
institutions became no less extractive, and its economic performance has
been even worse than before independence. What is common among the
political revolutions that successfully paved the way for more inclusive
institutions and the gradual institutional changes in North America, in
England in the nineteenth century, and in Botswana after
independence—which also led to significant strengthening of inclusive
political institutions—is that they succeeded in empowering a fairly
broad cross-section of society. Pluralism, the cornerstone of inclusive
political institutions, requires political power to be widely held in
society, and starting from extractive institutions that vest power in a
narrow elite, this requires a process of empowerment. This, as we
emphasized in chapter 7, is what sets apart the Glorious Revolution from
the overthrow of one elite by another. In the case of the Glorious
Revolution, the roots of pluralism were in the overthrow of James II by
a political revolution led by a broad coalition consisting of merchants,
industrialists, the gentry, and even many members of the English
aristocracy not allied with the Crown. As we have seen, the Glorious
Revolution was facilitated by the prior mobilization and empowerment of
a broad coalition, and more important, it in turn led to the further
empowerment of an even broader segment of society than what came
before—even though clearly this segment was much less broad than the
entire society, and England would remain far from a true democracy for
more than another two hundred years. The factors leading to the
emergence of inclusive institutions in the North American colonies were
also similar, as we saw in the first chapter. Once again, the path
starting in Virginia, Carolina, Maryland, and Massachusetts and leading
up to the Declaration of Independence and to the consolidation of
inclusive political institutions in the United States was one of
empowerment for increasingly broader segments in society. The French
Revolution, too, is an example of empowerment of a broader segment of
society, which rose up against the ancien régime in France and managed
to pave the way for a more pluralistic political system. But the French
Revolution, especially the interlude of the Terror under Robespierre, a
repressive and murderous regime, also illustrates how the process of
empowerment is not without its pitfalls. Ultimately, however,
Robespierre and his Jacobin cadres were cast aside, and the most
important inheritance from the French Revolution became not the
guillotine but the far-ranging reforms that the revolution implemented
in France and other parts of Europe. There are many parallels between
these historical processes of empowerment and what took place in Brazil
starting in the 1970s. Though one root of the Workers’ Party is the
trade union movement, right from its early days, leaders such as Lula,
along with the many intellectuals and opposition politicians who lent
their support to the party, sought to make it into a broad coalition.
These impulses began to fuse with local social movements all over the
country, as the party took over local governments, encouraging civic
participation and causing a sort of revolution in governance throughout
the country. In Brazil, in contrast with England in the seventeenth
century or France at the turn of the eighteenth century, there was no
radical revolution igniting the process of transforming political
institutions at one fell swoop. But the process of empowerment that
started in the factories of São Bernardo was effective in part because
it translated into fundamental political change at the national
level—for example, the transitioning out of military rule to democracy.
More important, empowerment at the grass-roots level in Brazil ensured
that the transition to democracy corresponded to a move toward inclusive
political institutions, and thus was a key factor in the emergence of a
government committed to the provision of public services, educational
expansion, and a truly level playing field. As we have seen, democracy
is no guarantee that there will be pluralism. The contrast of the
development of pluralistic institutions in Brazil to the Venezuelan
experience is telling in this context. Venezuela also transitioned to
democracy after 1958, but this happened without empowerment at the
grassroots level and did not create a pluralistic distribution of
political power. Instead, corrupt politics, patronage networks, and
conflict persisted in Venezuela, and in part as a result, when voters
went to the polls, they were even willing to support potential despots
such as Hugo Chávez, most likely because they thought he alone could
stand up to the established elites of Venezuela. In consequence,
Venezuela still languishes under extractive institutions, while Brazil
broke the mold.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN BE DONE to kick-start or perhaps just facilitate the process
of empowerment and thus the development of inclusive political
institutions? The honest answer of course is that there is no recipe for
building such institutions. Naturally there are some obvious factors
that would make the process of empowerment more likely to get off the
ground. These would include the presence of some degree of centralized
order so that social movements challenging existing regimes do not
immediately descend into lawlessness; some preexisting political
institutions that introduce a modicum of pluralism, such as the
traditional political institutions in Botswana, so that broad coalitions
can form and endure; and the presence of civil society institutions that
can coordinate the demands of the population so that opposition
movements can neither be easily crushed by the current elites nor
inevitably turn into a vehicle for another group to take control of
existing extractive institutions. But many of these factors are
historically predetermined and change only slowly. The Brazilian case
illustrates how civil society institutions and associated party
organizations can be built from the ground up, but this process is slow,
and how successful it can be under different circumstances is not well
understood. One other actor, or set of actors, can play a transformative
role in the process of empowerment: the media. Empowerment of society at
large is difficult to coordinate and maintain without widespread
information about whether there are economic and political abuses by
those in power. We saw in chapter 11 the role of the media in informing
the public and coordinating their demands against forces undermining
inclusive institutions in the United States. The media can also play a
key role in channeling the empowerment of a broad segment of society
into more durable political reforms, again as illustrated in our
discussion in chapter 11, particularly in the context of British
democratization. Pamphlets and books informing and galvanizing people
played an important role during the Glorious Revolution in England, the
French Revolution, and the march toward democracy in nineteenth-century
Britain. Similarly, media, particularly new forms based on advances in
information and communication technology, such as Web blogs, anonymous
chats, Facebook, and Twitter, played a central role in Iranian
opposition against Ahmadinejad’s fraudulent election in 2009 and
subsequent repression, and they seem to be playing a similarly central
role in the Arab Spring protests that are ongoing as this manuscript is
being completed. Authoritarian regimes are often aware of the importance
of a free media, and do their best to fight it. An extreme illustration
of this comes from Alberto Fujimori’s rule in Peru. Though originally
democratically elected, Fujimori soon set up a dictatorial regime in
Peru, mounting a coup while still in office in 1992. Thereafter, though
elections continued, Fujimori built a corrupt regime and ruled through
repression and bribery. In this he relied heavily on his right-hand man,
Valdimiro Montesinos, who headed the powerful national intelligence
service of Peru. Montesinos was an organized man, so he kept good
records of how much the administration paid different individuals to buy
their loyalty, even videotaping many actual acts of bribery. There was a
logic to this. Beyond just recordkeeping, this evidence made sure that
the accomplices were now on record and would be considered as guilty as
Fujimori and Montesinos. After the fall of the regime, these records
fell into the hands of journalists and authorities. The amounts are
revealing about the value of the media to a dictatorship. A Supreme
Court judge was worth between ,000 and 0,000 a month, and politicians in
the same or different parties were paid similar amounts. But when it
came to newspapers and TV stations, the sums were in the millions.
Fujimori and Montesinos paid million on one occasion and more than 0
million on another to control TV stations. They paid more than million
to a mainstream newspaper, and to other newspapers they paid any amount
between ,000 and ,000 per headline. Fujimori and Montesinos thought that
controlling the media was much more important than controlling
politicians and judges. One of Montesinos’s henchmen, General Bello,
summed this up in one of the videos by stating, “If we do not control
the television we do not do anything.”</p>
<p>The current extractive institutions in China are also crucially
dependent on Chinese authorities’ control of the media, which, as we
have seen, has become frighteningly sophisticated. As a Chinese
commentator summarized, “To uphold the leadership of the Party in
political reform, three principles must be followed: that the Party
controls the armed forces; the Party controls cadres; and the Party
controls the news.”</p>
<p>But of course a free media and new communication technologies can
help only at the margins, by providing information and coordinating the
demands and actions of those vying for more inclusive institutions.
Their help will translate into meaningful change only when a broad
segment of society mobilizes and organizes in order to effect political
change, and does so not for sectarian reasons or to take control of
extractive institutions, but to transform extractive institutions into
more inclusive ones. Whether such a process will get under way and open
the door to further empowerment, and ultimately to durable political
reform, will depend, as we have seen in many different instances, on the
history of economic and political institutions, on many small
differences that matter and on the very contingent path of history.</p>

their expert advice. During much of the process of researching and
writing this book we were both members of the Canadian Institute for
Advanced Research’s (CIFAR) program on Institutions, Organizations, and
Growth. We presented research related to this book many times at CIFAR
meetings and have benefited hugely from the support of this wonderful
organization and the scholars that it brings together. We also received
comments from literally hundreds of people in various seminars and
conferences on the material developed in this book, and we apologize for
failing to attribute properly any suggestion, idea, or insight that we
got from those presentations and discussions. We are also very grateful
to María Angélica Bautista, Melissa Dell, and Leander Heldring for their
superb research assistance on this project. Last, but certainly not
least, we have been very fortunate to have a wonderful, insightful, and
extremely supportive editor, John Mahaney. John’s comments and
suggestions have greatly improved our book, and his support and
enthusiasm for the project made the last year and a half much more
pleasant and less taxing than it might have been.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 1 : So CLOSE AND YET SO DIFFERENT</p>
<p>A good discussion of the Spanish exploration of the Rio de La Plata
is Rock (1992), chap. 1. On the discovery and colonization of the
Guaraní, see Ganson (2003). The quotations from de Sahagún are from de
Sahagún (1975), pp. 47–49. Gibson (1963) is fundamental on the Spanish
conquest of Mexico and the institutions they structured. The quotations
from de las Casas come from de las Casas (1992), pp. 39, 117–18, and
107, respectively. On Pizarro in Peru, see Hemming (1983). Chaps. 1–6
cover the meeting at Cajamarca and the march south and the capture of
the Inca capital, Cuzco. See Hemming (1983), chap. 20, on de Toledo.
Bakewell (1984) gives an overview of the functioning of the Potosí mita,
and Dell (2010) provides statistical evidence that shows how it has had
persistent effects over time. The quote from Arthur Young is reproduced
from Sheridan (1973), p. 8. There are many good books that describe the
early history of Jamestown: for example, Price (2003), and Kupperman
(2007). Our treatment is heavily influenced by Morgan (1975) and
Galenson (1996). The quote from Anas Todkill comes from p. 38 of Todkill
(1885). The quotes from John Smith are from Price (2003), p. 77
(“Victuals …”), p. 93 (“If your king …”), and p. 96 (“When you send …”).
The Charter of Maryland, the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, and
other colonial constitutions have been put on the Internet by Yale
University’s Avalon Project, at avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century.
Bakewell (2009), chap. 14, discusses the independence of Mexico and the
constitution. See Stevens (1991) and Knight (2011) on postindependence
political instability and presidents. Coatsworth (1978) is the seminal
paper on the evidence on economic decline in Mexico after independence.
Haber (2010) presents the comparison of the development of banking in
Mexico and the United States. Sokoloff (1988) and Sokoloff and Khan
(1990) provide evidence on the social background of innovators in the
United States who filed patents. See Israel (2000) for a biography of
Thomas Edison. Haber, Maurer, and Razo (2003) proposes an interpretation
of the political economy of the regime of Porfirio Díaz very much in the
spirit of our discussion. Haber, Klein, Maurer, and Middlebrook (2008)
extend this treatment of Mexico’s political economy into the twentieth
century. On the differential allocation of frontier lands in North and
Latin America, see Nugent and Robinson (2010) and García-Jimeno and
Robinson (2011). Hu-DeHart (1984) discusses the deportation of the Yaqui
people in chap. 6. On the fortune of Carlos Slim and how it was made,
see Relea (2007) and Martinez (2002). Our interpretation of comparative
economic development of the Americas builds on our own previous research
with Simon Johnson, particularly Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001,
2002), and has also been heavily influenced by Coatsworth (1978, 2008)
and Engerman and Sokoloff (1997).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 : THEORIES THAT DON’T WORK</p>
<p>Jared Diamond’s views on world inequality are laid out in his book
Guns, Germs and Steel (1997). Sachs (2006) sets out his own version of
geographical determinism. Views about culture are widely spread
throughout the academic literature but have never been brought together
in one work. Weber (2002) argued that it was the Protestant Reformation
that explained why it was Europe that had the Industrial Revolution.
Landes (1999) proposed that Northern Europeans developed a unique set of
cultural attitudes that led them to work hard, save, and be innovative.
Harrison and Huntington, eds. (2000), is a forceful statement of the
importance of culture for comparative economic development. The notion
that there is some sort of superior British culture or superior set of
British institutions is widespread and used to explain U.S.
exceptionalism (Fisher, 1989) and also patterns of comparative
development more generally (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer,
2008). The works of Banfield (1958) and Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti
(1994) are very influential cultural interpretations of how one aspect
of culture, or “social capital,” as they call it, makes the south of
Italy poor. For a survey of how economists use notions of culture, see
Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2006). Tabellini (2010) examines the
correlation between the extent to which people trust each other in
Western Europe and levels of annual income per capita. Nunn and
Wantchekon (2010) show how the lack of trust and social capital in
Africa is correlated with the historical intensity of the slave trade.
The relevant history of the Kongo is presented in Hilton (1985) and
Thornton (1983). On the historical backwardness of African technology,
see the works of Goody (1971), Law (1980), and Austen and Headrick
(1983). The definition of economics proposed by Robbins is from Robbins
(1935), p. 16. The quote from Abba Lerner is in Lerner (1972), p. 259.
The idea that ignorance explains comparative development is implicit in
most economic analyses of economic development and policy reform: for
example, Williamson (1990); Perkins, Radelet, and Lindauer (2006); and
Aghion and Howitt (2009). A recent, forceful version of this view is
developed in Banerjee and Duflo (2011). Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson
(2001, 2002) provide a statistical analysis of the relative role of
institutions, geography, and culture, showing that institutions dominate
the other two types of explanations in accounting for differences in per
capita income today.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 3 : THE MAKING OF PROSPERITY AND POVERTY</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the meeting between Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn and his
brother is taken from James A. Foley’s interview of Hwang transcribed in
Foley (2003), pp. 197–203. The notion of extractive institutions
originates from Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001). The terminology
of inclusive institutions was suggested to us by Tim Besley. The
terminology of economic losers and the distinction between them and
political losers comes from Acemoglu and Robinson (2000b). The data on
Barbados comes from Dunn (1969). Our treatment of the Soviet economy
relies on Nove (1992) and Davies (1998). Allen (2003) provides an
alternative and more positive interpretation of Soviet economic history.
In the social science literature there is a great deal of research
related to our theory and argument. See Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson
(2005b) for an overview of this literature and our contribution to it.
The institutional view of comparative development builds on a number of
important works. Particularly notable is the work of North; see North
and Thomas (1973), North (1982), North and Weingast (1989), and North,
Wallis, and Weingast (2009). Olson (1984) also provided a very
influential account of the political economy of economic growth. Mokyr
(1990) is a fundamental book that links economic losers to comparative
technological change in world history. The notion of economic losers is
very widespread in social science as an explanation for why efficient
institutional and policy outcomes do not occur. Our interpretation,
which builds on Robinson (1998) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2000b,
2006b), differs by emphasizing the idea that the most important barrier
to the emergence of inclusive institutions is elites’ fear that they
will lose their political power. Jones (2003) provides a rich
comparative history emphasizing similar themes, and Engerman and
Sokoloff’s (1997) important work on the Americas also emphasizes these
ideas. A seminal political economy interpretation of African
underdevelopment was developed by Bates (1981, 1983, 1989), whose work
heavily influenced ours. Seminal studies by Dalton (1965) and Killick
(1978) emphasize the role of politics in African development and
particularly how the fear of losing political power influences economic
policy. The notion of political losers was previously implicit in other
theoretical work in political economy, for instance, Besley and Coate
(1998) and Bourguignon and Verdier (2000). The role of political
centralization and state institutions in development has been most
heavily emphasized by historical sociologists following the work by Max
Weber. Notable is the work of Mann (1986, 1993), Migdal (1988), and
Evans (1995). In Africa, work on the connection between the state and
development is emphasized by Herbst (2000) and Bates (2001). Economists
have recently begun to contribute to this literature; for example,
Acemoglu (2005) and Besley and Persson (2011). Finally, Johnson (1982),
Haggard (1990), Wade (1990), and Amsden (1992) emphasized how it was the
particular political economy of East Asian nations that allowed them to
be so economically successful. Finley (1965) made a seminal argument
that slavery was responsible for the lack of technological dynamism in
the classical world. The idea that growth under extractive institutions
is possible but is also likely to run out of steam is emphasized in
Acemoglu (2008).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4 : SMALL DIFFERENCES AND CRITICAL JUNCTURES</p>
<p>Benedictow (2004) provides a definitive overview of the Black Death,
though his assessments of how many people the plague killed are
controversial. The quotations from Boccaccio and Ralph of Shrewsbury are
reproduced from Horrox (1994). Hatcher (2008) provides a compelling
account of the anticipation and arrival of the plague in England. The
text of the Statute of Laborers is available online from the Avalon
Project, at avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/statlab.asp</p>
<p>The fundamental works on the impact of the Black Death on the
divergence of Eastern and Western Europe are North and Thomas (1973) and
particularly Brenner (1976), whose analysis of how the initial
distribution of political power affected the consequences of the plague
has greatly influenced our thinking. See DuPlessis (1997) on the Second
Serfdom in Eastern Europe. Conning (2010) and Acemoglu and Wolitzky
(2011) develop formalizations of Brenner’s thesis. The quote from James
Watt is reproduced from Robinson (1964), pp. 223–24. In Acemoglu,
Johnson, and Robinson (2005a) we first presented the argument that it
was the interaction between Atlantic trade and initial institutional
differences that led to the divergence of English institutions and
ultimately the Industrial Revolution. The notion of the iron law of
oligarchy is due to Michels (1962). The notion of a critical juncture
was first developed by Lipset and Rokkan (1967). On the role of
institutions in the long-run development of the Ottoman Empire, the
research of Owen (1981), Owen and Pamuk (1999), and Pamuk (2006) is
fundamental.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5 : “I’VE SEEN THE FUTURE, AND IT WORKS”</p>
<p>On Steffens’s mission to Russia and his words to Baruch, see Steffens
(1931), chap. 18, pp. 790–802. For the number of people who starved in
the 1930s, we use the figures of Davies and Wheatcroft (2004). On the
1937 census numbers, see Wheatcroft and Davies (1994a, 1994b). The
nature of innovation in the Soviet economy is studied in Berliner
(1976). Our discussion of how Stalinism, and particularly economic
planning, really worked is based on Gregory and Harrison (2005). On how
writers of U.S. economics textbooks continually got Soviet economic
growth wrong, see Levy and Peart (2009). Our treatment and
interpretation of the Lele and the Bushong is based on the research of
Douglas (1962, 1963) and Vansina (1978). On the concept of the Long
Summer, see Fagan (2003). An accessible introduction to the Natufians
and archaeological sites we mention can be found in Mithen (2006) and
Barker (2006). The seminal work on Abu Hureyra is Moore, Hillman, and
Legge (2000), which documents how sedentary life and institutional
innovation appeared prior to farming. See Smith (1998) for a general
overview of the evidence that sedentary life preceded farming, and see
Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen (1992) for the case of the Natufians. Our
approach to the Neolithic Revolution is inspired by Sahlins (1972),
which also has the anecdote about the Yir Yoront. Our discussion of Maya
history follows Martin and Grube (2000) and Webster (2002). The
reconstruction of the population history of Copán comes from Webster,
Freter, and Gonlin (2000). The number of dated monuments is from Sidrys
and Berger (1979).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 6 : DRIFTING APART</p>
<p>The discussion of the Venetian case follows Puga and Trefler (2010),
and chaps. 8 and 9 of Lane (1973). The material on Rome is contained in
any standard history. Our interpretation of Roman economic institutions
follows Finlay (1999) and Bang (2008). Our account of Roman decline
follows Ward-Perkins (2006) and Goldsworthy (2009). On institutional
changes in the late Roman Empire, see Jones (1964). The anecdotes about
Tiberius and Hadrian are from Finley (1999). The evidence from
shipwrecks was first used by Hopkins (1980). See De Callataǿ (2005) and
Jongman (2007) for an overview of this and the Greenland Ice Core
Project. The Vindolanda tablets are available online at
vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/. The quote we use comes from TVII Pub. no.:
343. The discussion of the factors that led to the decline of Roman
Britain follows Cleary (1989), chap. 4; Faulkner (2000), chap. 7; Dark
(1994), chap. 2. On Aksum, see Munro-Hay (1991). The seminal work on
European feudalism and its origins is Bloch (1961); see Crummey (2000)
on Ethiopian feudalism. Phillipson (1998) makes the comparison between
the collapse of Aksum and the collapse of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 : THE TURNING POINT</p>
<p>The story of Lee’s machine and meeting with Queen Elizabeth I is
available at calverton.homestead.com/willlee.html. Allen (2009b)
presents the data on real wages using Diocletian’s Edict on Maximum
Prices. Our argument about the causes of the Industrial Revolution is
highly influenced by the arguments made in North and Thomas (1973),
North and Weingast (1989), Brenner (1993), Pincus (2009), and Pincus and
Robinson (2010). These scholars in turn were inspired by earlier Marxist
interpretations of British institutional change and the emergence of
capitalism; see Dobb</p>
<ol start="1963" type="1">
<li>and Hill (1961, 1980). See also Tawney’s (1941) thesis about how the
state building project of Henry VIII changed the English social
structure. The text of the Magna Carta is available online at the Avalon
Project, at avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/magframe.asp. Elton (1953) is
the seminal work on the development of state institutions under Henry
VIII, and Neale (1971) relates these to the evolution of parliament. On
the Peasants’ Revolt, see Hilton (2003). The quote from Hill on
monopolies is from Hill (1961), p. 25. On Charles I’s period of
“personal rule,” we follow Sharp (1992). Our evidence on how different
groups and regions sided either for or against Parliament comes from
Brunton and Pennington (1954), Hill (1961), and Stone (2001). Pincus
(2009) is fundamental on the Glorious Revolution and discusses many of
the specific changes in policies and economic institutions; for example,
the repeal of the Hearth Tax and the creation of the Bank of England.
See also Pincus and Robinson (2010). Pettigrew (2007, 2009) discusses
the attack on monopolies, including the Royal African Company, and our
data on petitioning comes from his papers. Knights (2010) emphasizes the
political importance of petitioning. Our information on Hoare’s Bank
comes from Temin and Voth (2008). Our information about Superviser
Cowperthwaite and the excise tax bureaucracy comes from Brewer (1988).
Our overview of the economic history of the Industrial Revolution rests
on Mantoux (1961), Daunton (1995), Allen (2009a), and Mokyr (1990,
2009), who provide details on the famous inventors and inventions we
discuss. The story about the Baldwyn family is from Bogart and
Richardson (2009, 2011), who stress the connection between the Glorious
Revolution, the reorganization of property rights, and the construction
of roads and canals. On the Calicoe Acts and Manchester Acts, see
O’Brien, Griffiths, and Hunt (1991), which is the source of the quotes
from the legislation. On the dominance of new people in industry, see
Daunton (1995), chap. 7, and Crouzet (1985). Our account of why the
major institutional changes first took place in England is based on
Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005a) and Brenner (1976). The data on
the number of independent merchants and their political preferences come
from Zahedieh (2010).</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAPTER 8 : NOT ON OUR TURF</p>
<p>On the opposition to the printing press in the Ottoman Empire, see
Savage-Smith (2003) pp. 656–59. Comparative historical literacy comes
from Easterlin (1981). Our discussion of political institutions of Spain
follows Thompson (1994a, 1994b). For evidence on the economic decline of
Spain over this period, see Nogal and Prados de la Escosura (2007). Our
discussion of the impediments to economic development in Austria-Hungary
follows Blum (1943), Freudenberger (1967), and Gross (1973). The
quotation from Maria Theresa comes from Freudenberger, p. 495. All other
quotations from Count Hartig and Francis I are from Blum. Francis’s
reply to the delegates from the Tyrol is quoted from Jászi (1929),
pp. 80–81. The comment of Friedrich von Gentz to Robert Owen is also
quoted from Jászi (1929), p. 80. The experience of the Rothschilds in
Austria is discussed in chap. 2 of Corti (1928). Our analysis of Russia
follows Gerschenkron (1970). The quotation from Kropotkin is from p. 60
of the 2009 edition of his book. The conversation between Nicholas and
Mikhail is quoted from Saunders (1992), p. 117. Kankrin’s quote on
railways is in Owen (1991), pp. 15–16. The speech by Nicholas to the
manufacturers is reproduced from Pintner 967), p. 100. The quote from A.
A. Zakrevskii is from Pintner (1967), p. 235. On Admiral Zheng, see
Dreyer (2007). The economic history of early Modern China is covered by
Myers and Wang (2002). The quote from T’ang Chen is quoted from Myers
and Wang, pp. 564–65. See Zewde (2002) for an overview of the relevant
Ethiopian history. The data on how extractive Ethiopia has been
historically come from Pankhurst (1961), as do all the quotes we
reproduce here. Our description of Somali institutions and history
follows Lewis (1961, 2002). The heer of the Hassan Ugaas is reproduced
on p.177 of Lewis (1961); our description of a feud comes from chap. 8
of Lewis (1961), where he reports many other examples. On the Kingdom of
Taqali and writing, see Ewald (1988).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 9 : REVERSING DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>Our discussion of the takeover of Ambon and Banda by the Dutch East
India Company and the company’s negative effect on the development of
Southeast Asia follows Hanna (1978) and particularly Reid (1993),
chap. 5. The quotes from Reid on Tomé Pires are from p. 271; the Dutch
factor in Maguindanao, p. 299; the sultan of Maguindanao, pp. 299–300.
Data on the impact of the Dutch East India Company on the price of
spices come from O’Rourke and Williamson (2002). A definitive overview
of slavery in African society and the impact of the slave trade is
Lovejoy (2000). Lovejoy, p. 47, Table 31, reports consensus estimates of
the extent of the slave trade. Nunn (2008) provided the first
quantitative estimates of the impact of the slave trade on African
economic institutions and economic growth. The data on firearms and
gunpowder imports are from Inikori (1977). The testimony of Francis
Moore is quoted from Lovejoy (2000), pp. 89–90. Law (1977) is a seminal
study of the expansion of the Oyo state. The estimates of the impact of
the slave trade on population in Africa are taken from Manning (1990).
Lovejoy (2000), chap. 8, the essays in Law (1995), and the important
book of Austin (2005) are the basis for our discussion of the analysis
of the period of “legitimate commerce.” Data on the proportion of
Africans who were slaves in Africa comes from Lovejoy (2000), e.g.,
p. 192, Table 9.2. Data on labor in Liberia is from Clower, Dalton,
Harwitz, and Walters (1966). The dual economy idea was developed by
Lewis (1954). Fergusson (2010) develops a mathematical model of the dual
economy. The notion that this was a creation of colonialism was first
proposed in the seminal collection of essays edited by Palmer and
Parsons (1977). Our account of South Africa is based on Bundy (1979) and
Feinstein (2005). The Moravian missionary is quoted in Bundy (1979),
p. 46, and John Hemming is quoted in Bundy, p. 72. The spread of land
ownership in Griqualand East is from Bundy, p. 89; the exploits of
Stephen Sonjica are from Bundy, p. 94; the quote from Matthew Blyth is
from p. 97; and the quote from a European observer in Fingoland 1884 is
from Bundy, pp. 100–101. George Albu is quoted in Feinstein (2005),
p. 63; secretary for native affairs is quoted from Feinstein, p. 45; and
Verwoerd is quoted from Feinstein, p. 159. Data on the real wages of
African gold miners are from p. 66 of Wilson (1972). G. Findlay is
quoted in Bundy (1979), p. 242. The notion that the development of the
rich countries of the West is the mirror image of the underdevelopment
of the rest of the world was originally developed by Wallertsein
(1974–2011), though he emphasizes very different mechanisms than we
do.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 : THE DIFFUSION OF PROSPERITY</p>
<p>This chapter builds heavily on our previous research with Simon
Johnson and Davide Cantoni: Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) and
Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (2010, 2011). Our discussion of
the development of early institutions in Australia follows the seminal
work of Hirst (1983, 1988, 2003) and Neal (1991). The original
manuscript of the writ issued to Judge Collins is available (thanks to
the Macquarie University Law School in Australia) at
www.law.mq.edu.au/scnsw/html/Cableper20vper20Sinclair,per201788.htm.
Macarthur’s characterization of Wentworth’s supporters is quoted from
Melbourne (1963), pp. 131–32. Our discussion of the origins of the
Rothschilds follows Ferguson (1998); Mayer Rothschild’s remark to his
son is reproduced from Ferguson, p. 76. Our discussion of the impact of
the French on European institutions is taken from Acemoglu, Cantoni,
Johnson, and Robinson (2010, 2011) and the references therein. See Doyle
(2002) for a standard overview of the French Revolution. Information on
the feudal dues in Nassau-Usingen is from Lenger (2004), p. 96. Ogilivie
(2011) overviews the historical impact of guilds on European
development. For a treatment of the life of (Ōkubo Toshimichi, see Iwata
(1964). Sakamoto Ryūma’s eight-point plan is reproduced from Jansen
(2000), p. 310.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 : THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE</p>
<p>Our discussion of the Black Act follows Thompson (1975). Baptist
Nunn’s report of June 27 is from Thompson (1975), pp. 65–66. The other
quotes are from Thompson’s section on the rule of law, pp. 258–69, which
is well worth reading in its entirety. Our approach to democratization
in England is based on Acemoglu and Robinson (2000a, 2001, and 2006a).
Earl Grey’s speech is quoted from Evans (1996), p. 223. Stephens’s
comment about democracy is quoted in Briggs (1959), p. 34. Thompson’s
quote is from Thompson (1975), p. 269. The entire text of the People’s
Charter can be found in Cole and Filson (1951) and at
web.bham.ac.uk/1848/document/peoplech.htm. The quote from Burke is taken
from Burke (1790/1969), p. 152. Lindert (2004, 2009) is a seminal
treatment of the coevolution of democracy and public policy over the
past two hundred years. Keyssar (2009) is a seminal introduction to the
evolution of political rights in the United States. Vanderbilt is quoted
in Josephson (1934), p. 15. The text of Roosevelt’s address is at
www.theodore-roosevelt.com/sotu1.html. The quote from Woodrow Wilson is
from Wilson (1913), p. 286. The text of President Roosevelt’s Fireside
Chat can be found at
miller-center.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3309. Data on the
relative tenure of Supreme Court justices in Argentina and the United
States is presented in Iaryczower, Spiller, and Tommasi (2002). Helmke
(2004) discusses the history of court packing in Argentina and quotes
Justice Carlos Fayt.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 12 : THE VICIOUS CIRCLE</p>
<p>This chapter heavily relies on our theoretical and empirical research
on institutional persistence, particularly Acemoglu, Johnson, and
Robinson (2005b) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2008a). Heath (1972) and
Kelley and Klein (1980) made a seminal application of the iron law of
oligarchy to the 1952 Bolivian Revolution. The quote from the British
parliamentary papers is reproduced from p. 15 of House of Commons
(1904). The early political history of postindependence Sierra Leone is
well told in Cartwright (1970). Though interpretations differ as to why
Siaka Stevens pulled up the railway line, the salient one is that he did
this to isolate Mendeland. In this we follow Abraham and Sesay (1993),
p. 120; Richards (1996), pp. 42–43; and Davies (2007), pp. 684–85. Reno
(1995, 2003) are the best treatments of Stevens’s regime. The data on
the agricultural marketing boards comes from Davies (2007). On the
murder of Sam Bangura by defenestration, see Reno (1995), pp. 137–41.
Jackson (2004), p. 63, and Keen (2005), p. 17, discuss the acronyms ISU
and SSD. Bates (1981) is the seminal analysis of how marketing boards
destroyed agricultural productivity in postindependence Africa, see
Goldstein and Udry (2009) on how political connections to chiefs
determine property rights to land in Ghana. On the relation between
politicians in 1993 and the conquistadors, see Dosal (1995), chap. 1,
and Casaús Arzú (2007). Our discussion of the policies of the Consulado
de Comercio follows Woodward (1966). The quote from President Barrios is
from McCreery (1994), pp. 187–88. Our discussion of the regime of Jorge
Ubico follows Grieb (1979). Our discussion of the underdevelopment of
the U.S. South follows Acemoglu and Robinson (2008b). See Wright (1978)
on the pre–Civil War development of the slave economy, and Bateman and
Weiss (1981) on the dearth of industry. Fogel and Engerman (1974) give a
different and controversial interpretation. Wright (1986) and Ransom and
Sutch (2001) give overviews of the extent to which the southern economy
after 1865 really changed. Congressman George Washington Julian is
quoted in Wiener (1978), p. 6. The same book contains the analysis of
the persistence of the southern landed elite after the Civil War. Naidu
(2009) examines the impact of the introduction of poll taxes and
literacy tests in the 1890s in southern states. The quotation from
W.E.B. Du Bois is in his book Du Bois (1903), p. 88. Clause 256 of the
Alabama constitution can be found at
www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/</p>
<p>1901/CA-245806.htm. Alston and Ferrie (1999) discuss how southern
politicians blocked federal legislation they thought would disrupt the
South’s economy. Woodward (1955) gives a seminal overview of the
creation of Jim Crow. Overviews of the Ethiopian revolution are provided
in Halliday and Molyneux (1981). On the Emperor’s cushions, see
Kapuściński (1983). The quotes from Dawit Wolde Giorgis are from Dawit
Wolde Giorgis (1989), pp. 49 and 48, respectively.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 13 : WHY NATIONS FAIL TODAY</p>
<p>For the BBC report on Mugabe’s lottery success, including the public
statement of Zimbank, see news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/621895.stm. Our
treatment of the creation of white rule in Rhodesia follows Palmer
(1977) and Alexander (2006). Meredith (2007) provides a good overview of
more recent Zimbabwean politics. Our account of the civil war in Sierra
Leone follows Richards (1996), Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(2004), and Keen (2005). The analysis published in a newspaper in the
capital city of Freetown in 1995 is quoted from Keen (2005), p. 34. The
text of the RUF’s “Footpaths to Democracy” can we found at
www.sierra-leone.org/AFRC-RUF/footpaths.html. The quotation from the
teenager from Geoma is from Keen (2005), p. 42. Our discussion of the
Colombian paramilitaries follows Acemoglu, Robinson, and Santos (2010)
and Chaves and Robinson (2010), which in turn heavily rely on the
extensive work by Colombian scholars, particularly Romero (2003), the
essays in Romero (2007), and López (2010). León (2009) is an accessible
and balanced account of the nature of contemporary conflicts in
Colombia. Also fundamental is the Web site run by the weekly newspaper
Semana, www.verdadabierta.com/. All the quotes come from Acemoglu,
Robinson, and Santos (2010). The contract between Martín Llanos and the
mayors in Casanare is available in Spanish at
www.verdadabierta.com/victimarios/los-jefes/714-perfil-hector-german-buitrago-alias-martin-llanos.
The origins and consequences of El Corralito are well presented in a
series of articles in The Economist magazine, available at
www.economist.com/search/apachesolr_search/corralito. On the role of the
interior in Argentine development, see Sawers (1996). Hassig and Oh
(2009) provides an excellent, valuable account of life in North Korea.
Chap. 2 covers the luxurious lifestyle of the leadership, and chaps. 3
and 4, the economic realities that most people face. The BBC coverage of
the currency reform can be found at news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8500017.stm. On
the pleasure palace and brandy consumption, see chap. 12 of Post (2004).
Our discussion of child labor and its use for picking cotton in
Uzbeksitan follows Kandiyoti (2008), available at

recording. On James Meredith and Oxford, Mississippi, see Doyle (2001).
See Wright (1999) on the impact of civil rights legislation on black
voting in the South. On the nature and politics of China’s political
transition after the death of Mao, see Harding (1987) and MacFarquhar

Jiabao’s comments on political reforms in China, see
www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/29/wen-jiabao-china-reform. The
modernization hypothesis is clearly articulated in Lipset (1959). The
evidence against it is discussed in detail in Acemoglu, Johnson,
Robinson, and Yared (2008, 2009). George H. W. Bush’s quote is from
news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/752224.stm. Our discussion of NGO activity
