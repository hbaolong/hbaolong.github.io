<h4 id="the-virtuous-circle">11. THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE</h4>
<p>THE BLACK ACT</p>
<p>WINDSOR CASTLE, located just west of London, is one of the great
royal residencies of England. In the early eighteenth century, the
castle was surrounded by a great forest, full of deer, though little of
this remains today. One of the keepers of the forest in 1722, Baptist
Nunn, was locked in to a violent conflict. On June 27 he recorded,</p>
<p>Blacks came in the night shot at me 3 times 2 bullets into my chamber
window and 〔I〕 agreed to pay them 5 guineas at Crowthorne on the
30th.</p>
<p>Another entry in Nunn’s diary read, “A fresh surprise. One appeared
disguised with a message of destruction.”</p>
<p>Who were these mysterious “Blacks” making threats, shooting at Nunn,
and demanding money? The Blacks were groups of local men who had their
faces “blacked” to conceal their appearance at night. They appeared
widely across southern England in this period, killing and maiming deer
and other animals, burning down haystacks and barns, and destroying
fences and fish ponds. On the surface it was sheer lawlessness, but it
wasn’t. Illegal hunting (poaching) deer in lands owned by the king or
other members of the aristocracy had been going on for a long time. In
the 1640s, during the Civil War, the entire population of deer at
Windsor Castle was killed. After the Restoration in 1660, when Charles
II came to the throne, the deer park was restocked. But the Blacks were
not just poaching deer to eat; they also engaged in wanton destruction.
To what end?</p>
<p>A crucial building block of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was the
pluralistic nature of interests represented in Parliament. None of the
merchants, industrialists, gentry, or aristocracy allied with William of
Orange and then with the Hanoverian monarchs, who succeeded Queen Anne
in 1714, were strong enough to impose their will unilaterally. Attempts
at restoring the Stuart monarchy continued throughout much of the
eighteenth century. After James II’s death in 1701, his son, James
Francis Edward Stuart, the “Old Pretender,” was recognized as the lawful
heir to the English Crown by France, Spain, the pope, and supporters of
the Stuart monarchy in England and Scotland, the so-called Jacobites. In
1708 the Old Pretender attempted to take back the throne with support of
French troops, but was unsuccessful. In the ensuing decades there would
be several Jacobite revolts, including major ones in 1715 and 1719. In
1745–46, the Old Pretender’s son, Charles Edward Stuart, the “Young
Pretender,” made an attempt to take back the throne, but his forces were
defeated by the British army. The Whig political party, which as we saw
(this page–this page) was founded in the 1670s to represent the new
mercantile and economic interests, was the main organization behind the
Glorious Revolution, and the Whigs dominated Parliament from 1714 to
1760. Once in power, they were tempted to use their newly found position
to prey on the rights of others, to have their cake and eat it, too.
They were no different from the Stuart kings, but their power was far
from absolute. It was constrained both by competing groups in
Parliament, particularly the Tory Party which had formed to oppose the
Whigs, and by the very institutions that they had fought to introduce to
strengthen Parliament and to prevent the emergence of a new absolutism
and the return of the Stuarts. The pluralistic nature of society that
emerged from the Glorious Revolution also meant that the population at
large, even those without formal representation in Parliament, had been
empowered, and “blacking” was precisely a response by the common people
to perceptions that the Whigs were exploiting their position. The case
of William Cadogan, a successful general in the War of the Spanish
Succession between 1701 and 1714 and in the suppression of the Jacobite
revolts, illustrates the sort of encroachment of common people’s rights
by the Whigs that led to blacking. George I made Cadogan a baron in 1716
and then an earl in 1718. He was also an influential member of the
Regency Council of Lords Justices, which presided over major affairs of
state, and he served as the acting commander in chief. He bought a large
property of about a thousand acres at Caversham, about twenty miles west
of Windsor. There he built a grand house and ornate gardens and laid out
a 240-acre deer park. Yet this property was consolidated by encroaching
on the rights of those around the estate. People were evicted, and their
traditional rights to graze animals and collect peat and firewood were
abrogated. Cadogan faced the wrath of the Blacks. On January 1, 1722,
and again in July, the park was raided by mounted and armed Blacks. The
first attack killed sixteen deer. Earl Cadogan was not alone. The
estates of many notable landowners and politicians were also raided by
the Blacks. The Whig government was not going to take this lying down.
In May 1723, Parliament passed the Black Act, which created an
extraordinary fifty new offenses that were punishable by hanging. The
Black Act made it a crime not only to carry weapons but to have a
blackened face. The law in fact was soon amended to make blacking
punishable by hanging. The Whig elites went about implementing the law
with gusto. Baptist Nunn set up a network of informers in Windsor Forest
to discover the identity of the Blacks. Soon several were arrested. The
transition from arrest to hanging ought to have been a straightforward
affair. After all, the Black Act had already been enacted, the Whigs
were in charge of Parliament, Parliament was in charge of the country,
and the Blacks were acting directly contrary to the interests of some
powerful Whigs. Even Sir Robert Walpole, secretary of state, then prime
minister—and like Cadogan, another influential member of the Regency
Council of the Lords Justices—was involved. He had a vested interest in
Richmond Park in southwest London, which had been created out of common
land by Charles I. This park also encroached upon the traditional rights
of local residents to graze their animals, hunt hares and rabbits, and
collect firewood. But the ending of these rights appears to have been
rather laxly enforced, and grazing and hunting continued, until Walpole
arranged for his son to become the park ranger. At this time, the park
was closed off, a new wall was constructed, and man traps were
installed. Walpole liked hunting deer, and he had a lodge built for
himself at Houghton, within the park. The animosity of local Blacks was
soon ignited. On November 10, 1724, a local resident outside the park,
John Huntridge, was accused of aiding deer stealers and abetting known
Blacks, both crimes punishable by hanging. The prosecution of Huntridge
came right from the top, initiated by the Regency Council of Lords
Justices, which Walpole and Cadogan dominated. Walpole went so far as to
extract evidence himself as to Huntridge’s guilt from an informant,
Richard Blackburn. Conviction ought to have been a foregone conclusion,
but it wasn’t. After a trial of eight or nine hours, the jury found
Huntridge innocent, partly on procedural grounds, since there were
irregularities with the way the evidence had been collected. Not all
Blacks or those who sympathized with them were as lucky as Huntridge.
Though some others were also acquitted or had their convictions
commuted, many were hanged or transported to the penal colony of choice
at the time, North America; the law in fact stayed on the statute books
until it was repealed in 1824. Yet Huntridge’s victory is remarkable.
The jury was made up not of Huntridge’s peers, but of major landowners
and gentry, who ought to have sympathized with Walpole. But this was no
longer the seventeenth century, where the Court of Star Chamber would
simply follow the wishes of Stuart monarchs and act as an open tool of
repression against their opponents, and where kings could remove judges
whose decisions they did not like. Now the Whigs also had to abide by
the rule of law, the principle that laws should not be applied
selectively or arbitrarily and that nobody is above the law.</p>
<p>THE EVENTS SURROUNDING the Black Act would show that the Glorious
Revolution had created the rule of law, and that this notion was
stronger in England and Britain, and the elites were far more
constrained by it than they themselves imagined. Notably, the rule of
law is not the same as rule by law. Even if the Whigs could pass a
harsh, repressive law to quash obstacles from common people, they had to
contend with additional constraints because of the rule of law. Their
law violated the rights that the Glorious Revolution and the changes in
political institutions that followed from it had already established for
everybody by tearing down the “divine” rights of kings and the
privileges of elites. The rule of law then implied that both elites and
nonelites alike would resist its implementation. The rule of law is a
very strange concept when you think about it in historical perspective.
Why should laws be applied equally to all? If the king and the
aristocracy have political power and the rest don’t, it’s only natural
that whatever is fair game for the king and the aristocracy should be
banned and punishable for the rest. Indeed, the rule of law is not
imaginable under absolutist political institutions. It is a creation of
pluralist political institutions and of the broad coalitions that
support such pluralism. It’s only when many individuals and groups have
a say in decisions, and the political power to have a seat at the table,
that the idea that they should all be treated fairly starts making
sense. By the early eighteenth century, Britain was becoming
sufficiently pluralistic, and the Whig elites would discover that, as
enshrined in the notion of the rule of law, laws and institutions would
constrain them, too. But why did the Whigs and parliamentarians abide by
such restraints? Why didn’t they use their control over Parliament and
the state to force an uncompromising implementation of the Black Act and
overturn the courts when the decisions didn’t go their way? The answer
reveals much about the nature of the Glorious Revolution—why it didn’t
just replace an old absolutism with a new version—the link between
pluralism and the rule of law, and the dynamics of virtuous circles. As
we saw in chapter 7, the Glorious Revolution was not the overthrow of
one elite by another, but a revolution against absolutism by a broad
coalition made up of the gentry, merchants, and manufacturers as well as
groupings of Whigs and Tories. The emergence of pluralist political
institutions was a consequence of this revolution. The rule of law also
emerged as a by-product of this process. With many parties at the table
sharing power, it was natural to have laws and constraints apply to all
of them, lest one party start amassing too much power and ultimately
undermine the very foundations of pluralism. Thus the notion that there
were limits and restraints on rulers, the essence of the rule of law,
was part of the logic of pluralism engendered by the broad coalition
that made up the opposition to Stuart absolutism. In this light, it
should be no surprise that the principle of the rule of law, coupled
with the notion that monarchs did not have divine rights, was in fact a
key argument against Stuart absolutism. As the British historian E. P.
Thompson put it, in the struggle against the Stuart monarchs:</p>
<p>immense efforts were made … to project the image of a ruling class
which was itself subject to the rule of law, and whose legitimacy rested
upon the equity and universality of those legal forms. And the rulers
were, in serious senses, whether willingly or unwillingly, the prisoners
of their own rhetoric; they played games of power according to rules
which suited them, but they could not break those rules or the whole
game would be thrown away.</p>
<p>Throwing the game away would destabilize the system and open the way
for absolutism by a subset of the broad coalition or even risk the
return of the Stuarts. In Thompson’s words, what inhibited Parliament
from creating a new absolutism was that</p>
<p>take away law, and the royal prerogative … might flood back upon
their properties and lives.</p>
<p>Moreover,</p>
<p>it was inherent in the very nature of the medium which they 〔those
aristocrats, merchants etc. fighting the Crown〕 had selected for their
own self-defense that it could not be reserved for the exclusive use
only of their own class. The law, in its forms and traditions, entailed
principles of equity and universality which … had to be extended to all
sorts and degrees of men.</p>
<p>Once in place, the notion of the rule of law not only kept absolutism
at bay but also created a type of virtuous circle: if the laws applied
equally to everybody, then no individual or group, not even Cadogan or
Walpole, could rise above the law, and common people accused of
encroaching on private property still had the right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>WE SAW HOW INCLUSIVE economic and political institutions emerge. But
why do they persist over time? The history of the Black Act and the
limits to its implementation illustrate the virtuous circle, a powerful
process of positive feedback that preserves these institutions in the
face of attempts at undermining them and, in fact, sets in motion forces
that lead to greater inclusiveness. The logic of virtuous circles stems
partly from the fact that inclusive institutions are based on
constraints on the exercise of power and on a pluralistic distribution
of political power in society, enshrined in the rule of law. The ability
of a subset to impose its will on others without any constraints, even
if those others are ordinary citizens, as Huntridge was, threatens this
very balance. If it were temporarily suspended in the case of the
peasants protesting against elites encroaching on their communal lands,
what was there to guarantee that it would not be suspended again? And
the next time it was suspended, what would prevent the Crown and
aristocracy from taking back what the merchants, businessmen, and the
gentry had gained in the intervening half century? In fact, the next
time it was suspended, perhaps the entire project of pluralism would
come crumbling down, because a narrow set of interests would take
control at the expense of the broad coalition. The political system
would not risk this. But this made pluralism, and the rule of law that
it implied, persistent features of British political institutions. And
we will see that once pluralism and the rule of law were established,
there would be demand for even greater pluralism and greater
participation in the political process. The virtuous circle arises not
only from the inherent logic of pluralism and the rule of law, but also
because inclusive political institutions tend to support inclusive
economic institutions. This then leads to a more equal distribution of
income, empowering a broad segment of society and making the political
playing field even more level. This limits what one can achieve by
usurping political power and reduces the incentives to re-create
extractive political institutions. These factors were important in the
emergence of truly democratic political institutions in Britain.
Pluralism also creates a more open system and allows independent media
to flourish, making it easier for groups that have an interest in the
continuation of inclusive institutions to become aware and organize
against threats to these institutions. It is highly significant that the
English state stopped censoring the media after 1688. The media played a
similarly important role in empowering the population at large and in
the continuation of the virtuous circle of institutional development in
the United States, as we will see in this chapter. While the virtuous
circle creates a tendency for inclusive institutions to persist, it is
neither inevitable nor irreversible. Both in Britain and the United
States, inclusive economic and political institutions were subject to
many challenges. In 1745 the Young Pretender got all the way to Derby, a
mere hundred miles from London, with an army to unseat the political
institutions forged during the Glorious Revolution. But he was defeated.
More important than the challenges from without were potential
challenges from within that might also have led to the unraveling of
inclusive institutions. As we saw in the context of the Peterloo
Massacre in Manchester in 1819 (this page), and as we will see in more
detail next, British political elites thought of using repression to
avoid having to further open the political system, but they pulled back
from the brink. Similarly, inclusive economic and political institutions
in the United States faced serious challenges, which could have
conceivably succeeded, but didn’t. And of course it was not preordained
that these challenges should be defeated. It is due to not only the
virtuous circle but also to the realization of the contingent path of
history that British and U.S. inclusive institutions survived and became
substantially stronger over time.</p>
<p>THE SLOW MARCH OF DEMOCRACY</p>
<p>The response to the Black Act showed ordinary British people that
they had more rights than they previously realized. They could defend
their traditional rights and economic interests in the courts and in
Parliament through the use of petitions and lobbying. But this pluralism
had not yet delivered effective democracy. Most adult men could not
vote; neither could women; and there were many inequities in the
existing democratic structures. All this was to change. The virtuous
circle of inclusive institutions not only preserves what has already
been achieved but also opens the door to greater inclusiveness. The odds
were against the British elite of the eighteenth century maintaining
their grip on political power without serious challenges. This elite had
come to power by challenging the divine right of kings and opening the
door to participation by the people in politics, but then they gave this
right only to a small minority. It was only a matter of time until more
and more of the population demanded the right to participate in the
political process. And in the years leading up to 1831, they did. The
first three decades of the nineteenth century witnessed increasing
social unrest in Britain, mostly in response to increasing economic
inequities and demands from the disenfranchised masses for greater
political representation. The Luddite Riots of 1811–1816, where workers
fought against the introduction of new technologies they believed would
reduce their wages, were followed by riots explicitly demanding
political rights, the Spa Fields Riots of 1816 in London and the
Peterloo Massacre of 1819 in Manchester. In the Swing Riots of 1830,
agricultural workers protested against falling living standards as well
as the introduction of new technology. Meanwhile, in Paris, the July
Revolution of 1830 exploded. A consensus among elites was starting to
form that the discontent was reaching the boiling point, and the only
way to defuse social unrest, and turn back a revolution, was by meeting
the demands of the masses and undertaking parliamentary reform. It was
no surprise then that the 1831 election was mostly about a single issue:
political reform. The Whigs, almost one hundred years after Sir Robert
Walpole, were much more responsive to the wishes of the common man and
campaigned to extend voting rights. But this meant only a small increase
in the electorate. Universal suffrage, even only for men, was not on the
table. The Whigs won the election, and their leader, Earl Grey, became
the prime minister. Earl Grey was no radical—far from it. He and the
Whigs pushed for reform not because they thought a broader voting
franchise was more just or because they wanted to share power. British
democracy was not given by the elite. It was largely taken by the
masses, who were empowered by the political processes that had been
ongoing in England and the rest of Britain for the last several
centuries. They had become emboldened by the changes in the nature of
political institutions unleashed by the Glorious Revolution. Reforms
were granted because the elite thought that reform was the only way to
secure the continuation of their rule, albeit in a somewhat lessened
form. Earl Grey, in his famous speech to Parliament in favor of
political reform, said this very clearly:</p>
<p>There is no-one more decided against annual Parliaments, universal
suffrage and the ballot, than I am. My object is not to favour, but to
put an end to such hopes and projects … The principle of my reform is,
to prevent the necessity of revolution … reforming to preserve and not
to overthrow.</p>
<p>The masses did not just want the vote for its own sake but to have a
seat at the table to be able to defend their interests. This was well
understood by the Chartist movement, which led the campaign for
universal suffrage after 1838, taking its name from its adoption of the
People’s Charter, named to evoke a parallel with the Magna Carta.
Chartist J. R. Stephens articulated why universal suffrage, and the vote
for all citizens, was key for the masses:</p>
<p>The question of universal suffrage … is a knife and fork question, a
bread and cheese question … by universal suffrage I mean to say that
every working man in the land has a right to a good coat on his back, a
good hat on his head, a good roof for the shelter of his household, a
good dinner upon his table.</p>
<p>Stephens had well understood that universal suffrage was the most
durable way of empowering the British masses further and guaranteeing a
coat, a hat, a roof, and a good dinner for the working man. Ultimately,
Earl Grey was successful both in ensuring the passage of the First
Reform Act and in defusing the revolutionary tides without taking any
major strides toward universal mass suffrage. The 1832 reforms were
modest, only doubling the voting franchise from 8 percent to about 16
percent of the adult male population (from about 2 to 4 percent of all
the population). They also got rid of rotten boroughs and gave
independent representation to the new industrializing cities such as
Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield. But this still left many issues
unresolved. Hence there were soon further demands for greater voting
rights and further social unrest. In response, further reform would
follow. Why did the British elites give in to the demands? Why did Earl
Grey feel that partial—indeed, very partial—reform was the only way to
preserve the system? Why did they have to put up with the lesser of the
two evils, reform or revolution, rather than maintaining their power
without any reform? Couldn’t they just have done what the Spanish
conquistadors did in South America, what Austria-Hungarian and Russian
monarchs would do in the next several decades when the demands for
reform reached those lands, and what the British themselves did in the
Caribbean and in India: use force to put down the demands? The answer to
this question comes from the virtuous circle. The economic and political
changes that had already taken place in Britain made using force to
repress these demands both unattractive for the elite and increasingly
infeasible. As E. P. Thompson wrote:</p>
<p>When the struggles of 1790–1832 signalled that this equilibrium had
changed, the rulers of England were faced with alarming alternatives.
They could either dispense with the rule of law, dismantle their
elaborate constitutional structures, countermand their own rhetoric and
rule by force; or they could submit to their own rules and surrender
their hegemony … they took halting steps in the first direction. But in
the end, rather than shatter their own self-image and repudiate 150
years of constitutional legality, they surrendered to the law.</p>
<p>Put differently, the same forces that made the British elite not wish
to tear down the edifice of the rule of law during the Black Act also
made them shun repression and rule by force, which would again risk the
stability of the entire system. If undermining the law in trying to
implement the Black Act would have weakened the system that merchants,
businessmen, and the gentry had built in the Glorious Revolution,
setting up a repressive dictatorship in 1832 would have entirely
undermined it. In fact, the organizers of the protests for parliamentary
reform were well aware of the importance of the rule of law and its
symbolism to the British political institutions during this period. They
used its rhetoric to bring home this point. One of the first
organizations seeking parliamentary reform was called the Hampden Club,
after the member of Parliament who had first resisted Charles I over the
ship money tax, a crucial event leading up to the first major uprising
against Stuart absolutism, as we saw in chapter 7. There was also
dynamic positive feedback between inclusive economic and political
institutions making such a course of action attractive. Inclusive
economic institutions led to the development of inclusive markets,
inducing a more efficient allocation of resources, greater encouragement
to acquire education and skills, and further innovations in technology.
All of these forces were in play in Britain by 1831. Clamping down on
popular demands and undertaking a coup against inclusive political
institutions would also destroy these gains, and the elites opposing
greater democratization and greater inclusiveness might find themselves
among those losing their fortunes from this destruction. Another aspect
of this positive feedback is that under inclusive economic and political
institutions, controlling power became less central. In Austria-Hungary
and in Russia, as we saw in chapter 8, the monarchs and the aristocracy
had much to lose from industrialization and reform. In contrast, in
Britain at the beginning of the nineteenth century, thanks to the
development of inclusive economic institutions, there was much less at
stake: there were no serfs, relatively little coercion in the labor
market, and few monopolies protected by entry barriers. Clinging to
power was thus much less valuable for the British elite. The logic of
the virtuous circle also meant that such repressive steps would be
increasingly infeasible, again because of the positive feedback between
inclusive economic and political institutions. Inclusive economic
institutions lead to a more equitable distribution of resources than
extractive institutions. As such, they empower the citizens at large and
thus create a more level playing field, even when it comes to the fight
for power. This makes it more difficult for a small elite to crush the
masses rather than to give in to their demands, or at least to some of
them. The British inclusive institutions had also already unleashed the
Industrial Revolution, and Britain was highly urbanized. Using
repression against an urban, concentrated, and partially organized and
empowered group of people would have been much harder than repressing a
peasantry or dependent serfs. The virtuous circle thus brought the First
Reform Act to Britain in 1832. But this was just the beginning. There
was still a long road to travel toward real democracy, because in 1832
the elite had only offered what they thought they had to and no more.
The issue of parliamentary reform was taken up by the Chartist movement,
whose People’s Charter of 1838 included the clauses</p>
<p>A vote for every man twenty-one years of age, of sound mind, and not
undergoing punishment for crime. The ballot.—To protect the elector in
the exercise of his vote. No property qualification for members of
Parliament—thus enabling the constituencies to return the man of their
choice, be he rich or poor. Payment of members, thus enabling an honest
tradesman, working man, or other person, to serve a constituency, when
taken from his business to attend to the interests of the Country. Equal
Constituencies, securing the same amount of representation for the same
number of electors, instead of allowing small constituencies to swamp
the votes of large ones. Annual Parliaments, thus presenting the most
effectual check to bribery and intimidation, since though a constituency
might be bought once in seven years (even with the ballot), no purse
could buy a constituency (under a system of universal suffrage) in each
ensuing twelve-month; and since members, when elected for a year only,
would not be able to defy and betray their constituents as now. By the
“ballot,” they meant the secret ballot and the end of open voting, which
had facilitated the buying of votes and the coercion of voters. The
Chartist movement organized a series of mass demonstrations, and
throughout this period Parliament continually discussed the potential
for further reforms. Though the Chartists disintegrated after 1848, they
were followed by the National Reform Union, founded in 1864, and the
Reform League, which was founded in 1865. In July 1866, major pro-reform
riots in Hyde Park brought reform right to the top of the political
agenda once more. This pressure bore dividends in the form of the Second
Reform Act of 1867, in which the total electorate was doubled and
working-class voters became the majority in all urban constituencies.
Shortly afterward the secret ballot was introduced and moves were made
to eliminate corrupt electoral practices such as “treating” (essentially
buying votes in exchange for which the voter received a treat, usually
money, food, or alcohol). The electorate was doubled again by the Third
Reform Act of 1884, when 60 percent of adult males were enfranchised.
Following the First World War, the Representation of the People Act of
1918 gave the vote to all adult males over the age of twenty-one, and to
women over the age of thirty who were taxpayers or married to taxpayers.
Ultimately, all women also received the vote on the same terms as men in
1928. The measures of 1918 were negotiated during the war and reflected
a quid pro quo between the government and the working classes, who were
needed to fight and produce munitions. The government may also have
taken note of the radicalism of the Russian Revolution. Parallel with
the gradual development of more inclusive political institutions was a
movement toward even more inclusive economic institutions. One major
consequence of the First Reform Act was the repeal of the Corn Laws in
1846. As we saw in chapter 7, the Corn Laws banned the import of grains
and cereals, keeping their prices high and ensuring lucrative profits
for large landowners. The new parliamentarians from Manchester and
Birmingham wanted cheap corn and low wages. They won, and the landed
interests suffered a major defeat. The changes in the electorate and
other dimensions of political institutions taking place during the
course of the nineteenth century were followed by further reforms. In
1871 the Liberal prime minister Gladstone opened up the civil service to
public examination, making it meritocratic, and thus continuing the
process of political centralization and the building of state
institutions that started during the Tudor period. Liberal and Tory
governments during this period introduced a considerable amount of labor
market legislation. For example, the Masters and Servants Acts, which
allowed employers to use the law to reduce the mobility of their
workers, was repealed, changing the nature of labor relations in favor
of workers. During 1906–1914, the Liberal Party, under the leadership of
H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George, began to use the state to provide
far more public services, including health and unemployment insurance,
government-financed pensions, minimum wages, and a commitment to
redistributive taxation. As a result of these fiscal changes, taxes as a
proportion of national product more than doubled in the last three
decades of the nineteenth century, and then doubled again in the first
three decades of the twentieth. The tax system also became more
“progressive,” so that wealthier people bore a heavier burden.
Meanwhile, the education system, which was previously either primarily
for the elite, run by religious denominations, or required poor people
to pay fees, was made more accessible to the masses; the Education Act
of 1870 committed the government to the systematic provision of
universal education for the first time. Education became free of charge
in 1891. The school-leaving age was set at eleven in 1893. In 1899 it
was increased to twelve, and special provisions for the children of
needy families were introduced. As a result of these changes, the
proportion of ten-year-olds enrolled in school, which stood at a
disappointing 40 percent in 1870, increased to 100 percent in 1900.
Finally, the Education Act of 1902 led to a large expansion in resources
for schools and introduced the grammar schools, which subsequently
became the foundation of secondary education in Britain. In fact, the
British example, an illustration of the virtuous circle of inclusive
institutions, provides an example of a “gradual virtuous circle.” The
political changes were unmistakably toward more inclusive political
institutions and were the result of demands from empowered masses. But
they were also gradual. Every decade another step, sometimes smaller,
sometimes larger, was taken toward democracy. There was conflict over
each step, and the outcome of each was contingent. But the virtuous
circle created forces that reduced the stakes involved in clinging to
power. It also spurred the rule of law, making it harder to use force
against those who were demanding what these elites had themselves
demanded from Stuart monarchs. It became less likely that this conflict
would turn into an all-out revolution and more likely that it would be
resolved in favor of greater inclusiveness. There is great virtue in
this sort of gradual change. It is less threatening to the elite than
the wholesale overthrow of the system. Each step is small, and it makes
sense to give in to a small demand rather than create a major showdown.
This partly explains how the Corn Law was repealed without more serious
conflict. By 1846 landowners could no longer control legislation in
Parliament. This was an outcome of the First Reform Act. However, if in
1832 the expansion of the electorate, the reform of the rotten boroughs,
and the repeal of the Corn Laws had all been on the table, landowners
would have put up much more resistance. The fact that there were first
limited political reforms and that repeal of the Corn Laws came on the
agenda only later defused conflict. Gradual change also prevented
ventures into uncharted territories. A violent overthrow of the system
means that something entirely new has to be built in place of what has
been removed. This was the case with the French Revolution, when the
first experiment with democracy led to the Terror and then back to a
monarchy twice before finally leading to the French Third Republic in
1870. It was the case in the Russian Revolution, where the desires of
many for a more equal system than that of the Russian Empire led to a
one-party dictatorship that was much more violent, bloody, and vicious
than what it had replaced. Gradual reform was difficult in these
societies precisely because they lacked pluralism and were highly
extractive. It was the pluralism emerging from the Glorious Revolution,
and the rule of law that it introduced, that made gradual change
feasible, and desirable, in Britain. The conservative English
commentator Edmund Burke, who steadfastly opposed the French Revolution,
wrote in 1790, “It is with infinite caution that any man should venture
upon pulling down an edifice, which has answered in any tolerable degree
for ages the common purposes of society, or on building it up again
without having models and patterns of approved utility before his eyes.”
Burke was wrong on the big picture. The French Revolution had replaced a
rotten edifice and opened the way for inclusive institutions not only in
France, but throughout much of Western Europe. But Burke’s caution was
not entirely off the mark. The gradual process of British political
reform, which had started in 1688 and would pick up pace three decades
after Burke’s death, would be more effective because its gradual nature
made it more powerful, harder to resist, and ultimately more
durable.</p>
<p>BUSTING TRUSTS</p>
<p>Inclusive institutions in the United States had their roots in the
struggles in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas during the colonial
period (this page–this page). These institutions were reinforced by the
Constitution of the United States, with its system of constraints and
its separation of powers. But the Constitution did not mark the end of
the development of inclusive institutions. Just as in Britain, these
were strengthened by a process of positive feedback, based on the
virtuous circle. By the middle of the nineteenth century, all white
males, though not women or blacks, could vote in the United States.
Economic institutions became more inclusive—for example, with the
passage of the Homestead Act in 1862 (this page), which made frontier
land available to potential settlers rather than allocating these lands
to political elites. But just as in Britain, challenges to inclusive
institutions were never entirely absent. The end of the U.S. Civil War
initiated a rapid spurt of economic growth in the North. As railways,
industry, and commerce expanded, a few people made vast fortunes.
Emboldened by their economic success, these men and their companies
became increasingly unscrupulous. They were called the Robber Barons
because of their hard-nosed business practices aimed at consolidating
monopolies and preventing any potential competitor from entering the
market or doing business on an equal footing. One of the most notorious
of these was Cornelius Vanderbilt, who famously remarked, “What do I
care about the Law? Hain’t I got the power?”</p>
<p>Another was John D. Rockefeller, who started the Standard Oil Company
in 1870. He quickly eliminated rivals in Cleveland and attempted to
monopolize the transportation and retailing of oil and oil products. By
1882 he had created a massive monopoly—in the language of the day, a
trust. By 1890 Standard Oil controlled 88 percent of the refined oil
flows in the United States, and Rockefeller became the world’s first
billionaire in 1916. Contemporary cartoons depict Standard Oil as an
octopus wrapping itself around not just the oil industry but also
Capitol Hill. Almost as infamous was John Pierpont Morgan, the founder
of the modern banking conglomerate J.P. Morgan, which later, after many
mergers over decades, eventually became JPMorgan Chase. Along with
Andrew Carnegie, Morgan founded the U.S. Steel Company in 1901, the
first corporation with a capitalized value of more than billion and by
far the largest steel corporation in the world. In the 1890s, large
trusts began to emerge in nearly every sector of the economy, and many
of them controlled more than 70 percent of the market in their sector.
These included several household names, such as Du Pont, Eastman Kodak,
and International Harvester. Historically the United States, at least
the northern and midwestern United States, had relatively competitive
markets and had been more egalitarian than other parts of the country,
particularly the South. But during this period, competition gave way to
monopoly, and wealth inequality rapidly increased. The pluralistic U.S.
political system already empowered a broad segment of society that could
stand up against such encroachments. Those who were the victims of the
monopolistic practices of the Robber Barons, or who objected to their
unscrupulous domination of their industries, began to organize against
them. They formed the Populist and then subsequently the Progressive
movements. The Populist movement emerged out of a long-running agrarian
crisis, which afflicted the Midwest from the late 1860s onward. The
National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, known as the
Grangers, was founded in 1867 and began to mobilize farmers against
unfair and discriminatory business practices. In 1873 and 1874, the
Grangers won control of eleven midwestern state legislatures, and rural
discontent culminated in the formation of the People’s Party in 1892,
which got 8.5 percent of the popular vote in the 1892 presidential
election. In the next two elections, the Populists fell in behind the
two unsuccessful Democratic campaigns by William Jennings Bryan, who
made many of their issues his own. Grass-roots opposition to the spread
of the trusts had now organized to try to counteract the influence that
Rockefeller and other Robber Barons were exerting over national
politics. These political movements slowly began to have an impact on
political attitudes and then on legislation, particularly concerning the
role of the state in the regulation of monopoly. The first important
piece of legislation was the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which
created the Interstate Commerce Commission and initiated the development
of the federal regulation of industry. This was quickly followed by the
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The Sherman Act, which is still a major
part of U.S. antitrust regulation, would become the basis for attacks on
the Robber Barons’ trusts. Major action against the trusts came after
the election of presidents committed to reform and to limiting the power
of the Robber Barons: Theodore Roosevelt, 1901–1909; William Taft,
1909–1913; and Woodrow Wilson, 1913–1921. A key political force behind
antitrust and the move to impose federal regulation of industry was
again the farm vote. Early attempts by individual states in the 1870s to
regulate railroads came from farmers’ organizations. Indeed, nearly all
the fifty-nine petitions that concerned trusts sent to Congress prior to
the enactment of the Sherman Act came from farming states and emanated
from organizations such as the Farmers’ Union, Farmers’ Alliance,
Farmers’ Mutual Benefit Association, and Patrons of Animal Husbandry.
Farmers found a collective interest in opposing the monopolistic
practices of industry. From the ashes of the Populists, who seriously
declined after throwing their weight behind the Democrats, came the
Progressives, a heterogeneous reform movement concerned with many of the
same issues. The Progressive movement initially gelled around the figure
of Teddy Roosevelt, who was William McKinley’s vice president and who
assumed the presidency following McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Prior
to his rise to national office, Roosevelt had been an uncompromising
governor of New York and had worked hard to eliminate political
corruption and “machine politics.” In his first address to Congress,
Roosevelt turned his attention to the trusts. He argued that the
prosperity of the United States was based on market economy and the
ingenuity of businessmen, but at the same time,</p>
<p>there are real and grave evils … and a … widespread conviction in the
minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts
are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general
welfare. This springs from no spirit of envy or un-charitableness, nor
lack of pride in the great industrial achievements that have placed this
country at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy.
It does not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the
necessity of meeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new
methods, nor upon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital in
the effort to accomplish great things is necessary when the world’s
progress demands that great things be done. It is based upon sincere
conviction that combination and concentration should be, not prohibited,
but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled; and in my
judgment this conviction is right.</p>
<p>He continued: “It should be as much the aim of those who seek for
social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to
rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence.” His conclusion was
that</p>
<p>in the interest of the whole people, the nation should, without
interfering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also
assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing
an interstate business. This is especially true where the corporation
derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic
element or tendency in its business.</p>
<p>Roosevelt proposed that Congress establish a federal agency with
power to investigate the affairs of the great corporations and that, if
necessary, a constitutional amendment could be used to create such an
agency. By 1902 Roosevelt had used the Sherman Act to break up the
Northern Securities Company, affecting the interests of J.P. Morgan, and
subsequent suits had been brought against Du Pont, the American Tobacco
Company, and the Standard Oil Company. Roosevelt strengthened the
Interstate Commerce Act with the Hepburn Act of 1906, which increased
the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, particularly allowing
it to inspect the financial accounts of railways and extending its
authority into new spheres. Roosevelt’s successor, William Taft,
prosecuted trusts even more assiduously, the high point of this being
the breakup of the Standard Oil Company in 1911. Taft also promoted
other important reforms, such as the introduction of a federal income
tax, which came with the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in
1913. The apogee of Progressive reforms came with the election of
Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Wilson noted in his 1913 book, The New Freedom,
“If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of
government. I do not expect to see monopoly restrain itself. If there
are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United
States, they are going to own it.”</p>
<p>Wilson worked to pass the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914,
strengthening the Sherman Act, and he created the Federal Trade
Commission, which enforced the Clayton Act. In addition, under the
impetus of the investigation of the Pujo Committee, led by Louisiana
congressman Arsene Pujo, into the “money trust,” the spread of monopoly
into the financial industry, Wilson moved to increase regulation of the
financial sector. In 1913 he created the Federal Reserve Board, which
would regulate monopolistic activities in the financial sector. The rise
of Robber Barons and their monopoly trusts in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries underscores that, as we already emphasized in
chapter 3, the presence of markets is not by itself a guarantee of
inclusive institutions. Markets can be dominated by a few firms,
charging exorbitant prices and blocking the entry of more efficient
rivals and new technologies. Markets, left to their own devices, can
cease to be inclusive, becoming increasingly dominated by the
economically and politically powerful. Inclusive economic institutions
require not just markets, but inclusive markets that create a level
playing field and economic opportunities for the majority of the people.
Widespread monopoly, backed by the political power of the elite,
contradicts this. But the reaction to the monopoly trusts also
illustrates that when political institutions are inclusive, they create
a countervailing force against movements away from inclusive markets.
This is the virtuous circle in action. Inclusive economic institutions
provide foundations upon which inclusive political institutions can
flourish, while inclusive political institutions restrict deviations
away from inclusive economic institutions. Trust busting in the United
States, in contrast to what we have seen in Mexico (this page–this
page), illustrates this facet of the virtuous circle. While there is no
political body in Mexico restricting Carlos Slim’s monopoly, the Sherman
and Clayton Acts have been used repeatedly in the United States over the
past century to restrict trusts, monopolies, and cartels, and to ensure
that markets remain inclusive. The U.S. experience in the first half of
the twentieth century also emphasizes the important role of free media
in empowering broad segments of society and thus in the virtuous circle.
In 1906 Roosevelt coined the term muckraker, based on a literary
character, the man with the muckrake in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, to
describe what he regarded as intrusive journalism. The term stuck and
came to symbolize journalists who were intrusively, but also
effectively, exposing the excesses of Robber Barons as well as
corruption in local and federal politics. Perhaps the most famous
muckraker was Ida Tarbell, whose 1904 book, History of the Standard Oil
Company, played a key role in moving public opinion against Rockefeller
and his business interests, culminating in the breakup of Standard Oil
in 1911. Another key muckraker was lawyer and author Louis Brandeis, who
would later be named Supreme Court justice by President Wilson. Brandeis
outlined a series of financial scandals in his book Other People’s Money
and How Bankers Use It, and was highly influential on the Pujo
Committee. The newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst also played a
salient role as muckraker. His serialization in his magazine The
Cosmopolitan in 1906 of articles by David Graham Phillips, called “The
Treason of the Senate,” galvanized the campaign to introduce direct
elections for the Senate, another key Progressive reform that happened
with the enactment of the Seventeenth Amendment to the U.S. constitution
in 1913. The muckrakers played a major role in inducing politicians to
take action against the trusts. The Robber Barons hated the muckrakers,
but the political institutions of the United States made it impossible
for them to stamp out and silence them. Inclusive political institutions
allow a free media to flourish, and a free media, in turn, makes it more
likely that threats against inclusive economic and political
institutions will be widely known and resisted. In contrast, such
freedom is impossible under extractive political institutions, under
absolutism, or under dictatorships, which helps extractive regimes to
prevent serious opposition from forming in the first place. The
information that the free media provided was clearly key during the
first half of the twentieth century in the United States. Without this
information, the U.S. public would not have known the true extent of the
power and abuses of the Robber Barons and would not have mobilized
against their trusts.</p>
<p>PACKING THE COURT</p>
<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic Party candidate and cousin of
Teddy Roosevelt, was elected president in 1932 in the midst of the Great
Depression. He came to power with a popular mandate to implement an
ambitious set of policies for combating the Great Depression. At the
time of his inauguration in early 1933, one-quarter of the labor force
was unemployed, with many thrown into poverty. Industrial production had
fallen by over half since the Depression hit in 1929, and investment had
collapsed. The policies Roosevelt proposed to counteract this situation
were collectively known as the New Deal. Roosevelt had won a solid
victory, with 57 percent of the popular vote, and the Democratic Party
had majorities in both the Congress and Senate, enough to pass New Deal
legislation. However, some of the legislation raised constitutional
issues and ended up in the Supreme Court, where Roosevelt’s electoral
mandate cut much less ice. One of the key pillars of the New Deal was
the National Industrial Recovery Act. Title I focused on industrial
recovery. President Roosevelt and his team believed that restraining
industrial competition, giving workers greater rights to form trade
unions, and regulating working standards were crucial to the recovery
effort. Title II established the Public Works Administration, whose
infrastructure projects include such landmarks as the Thirtieth Street
railroad station in Philadelphia, the Triborough Bridge, the Grand
Coulee Dam, and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with
the mainland. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16,
1933, and the National Industrial Recovery Act was put into operation.
However, it immediately faced challenges in the courts. On May 27, 1935,
the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Title I of the act was
unconstitutional. Their verdict noted solemnly, “Extraordinary
conditions may call for extraordinary remedies. But … extraordinary
conditions do not create or enlarge constitutional power.”</p>
<p>Before the Court’s ruling came in, Roosevelt had moved to the next
step of his agenda and had signed the Social Security Act, which
introduced the modern welfare state into the United States: pensions at
retirement, unemployment benefits, aid to families with dependent
children, and some public health care and disability benefits. He also
signed the National Labor Relations Act, which further strengthened the
rights of workers to organize unions, engage in collective bargaining,
and conduct strikes against their employers. These measures also faced
challenges in the Supreme Court. As these were making their way through
the judiciary, Roosevelt was reelected in 1936 with a strong mandate,
receiving 61 percent of the popular vote. With his popularity at record
highs, Roosevelt had no intention of letting the Supreme Court derail
more of his policy agenda. He laid out his plans in one of his regular
Fireside Chats, which was broadcast live on the radio on March 9, 1937.
He started by pointing out that in his first term, much-needed policies
had only cleared the Supreme Court by a whisker. He went on:</p>
<p>I am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when I made
my first radio report to you. We were then in the midst of the great
banking crisis. Soon after, with the authority of the Congress, we asked
the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for
dollar, to the government of the United States. Today’s recovery proves
how right that policy was. But when, almost two years later, it came
before the Supreme Court its constitutionality was upheld only by a
five-to-four vote. The change of one vote would have thrown all the
affairs of this great nation back into hopeless chaos. In effect, four
justices ruled that the right under a private contract to exact a pound
of flesh was more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to
establish an enduring nation.</p>
<p>Obviously, this should not be risked again. Roosevelt continued:</p>
<p>Last Thursday I described the American form of government as a
three-horse team provided by the Constitution to the American people so
that their field might be plowed. The three horses are, of course, the
three branches of government—the Congress, the executive, and the
courts. Two of the horses, the Congress and the executive, are pulling
in unison today; the third is not.</p>
<p>Roosevelt then pointed out that the U.S. Constitution had not
actually endowed the Supreme Court with the right to challenge the
constitutionality of legislation, but that it had assumed this role in
1803. At the time, Justice Bushrod Washington had stipulated that the
Supreme Court should “presume in favor of 〔a law’s〕 validity until its
violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.”
Roosevelt then charged:</p>
<p>In the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit
of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside. The Court has been acting
not as a judicial body, but as a policymaking body.</p>
<p>Roosevelt claimed that he had an electoral mandate to change this
situation and that “after consideration of what reform to propose the
only method which was clearly constitutional … was to infuse new blood
into all our courts.” He also argued that the Supreme Court judges were
overworked, and the load was just too much for the older justices—who
happened to be the ones striking down his legislation. He then proposed
that all judges should face compulsory retirement at the age of seventy
and that he should be allowed to appoint up to six new justices. This
plan, which Roosevelt presented as the Judiciary Reorganization Bill,
would have sufficed to remove the justices who had been appointed
earlier by more conservative administrations and who had most
strenuously opposed the New Deal. Though Roosevelt skillfully tried to
win popular support for the measure, opinion polls suggested that only
about 40 percent of the population was in favor of the plan. Louis
Brandeis was now a Supreme Court justice. Though Brandeis sympathized
with much of Roosevelt’s legislation, he spoke against the president’s
attempts to erode the power of the Supreme Court and his allegations
that the justices were overworked. Roosevelt’s Democratic Party had
large majorities in both houses of Congress. But the House of
Representatives more or less refused to deal with Roosevelt’s bill.
Roosevelt then tried the Senate. The bill was sent to the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which then held highly contentious meetings,
soliciting various opinions on the bill. They ultimately sent it back to
the Senate floor with a negative report, arguing that the bill was a
“needless, futile and utterly dangerous abandonment of constitutional
principle … without precedent or justification.” The Senate voted 70 to
20 to send it back to committee to be rewritten. All the “court packing”
elements were stripped away. Roosevelt would be unable to remove the
constraints placed on his power by the Supreme Court. Even though
Roosevelt’s powers remained constrained, there were compromises, and the
Social Security and the National Labor Relations Acts were both ruled
constitutional by the Court. More important than the fate of these two
acts was the general lesson from this episode. Inclusive political
institutions not only check major deviations from inclusive economic
institutions, but they also resist attempts to undermine their own
continuation. It was in the immediate interests of the Democratic
Congress and Senate to pack the court and ensure that all New Deal
legislation survived. But in the same way that British political elites
in the early eighteenth century understood that suspending the rule of
law would endanger the gains they had wrested from the monarchy,
congressmen and senators understood that if the president could
undermine the independence of the judiciary, then this would undermine
the balance of power in the system that protected them from the
president and ensured the continuity of pluralistic political
institutions. Perhaps Roosevelt would have decided next that obtaining
legislative majorities took too much compromise and time and that he
would instead rule by decree, totally undermining pluralism and the U.S.
political system. Congress certainly would not have approved this, but
then Roosevelt could have appealed to the nation, asserting that
Congress was impeding the necessary measures to fight the Depression. He
could have used the police to close Congress. Sound farfetched? This is
exactly what happened in Peru and Venezuela in the 1990s. Presidents
Fujimori and Chávez appealed to their popular mandate to close
uncooperative congresses and subsequently rewrote their constitutions to
massively strengthen the powers of the president. The fear of this
slippery slope by those sharing power under pluralistic political
institutions is exactly what stopped Walpole from fixing British courts
in the 1720s, and it is what stopped the U.S. Congress from backing
Roosevelt’s court-packing plan. Roosevelt had encountered the power of
virtuous circles. But this logic does not always play out, particularly
in societies that may have some inclusive features but that are broadly
extractive. We have already seen these dynamics in Rome and Venice.
Another illustration comes from comparing Roosevelt’s failed attempt to
pack the Court with similar efforts in Argentina, where crucially the
same struggles took place in the context of predominantly extractive
economic and political institutions. The 1853 constitution of Argentina
created a Supreme Court with duties similar to those of the U.S. Supreme
Court. An 1887 decision allowed the Argentine court to assume the same
role as that of the U.S. Supreme Court in deciding whether specific laws
were constitutional. In theory, the Supreme Court could have developed
as one of the important elements of inclusive political institutions in
Argentina, but the rest of the political and economic system remained
highly extractive, and there was neither empowerment of broad segments
of society nor pluralism in Argentina. As in the United States, the
constitutional role of the Supreme Court would also be challenged in
Argentina. In 1946 Juan Domingo Perón was democratically elected
president of Argentina. Perón was a former colonel and had first come to
national prominence after a military coup in 1943, which had appointed
him minister of labor. In this post, he built a political coalition with
trade unions and the labor movement, which would be crucial for his
presidential bid. Shortly after Perón’s victory, his supporters in the
Chamber of Deputies proposed the impeachment of four of the five members
of the Court. The charges leveled against the Court were several. One
involved unconstitutionally accepting the legality of two military
regimes in 1930 and 1943—rather ironic, since Perón had played a key
role in the latter coup. The other focused on legislation that the court
had struck down, just as its U.S. counterpart had done. In particular,
just prior to Perón’s election as president, the Court had issued a
decision ruling that Perón’s new national labor relations board was
unconstitutional. Just as Roosevelt heavily criticized the Supreme Court
in his 1936 reelection campaign, Perón did the same in his 1946
campaign. Nine months after initiating the impeachment process, the
Chamber of Deputies impeached three of the judges, the fourth having
already resigned. The Senate approved the motion. Perón then appointed
four new justices. The undermining of the Court clearly had the effect
of freeing Perón from political constraints. He could now exercise
unchecked power, in much the same way the military regimes in Argentina
did before and after his presidency. His newly appointed judges, for
example, ruled as constitutional the conviction of Ricardo Balbín, the
leader of the main opposition party to Perón, the Radical Party, for
disrespecting Perón. Perón could effectively rule as a dictator. Since
Perón successfully packed the Court, it has become the norm in Argentina
for any new president to handpick his own Supreme Court justices. So a
political institution that might have exercised some constraints on the
power of the executive is gone. Perón’s regime was removed from power by
another coup in 1955, and was followed by a long sequence of transitions
between military and civilian rule. Both new military and civilian
regimes picked their own justices. But picking Supreme Court justices in
Argentina was not an activity confined to transitions between military
and civilian rule. In 1990 Argentina finally experienced a transition
between democratically elected governments—one democratic government
followed by another. Yet, by this time democratic governments did not
behave much differently from military ones when it came to the Supreme
Court. The incoming president was Carlos Saúl Menem of the Perónist
Party. The sitting Supreme Court had been appointed after the transition
to democracy in 1983 by the Radical Party president Raúl Alfonsín. Since
this was a democratic transition, there should have been no reason for
Menem to appoint his own court. But in the run-up to the election, Menem
had already shown his colors. He continually, though not successfully,
tried to encourage (or even intimidate) members of the court to resign.
He famously offered Justice Carlos Fayt an ambassadorship. But he was
rebuked, and Fayt responded by sending him a copy of his book Law and
Ethics, with the note “Beware I wrote this” inscribed. Undeterred,
within three months of taking office, Menem sent a law to the Chamber of
Deputies proposing to expand the Court from five to nine members. One
argument was the same Roosevelt used in 1937: the court was overworked.
The law quickly passed the Senate and Chamber, and this allowed Menem to
name four new judges. He had his majority. Menem’s victory against the
Supreme Court set in motion the type of slippery-slope dynamics we
mentioned earlier. His next step was to rewrite the constitution to
remove the term limit so he could run for president again. After being
reelected, Menem moved to rewrite the constitution again, but was
stopped not by Argentina political institutions but by factions within
his own Perónist Party, who fought back against his personal domination.
Since independence, Argentina has suffered from most of the
institutional problems that have plagued Latin America. It has been
trapped in a vicious, not a virtuous, circle. As a consequence, positive
developments, such as first steps toward the creation of an independent
Supreme Court, never gained a foothold. With pluralism, no group wants
or dares to overthrow the power of another, for fear that its own power
will be subsequently challenged. At the same time, the broad
distribution of power makes such an overthrow difficult. A Supreme Court
can have power if it receives significant support from broad segments of
society willing to push back attempts to vitiate the Court’s
independence. That has been the case in the United States, but not
Argentina. Legislators there were happy to undermine the Court even if
they anticipated that this could jeopardize their own position. One
reason is that with extractive institutions there is much to gain from
overthrowing the Supreme Court, and the potential benefits are worth the
risks.</p>
<p>POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND VIRTUOUS CIRCLES</p>
<p>Inclusive economic and political institutions do not emerge by
themselves. They are often the outcome of significant conflict between
elites resisting economic growth and political change and those wishing
to limit the economic and political power of existing elites. Inclusive
institutions emerge during critical junctures, such as during the
Glorious Revolution in England or the foundation of the Jamestown colony
in North America, when a series of factors weaken the hold of the elites
in power, make their opponents stronger, and create incentives for the
formation of a pluralistic society. The outcome of political conflict is
never certain, and even if in hindsight we see many historical events as
inevitable, the path of history is contingent. Nevertheless, once in
place, inclusive economic and political institutions tend to create a
virtuous circle, a process of positive feedback, making it more likely
that these institutions will persist and even expand. The virtuous
circle works through several mechanisms. First, the logic of pluralistic
political institutions makes usurpation of power by a dictator, a
faction within the government, or even a well-meaning president much
more difficult, as Franklin Roosevelt discovered when he tried to remove
the checks on his power imposed by the Supreme Court, and as Sir Robert
Walpole discovered when he attempted to summarily implement the Black
Act. In both cases, concentrating power further in the hands of an
individual or a narrow group would have started undermining the
foundations of pluralistic political institutions, and the true measure
of pluralism is precisely its ability to resist such attempts. Pluralism
also enshrines the notion of the rule of law, the principle that laws
should be applied equally to everybody—something that is naturally
impossible under an absolutist monarchy. But the rule of law, in turn,
implies that laws cannot simply be used by one group to encroach upon
the rights of another. What’s more, the principle of the rule of law
opens the door for greater participation in the political process and
greater inclusivity, as it powerfully introduces the idea that people
should be equal not only before the law but also in the political
system. This was one of the principles that made it difficult for the
British political system to resist the forceful calls for greater
democracy throughout the nineteenth century, opening the way to the
gradual extension of the franchise to all adults. Second, as we have
seen several times before, inclusive political institutions support and
are supported by inclusive economic institutions. This creates another
mechanism of the virtuous circle. Inclusive economic institutions remove
the most egregious extractive economic relations, such as slavery and
serfdom, reduce the importance of monopolies, and create a dynamic
economy, all of which reduces the economic benefits that one can secure,
at least in the short run, by usurping political power. Because economic
institutions had already become sufficiently inclusive in Britain by the
eighteenth century, the elite had less to gain by clinging to power and,
in fact, much to lose by using widespread repression against those
demanding greater democracy. This facet of the virtuous circle made the
gradual march of democracy in nineteenth-century Britain both less
threatening to the elite and more likely to succeed. This contrasts with
the situation in absolutist regimes such as the Austro-Hungarian or
Russian empires, where economic institutions were still highly
extractive and, in consequence, where calls for greater political
inclusion later in the nineteenth century would be met by repression
because the elite had too much to lose from sharing power. Finally,
inclusive political institutions allow a free media to flourish, and a
free media often provides information about and mobilizes opposition to
threats against inclusive institutions, as it did during the last
quarter of the nineteenth century and first quarter of the twentieth
century, when the increasing economic domination of the Robber Barons
was threatening the essence of inclusive economic institutions in the
United States. Though the outcome of the ever-present conflicts
continues to be contingent, through these mechanisms the virtuous circle
creates a powerful tendency for inclusive institutions to persist, to
resist challenges, and to expand as they did in both Britain and the
United States. Unfortunately, as we will see in the next chapter,
extractive institutions create equally strong forces toward their
persistence—the process of the vicious circle.</p>
