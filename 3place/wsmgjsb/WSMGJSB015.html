<h4 id="breaking-the-mold">14. BREAKING THE MOLD</h4>
<p>THREE AFRICAN CHIEFS</p>
<p>ON SEPTEMBER 6, 1895, the ocean liner Tantallon Castle docked at
Plymouth on the southern coast of England. Three African chiefs, Khama
of the Ngwato, Bathoen of the Ngwaketse, and Sebele of the Kwena,
disembarked and took the 8:10 express train to Paddington Station,
London. The three chiefs had come to Britain on a mission: to save their
and five other Tswana states from Cecil Rhodes. The Ngwato, Ngwaketse,
and Kwena were three of the eight Tswana states comprising what was then
known as Bechuanaland, which would become Botswana after independence in
1966. The tribes had been trading with Europeans for most of the
nineteenth century. In the 1840s, the famous Scottish missionary David
Livingstone had traveled extensively in Bechuanaland and converted King
Sechele of the Kwena to Christianity. The first translation of the Bible
into an African language was in Setswana, the language of the Tswana. In
1885 Britain had declared Bechuanaland a protectorate. The Tswana were
content with the arrangement, as they thought this would bring them
protection from further European invasions, particularly from the Boers,
with whom they had been clashing since the Great Trek in 1835, a
migration of thousands of Boers into the interior to escape from British
colonialism. The British, on the other hand, wanted control of the area
to block both further expansions by the Boers (this page–this page) and
possible expansions by Germans, who had annexed the area of southwest
Africa corresponding to today’s Namibia. The British did not think that
a full-scale colonization was worthwhile. The high commissioner Rey
summarized the attitudes of the British government in 1885 clearly: “We
have no interest in the country to the north of the Molope 〔the
Bechuanaland protectorate〕, except as a road to the interior; we might
therefore confine ourselves for the present to preventing that part of
the Protectorate being occupied by either filibusters or foreign powers
doing as little in the way of administration or settlement as
possible.”</p>
<p>But things changed for the Tswana in 1889 when Cecil Rhodes’s British
South Africa Company started expanding north out of South Africa,
expropriating great swaths of land that would eventually become Northern
and Southern Rhodesia, now Zambia and Zimbabwe. By 1895, the year of the
three chiefs’ visit to London, Rhodes had his eye on territories to the
southwest of Rhodesia, Bechuanaland. The chiefs knew that only disaster
and exploitation lay ahead for territories if they fell under the
control of Rhodes. Though it was impossible for them to defeat Rhodes
militarily, they were determined to fight him any way they could. They
decided to opt for the lesser of two evils: greater control by the
British rather than annexation by Rhodes. With the help of the London
Missionary Society, they traveled to London to try to persuade Queen
Victoria and Joseph Chamberlain, then colonial secretary, to take
greater control of Bechuanaland and protect it from Rhodes. On September
11, 1895, they had their first meeting with Chamberlain. Sebele spoke
first, then Bathoen, and finally Khama. Chamberlain declared that he
would consider imposing British control to protect the tribes from
Rhodes. In the meantime, the chiefs quickly embarked on a nationwide
speaking tour to drum up popular support for their requests. They
visited and spoke at Windsor and Reading, close to London; in
Southampton on the south coast; and in Leicester and Birmingham, in
Chamberlain’s political support base, the Midlands. They went north to
industrial Yorkshire, to Sheffield, Leeds, Halifax, and Bradford; they
also went west to Bristol and then up to Manchester and Liverpool.
Meanwhile, back in South Africa, Cecil Rhodes was making preparations
for what would become the disastrous Jameson Raid, an armed assault on
the Boer Republic of the Transvaal, despite Chamberlain’s strong
objections. These events likely made Chamberlain much more sympathetic
to the chiefs’ plight than he might have been otherwise. On November 6,
they met with him again in London. The chiefs spoke through an
interpreter:</p>
<p>Chamberlain: I will speak about the lands of the Chiefs, and about
the railway, and about the law which is to be observed in the territory
of the Chiefs … Now let us look at the map … We will take the land that
we want for the railway, and no more.</p>
<p>Khama: I say, that if Mr. Chamberlain will take the land himself, I
will be content.</p>
<p>Chamberlain: Then tell him that I will make the railway myself by the
eyes of one whom I will send and I will take only as much as I require,
and will give compensation if what I take is of value.</p>
<p>Khama: I would like to know how 〔i.e., where〕 the railway will
go.</p>
<p>Chamberlain: It shall go through his territory but shall be fenced
in, and we will take no land.</p>
<p>Khama: I trust that you will do this work as for myself, and treat me
fairly in this matter.</p>
<p>Chamberlain: I will guard your interests.</p>
<p>The next day, Edward Fairfield, at the Colonial Office, explained
Chamberlain’s settlement in more detail:</p>
<p>Each of the three chiefs, Khama, Sebele and Bathoen, shall have a
country within which they shall live as hitherto under the protection of
the Queen. The Queen shall appoint an officer to reside with them. The
chiefs will rule their own people much as at present.</p>
<p>Rhodes’s reaction to being outmaneuvered by the three African chiefs
was predictable. He cabled to one of his employees, saying, “I do object
to being beaten by three canting natives.”</p>
<p>The chiefs in fact had something valuable that they had protected
from Rhodes and would subsequently protect from British indirect rule.
By the nineteenth century, the Tswana states had developed a core set of
political institutions. These involved both an unusual degree, by
sub-Saharan African standards, of political centralization and
collective decision-making procedures that can even be viewed as a
nascent, primitive form of pluralism. Just as the Magna Carta enabled
the participation of barons into the political decision-making process
and put some restrictions on the actions of the English monarchs, the
political institutions of the Tswana, in particular the kgotla, also
encouraged political participation and constrained chiefs. The South
African anthropologist Isaac Schapera describes how the kgotla worked as
follows:</p>
<p>all matters of tribal policy are dealt with finally before a general
assembly of the adult males in the chief’s kgotla (council place). Such
meetings are very frequently held … among the topics discussed … are
tribal disputes, quarrels between the chief and his relatives, the
imposition of new levies, the undertaking of new public works, the
promulgation of new decrees by the chief … it is not unknown for the
tribal assembly to overrule the wishes of the chief. Since anyone may
speak, these meetings enable him to ascertain the feelings of the people
generally, and provide the latter with an opportunity of stating their
grievances. If the occasion calls for it, he and his advisers may be
taken severely to task, for the people are seldom afraid to speak openly
and frankly.</p>
<p>Beyond the kgotla, the Tswana chieftaincy was not strictly hereditary
but open to any man demonstrating significant talent and ability.
Anthropologist John Comaroff studied in detail the political history of
another of the Tswana states, the Rolong. He showed that though in
appearance the Tswana had clear rules stipulating how the chieftancy was
to be inherited, in practice these rules were interpreted to remove bad
rulers and allow talented candidates to become chief. He showed that
winning the chieftancy was a matter of achievement, but was then
rationalized so that the successful competitor appeared to be the
rightful heir. The Tswana captured this idea with a proverb, with a
tinge of constitutional monarchy: kgosi ke kgosi ka morafe, “The king is
king by the grace of the people.”</p>
<p>The Tswana chiefs continued in their attempts to maintain their
independence from Britain and preserve their indigenous institutions
after their trip to London. They conceded the construction of railways
in Bechuanaland, but limited the intervention of the British in other
aspects of economic and political life. They were not opposed to the
construction of the railways, certainly not for the same reasons as the
Austro-Hungarian and Russian monarchs blocked railways. They just
realized that railways, like the rest of the policies of the British,
would not bring development to Bechuanaland as long as it was under
colonial control. The early experience of Quett Masire, president of
independent Botswana from 1980 to 1998, explains why. Masire was an
enterprising farmer in the 1950s; he developed new cultivation
techniques for sorghum and found a potential customer in Vryburg
Milling, a company located across the border in South Africa. He went to
the railway station master at Lobatse in Bechuanaland and asked to rent
two rail trucks to move his crop to Vryburg. The station master refused.
Then he got a white friend to intervene. The station master reluctantly
agreed, but quoted Masire four times the rate for whites. Masire gave up
and concluded, “It was the practice of the whites, not just the laws
prohibiting Africans from owning freehold land or holding trading
licenses that kept blacks from developing enterprises in
Bechuanaland.”</p>
<p>All in all, the chiefs, and the Tswana people, had been lucky.
Perhaps against all odds, they succeeded in preventing Rhodes’s
takeover. As Bechuanaland was still marginal for the British, the
establishment of indirect rule there did not create the type of vicious
circle playing out in Sierra Leone (this page–this page). They also
avoided the kind of colonial expansion that went on in the interior of
South Africa that would turn those lands into reservoirs of cheap labor
for white miners or farmers. The early stages of the process of
colonization are a critical juncture for most societies, a crucial
period during which events that will have important long-term
consequences for their economic and political development transpire. As
we discussed in chapter 9, most societies in sub-Saharan Africa, just as
those in South America and South Asia, witnessed the establishment or
intensification of extractive institutions during colonization. The
Tswana would instead avoid both intense indirect rule and the far worse
fate that would have befallen them had Rhodes succeeded in annexing
their lands. This was not just blind luck, however. It was once again a
result of the interplay between the existing institutions, shaped by the
institutional drift of the Tswana people, and the critical juncture
brought about by colonialism. The three chiefs had made their own luck
by taking the initiative and traveling to London, and they were able to
do this because they had an unusual degree of authority, compared with
other tribal leaders in sub-Saharan Africa, owing to the political
centralization the Tswana tribes had achieved, and perhaps they also had
an unusual degree of legitimacy, because of the modicum of pluralism
embedded in their tribal institutions. Another critical juncture at the
end of the colonial period would be more central to the success of
Botswana, enabling it to develop inclusive institutions. By the time
Bechuanaland became independent in 1966 under the name Botswana, the
lucky success of chiefs Sebele, Bathoen, and Khama was long in the past.
In the intervening years, the British invested little in Bechuanaland.
At independence, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in the world;
it had a total of twelve kilometers of paved roads, twenty-two citizens
who had graduated from university, and one hundred from secondary
school. To top it all off, it was almost completely surrounded by the
white regimes of South Africa, Namibia, and Rhodesia, all of which were
hostile to independent African countries run by blacks. It would have
been on few people’s list of countries most likely to succeed. Yet over
the next forty-five years, Botswana would become one of the
fastest-growing countries in the world. Today Botswana has the highest
per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa, and is at the same level as
successful Eastern European countries such as Estonia and Hungary, and
the most successful Latin American nations, such as Costa Rica. How did
Botswana break the mold? By quickly developing inclusive economic and
political institutions after independence. Since then, it has been
democratic, holds regular and competitive elections, and has never
experienced civil war or military intervention. The government set up
economic institutions enforcing property rights, ensuring macroeconomic
stability, and encouraging the development of an inclusive market
economy. But of course, the more challenging question is, how did
Botswana manage to establish a stable democracy and pluralistic
institutions, and choose inclusive economic institutions, while most
other African countries did the opposite? To answer this, we have to
understand how a critical juncture, this time the end of colonial rule,
interacted with Botswana’s existing institutions. In most of sub-Saharan
Africa—for example, for Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe—independence was an
opportunity missed, accompanied by the re-creation of the same type of
extractive institutions that existed during the colonial period. Early
stages of independence would play out very differently in Botswana,
again largely because of the background created by Tswana historical
institutions. In this, Botswana exhibited many parallels to England on
the verge of the Glorious Revolution. England had achieved rapid
political centralization under the Tudors and had the Magna Carta and
the tradition of Parliament that could at least aspire to constrain
monarchs and ensure some degree of pluralism. Botswana also had some
amount of state centralization and relatively pluralistic tribal
institutions that survived colonialism. England had a newly forming
broad coalition, consisting of Atlantic traders, industrialists, and the
commercially minded gentry, that was in favor of well-enforced property
rights. Botswana had its coalition in favor of secure procedure rights,
the Tswana chiefs, and elites who owned the major assets in the economy,
cattle. Even though land was held communally, cattle was private
property in the Tswana states, and the elites were similarly in favor of
well-enforced property rights. All this of course is not denying the
contingent path of history. Things would have turned out very
differently in England if parliamentary leaders and the new monarch had
attempted to use the Glorious Revolution to usurp power. Similarly,
things could have turned out very differently in Botswana, especially if
it hadn’t been so fortunate as to have leaders such as Seretse Khama, or
Quett Masire, who decided to contest power in elections rather than
subvert the electoral system, as many postindependence leaders in
sub-Saharan Africa did. At independence the Tswana emerged with a
history of institutions enshrining limited chieftaincy and some degree
of accountability of chiefs to the people. The Tswana were of course not
unique in Africa for having institutions like this, but they were unique
in the extent to which these institutions survived the colonial period
unscathed. British rule had been all but absent. Bechuanaland was
administered from Mafeking, in South Africa, and it was only during the
transition to independence in the 1960s that the plans for the capital
of Gaborone were laid out. The capital and the new structures there were
not meant to expunge the indigenous institutions, but to build on them;
as Gaborone was constructed, new kgotlas were planned along with it.
Independence was also a relatively orderly affair. The drive for
independence was led by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), founded in
1960 by Quett Masire and Seretse Khama. Khama was the grandson of King
Khama III; his given name, Seretse, means “the clay that binds
together.” It was to be an extraordinarily apt name. Khama was the
hereditary chief of the Ngwato, and most of the Tswana chiefs and elites
joined the Botswana Democratic Party. Botswana didn’t have a marketing
board, because the British had been so uninterested in the colony. The
BDP quickly set one up in 1967, the Botswana Meat Commission. But
instead of expropriating the ranchers and cattle owners, the Meat
Commission played a central role in developing the cattle economy; it
put up fences to control foot-and-mouth disease and promoted exports,
which would both contribute to economic development and increase the
support for inclusive economic institutions. Though the early growth in
Botswana relied on meat exports, things changed dramatically when
diamonds were discovered. The management of natural resources in
Botswana also differed markedly from that in other African nations.
During the colonial period, the Tswana chiefs had attempted to block
prospecting for minerals in Bechuanaland because they knew that if
Europeans discovered precious metals or stones, their autonomy would be
over. The first big diamond discovery was under Ngwato land, Seretse
Khama’s traditional homeland. Before the discovery was announced, Khama
instigated a change in the law so that all subsoil mineral rights were
vested in the nation, not the tribe. This ensured that diamond wealth
would not create great inequities in Botswana. It also gave further
impetus to the process of state centralization as diamond revenues could
now be used for building a state bureaucracy and infrastructure and for
investing in education. In Sierra Leone and many other sub-Saharan
African nations, diamonds fueled conflict between different groups and
helped to sustain civil wars, earning the label Blood Diamonds for the
carnage brought about by the wars fought over their control. In
Botswana, diamond revenues were managed for the good of the nation. The
change in subsoil mineral rights was not the only policy of state
building that Seretse Khama’s government implemented. Ultimately, the
Chieftaincy Act of 1965 passed by the legislative assembly prior to
independence, and the Chieftaincy Amendment Act of 1970 would continue
the process of political centralization, enshrining the power of the
state and the elected president by removing from chiefs the right to
allocate land and enabling the president to remove a chief from office
if necessary. Another facet of political centralization was the effort
to unify the country further, for example, with legislation ensuring
that only Setswana and English were to be taught in school. Today
Botswana looks like a homogenous country, without the ethnic and
linguistic fragmentation associated with many other African nations. But
this was an outcome of the policy to have only English and a single
national language, Setswana, taught in schools to minimize conflict
between different tribes and groups within society. The last census to
ask questions about ethnicity was the one taken in 1946, which revealed
considerable heterogeneity in Botswana. In the Ngwato reserve, for
example, only 20 percent of the population identified themselves as pure
Ngwato; though there were other Tswana tribes present, there were also
many non-Tswana groups whose first language was not Setswana. This
underlying heterogeneity has been modulated both by the policies of the
postindependence government and by the relatively inclusive institutions
of the Tswana tribes in the same way as heterogeneity in Britain, for
example, between the English and the Welsh, has been modulated by the
British state. The Botswanan state did the same. Since independence, the
census in Botswana has never asked about ethnic heterogeneity, because
in Botswana everyone is Tswana. Botswana achieved remarkable growth
rates after independence because Seretse Khama, Quett Masire, and the
Botswana Democratic Party led Botswana onto a path of inclusive economic
and political institutions. When the diamonds came on stream in the
1970s, they did not lead to civil war, but provided a strong fiscal base
for the government, which would use the revenues to invest in public
services. There was much less incentive to challenge or overthrow the
government and control the state. Inclusive political institutions bred
political stability and supported inclusive economic institutions. In a
pattern familiar from the virtuous circle described in chapter 11,
inclusive economic institutions increased the viability and durability
of inclusive political institutions. Botswana broke the mold because it
was able to seize a critical juncture, postcolonial independence, and
set up inclusive institutions. The Botswana Democratic Party and the
traditional elites, including Khama himself, did not try to form a
dictatorial regime or set up extractive institutions that might have
enriched them at the expense of society. This was once again an outcome
of the interplay between a critical juncture and existing institutions.
As we have seen, differently from almost anywhere else in sub-Saharan
Africa, Botswana already had tribal institutions that had achieved some
amount of centralized authority and contained important pluralistic
features. Moreover, the country had economic elites who themselves had
much to gain from secure property rights. No less important, the
contingent path of history worked in Botswana’s favor. It was
particularly lucky because Seretse Khama and Quett Masire were not Siaka
Stevens and Robert Mugabe. The former worked hard and honestly to build
inclusive institutions on the foundations of the Tswanas’ tribal
institutions. All this made it more likely that Botswana would succeed
in taking a path toward inclusive institutions, whereas much of the rest
of sub-Saharan Africa did not even try, or failed outright.</p>
<p>THE END OF THE SOUTHERN EXTRACTION</p>
<p>It was December 1, 1955. The city of Montgomery, Alabama, arrest
warrant lists the time that the offense occurred as 6:06 p.m. James
Blake, a bus driver, was having trouble, he called the police, and
Officers Day and Mixon arrived on the scene. They noted in their
report:</p>
<p>We received a call upon arrival the bus operator said he had a
colored female sitting in the white section of the bus, and would not
move back. We … also saw her. The bus operator signed a warrant for her.
Rosa Parks (cf) was charged with chapter 6 section 11 of the Montgomery
City Code.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks’s offense was to sit in a section of the Cleveland Avenue
bus reserved for whites, a crime under Alabama’s Jim Crow laws. Parks
was fined ten dollars in addition to court fees of four dollars. Rosa
Parks wasn’t just anybody. She was already the secretary of the
Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, the NAACP, which had long been struggling to change the
institutions of the U.S. South. Her arrest triggered a mass movement,
the Montgomery Bus Boycott, masterminded by Martin Luther King, Jr. By
December 3, King and other black leaders had organized a coordinated bus
boycott, convincing all black people that they should not ride on any
bus in Montgomery. The boycott was successful and it lasted until
December 20, 1956. It set in motion a process that culminated in the
U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the laws that segregated buses in Alabama
and Montgomery were unconstitutional. The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a
key moment in the civil rights movement in the U.S. South. This movement
was part of a series of events and changes that finally broke the mold
in the South and led to a fundamental change of institutions. As we saw
in chapter 12, after the Civil War, southern landowning elites had
managed to re-create the extractive economic and political institutions
that had dominated the South before the Civil War. Though the details of
these institutions changed—for example, slavery was no longer
possible—the negative impact on economic incentives and prosperity in
the South was the same. The South was notably poorer than the rest of
the United States. Starting in the 1950s, southern institutions would
begin to move the region onto a much faster growth trajectory. The type
of extractive institutions ultimately eliminated in the U.S. South were
different from the colonial institutions of pre-independence Botswana.
The type of critical juncture that started the process of their downfall
was also different but shared several commonalities. Starting in the
1940s, those who bore the brunt of the discrimination and the extractive
institutions in the South, people such as Rosa Parks, started to become
much better organized in their fight against them. At the same time, the
U.S. Supreme Court and the federal government finally began to intervene
systematically to reform the extractive institutions in the South. Thus
a main factor creating a critical juncture for change in the South was
the empowerment of black Americans there and the end of the unchallenged
domination of the southern elites. The southern political institutions,
both before the Civil War and after, had a clear economic logic, not too
different from the South African Apartheid regime: to secure cheap labor
for the plantations. But by the 1950s, this logic became less
compelling. For one, significant mass outmigration of blacks from the
South was already under way, a legacy of both the Great Depression and
the Second World War. In the 1940s and ’50s, this reached an average of
a hundred thousand people per year. Meanwhile, technological innovation
in agriculture, though adopted only slowly, was reducing the dependence
of the plantation owners on cheap labor. Most labor in the plantations
was used for picking cotton. In 1950 almost all southern cotton was
still picked by hand. But the mechanization of cotton picking was
reducing the demand for this type of work. By 1960, in the key states of
Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, almost half of production had
become mechanized. Just as blacks became harder to trap in the South,
they also became no longer indispensable for the plantation owners.
There was thus less reason for elites to fight vigorously to maintain
the old extractive economic institutions. This did not mean that they
would accept the changes in institutions willingly, however. Instead, a
protracted conflict ensued. An unusual coalition, between southern
blacks and the inclusive federal institutions of the United States,
created a powerful force away from southern extraction and toward equal
political and civil rights for southern blacks, which would finally
remove the significant barriers to economic growth in the U.S. South.
The most important impetus for change came from the civil rights
movement. It was the empowerment of blacks in the South that led the
way, as in Montgomery, by challenging extractive institutions around
them, by demanding their rights, and by protesting and mobilizing in
order to obtain them. But they weren’t alone in this, because the U.S.
South was not a separate country and the southern elites did not have
free rein as did Guatemalan elites, for example. As part of the United
States of America, the South was subject to the U.S. Constitution and
federal legislation. The cause for fundamental reform in the South would
finally receive support from the U.S. executive, legislature, and
Supreme Court partly because the civil rights movement was able to have
its voice heard outside the South, thereby mobilizing the federal
government. Federal intervention to change the institutions in the South
started with the decision of the Supreme Court in 1944 that primary
elections where only white people could stand were unconstitutional. As
we have seen, blacks had been politically disenfranchised in the 1890s
with the use of poll taxes and literacy tests (this page–this page).
These tests were routinely manipulated to discriminate against black
people, while still allowing poor and illiterate whites to vote. In a
famous example from the early 1960s, in Louisiana a white applicant was
judged literate after giving the answer “FRDUM FOOF SPETGH” to a
question about the state constitution. The Supreme Court decision in
1944 was the opening salvo in the longer battle to open up the political
system to blacks, and the Court understood the importance of loosening
white control of political parties. That decision was followed by Brown
v. Board of Education in 1954, in which the Supreme Court ruled that
state-mandated segregation of schools and other public sites was
unconstitutional. In 1962 the Court knocked away another pillar of the
political dominance of white elites: legislative malapportionment. When
a legislature is malapportioned—as were the “rotten boroughs” in England
before the First Reform Act—some areas or regions receive much greater
representation than they should based on their share of the relevant
population. Malapportionment in the South meant that the rural areas,
the heartland of the southern planter elite, were heavily
overrepresented relative to urban areas. The Supreme Court put an end to
this in 1962 with its decision in the Baker v. Carr case, which
introduced the “one-person, one-vote” standard. But all the rulings from
the Supreme Court would have amounted to little if they hadn’t been
implemented. In the 1890s, in fact, federal legislation enfranchising
southern blacks was not implemented, because local law enforcement was
under the control of the southern elite and the Democratic Party, and
the federal government was happy to go along with this state of affairs.
But as blacks started rising up against the southern elite, this bastion
of support for Jim Crow crumbled, and the Democratic Party, led by its
non-southern elements, turned against racial segregation. The renegade
southern Democrats regrouped under the banner of the States’ Rights
Democratic Party and competed in the 1948 presidential election. Their
candidate, Strom Thurmond, carried four states and gained thirty-nine
votes in the Electoral College. But this was a far cry from the power of
the unified Democratic Party in national politics and the capture of
that party by the southern elites. Strom Thurmond’s campaign was
centered on his challenge to the ability of the federal government to
intervene in the institutions of the South. He stated his position
forcefully: “I wanna tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that there’s not
enough troops in the army to force the Southern people to break down
segregation and admit the nigra race into our theaters, into our
swimming pools, into our homes, and into our churches.”</p>
<p>He would be proved wrong. The rulings of the Supreme Court meant that
southern educational facilities had to be desegregated, including the
University of Mississippi in Oxford. In 1962, after a long legal battle,
federal courts ruled that James Meredith, a young black air force
veteran, had to be admitted to “Ole Miss.” Opposition to the
implementation of this ruling was orchestrated by the so-called
Citizens’ Councils, the first of which had been formed in Indianola,
Mississippi, in 1954 to fight desegregation of the South. State governor
Ross Barnett publicly rejected the court-ordered desegregation on
television on September 13, announcing that state universities would
close before they agreed to be desegregated. Finally, after much
negotiation between Barnett and President John Kennedy and Attorney
General Robert Kennedy in Washington, the federal government intervened
forcibly to implement this ruling. A day was set when U.S. marshals
would bring Meredith to Oxford. In anticipation, white supremacists
began to organize. On September 30, the day before Meredith was due to
appear, U.S. marshals entered the university campus and surrounded the
main administration building. A crowd of about 2,500 came to protest,
and soon a riot broke out. The marshals used tear gas to disperse the
rioters, but soon came under fire. By 10:00 p.m. that night, federal
troops were moved into the city to restore order. Soon there were 20,000
troops and 11,000 National Guardsmen in Oxford. In total, 300 people
would be arrested. Meredith decided to stay on campus, where, protected
from death threats by U.S. marshals and 300 soldiers, he eventually
graduated. Federal legislation was pivotal in the process of
institutional reform in the South. During the passage of the first Civil
Rights Act in 1957, Strom Thurmond, then a senator, spoke nonstop for
twenty-four hours and eighteen minutes to prevent, or at least delay,
passage of the act. During his speech he read everything from the
Declaration of Independence to various phone books. But to no avail. The
1957 act culminated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawing a whole
gamut of segregationist state legislation and practices. The Voting
Rights Act of 1965 declared the literacy tests, poll taxes, and other
methods used for disenfranchising southern blacks to be illegal. It also
extended a great deal of federal oversight into state elections. The
impact of all these events was a significant change in economic and
legal institutions in the South. In Mississippi, for example, only about
5 percent of eligible black people were voting in 1960. By 1970 this
figure had increased to 50 percent. In Alabama and South Carolina, it
went from around 10 percent in 1960 to 50 percent in 1970. These
patterns changed the nature of elections, both for local and national
offices. More important, the political support from the dominant
Democratic Party for the extractive institutions discriminating against
blacks eroded. The way was then open for a range of changes in economic
institutions. Prior to the institutional reforms of the 1960s, blacks
had been almost entirely excluded from jobs in textile mills. In 1960
only about 5 percent of employees in southern textile mills were black.
Civil rights legislation stopped this discrimination. By 1970 this
proportion had increased to 15 percent; by 1990 it was at 25 percent.
Economic discrimination against blacks began to decline, the educational
opportunities for blacks improved significantly, and the southern labor
market became more competitive. Together with inclusive institutions
came more rapid economic improvements in the South. In 1940 southern
states had only about 50 percent of the level of per capita income of
the United States. This started to change in the late 1940s and ’50s. By
1990 the gap had basically vanished. As in Botswana, the key in the U.S.
South was the development of inclusive political and economic
institutions. This came at the juxtaposition of the increasing
discontent among blacks suffering under southern extractive institutions
and the crumbling of the one-party rule of the Democratic Party in the
South. Once again, existing institutions shaped the path of change. In
this case, it was pivotal that southern institutions were situated
within the inclusive federal institutions of the United States, and this
allowed southern blacks finally to mobilize the federal government and
institutions for their cause. The whole process was also facilitated by
the fact that, with the massive outmigration of blacks from the South
and the mechanization of cotton production, economic conditions had
changed so that southern elites were less willing to put up more of a
fight.</p>
<p>REBIRTH IN CHINA</p>
<p>The Communist Party under the leadership of Mao Zedong finally
overthrew the Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, in 1949. The
People’s Republic of China was proclaimed on October 1. The political
and economic institutions created after 1949 were highly extractive.
Politically, they featured the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist
Party. No other political organization has been allowed in China since
then. Until his death in 1976, Mao entirely dominated the Communist
Party and the government. Accompanying these authoritarian, extractive
political institutions were highly extractive economic institutions. Mao
immediately nationalized land and abolished all kinds of property rights
in one fell swoop. He had landlords, as well as other segments he deemed
to be against the regime, executed. The market economy was essentially
abolished. People in rural areas were gradually organized onto communal
farms. Money and wages were replaced by “work points,” which could be
traded for goods. Internal passports were introduced in 1956 forbidding
travel without appropriate authorization, in order to increase political
and economic control. All industry was similarly nationalized, and Mao
launched an ambitious attempt to promote the rapid development of
industry through the use of “five-year plans,” modeled on those in the
Soviet Union. As with all extractive institutions, Mao’s regime was
attempting to extract resources from the vast country he was now
controlling. As in the case of the government of Sierra Leone with its
marketing board, the Chinese Communist Party had a monopoly over the
sale of produce, such as rice and grain, which was used to heavily tax
farmers. The attempts at industrialization turned into the infamous
Great Leap Forward after 1958 with the roll-out of the second five-year
plan. Mao announced that steel output would double in a year based on
small-scale “backyard” blast furnaces. He claimed that in fifteen years,
China would catch up with British steel production. The only problem was
that there was no feasible way of meeting these targets. To meet the
plan’s goals, scrap metal had to be found, and people would have to melt
down their pots and pans and even their agricultural implements such as
hoes and plows. Workers who ought to have been tending the fields were
making steel by destroying their plows, and thus their future ability to
feed themselves and the country. The result was a calamitous famine in
the Chinese countryside. Though scholars debate the role of Mao’s policy
compared with the impact of droughts at the same time, nobody doubts the
central role of the Great Leap Forward in contributing to the death of
between twenty and forty million people. We don’t know precisely how
many, because China under Mao did not collect the numbers that would
have documented the atrocities. Per capita income fell by around
one-quarter. One consequence of the Great Leap Forward was that a senior
member of the Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping, a very successful general
during the revolution, who led an “anti-rightist” campaign resulting in
the execution of many “enemies of the revolution,” had a change of
heart. At a conference in Guangzhou in the south of China in 1961, Deng
argued, “No matter whether the cat is black or white, if it catches
mice, it’s a good cat.” It did not matter whether policies appeared
communist or not; China needed policies that would encourage production
so that it could feed its people. Yet Deng was soon to suffer for his
newfound practicality. On May 16, 1966, Mao announced that the
revolution was under threat from “bourgeois” interests that were
undermining China’s communist society and wishing to re-create
capitalism. In response, he announced the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution, usually referred to as the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural
Revolution was based on sixteen points. The first started:</p>
<p>Although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, it is still trying to
use the old ideas, culture, and customs, and habits of the exploiting
classes to corrupt the masses, capture their minds, and endeavor to
stage a comeback. The proletariat must do just the opposite: it must
meet head-on every challenge of the bourgeoisie in the ideological field
and use the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat
to change the mental outlook of the whole of society. At present our
objective is to struggle against and crush those persons in authority
who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the
reactionary bourgeois academic authorities and the ideology of the
bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and transform education,
literature, and art and all other parts of the superstructure that do
not correspond to the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the
consolidation and development of the socialist system.</p>
<p>Soon the Cultural Revolution, just like the Great Leap Forward, would
start wrecking both the economy and many human lives. Units of Red
Guards were formed across the country: young, enthusiastic members of
the Communist Party who were used to purge opponents of the regime. Many
people were killed, arrested, or sent into internal exile. Mao himself
retorted to concerns about the extent of the violence, stating, “This
man Hitler was even more ferocious. The more ferocious, the better,
don’t you think? The more people you kill, the more revolutionary you
are.”</p>
<p>Deng found himself labeled number-two capitalist roader, was jailed
in 1967, and then was exiled to Jiangxi province in 1969, to work in a
rural tractor factory. He was rehabilitated in 1974, and Mao was
persuaded by Premier Zhou Enlai to make Deng first vice-premier. Already
in 1975, Deng supervised the composition of three party documents that
would have charted a new direction had they been adopted. They called
for a revitalization of higher education, a return to material
incentives in industry and agriculture, and the removal of “leftists”
from the party. At the time, Mao’s health was deteriorating and power
was increasingly concentrated in the hands of the very leftists whom
Deng Xiaoping wanted to remove from power. Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, and
three of her close associates, collectively known as the Gang of Four,
had been great supporters of the Cultural Revolution and the resulting
repression. They intended to continue using this blueprint to run the
country under the dictatorship of the Communist Party. On April 5, a
spontaneous celebration of the life of Zhou Enlai in Tiananmen Square
turned into a protest against the government. The Gang of Four blamed
Deng for the demonstrations, and he was once more stripped of all his
positions and dismissed. Instead of achieving the removal of the
leftists, Deng found that the leftists had removed him. After the death
of Zhou Enlai, Mao had appointed Hua Guofeng as the acting premier
instead of Deng. In the relative power vacuum of 1976, Hua was able to
accumulate a great deal of personal power. In September there was a
critical juncture: Mao died. The Chinese Communist Party had been under
Mao’s domination, and the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution
had been largely his initiatives. With Mao gone, there was a true power
vacuum, which resulted in a struggle between those with different
visions and different beliefs about the consequences of change. The Gang
of Four intended to continue with the policies of the Cultural
Revolution as the only way of consolidating theirs and the Communist
Party’s power. Hua Guofeng wanted to abandon the Cultural Revolution,
but he could not distance himself too much from it, because he owed his
own rise in the party to its effects. Instead, he advocated a return to
a more balanced version of Mao’s vision, which he encapsulated in the
“Two Whatevers,” as the People’s Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese
Communist Party, put it in 1977. Hua argued, “We will resolutely uphold
whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow
whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave.”</p>
<p>Deng Xiaoping did not wish to abolish the communist regime and
replace it with inclusive markets any more than Hua did. He, too, was
part of the same group of people brought to power by the communist
revolution. But he and his supporters thought that significant economic
growth could be achieved without endangering their political control:
they had a model of growth under extractive political institutions that
would not threaten their power, because the Chinese people were in dire
need of improved living standards and because all meaningful opposition
to the Communist Party had been obliterated during Mao’s reign and the
Cultural Revolution. To achieve this, they wished to repudiate not just
the Cultural Revolution but also much of the Maoist institutional
legacy. They realized that economic growth would be possible only with
significant moves toward inclusive economic institutions. They thus
wished to reform the economy and bolster the role of market forces and
incentives. They also wanted to expand the scope for private ownership
and reduce the role of the Communist Party in society and the
administration, getting rid of such concepts as class struggle. Deng’s
group was also open to foreign investment and international trade, and
wished to pursue a much more aggressive policy of integrating with the
international economy. Still, there were limits, and building truly
inclusive economic institutions and significantly lessening the grip the
Communist Party had on the economy weren’t even options. The turning
point for China was Hua Guofeng’s power and his willingness to use it
against the Gang of Four. Within a month of Mao’s death, Hua mounted a
coup against the Gang of Four, having them all arrested. He then
reinstated Deng in March 1977. There was nothing inevitable either about
this course of events or about the next significant steps, which
resulted from Hua himself being politically outmaneuvered by Deng
Xiaoping. Deng encouraged public criticism of the Cultural Revolution
and began to fill key positions in the Communist Party at all levels
with people who, like him, had suffered during this period. Hua could
not repudiate the Cultural Revolution, and this weakened him. He was
also a comparative newcomer to the centers of power, and he lacked the
web of connections and informal relations that Deng had built up over
many years. In a series of speeches, Deng began to criticize Hua’s
policies. In September 1978, he explicitly attacked the Two Whatevers,
noting that rather than let whatever Mao had said determine policy, the
correct approach was to “seek truth from facts.”</p>
<p>Deng also brilliantly began to bring public pressure to bear on Hua,
which was reflected most powerfully in the Democracy Wall movement in
1978, in which people posted complaints about the country on a wall in
Beijing. In July of 1978, one of Deng’s supporters, Hu Qiaomu, presented
some basic principles of economic reform. These included the notions
that firms should be given greater initiative and authority to make
their own production decisions. Prices should be allowed to bring supply
and demand together, rather than just being set by the government, and
the state regulation of the economy more generally ought to be reduced.
These were radical suggestions, but Deng was gaining influence. In
November and December 1978, the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central
Party Committee produced a breakthrough. Over Hua’s objections, it was
decided that, from then on, the focus of the party would be not class
struggle but economic modernization. The plenum announced some tentative
experiments with a “household responsibility system” in some provinces,
which was an attempt to roll back collective agriculture and introduce
economic incentives into farming. By the next year, the Central
Committee was acknowledging the centrality of the notion of “truth from
facts” and declaring the Cultural Revolution to have been a great
calamity for the Chinese people. Throughout this period, Deng was
securing the appointment of his own supporters to important positions in
the party, army, and government. Though he had to move slowly against
Hua’s supporters in the Central Committee, he created parallel bases of
power. By 1980 Hua was forced to step down from the premiership, to be
replaced by Zhao Ziyang. By 1982 Hua had been removed from the Central
Committee. But Deng did not stop there. At the Twelfth Party Congress in
1982, and then in the National Party Conference in September 1985, he
achieved an almost complete reshuffling of the party leadership and
senior cadres. In came much younger, reform-minded people. If one
compares 1980 to 1985, then by the latter date, twenty-one of the
twenty-six members of the Politburo, eight of the eleven members of the
Communist Party secretariat, and ten of the eighteen vice-premiers had
been changed. Now that Deng and the reformers had consummated their
political revolution and were in control of the state, they launched a
series of further changes in economic institutions. They began in
agriculture: By 1983, following the ideas of Hu Qiaomu, the household
responsibility system, which would provide economic incentives to
farmers, was universally adopted. In 1985 the mandatory state purchasing
of grain was abandoned and replaced by a system of more voluntary
contracts. Administrative control of agricultural prices was greatly
relaxed in 1985. In the urban economy, state enterprises were given more
autonomy, and fourteen “open cities” were identified and given the
ability to attract foreign investment. It was the rural economy that
took off first. The introduction of incentives led to a dramatic
increase in agricultural productivity. By 1984 grain output was
one-third higher than in 1978, though fewer people were involved in
agriculture. Many had moved into employment in new rural industries, the
so-called Township Village Enterprises. These had been allowed to grow
outside the system of state industrial planning after 1979, when it was
accepted that new firms could enter and compete with state-owned firms.
Gradually economic incentives were also introduced into the industrial
sector, in particular into the operation of state-run enterprises,
though at this stage there was no hint at privatization, which had to
wait until the mid-1990s. The rebirth of China came with a significant
move away from one of the most extractive set of economic institutions
and toward more inclusive ones. Market incentives in agriculture and
industry, then followed by foreign investment and technology, would set
China on a path to rapid economic growth. As we will discuss further in
the next chapter, this was growth under extractive political
institutions, even if they were not as repressive as they had been under
the Cultural Revolution and even if economic institutions were becoming
partially inclusive. All of this should not understate the degree to
which the changes in economic institutions in China were radical. China
broke the mold, even if it did not transform its political institutions.
As in Botswana and the U.S. South, the crucial changes came during a
critical juncture—in the case of China, following Mao’s death. They were
also contingent, in fact highly contingent, as there was nothing
inevitable about the Gang of Four losing the power struggle; and if they
had not, China would not have experienced the sustained economic growth
it has seen in the last thirty years. But the devastation and human
suffering that the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution caused
generated sufficient demand for change that Deng Xiaoping and his allies
were able to win the political fight.</p>
<p>BOTSWANA, CHINA, and the U.S. South, just like the Glorious
Revolution in England, the French Revolution, and the Meiji Restoration
in Japan, are vivid illustrations that history is not destiny. Despite
the vicious circle, extractive institutions can be replaced by inclusive
ones. But it is neither automatic nor easy. A confluence of factors, in
particular a critical juncture coupled with a broad coalition of those
pushing for reform or other propitious existing institutions, is often
necessary for a nation to make strides toward more inclusive
institutions. In addition some luck is key, because history always
unfolds in a contingent way.</p>
