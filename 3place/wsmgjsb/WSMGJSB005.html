SMALL DIFFERENCES AND CRITICAL JUNCTURES: THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY</h4>
<p>THE WORLD THE PLAGUE CREATED</p>
<p>IN 1346 THE BUBONIC plague, the Black Death, reached the port city of
Tana at the mouth of the River Don on the Black Sea. Transmitted by
fleas living on rats, the plague was brought from China by traders
traveling along the Silk Road, the great trans-Asian commercial artery.
Thanks to Genoese traders, the rats were soon spreading the fleas and
the plague from Tana to the entire Mediterranean. By early 1347, the
plague had reached Constantinople. In the spring of 1348, it was
spreading through France and North Africa and up the boot of Italy. The
plague wiped out about half of the population of any area it hit. Its
arrival in the Italian city of Florence was witnessed firsthand by the
Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. He later recalled:</p>
<p>In the face of its onrush, all the wisdom and ingenuity of man were
unavailing … the plague began, in a terrifying and extraordinary manner,
to make its disastrous effects apparent. It did not take the form it had
assumed in the East, where if anyone bled from the nose it was an
obvious portent of certain death. On the contrary, its earliest symptom
was the appearance of certain swellings in the groin or armpit, some of
which were egg-shaped whilst others were roughly the size of a common
apple … Later on the symptoms of the disease changed, and many people
began to find dark blotches and bruises on their arms, thighs and other
parts of their bodies … Against these maladies … All the advice of
physicians and all the power of medicine were profitless and unavailing
… And in most cases death occurred within three days from the appearance
of the symptoms we have described.</p>
<p>People in England knew the plague was coming their way and were well
aware of impending doom. In mid-August 1348, King Edward III asked the
Archbishop of Canterbury to organize prayers, and many bishops wrote
letters for priests to read out in church to help people cope with what
was about to hit them. Ralph of Shrewsbury, Bishop of Bath, wrote to his
priests:</p>
<p>Almighty God uses thunder, lightening 〔sic〕, and other blows which
issue from his throne to scourge the sons whom he wishes to redeem.
Accordingly, since a catastrophic pestilence from the East has arrived
in a neighboring kingdom, it is to be very much feared that, unless we
pray devoutly and incessantly, a similar pestilence will stretch its
poisonous branches into this realm, and strike down and consume the
inhabitants. Therefore we must all come before the presence of the Lord
in confession, reciting psalms.</p>
<p>It didn’t do any good. The plague hit and quickly wiped out about
half the English population. Such catastrophes can have a huge effect on
the institutions of society. Perhaps understandably, scores of people
went mad. Boccaccio noted that “some maintained that an infallible way
of warding off this appalling evil was to drink heavily, enjoy life to
the full, go round singing and merrymaking, gratify all one’s cravings
whenever the opportunity offered, and shrug the thing off as an enormous
joke … and this explains why those women who recovered were possibly
less chaste in the period that followed.” Yet the plague also had a
socially, economically, and politically transformative impact on
medieval European societies. At the turn of the fourteenth century,
Europe had a feudal order, an organization of society that first emerged
in Western Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire. It was based
on a hierarchical relationship between the king and the lords beneath
him, with the peasants at the bottom. The king owned the land and he
granted it to the lords in exchange for military services. The lords
then allocated land to peasants, in exchange for which peasants had to
perform extensive unpaid labor and were subject to many fines and taxes.
Peasants, who because of their “servile” status were thus called serfs,
were tied to the land, unable to move elsewhere without the permission
of their lord, who was not just the landlord, but also the judge, jury,
and police force. It was a highly extractive system, with wealth flowing
upward from the many peasants to the few lords. The massive scarcity of
labor created by the plague shook the foundations of the feudal order.
It encouraged peasants to demand that things change. At Eynsham Abbey,
for example, the peasants demanded that many of the fines and unpaid
labor be reduced. They got what they wanted, and their new contract
began with the assertion “At the time of the mortality or pestilence,
which occurred in 1349, scarcely two tenants remained in the manor, and
they expressed their intention of leaving unless Brother Nicholas of
Upton, then abbot and lord of the manor, made a new agreement with
them.” He did. What happened at Eynsham happened everywhere. Peasants
started to free themselves from compulsory labor services and many
obligations to their lords. Wages started to rise. The government tried
to put a stop to this and, in 1351, passed the Statute of Laborers,
which commenced:</p>
<p>Because a great part of the people and especially of the workmen and
servants has now died in that pestilence, some, seeing the straights of
the masters and the scarcity of servants, are not willing to serve
unless they receive excessive wages … We, considering the grave
inconveniences which might come from the lack especially of ploughmen
and such labourers, have … seen fit to ordain: that every man and woman
of our kingdom of England … shall be bound to serve him who has seen fit
so to seek after him; and he shall take only the wages liveries, meed or
salary which, in the places where he sought to serve, were accustomed to
be paid in the twentieth year of our reign of England 〔King Edward III
came to the throne on January 25, 1327, so the reference here is to
1347〕 or the five or six common years next preceding.</p>
<p>The statute in effect tried to fix wages at the levels paid before
the Black Death. Particularly concerning for the English elite was
“enticement,” the attempt by one lord to attract the scarce peasants of
another. The solution was to make prison the punishment for leaving
employment without permission of the employer:</p>
<p>And if a reaper or mower, or other workman or servant, of whatever
standing or condition he be, who is retained in the service of any one,
do depart from the said service before the end of the term agreed,
without permission or reasonable cause, he shall undergo the penalty of
imprisonment, and let no one … moreover, pay or permit to be paid to any
one more wages, livery, meed or salary than was customary as has been
said.</p>
<p>The attempt by the English state to stop the changes of institutions
and wages that came in the wake of the Black Death didn’t work. In 1381
the Peasants’ Revolt broke out, and the rebels, under the leadership of
Wat Tyler, even captured most of London. Though they were ultimately
defeated, and Tyler was executed, there were no more attempts to enforce
the Statute of Laborers. Feudal labor services dwindled away, an
inclusive labor market began to emerge in England, and wages rose. The
plague seems to have hit most of the world, and everywhere a similar
fraction of the population perished. Thus the demographic impact in
Eastern Europe was the same as in England and Western Europe. The social
and economic forces at play were also the same. Labor was scarce and
people demanded greater freedoms. But in the East, a more powerful
contradictory logic was at work. Fewer people meant higher wages in an
inclusive labor market. But this gave lords a greater incentive to keep
the labor market extractive and the peasants servile. In England this
motivation had been in play, too, as reflected in the Statute of
Laborers. But workers had sufficient power that they got their way. Not
so in Eastern Europe. After the plague, Eastern landlords started to
take over large tracts of land and expand their holdings, which were
already larger than those in Western Europe. Towns were weaker and less
populous, and rather than becoming freer, workers began to see their
already existing freedoms encroached on. The effects became especially
clear after 1500, when Western Europe began to demand the agricultural
goods, such as wheat, rye, and livestock, produced in the East. Eighty
percent of the imports of rye into Amsterdam came from the Elbe,
Vistula, and Oder river valleys. Soon half of the Netherlands’ booming
trade was with Eastern Europe. As Western demand expanded, Eastern
landlords ratcheted up their control over the labor force to expand
their supply. It was to be called the Second Serfdom, distinct and more
intense than its original form of the early Middle Ages. Lords increased
the taxes they levied on their tenants’ own plots and took half of the
gross output. In Korczyn, Poland, all work for the lord in 1533 was
paid. But by 1600 nearly half was unpaid forced labor. In 1500, workers
in Mecklenberg, in eastern Germany, owed only a few days’ unpaid labor
services a year. By 1550 it was one day a week, and by 1600, three days
per week. Workers’ children had to work for the lord for free for
several years. In Hungary, landlords took complete control of the land
in 1514, legislating one day a week of unpaid labor services for each
worker. In 1550 this was raised to two days per week. By the end of the
century, it was three days. Serfs subject to these rules made up 90
percent of the rural population by this time. Though in 1346 there were
few differences between Western and Eastern Europe in terms of political
and economic institutions, by 1600 they were worlds apart. In the West,
workers were free of feudal dues, fines, and regulations and were
becoming a key part of a booming market economy. In the East, they were
also involved in such an economy, but as coerced serfs growing the food
and agricultural goods demanded in the West. It was a market economy,
but not an inclusive one. This institutional divergence was the result
of a situation where the differences between these areas initially
seemed very small: in the East, lords were a little better organized;
they had slightly more rights and more consolidated landholdings. Towns
were weaker and smaller, peasants less organized. In the grand scheme of
history, these were small differences. Yet these small differences
between the East and the West became very consequential for the lives of
their populations and for the future path of institutional development
when the feudal order was shaken up by the Black Death. The Black Death
is a vivid example of a critical juncture, a major event or confluence
of factors disrupting the existing economic or political balance in
society. A critical juncture is a double-edged sword that can cause a
sharp turn in the trajectory of a nation. On the one hand it can open
the way for breaking the cycle of extractive institutions and enable
more inclusive ones to emerge, as in England. Or it can intensify the
emergence of extractive institutions, as was the case with the Second
Serfdom in Eastern Europe. Understanding how history and critical
junctures shape the path of economic and political institutions enables
us to have a more complete theory of the origins of differences in
poverty and prosperity. In addition, it enables us to account for the
lay of the land today and why some nations make the transition to
inclusive economic and political institutions while others do not.</p>
<p>THE MAKING OF INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>England was unique among nations when it made the breakthrough to
sustained economic growth in the seventeenth century. Major economic
changes were preceded by a political revolution that brought a distinct
set of economic and political institutions, much more inclusive than
those of any previous society. These institutions would have profound
implications not only for economic incentives and prosperity, but also
for who would reap the benefits of prosperity. They were based not on
consensus but, rather, were the result of intense conflict as different
groups competed for power, contesting the authority of others and
attempting to structure institutions in their own favor. The culmination
of the institutional struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries were two landmark events: the English Civil War between 1642
and 1651, and particularly the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Glorious
Revolution limited the power of the king and the executive, and
relocated to Parliament the power to determine economic institutions. At
the same time, it opened up the political system to a broad cross
section of society, who were able to exert considerable influence over
the way the state functioned. The Glorious Revolution was the foundation
for creating a pluralistic society, and it built on and accelerated a
process of political centralization. It created the world’s first set of
inclusive political institutions. As a consequence, economic
institutions also started becoming more inclusive. Neither slavery nor
the severe economic restrictions of the feudal medieval period, such as
serfdom, existed in England at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
Nevertheless, there were many restrictions on economic activities people
could engage in. Both the domestic and international economy were choked
by monopolies. The state engaged in arbitrary taxation and manipulated
the legal system. Most land was caught in archaic forms of property
rights that made it impossible to sell and risky to invest in. This
changed after the Glorious Revolution. The government adopted a set of
economic institutions that provided incentives for investment, trade,
and innovation. It steadfastly enforced property rights, including
patents granting property rights for ideas, thereby providing a major
stimulus to innovation. It protected law and order. Historically
unprecedented was the application of English law to all citizens.
Arbitrary taxation ceased, and monopolies were abolished almost
completely. The English state aggressively promoted mercantile
activities and worked to promote domestic industry, not only by removing
barriers to the expansion of industrial activity but also by lending the
full power of the English navy to defend mercantile interests. By
rationalizing property rights, it facilitated the construction of
infrastructure, particularly roads, canals, and later railways, that
would prove to be crucial for industrial growth. These foundations
decisively changed incentives for people and impelled the engines of
prosperity, paving the way for the Industrial Revolution. First and
foremost, the Industrial Revolution depended on major technological
advances exploiting the knowledge base that had accumulated in Europe
during the past centuries. It was a radical break from the past, made
possible by scientific inquiry and the talents of a number of unique
individuals. The full force of this revolution came from the market that
created profitable opportunities for technologies to be developed and
applied. It was the inclusive nature of markets that allowed people to
allocate their talents to the right lines of business. It also relied on
education and skills, for it was the relatively high levels of
education, at least by the standards of the time, that enabled the
emergence of entrepreneurs with the vision to employ new technologies
for their businesses and to find workers with the skills to use them. It
is not a coincidence that the Industrial Revolution started in England a
few decades following the Glorious Revolution. The great inventors such
as James Watt (perfecter of the steam engine), Richard Trevithick (the
builder of the first steam locomotive), Richard Arkwright (the inventor
of the spinning frame), and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (the creator of
several revolutionary steamships) were able to take up the economic
opportunities generated by their ideas, were confident that their
property rights would be respected, and had access to markets where
their innovations could be profitably sold and used. In 1775, just after
he had the patent renewed on his steam engine, which he called his “Fire
engine,” James Watt wrote to his father:</p>
<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>After a series of various and violent Oppositions I have at last got
an Act of Parliament vesting the property of my new Fire engines in me
and my Assigns, throughout Great Britain the plantations for twenty five
years to come, which I hope will be very beneficial to me, as there is
already considerable demand for them.</p>
<p>This letter reveals two things. First, Watt was motivated by the
market opportunities he anticipated, by the “considerable demand” in
Great Britain and its plantations, the English overseas colonies.
Second, it shows how he was able to influence Parliament to get what he
wanted since it was responsive to the appeals of individuals and
innovators. The technological advances, the drive of businesses to
expand and invest, and the efficient use of skills and talent were all
made possible by the inclusive economic institutions that England
developed. These in turn were founded on her inclusive political
institutions. England developed these inclusive political institutions
because of two factors. First were political institutions, including a
centralized state, that enabled her to take the next radical—in fact,
unprecedented—step toward inclusive institutions with the onset of the
Glorious Revolution. While this factor distinguished England from much
of the world, it did not significantly differentiate it from Western
European countries such as France and Spain. More important was the
second factor. The events leading up to the Glorious Revolution forged a
broad and powerful coalition able to place durable constraints on the
power of the monarchy and the executive, which were forced to be open to
the demands of this coalition. This laid the foundations for pluralistic
political institutions, which then enabled the development of economic
institutions that would underpin the first Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>SMALL DIFFERENCES THAT MATTER</p>
<p>World inequality dramatically increased with the British, or English,
Industrial Revolution because only some parts of the world adopted the
innovations and new technologies that men such as Arkwright and Watt,
and the many who followed, developed. The response of different nations
to this wave of technologies, which determined whether they would
languish in poverty or achieve sustained economic growth, was largely
shaped by the different historical paths of their institutions. By the
middle of the eighteenth century, there were already notable differences
in political and economic institutions around the world. But where did
these differences come from?</p>
<p>English political institutions were on their way to much greater
pluralism by 1688, compared with those in France and Spain, but if we go
back in time one hundred years, to 1588, the differences shrink to
almost nothing. All three countries were ruled by relatively absolutist
monarchs: Elizabeth I in England, Philip II in Spain, and Henry II in
France. All were battling with assemblies of citizens—such as the
Parliament in England, the Cortes in Spain, and the Estates-General in
France—that were demanding more rights and control over the monarchy.
These assemblies all had somewhat different powers and scopes. For
instance, the English Parliament and the Spanish Cortes had power over
taxation, while the Estates-General did not. In Spain this mattered
little, because after 1492 the Spanish Crown had a vast American empire
and benefited massively from the gold and silver found there. In England
the situation was different. Elizabeth I was far less financially
independent, so she had to beg Parliament for more taxes. In exchange,
Parliament demanded concessions, in particular restrictions on the right
of Elizabeth to create monopolies. It was a conflict Parliament
gradually won. In Spain the Cortes lost a similar conflict. Trade wasn’t
just monopolized; it was monopolized by the Spanish monarchy. These
distinctions, which initially appeared small, started to matter a great
deal in the seventeenth century. Though the Americas had been discovered
by 1492 and Vasco da Gama had reached India by rounding the Cape of Good
Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, in 1498, it was only after 1600
that a huge expansion of world trade, particularly in the Atlantic,
started to take place. In 1585 the first English colonization of North
America began at Roanoke, in what is now North Carolina. In 1600 the
English East India Company was formed. In 1602 it was followed by the
Dutch equivalent. In 1607 the colony of Jamestown was founded by the
Virginia Company. By the 1620s the Caribbean was being colonized, with
Barbados occupied in 1627. France was also expanding in the Atlantic,
founding Quebec City in 1608 as the capital of New France in what is now
Canada. The consequences of this economic expansion for institutions
were very different for England than for Spain and France because of
small initial differences. Elizabeth I and her successors could not
monopolize the trade with the Americas. Other European monarchs could.
So while in England, Atlantic trade and colonization started creating a
large group of wealthy traders with few links to the Crown, this was not
the case in Spain or France. The English traders resented royal control
and demanded changes in political institutions and the restriction of
royal prerogatives. They played a critical role in the English Civil War
and the Glorious Revolution. Similar conflicts took place everywhere.
French kings, for example, faced the Fronde Rebellion between 1648 and
1652. The difference was that in England it was far more likely that the
opponents to absolutism would prevail because they were relatively
wealthy and more numerous than the opponents to absolutism in Spain and
France. The divergent paths of English, French, and Spanish societies in
the seventeenth century illustrate the importance of the interplay of
small institutional differences with critical junctures. During critical
junctures, a major event or confluence of factors disrupts the existing
balance of political or economic power in a nation. These can affect
only a single country, such as the death of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976,
which at first created a critical juncture only for Communist China.
Often, however, critical junctures affect a whole set of societies, in
the way that, for example, colonization and then decolonization affected
most of the globe. Such critical junctures are important because there
are formidable barriers against gradual improvements, resulting from the
synergy between extractive political and economic institutions and the
support they give each other. The persistence of this feedback loop
creates a vicious circle. Those who benefit from the status quo are
wealthy and well organized, and can effectively fight major changes that
will take away their economic privileges and political power. Once a
critical juncture happens, the small differences that matter are the
initial institutional differences that put in motion very different
responses. This is the reason why the relatively small institutional
differences in England, France, and Spain led to fundamentally different
development paths. The paths resulted from the critical juncture created
by the economic opportunities presented to Europeans by Atlantic trade.
Even if small institutional differences matter greatly during critical
junctures, not all institutional differences are small, and naturally,
larger institutional differences lead to even more divergent patterns
during such junctures. While the institutional differences between
England and France were small in 1588, the differences between Western
and Eastern Europe were much greater. In the West, strong centralized
states such as England, France, and Spain had latent constitutional
institutions (Parliament, the Estates-General, and the Cortes). There
were also underlying similarities in economic institutions, such as the
lack of serfdom. Eastern Europe was a different matter. The kingdom of
Poland-Lithuania, for example, was ruled by an elite class called the
Szlachta, who were so powerful they had even introduced elections for
kings. This was not absolute rule as in France under Louis XIV, the Sun
King, but absolutism of an elite, extractive political institutions all
the same. The Szlachta ruled over a mostly rural society dominated by
serfs, who had no freedom of movement or economic opportunities. Farther
east, the Russian emperor Peter the Great was also consolidating an
absolutism far more intense and extractive than even Louis XIV could
manage. Map 8 provides one simple way of seeing the extent of the
divergence between Western and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the
nineteenth century. It plots whether or not a country still had serfdom
in 1800. Countries that appear dark did; those that are light did not.
Eastern Europe is dark; Western Europe is light. Yet the institutions of
Western Europe had not always been so different from those in the East.
They began, as we saw earlier, to diverge in the fourteenth century when
the Black Death hit in 1346. There were small differences between
political and economic institutions in Western and Eastern Europe.
England and Hungary were even ruled by members of the same family, the
Angevins. The more important institutional differences that emerged
after the Black Death then created the background upon which the more
significant divergence between the East and the West would play out
during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. But where
do the small institutional differences that start this process of
divergence arise in the first place? Why did Eastern Europe have
different political and economic institutions than the West in the
fourteenth century? Why was the balance of power between Crown and
Parliament different in England than in France and Spain? As we will see
in the next chapter, even societies that are far less complex than our
modern society create political and economic institutions that have
powerful effects on the lives of their members. This is true even for
hunter-gatherers, as we know from surviving societies such as the San
people of modern Botswana, who do not farm or even live in permanent
settlements. No two societies create the same institutions; they will
have distinct customs, different systems of property rights, and
different ways of dividing a killed animal or loot stolen from another
group. Some will recognize the authority of elders, others will not;
some will achieve some degree of political centralization early on, but
not others. Societies are constantly subject to economic and political
conflict that is resolved in different ways because of specific
historical differences, the role of individuals, or just random factors.
These differences are often small to start with, but they cumulate,
creating a process of institutional drift. Just as two isolated
populations of organisms will drift apart slowly in a process of genetic
drift, because random genetic mutations cumulate, two otherwise similar
societies will also slowly drift apart institutionally. Though, just
like genetic drift, institutional drift has no predetermined path and
does not even need to be cumulative; over centuries it can lead to
perceptible, sometimes important differences. The differences created by
institutional drift become especially consequential, because they
influence how society reacts to changes in economic or political
circumstances during critical junctures. The richly divergent patterns
of economic development around the world hinge on the interplay of
critical junctures and institutional drift. Existing political and
economic institutions—sometimes shaped by a long process of
institutional drift and sometimes resulting from divergent responses to
prior critical junctures—create the anvil upon which future change will
be forged. The Black Death and the expansion of world trade after 1600
were both major critical junctures for European powers and interacted
with different initial institutions to create a major divergence.
Because in 1346 in Western Europe peasants had more power and autonomy
than they did in Eastern Europe, the Black Death led to the dissolution
of feudalism in the West and the Second Serfdom in the East. Because
Eastern and Western Europe had started to diverge in the fourteenth
century, the new economic opportunities of the seventeenth, eighteenth,
and nineteenth centuries would also have fundamentally different
implications for these different parts of Europe. Because in 1600 the
grip of the Crown was weaker in England than in France and Spain,
Atlantic trade opened the way to the creation of new institutions with
greater pluralism in England, while strengthening the French and Spanish
monarchs.</p>
<p>THE CONTINGENT PATH OF HISTORY</p>
<p>The outcomes of the events during critical junctures are shaped by
the weight of history, as existing economic and political institutions
shape the balance of power and delineate what is politically feasible.
The outcome, however, is not historically predetermined but contingent.
The exact path of institutional development during these periods depends
on which one of the opposing forces will succeed, which groups will be
able to form effective coalitions, and which leaders will be able to
structure events to their advantage. The role of contingency can be
illustrated by the origins of inclusive political institutions in
England. Not only was there nothing preordained in the victory of the
groups vying for limiting the power of the Crown and for more
pluralistic institutions in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, but the
entire path leading up to this political revolution was at the mercy of
contingent events. The victory of the winning groups was inexorably
linked to the critical juncture created by the rise of Atlantic trade
that enriched and emboldened merchants opposing the Crown. But a century
earlier it was far from obvious that England would have any ability to
dominate the seas, colonize many parts of the Caribbean and North
America, or capture so much of the lucrative trade with the Americas and
the East. Neither Elizabeth I nor other Tudor monarchs before her had
built a powerful, unified navy. The English navy relied on privateers
and independent merchant ships and was much less powerful than the
Spanish fleet. The profits of the Atlantic nonetheless attracted these
privateers, challenging the Spanish monopoly of the ocean. In 1588 the
Spanish decided to put an end to these challenges to their monopoly, as
well as to English meddling in the Spanish Netherlands, at the time
fighting against Spain for independence. The Spanish monarch Philip II
sent a powerful fleet, the Armada, commanded by the Duke of Medina
Sidonia. It appeared a foregone conclusion to many that the Spanish
would conclusively defeat the English, solidify their monopoly of the
Atlantic, and probably overthrow Elizabeth I, perhaps ultimately gaining
control of the British Isles. Yet something very different transpired.
Bad weather and strategic mistakes by Sidonia, who had been put in
charge at the last minute after a more experienced commander died, made
the Spanish Armada lose their advantage. Against all odds, the English
destroyed much of the fleet of their more powerful opponents. The
Atlantic seas were now open to the English on more equal terms. Without
this unlikely victory for the English, the events that would create the
transformative critical juncture and spawn the distinctively pluralistic
political institutions of post-1688 England would never have got moving.
Map 9 shows the trail of Spanish shipwrecks as the Armada was chased
right around the British Isles. Of course, nobody in 1588 could foresee
the consequences of the fortunate English victory. Few probably
understood at the time that this would create a critical juncture
leading up to a major political revolution a century later. There should
be no presumption that any critical juncture will lead to a successful
political revolution or to change for the better. History is full of
examples of revolutions and radical movements replacing one tyranny with
another, in a pattern that the German sociologist Robert Michels dubbed
the iron law of oligarchy, a particularly pernicious form of the vicious
circle. The end of colonialism in the decades following the Second World
War created critical junctures for many former colonies. However, in
most cases in sub-Saharan Africa and many in Asia, the postindependence
governments simply took a page out of Robert Michels’s book and repeated
and intensified the abuses of their predecessors, often severely
narrowing the distribution of political power, dismantling constraints,
and undermining the already meager incentives that economic institutions
provided for investment and economic progress. It was only in a few
cases, societies such as Botswana (see this page), that critical
junctures were used to launch a process of political and economic change
that paved the way for economic growth. Critical junctures can also
result in major change toward rather than away from extractive
institutions. Inclusive institutions, even though they have their own
feedback loop, the virtuous circle, can also reverse course and become
gradually more extractive because of challenges during critical
junctures—and whether this happens is, again, contingent. The Venetian
Republic, as we will see in chapter 6, made major strides toward
inclusive political and economic institutions in the medieval period.
But while such institutions became gradually stronger in England after
the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in Venice they ultimately transformed
themselves into extractive institutions under the control of a narrow
elite that monopolized both economic opportunities and political
power.</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING THE LAY OF THE LAND</p>
<p>The emergence of a market economy based on inclusive institutions and
sustained economic growth in eighteenth-century England sent ripples all
around the world, not least because it allowed England to colonize a
large part of it. But if the influence of English economic growth
certainly spread around the globe, the economic and political
institutions that created it did not automatically do so. The diffusion
of the Industrial Revolution had different effects on the world in the
same way that the Black Death had different effects on Western and
Eastern Europe, and in the same way that the expansion of Atlantic trade
had different effects in England and Spain. It was the institutions in
place in different parts of the world that determined the impact, and
these institutions were indeed different—small differences had been
amplified over time by prior critical junctures. These institutional
differences and their implications have tended to persist to the present
due to the vicious and virtuous circles, albeit imperfectly, and are the
key to understanding both how world inequality emerged and the nature of
the lay of the land around us. Some parts of the world developed
institutions that were very close to those in England, though by a very
different route. This was particularly true of some European “settler
colonies” such as Australia, Canada, and the United States, though their
institutions were just forming as the Industrial Revolution was getting
under way. As we saw in chapter 1, a process starting with the
foundation of the Jamestown colony in 1607 and culminating in the War of
Independence and the enactment of the U.S. Constitution shares many of
the same characteristics as the long struggle in England of Parliament
against the monarchy, for it also led to a centralized state with
pluralistic political institutions. The Industrial Revolution then
spread rapidly to such countries. Western Europe, experiencing many of
the same historical processes, had institutions similar to England at
the time of the Industrial Revolution. There were small but
consequential differences between England and the rest, which is why the
Industrial Revolution happened in England and not France. This
revolution then created an entirely new situation and considerably
different sets of challenges to European regimes, which in turn spawned
a new set of conflicts culminating in the French Revolution. The French
Revolution was another critical juncture that led the institutions of
Western Europe to converge with those of England, while Eastern Europe
diverged further. The rest of the world followed different institutional
trajectories. European colonization set the stage for institutional
divergence in the Americas, where in contrast to the inclusive
institutions developed in the United States and Canada extractive ones
emerged in Latin America, which explains the patterns of inequality we
see in the Americas. The extractive political and economic institutions
of the Spanish conquistadors in Latin America have endured, condemning
much of the region to poverty. Argentina and Chile have, however, fared
better than most other countries in the region. They had few indigenous
people or mineral riches and were “neglected” while the Spanish focused
on the lands occupied by the Aztec, Maya, and Incan civilizations. Not
coincidentally, the poorest part of Argentina is the northwest, the only
section of the country integrated into the Spanish colonial economy. Its
persistent poverty, the legacy of extractive institutions, is similar to
that created by the Potosí mita in Bolivia and Peru (this page–this
page). Africa was the part of the world with the institutions least able
to take advantage of the opportunities made available by the Industrial
Revolution. For at least the last one thousand years, outside of small
pockets and during limited periods of time, Africa has lagged behind the
rest of the world in terms of technology, political development, and
prosperity. It is the part of the world where centralized states formed
very late and very tenuously. Where they did form, they were likely as
highly absolutist as the Kongo and often short lived, usually
collapsing. Africa shares this trajectory of lack of state
centralization with countries such as Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nepal,
which have also failed to impose order over their territories and create
anything resembling stability to achieve even a modicum of economic
progress. Though located in very different parts of the world,
Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nepal have much in common institutionally with
most nations in sub-Saharan Africa, and are thus some of the poorest
countries in the world today. How African institutions evolved into
their present-day extractive form again illustrates the process of
institutional drift punctuated by critical junctures, but this time
often with highly perverse outcomes, particularly during the expansion
of the Atlantic slave trade. There were new economic opportunities for
the Kingdom of Kongo when European traders arrived. The long-distance
trade that transformed Europe also transformed the Kingdom of Kongo, but
again, initial institutional differences mattered. Kongolese absolutism
transmogrified from completely dominating society, with extractive
economic institutions that merely captured all the agricultural output
of its citizens, to enslaving people en masse and selling them to the
Portuguese in exchange for guns and luxury goods for the Kongolese
elite. The initial differences between England and Kongo meant that
while new long-distance trade opportunities created a critical juncture
toward pluralistic political institutions in the former, they also
extinguished any hope of absolutism being defeated in the Kongo. In much
of Africa the substantial profits to be had from slaving led not only to
its intensification and even more insecure property rights for the
people but also to intense warfare and the destruction of many existing
institutions; within a few centuries, any process of state
centralization was totally reversed, and many of the African states had
largely collapsed. Though some new, and sometimes powerful, states did
form to exploit the slave trade, they were based on warfare and plunder.
The critical juncture of the discovery of the Americas may have helped
England develop inclusive institutions but it made institutions in
Africa even more extractive. Though the slave trade mostly ended after
1807, subsequent European colonialism not only threw into reverse
nascent economic modernization in parts of southern and western Africa
but also cut off any possibility of indigenous institutional reform.
This meant that even outside of areas such as Congo, Madagascar,
Namibia, and Tanzania, the areas where plunder, mass disruption, and
even whole-scale murder were the rule, there was little chance for
Africa to change its institutional path. Even worse, the structures of
colonial rule left Africa with a more complex and pernicious
institutional legacy in the 1960s than at the start of the colonial
period. The development of the political and economic institutions in
many African colonies meant that rather than creating a critical
juncture for improvements in their institutions, independence created an
opening for unscrupulous leaders to take over and intensify the
extraction that European colonialists presided over. The political
incentives these structures created led to a style of politics that
reproduced the historical patterns of insecure and inefficient property
rights under states with strong absolutist tendencies but nonetheless
lacking any centralized authority over their territories. The Industrial
Revolution has still not spread to Africa because that continent has
experienced a long vicious circle of the persistence and re-creation of
extractive political and economic institutions. Botswana is the
exception. As we will see (this page–this page), in the nineteenth
century, King Khama, the grandfather of Botswana’s first prime minister
at independence, Seretse Khama, initiated institutional changes to
modernize the political and economic institutions of his tribe. Quite
uniquely, these changes were not destroyed in the colonial period,
partly as a consequence of Khama’s and other chiefs’ clever challenges
to colonial authority. Their interplay with the critical juncture that
independence from colonial rule created laid the foundations for
Botswana’s economic and political success. It was another case of small
historical differences mattering. There is a tendency to see historical
events as the inevitable consequences of deep-rooted forces. While we
place great emphasis on how the history of economic and political
institutions creates vicious and virtuous circles, contingency, as we
have emphasized in the context of the development of English
institutions, can always be a factor. Seretse Khama, studying in England
in the 1940s, fell in love with Ruth Williams, a white woman. As a
result, the racist apartheid regime in South Africa persuaded the
English government to ban him from the protectorate, then called
Bechuanaland (whose administration was under the High Commissioner of
South Africa), and he resigned his kingship. When he returned to lead
the anticolonial struggle, he did so with the intention not of
entrenching the traditional institutions but of adapting them to the
modern world. Khama was an extraordinary man, uninterested in personal
wealth and dedicated to building his country. Most other African
countries have not been so fortunate. Both things mattered, the
historical development of institutions in Botswana and contingent
factors that led these to be built on rather than overthrown or
distorted as they were elsewhere in Africa.</p>
<p>IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, absolutism not so different from that in
Africa or Eastern Europe was blocking the path of industrialization in
much of Asia. In China, the state was strongly absolutist, and
independent cities, merchants, and industrialists were either
nonexistent or much weaker politically. China was a major naval power
and heavily involved in long-distance trade centuries before the
Europeans. But it had turned away from the oceans just at the wrong
time, when Ming emperors decided in the late fourteenth and early
fifteenth centuries that increased long-distance trade and the creative
destruction that it might bring would be likely to threaten their rule.
In India, institutional drift worked differently and led to the
development of a uniquely rigid hereditary caste system that limited the
functioning of markets and the allocation of labor across occupations
much more severely than the feudal order in medieval Europe. It also
underpinned another strong form of absolutism under the Mughal rulers.
Most European countries had similar systems in the Middle Ages. Modern
Anglo-Saxon surnames such as Baker, Cooper, and Smith are direct
descendants of hereditary occupational categories. Bakers baked, coopers
made barrels, and smiths forged metals. But these categories were never
as rigid as Indian caste distinctions and gradually became meaningless
as predictors of a person’s occupation. Though Indian merchants did
trade throughout the Indian Ocean, and a major textile industry
developed, the caste system and Mughal absolutism were serious
impediments to the development of inclusive economic institutions in
India. By the nineteenth century, things were even less hospitable for
industrialization as India became an extractive colony of the English.
China was never formally colonized by a European power, but after the
English successfully defeated the Chinese in the Opium Wars between 1839
and 1842, and then again between 1856 and 1860, China had to sign a
series of humiliating treaties and allow European exports to enter. As
China, India, and others failed to take advantage of commercial and
industrial opportunities, Asia, except for Japan, lagged behind as
Western Europe was forging ahead.</p>
<p>THE COURSE OF institutional development that Japan charted in the
nineteenth century again illustrates the interaction between critical
junctures and small differences created by institutional drift. Japan,
like China, was under absolutist rule. The Tokugawa family took over in
1600 and ruled over a feudal system that also banned international
trade. Japan, too, faced a critical juncture created by Western
intervention as four U.S. warships, commanded by Matthew C. Perry,
entered Edo Bay in July 1853, demanding trade concessions similar to
those England obtained from the Chinese in the Opium Wars. But this
critical juncture played out very differently in Japan. Despite their
proximity and frequent interactions, by the nineteenth century China and
Japan had already drifted apart institutionally. While Tokugawa rule in
Japan was absolutist and extractive, it had only a tenuous hold on the
leaders of the other major feudal domains and was susceptible to
challenge. Even though there were peasant rebellions and civil strife,
absolutism in China was stronger, and the opposition less organized and
autonomous. There were no equivalents of the leaders of the other
domains in China who could challenge the absolutist rule of the emperor
and trace an alternative institutional path. This institutional
difference, in many ways small relative to the differences separating
China and Japan from Western Europe, had decisive consequences during
the critical juncture created by the forceful arrival of the English and
Americans. China continued in its absolutist path after the Opium Wars,
while the U.S. threat cemented the opposition to Tokugawa rule in Japan
and led to a political revolution, the Meiji Restoration, as we will see
in chapter 10. This Japanese political revolution enabled more inclusive
political institutions and much more inclusive economic institutions to
develop, and laid the foundations for subsequent rapid Japanese growth,
while China languished under absolutism. How Japan reacted to the threat
posed by U.S. warships, by starting a process of fundamental
institutional transformation, helps us understand another aspect of the
lay of the land around us: transitions from stagnation to rapid growth.
South Korea, Taiwan, and finally China achieved breakneck rates of
economic growth since the Second World War through a path similar to the
one that Japan took. In each of these cases, growth was preceded by
historic changes in the countries’ economic institutions—though not
always in their political institutions, as the Chinese case highlights.
The logic of how episodes of rapid growth come to an abrupt end and are
reversed is also related. In the same way that decisive steps toward
inclusive economic institutions can ignite rapid economic growth, a
sharp turn away from inclusive institutions can lead to economic
stagnation. But more often, collapses of rapid growth, such as in
Argentina or the Soviet Union, are a consequence of growth under
extractive institutions coming to an end. As we have seen, this can
happen either because of infighting over the spoils of extraction,
leading to the collapse of the regime, or because the inherent lack of
innovation and creative destruction under extractive institutions puts a
limit on sustained growth. How the Soviets ran hard into these limits
will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.</p>
<p>IF THE POLITICAL and economic institutions of Latin America over the
past five hundred years were shaped by Spanish colonialism, those of the
Middle East were shaped by Ottoman colonialism. In 1453 the Ottomans
under Sultan Mehmet II captured Constantinople, making it their capital.
During the rest of the century, the Ottomans conquered large parts of
the Balkans and most of the rest of Turkey. In the first half of the
sixteenth century, Ottoman rule spread throughout the Middle East and
North Africa. By 1566, at the death of Sultan Süleyman I, known as the
Magnificent, their empire stretched from Tunisia in the East, through
Egypt, all the way to Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula, and on to what is
now modern Iraq. The Ottoman state was absolutist, with the sultan
accountable to few and sharing power with none. The economic
institutions the Ottomans imposed were highly extractive. There was no
private property in land, which all formally belonged to the state.
Taxation of land and agricultural output, together with loot from war,
was the main source of government revenues. However, the Ottoman state
did not dominate the Middle East in the same way that it could dominate
its heartland in Anatolia or even to the extent that the Spanish state
dominated Latin American society. The Ottoman state was continuously
challenged by Bedouins and other tribal powers in the Arabian Peninsula.
It lacked not only the ability to impose a stable order in much of the
Middle East but also the administrative capacity to collect taxes. So it
“farmed” them out to individuals, selling off the right to others to
collect taxes in whatever way they could. These tax farmers became
autonomous and powerful. Rates of taxation in the Middle Eastern
territories were very high, varying between one-half or two-thirds of
what farmers produced. Much of this revenue was kept by the tax farmers.
Because the Ottoman state failed to establish a stable order in these
areas, property rights were far from secure, and there was a great deal
of lawlessness and banditry as armed groups vied for local control. In
Palestine, for example, the situation was so dire that starting in the
late sixteenth century, peasants left the most fertile land and moved up
to mountainous areas, which gave them greater protection against
banditry. Extractive economic institutions in the urban areas of the
Ottoman Empire were no less stifling. Commerce was under state control,
and occupations were strictly regulated by guilds and monopolies. The
consequence was that at the time of the Industrial Revolution the
economic institutions of the Middle East were extractive. The region
stagnated economically. By the 1840s, the Ottomans were trying to reform
institutions—for example, by reversing tax farming and getting locally
autonomous groups under control. But absolutism persisted until the
First World War, and reform efforts were thwarted by the usual fear of
creative destruction and the anxiety among elite groups that they would
lose economically or politically. While Ottoman reformers talked of
introducing private property rights to land in order to increase
agricultural productivity, the status quo persisted because of the
desire for political control and taxation. Ottoman colonization was
followed by European colonization after 1918. When European control
ended, the same dynamics we have seen in sub-Saharan Africa took hold,
with extractive colonial institutions taken over by independent elites.
In some cases, such as the monarchy of Jordan, these elites were direct
creations of the colonial powers, but this, too, happened frequently in
Africa, as we will see. Middle Eastern countries without oil today have
income levels similar to poor Latin American nations. They did not
suffer from such immiserizing forces as the slave trade, and they
benefited for a longer period from flows of technology from Europe. In
the Middle Ages, the Middle East itself was also a relatively advanced
part of the world economically. So today it is not as poor as Africa,
but the majority of its people still live in poverty. WE HAVE SEEN that
neither geographic- nor cultural- nor ignorance-based theories are
helpful for explaining the lay of the land around us. They do not
provide a satisfactory account for the prominent patterns of world
inequality: the fact that the process of economic divergence started
with the Industrial Revolution in England during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and then spread to Western Europe and to European
settler colonies; the persistent divergence between different parts of
the Americas; the poverty of Africa or the Middle East; the divergence
between Eastern and Western Europe; and the transitions from stagnation
to growth and the sometimes abrupt end to growth spurts. Our
institutional theory does. In the remaining chapters, we will discuss in
greater detail how this institutional theory works and illustrate the
wide range of phenomena it can account for. These range from the origins
of the Neolithic Revolution to the collapse of several civilizations,
either because of the intrinsic limits to growth under extractive
institutions or because of limited steps toward inclusiveness being
reversed. We will see how and why decisive steps toward inclusive
political institutions were taken during the Glorious Revolution in
England. We will look more specifically at the following:</p>
<p>• How inclusive institutions emerged from the interplay of the
critical juncture created by Atlantic trade and the nature of
preexisting English institutions. • How these institutions persisted and
became strengthened to lay the foundations for the Industrial
Revolution, thanks in part to the virtuous circle and in part to
fortunate turns of contingency. • How many regimes reigning over
absolutist and extractive institutions steadfastly resisted the spread
of new technologies unleashed by the Industrial Revolution. • How
Europeans themselves stamped out the possibility of economic growth in
many parts of the world that they conquered. • How the vicious circle
and the iron law of oligarchy have created a powerful tendency for
extractive institutions to persist, and thus the lands where the
Industrial Revolution originally did not spread remain relatively poor.
• Why the Industrial Revolution and other new technologies have not
spread and are unlikely to spread to places around the world today where
a minimum degree of centralization of the state hasn’t been achieved.
Our discussion will also show that certain areas that managed to
transform institutions in a more inclusive direction, such as France or
Japan, or that prevented the establishment of extractive institutions,
such as the United States or Australia, were more receptive to the
spread of the Industrial Revolution and pulled ahead of the rest. As in
England, this was not always a smooth process, and along the way, many
challenges to inclusive institutions were overcome, sometimes because of
the dynamics of the virtuous circle, sometimes thanks to the contingent
path of history. Finally, we will also discuss how the failure of
nations today is heavily influenced by their institutional histories,
how much policy advice is informed by incorrect hypotheses and is
potentially misleading, and how nations are still able to seize critical
junctures and break the mold to reform their institutions and embark
upon a path to greater prosperity.</p>
