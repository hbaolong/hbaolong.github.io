<h4 id="so-close-and-yet-so-different">1. SO CLOSE AND YET SO
DIFFERENT</h4>
<p>THE ECONOMICS OF THE RIO GRANDE</p>
<p>THE CITY OF NOGALES is cut in half by a fence. If you stand by it and
look north, you’ll see Nogales, Arizona, located in Santa Cruz County.
The income of the average household there is about 0,000 a year. Most
teenagers are in school, and the majority of the adults are high school
graduates. Despite all the arguments people make about how deficient the
U.S. health care system is, the population is relatively healthy, with
high life expectancy by global standards. Many of the residents are
above age sixty-five and have access to Medicare. It’s just one of the
many services the government provides that most take for granted, such
as electricity, telephones, a sewage system, public health, a road
network linking them to other cities in the area and to the rest of the
United States, and, last but not least, law and order. The people of
Nogales, Arizona, can go about their daily activities without fear for
life or safety and not constantly afraid of theft, expropriation, or
other things that might jeopardize their investments in their businesses
and houses. Equally important, the residents of Nogales, Arizona, take
it for granted that, with all its inefficiency and occasional
corruption, the government is their agent. They can vote to replace
their mayor, congressmen, and senators; they vote in the presidential
elections that determine who will lead their country. Democracy is
second nature to them. Life south of the fence, just a few feet away, is
rather different. While the residents of Nogales, Sonora, live in a
relatively prosperous part of Mexico, the income of the average
household there is about one-third that in Nogales, Arizona. Most adults
in Nogales, Sonora, do not have a high school degree, and many teenagers
are not in school. Mothers have to worry about high rates of infant
mortality. Poor public health conditions mean it’s no surprise that the
residents of Nogales, Sonora, do not live as long as their northern
neighbors. They also don’t have access to many public amenities. Roads
are in bad condition south of the fence. Law and order is in worse
condition. Crime is high, and opening a business is a risky activity.
Not only do you risk robbery, but getting all the permissions and
greasing all the palms just to open is no easy endeavor. Residents of
Nogales, Sonora, live with politicians’ corruption and ineptitude every
day. In contrast to their northern neighbors, democracy is a very recent
experience for them. Until the political reforms of 2000, Nogales,
Sonora, just like the rest of Mexico, was under the corrupt control of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or Partido Revolucionario
Institucional (PRI). How could the two halves of what is essentially the
same city be so different? There is no difference in geography, climate,
or the types of diseases prevalent in the area, since germs do not face
any restrictions crossing back and forth between the United States and
Mexico. Of course, health conditions are very different, but this has
nothing to do with the disease environment; it is because the people
south of the border live with inferior sanitary conditions and lack
decent health care. But perhaps the residents are very different. Could
it be that the residents of Nogales, Arizona, are grandchildren of
migrants from Europe, while those in the south are descendants of
Aztecs? Not so. The backgrounds of people on both sides of the border
are quite similar. After Mexico became independent from Spain in 1821,
the area around “Los dos Nogales” was part of the Mexican state of Vieja
California and remained so even after the Mexican-American War of
1846–1848. Indeed, it was only after the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 that
the U.S. border was extended into this area. It was Lieutenant N.
Michler who, while surveying the border, noted the presence of the
“pretty little valley of Los Nogales.” Here, on either side of the
border, the two cities rose up. The inhabitants of Nogales, Arizona, and
Nogales, Sonora, share ancestors, enjoy the same food and the same
music, and, we would hazard to say, have the same “culture.”</p>
<p>Of course, there is a very simple and obvious explanation for the
differences between the two halves of Nogales that you’ve probably long
since guessed: the very border that defines the two halves. Nogales,
Arizona, is in the United States. Its inhabitants have access to the
economic institutions of the United States, which enable them to choose
their occupations freely, acquire schooling and skills, and encourage
their employers to invest in the best technology, which leads to higher
wages for them. They also have access to political institutions that
allow them to take part in the democratic process, to elect their
representatives, and replace them if they misbehave. In consequence,
politicians provide the basic services (ranging from public health to
roads to law and order) that the citizens demand. Those of Nogales,
Sonora, are not so lucky. They live in a different world shaped by
different institutions. These different institutions create very
disparate incentives for the inhabitants of the two Nogaleses and for
the entrepreneurs and businesses willing to invest there. These
incentives created by the different institutions of the Nogaleses and
the countries in which they are situated are the main reason for the
differences in economic prosperity on the two sides of the border. Why
are the institutions of the United States so much more conducive to
economic success than those of Mexico or, for that matter, the rest of
Latin America? The answer to this question lies in the way the different
societies formed during the early colonial period. An institutional
divergence took place then, with implications lasting into the present
day. To understand this divergence we must begin right at the foundation
of the colonies in North and Latin America.</p>
<p>THE FOUNDING OF BUENOS AIRES</p>
<p>Early in 1516 the Spanish navigator Juan Díaz de Solís sailed into a
wide estuary on the Eastern Seaboard of South America. Wading ashore, de
Solís claimed the land for Spain, naming the river the Río de la Plata,
“River of Silver,” since the local people possessed silver. The
indigenous peoples on either side of the estuary—the Charrúas in what is
now Uruguay, and the Querandí on the plains that were to be known as the
Pampas in modern Argentina—regarded the newcomers with hostility. These
locals were hunter-gatherers who lived in small groups without strong
centralized political authorities. Indeed it was such a band of Charrúas
who clubbed de Solís to death as he explored the new domains he had
attemped to occupy for Spain. In 1534 the Spanish, still optimistic,
sent out a first mission of settlers from Spain under the leadership of
Pedro de Mendoza. They founded a town on the site of Buenos Aires in the
same year. It should have been an ideal place for Europeans. Buenos
Aires, literally meaning “good airs,” had a hospitable, temperate
climate. Yet the first stay of the Spaniards there was short lived. They
were not after good airs, but resources to extract and labor to coerce.
The Charrúas and the Querandí were not obliging, however. They refused
to provide food to the Spaniards, and refused to work when caught. They
attacked the new settlement with their bows and arrows. The Spaniards
grew hungry, since they had not anticipated having to provide food for
themselves. Buenos Aires was not what they had dreamed of. The local
people could not be forced into providing labor. The area had no silver
or gold to exploit, and the silver that de Solís found had actually come
all the way from the Inca state in the Andes, far to the west. The
Spaniards, while trying to survive, started sending out expeditions to
find a new place that would offer greater riches and populations easier
to coerce. In 1537 one of these expeditions, under the leadership of
Juan de Ayolas, penetrated up the Paraná River, searching for a route to
the Incas. On its way, it made contact with the Guaraní, a sedentary
people with an agricultural economy based on maize and cassava. De
Ayolas immediately realized that the Guaraní were a completely different
proposition from the Charrúas and the Querandí. After a brief conflict,
the Spanish overcame Guaraní resistance and founded a town, Nuestra
Señora de Santa María de la Asunción, which remains the capital of
Paraguay today. The conquistadors married the Guaraní princesses and
quickly set themselves up as a new aristocracy. They adapted the
existing systems of forced labor and tribute of the Guaraní, with
themselves at the helm. This was the kind of colony they wanted to set
up, and within four years Buenos Aires was abandoned as all the
Spaniards who’d settled there moved to the new town. Buenos Aires, the
“Paris of South America,” a city of wide European-style boulevards based
on the great agricultural wealth of the Pampas, was not resettled until
1580. The abandonment of Buenos Aires and the conquest of the Guaraní
reveals the logic of European colonization of the Americas. Early
Spanish and, as we will see, English colonists were not interested in
tilling the soil themselves; they wanted others to do it for them, and
they wanted riches, gold and silver, to plunder.</p>
<p>FROM CAJAMARCA …</p>
<p>The expeditions of de Solís, de Mendoza, and de Ayolas came in the
wake of more famous ones that followed Christopher Columbus’s sighting
of one of the islands of the Bahamas on October 12, 1492. Spanish
expansion and colonization of the Americas began in earnest with the
invasion of Mexico by Hernán Cortés in 1519, the expedition of Francisco
Pizarro to Peru a decade and a half later, and the expedition of Pedro
de Mendoza to the Río de la Plata just two years after that. Over the
next century, Spain conquered and colonized most of central, western,
and southern South America, while Portugal claimed Brazil to the east.
The Spanish strategy of colonization was highly effective. First
perfected by Cortés in Mexico, it was based on the observation that the
best way for the Spanish to subdue opposition was to capture the
indigenous leader. This strategy enabled the Spanish to claim the
accumulated wealth of the leader and coerce the indigenous peoples to
give tribute and food. The next step was setting themselves up as the
new elite of the indigenous society and taking control of the existing
methods of taxation, tribute, and, particularly, forced labor. When
Cortés and his men arrived at the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan on
November 8, 1519, they were welcomed by Moctezuma, the Aztec emperor,
who had decided, in the face of much advice from his counselors, to
welcome the Spaniards peacefully. What happened next is well described
by the account compiled after 1545 by the Franciscan priest Bernardino
de Sahagún in his famous Florentine Codices. 〔At〕 once they 〔the
Spanish〕 firmly seized Moctezuma … then each of the guns shot off …
Fear prevailed. It was as if everyone had swallowed his heart. Even
before it had grown dark, there was terror, there was astonishment,
there was apprehension, there was a stunning of the people.</p>
<p>And when it dawned thereupon were proclaimed all the things which
〔the Spaniards〕 required: white tortillas, roasted turkey hens, eggs,
fresh water, wood, firewood, charcoal … This had Moctezuma indeed
commanded.</p>
<p>And when the Spaniards were well settled, they thereupon inquired of
Moctezuma as to all the city’s treasure … with great zeal they sought
gold. And Moctezuma thereupon went leading the Spaniards. They went
surrounding him … each holding him, each grasping him.</p>
<p>And when they reached the storehouse, a place called Teocalco,
thereupon they brought forth all the brilliant things; the quetzal
feather head fan, the devices, the shields, the golden discs … the
golden nose crescents, the golden leg bands, the golden arm bands, the
golden forehead bands.</p>
<p>Thereupon was detached the gold … at once they ignited, set fire to …
all the precious things. They all burned. And the gold the Spaniards
formed into separate bars … And the Spanish walked everywhere … They
took all, all that they saw which they saw to be good.</p>
<p>Thereupon they went to Moctezuma’s own storehouse … at the place
called Totocalco … they brought forth 〔Moctezuma’s〕 own property …
precious things all; the necklaces with pendants, the arm bands with
tufts of quetzal feathers, the golden arm bands, the bracelets, the
golden bands with shells … and the turquoise diadem, the attribute of
the ruler. They took it all.</p>
<p>The military conquest of the Aztecs was completed by 1521. Cortés, as
governor of the province of New Spain, then began dividing up the most
valuable resource, the indigenous population, through the institution of
the encomienda. The encomienda had first appeared in fifteenth-century
Spain as part of the reconquest of the south of the country from the
Moors, Arabs who had settled during and after the eighth century. In the
New World, it took on a much more pernicious form: it was a grant of
indigenous peoples to a Spaniard, known as the encomendero. The
indigenous peoples had to give the encomendero tribute and labor
services, in exchange for which the encomendero was charged with
converting them to Christianity. A vivid early account of the workings
of the encomienda has come down to us from Bartolomé de las Casas, a
Dominican priest who formulated the earliest and one of the most
devastating critiques of the Spanish colonial system. De las Casas
arrived on the Spanish island of Hispaniola in 1502 with a fleet of
ships led by the new governor, Nicolás de Ovando. He became increasingly
disillusioned and disturbed by the cruel and exploitative treatment of
the indigenous peoples he witnessed every day. In 1513 he took part as a
chaplain in the Spanish conquest of Cuba, even being granted an
encomienda for his service. However, he renounced the grant and began a
long campaign to reform Spanish colonial institutions. His efforts
culminated in his book A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies,
written in 1542, a withering attack on the barbarity of Spanish rule. On
the encomienda he has this to say in the case of Nicaragua:</p>
<p>Each of the settlers took up residence in the town allotted to him
(or encommended to him, as the legal phrase has it), put the inhabitants
to work for him, stole their already scarce foodstuffs for himself and
took over the lands owned and worked by the natives and on which they
traditionally grew their own produce. The settler would treat the whole
of the native population—dignitaries, old men, women and children—as
members of his household and, as such, make them labor night and day in
his own interests, without any rest whatsoever.</p>
<p>For the conquest of New Granada, modern Colombia, de las Casas
reports the whole Spanish strategy in action:</p>
<p>To realize their long-term purpose of seizing all the available gold,
the Spaniards employed their usual strategy of apportioning among
themselves (or en-commending, as they have it) the towns and their
inhabitants … and then, as ever, treating them as common slaves. The man
in overall command of the expedition seized the King of the whole
territory for himself and held him prisoner for six or seven months,
quite illicitly demanding more and more gold and emeralds from him. This
King, one Bogotá, was so terrified that, in his anxiety to free himself
from the clutches of his tormentors, he consented to the demand that he
fill an entire house with gold and hand it over; to this end he sent his
people off in search of gold, and bit by bit they brought it along with
many precious stones. But still the house was not filled and the
Spaniards eventually declared that they would put him to death for
breaking his promise. The commander suggested they should bring the case
before him, as a representative of the law, and when they did so,
entering formal accusations against the King, he sentenced him to
torture should he persist in not honoring the bargain. They tortured him
with the strappado, put burning tallow on his belly, pinned both his
legs to poles with iron hoops and his neck with another and then, with
two men holding his hands, proceeded to burn the soles of his feet. From
time to time, the commander would look in and repeat that they would
torture him to death slowly unless he produced more gold, and this is
what they did, the King eventually succumbing to the agonies they
inflicted on him.</p>
<p>The strategy and institutions of conquest perfected in Mexico were
eagerly adopted elsewhere in the Spanish Empire. Nowhere was this done
more effectively than in Pizarro’s conquest of Peru. As de las Casas
begins his account:</p>
<p>In 1531 another great villain journeyed with a number of men to the
kingdom of Peru. He set out with every intention of imitating the
strategy and tactics of his fellow adventurers in other parts of the New
World.</p>
<p>Pizarro began on the coast near the Peruvian town of Tumbes and
marched south. On November 15, 1532, he reached the mountain town of
Cajamarca, where the Inca emperor Atahualpa was encamped with his army.
The next day, Atahualpa, who had just vanquished his brother Huáscar in
a contest over who would succeed their deceased father, Huayna Capac,
came with his retinue to where the Spanish were camped. Atahualpa was
irritated because news of atrocities that the Spanish had already
committed, such as violating a temple of the Sun God Inti, had reached
him. What transpired next is well known. The Spanish laid a trap and
sprang it. They killed Atahualpa’s guards and retainers, possibly as
many as two thousand people, and captured the king. To gain his freedom,
Atahualpa had to promise to fill one room with gold and two more of the
same size with silver. He did this, but the Spanish, reneging on their
promises, strangled him in July 1533. That November, the Spanish
captured the Inca capital of Cusco, where the Incan aristocracy received
the same treatment as Atahualpa, being imprisoned until they produced
gold and silver. When they did not satisfy Spanish demands, they were
burned alive. The great artistic treasures of Cusco, such as the Temple
of the Sun, had their gold stripped from them and melted down into
ingots. At this point the Spanish focused on the people of the Inca
Empire. As in Mexico, citizens were divided into encomiendas, with one
going to each of the conquistadors who had accompanied Pizarro. The
encomienda was the main institution used for the control and
organization of labor in the early colonial period, but it soon faced a
vigorous contender. In 1545 a local named Diego Gualpa was searching for
an indigenous shrine high in the Andes in what is today Bolivia. He was
thrown to the ground by a sudden gust of wind and in front of him
appeared a cache of silver ore. This was part of a vast mountain of
silver, which the Spanish baptized El Cerro Rico, “The Rich Hill.”
Around it grew the city of Potosí, which at its height in 1650 had a
population of 160,000 people, larger than Lisbon or Venice in this
period. To exploit the silver, the Spanish needed miners—a lot of
miners. They sent a new viceroy, the chief Spanish colonial official,
Francisco de Toledo, whose main mission was to solve the labor problem.
De Toledo, arriving in Peru in 1569, first spent five years traveling
around and investigating his new charge. He also commissioned a massive
survey of the entire adult population. To find the labor he needed, de
Toledo first moved almost the entire indigenous population,
concentrating them in new towns called reducciones—literally
“reductions”—which would facilitate the exploitation of labor by the
Spanish Crown. Then he revived and adapted an Inca labor institution
known as the mita, which, in the Incas’ language, Quechua, means “a
turn.” Under their mita system, the Incas had used forced labor to run
plantations designed to provide food for temples, the aristocracy, and
the army. In return, the Inca elite provided famine relief and security.
In de Toledo’s hands the mita, especially the Potosí mita, was to become
the largest and most onerous scheme of labor exploitation in the Spanish
colonial period. De Toledo defined a huge catchment area, running from
the middle of modern-day Peru and encompassing most of modern Bolivia.
It covered about two hundred thousand square miles. In this area,
one-seventh of the male inhabitants, newly arrived in their reducciones,
were required to work in the mines at Potosí. The Potosí mita endured
throughout the entire colonial period and was abolished only in 1825.
Map 1 shows the catchment area of the mita superimposed on the extent of
the Inca empire at the time of the Spanish conquest. It illustrates the
extent to which the mita overlapped with the heartland of the empire,
encompassing the capital Cusco. Remarkably, you still see the legacy of
the mita in Peru today. Take the differences between the provinces of
Calca and nearby Acomayo. There appears to be few differences among
these provinces. Both are high in the mountains, and each is inhabited
by the Quechua-speaking descendants of the Incas. Yet Acomayo is much
poorer, with its inhabitants consuming about one-third less than those
in Calca. The people know this. In Acomayo they ask intrepid foreigners,
“Don’t you know that the people here are poorer than the people over
there in Calca? Why would you ever want to come here?” Intrepid because
it is much harder to get to Acomayo from the regional capital of Cusco,
ancient center of the Inca Empire, than it is to get to Calca. The road
to Calca is surfaced, the one to Acomayo is in a terrible state of
disrepair. To get beyond Acomayo, you need a horse or a mule. In Calca
and Acomayo, people grow the same crops, but in Calca they sell them on
the market for money. In Acomayo they grow food for their own
subsistence. These inequalities, apparent to the eye and to the people
who live there, can be understood in terms of the institutional
differences between these departments—institutional differences with
historical roots going back to de Toledo and his plan for effective
exploitation of indigenous labor. The major historical difference
between Acomayo and Calca is that Acomayo was in the catchment area of
the Potosí mita. Calca was not. In addition to the concentration of
labor and the mita, de Toledo consolidated the encomienda into a head
tax, a fixed sum payable by each adult male every year in silver. This
was another scheme designed to force people into the labor market and
reduce wages for Spanish landowners. Another institution, the
repartimiento de mercancias, also became widespread during de Toledo’s
tenure. Derived from the Spanish verb repartir, to distribute, this
repartimiento, literally “the distribution of goods,” involved the
forced sale of goods to locals at prices determined by Spaniards.
Finally, de Toledo introduced the trajin—meaning, literally, “the
burden”—which used the indigenous people to carry heavy loads of goods,
such as wine or coca leaves or textiles, as a substitute for pack
animals, for the business ventures of the Spanish elite. Throughout the
Spanish colonial world in the Americas, similar institutions and social
structures emerged. After an initial phase of looting, and gold and
silver lust, the Spanish created a web of institutions designed to
exploit the indigenous peoples. The full gamut of encomienda, mita,
repartimiento, and trajin was designed to force indigenous people’s
living standards down to a subsistence level and thus extract all income
in excess of this for Spaniards. This was achieved by expropriating
their land, forcing them to work, offering low wages for labor services,
imposing high taxes, and charging high prices for goods that were not
even voluntarily bought. Though these institutions generated a lot of
wealth for the Spanish Crown and made the conquistadors and their
descendants very rich, they also turned Latin America into the most
unequal continent in the world and sapped much of its economic
potential.</p>

<p>As the Spanish began their conquest of the Americas in the 1490s,
England was a minor European power recovering from the devastating
effects of a civil war, the Wars of the Roses. She was in no state to
take advantage of the scramble for loot and gold and the opportunity to
exploit the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Nearly one hundred years
later, in 1588, the lucky rout of the Spanish Armada, an attempt by King
Philip II of Spain to invade England, sent political shockwaves around
Europe. Fortunate though England’s victory was, it was also a sign of
growing English assertiveness on the seas that would enable them to
finally take part in the quest for colonial empire. It is thus no
coincidence that the English began their colonization of North America
at exactly the same time. But they were already latecomers. They chose
North America not because it was attractive, but because it was all that
was available. The “desirable” parts of the Americas, where the
indigenous population to exploit was plentiful and where the gold and
silver mines were located, had already been occupied. The English got
the leftovers. When the eighteenth-century English writer and
agriculturalist Arthur Young discussed where profitable “staple
products,” by which he meant exportable agricultural goods, were
produced, he noted:</p>
<p>It appears upon the whole, that the staple productions of our
colonies decrease in value in proportion to their distance from the sun.
In the West Indies, which are the hottest of all, they make to the
amount of 8l. 12s. 1d. per head. In the southern continental ones, to
the amount of 5l. 10s. In the central ones, to the amount of 9s. 6 1/2d.
In the northern settlements, to that of 2s. 6d. This scale surely
suggests a most important lesson—to avoid colonizing in northern
latitudes.</p>
<p>The first English attempt to plant a colony, at Roanoke, in North
Carolina, between 1585 and 1587, was a complete failure. In 1607 they
tried again. Shortly before the end of 1606, three vessels, Susan
Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery, under the command of Captain
Christopher Newport, set off for Virginia. The colonists, under the
auspices of the Virginia Company, sailed into Chesapeake Bay and up a
river they named the James, after the ruling English monarch, James I.
On May 14, 1607, they founded the settlement of Jamestown. Though the
settlers on board the ships owned by the Virginia Company were English,
they had a model of colonization heavily influenced by the template set
up by Cortés, Pizarro, and de Toledo. Their first plan was to capture
the local chief and use him as a way to get provisions and to coerce the
population into producing food and wealth for them. When they first
landed in Jamestown, the English colonists did not know that they were
within the territory claimed by the Powhatan Confederacy, a coalition of
some thirty polities owing allegiance to a king called Wahunsunacock.
Wahunsunacock’s capital was at the town of Werowocomoco, a mere twenty
miles from Jamestown. The plan of the colonists was to learn more about
the lay of the land. If the locals could not be induced to provide food
and labor, the colonists might at least be able to trade with them. The
notion that the settlers themselves would work and grow their own food
seems not to have crossed their minds. That is not what conquerors of
the New World did. Wahunsunacock quickly became aware of the colonists’
presence and viewed their intentions with great suspicion. He was in
charge of what for North America was quite a large empire. But he had
many enemies and lacked the overwhelming centralized political control
of the Incas. Wahunsunacock decided to see what the intentions of the
English were, initially sending messengers saying that he desired
friendly relations with them. As the winter of 1607 closed in, the
settlers in Jamestown began to run low on food, and the appointed leader
of the colony’s ruling council, Edward Marie Wingfield, dithered
indecisively. The situation was rescued by Captain John Smith. Smith,
whose writings provide one of our main sources of information about the
early development of the colony, was a larger-than-life character. Born
in England, in rural Lincolnshire, he disregarded his father’s desires
for him to go into business and instead became a soldier of fortune. He
first fought with English armies in the Netherlands, after which he
joined Austrian forces serving in Hungary fighting against the armies of
the Ottoman Empire. Captured in Romania, he was sold as a slave and put
to work as a field hand. He managed one day to overcome his master and,
stealing his clothes and his horse, escape back into Austrian territory.
Smith had got himself into trouble on the voyage to Virginia and was
imprisoned on the Susan Constant for mutiny after defying the orders of
Wingfield. When the ships reached the New World, the plan was to put him
on trial. To the immense horror of Wingfield, Newport, and other elite
colonists, however, when they opened their sealed orders, they
discovered that the Virginia Company had nominated Smith to be a member
of the ruling council that was to govern Jamestown. With Newport sailing
back to England for supplies and more colonists, and Wingfield uncertain
about what to do, it was Smith who saved the colony. He initiated a
series of trading missions that secured vital food supplies. On one of
these he was captured by Opechancanough, one of Wahunsunacock’s younger
brothers, and was brought before the king at Werowocomoco. He was the
first Englishman to meet Wahunsunacock, and it was at this initial
meeting that according to some accounts Smith’s life was saved only at
the intervention of Wahunsunacock’s young daughter Pocahontas. Freed on
January 2, 1608, Smith returned to Jamestown, which was still perilously
low on food, until the timely return of Newport from England later on
the same day. The colonists of Jamestown learned little from this
initial experience. As 1608 proceeded, they continued their quest for
gold and precious metals. They still did not seem to understand that to
survive, they could not rely on the locals to feed them through either
coercion or trade. It was Smith who was the first to realize that the
model of colonization that had worked so well for Cortés and Pizarro
simply would not work in North America. The underlying circumstances
were just too different. Smith noted that, unlike the Aztecs and Incas,
the peoples of Virginia did not have gold. Indeed, he noted in his
diary, “Victuals you must know is all their wealth.” Anas Todkill, one
of the early settlers who left an extensive diary, expressed well the
frustrations of Smith and the few others on which this recognition
dawned:</p>
<p>“There was no talke, no hope, no worke, but dig gold, refine gold,
load gold.”</p>
<p>When Newport sailed for England in April 1608 he took a cargo of
pyrite, fool’s gold. He returned at the end of September with orders
from the Virginia Company to take firmer control over the locals. Their
plan was to crown Wahunsunacock, hoping this would render him
subservient to the English king James I. They invited him to Jamestown,
but Wahunsunacock, still deeply suspicious of the colonists, had no
intention of risking capture. John Smith recorded Wahunsunacock’s reply:
“If your King have sent me presents, I also am a King, and this is my
land … Your father is to come to me, not I to him, nor yet to your fort,
neither will I bite at such a bait.”</p>
<p>If Wahunsunacock would not “bite at such a bait,” Newport and Smith
would have to go to Werowocomoco to undertake the coronation. The whole
event appears to have been a complete fiasco, with the only thing coming
out of it a resolve on the part of Wahunsunacock that it was time to get
rid of the colony. He imposed a trade embargo. Jamestown could no longer
trade for supplies. Wahunsunacock would starve them out. Newport set
sail once more for England, in December 1608. He took with him a letter
written by Smith pleading with the directors of the Virginia Company to
change the way they thought about the colony. There was no possibility
of a get-rich-quick exploitation of Virginia along the lines of Mexico
and Peru. There were no gold or precious metals, and the indigenous
people could not be forced to work or provide food. Smith realized that
if there were going to be a viable colony, it was the colonists who
would have to work. He therefore pleaded with the directors to send the
right sort of people: “When you send againe I entreat you rather to send
some thirty carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths,
masons, and diggers up of trees, roots, well provided, then a thousand
of such as we have.”</p>
<p>Smith did not want any more useless goldsmiths. Once more Jamestown
survived only because of his resourcefulness. He managed to cajole and
bully local indigenous groups to trade with him, and when they wouldn’t,
he took what he could. Back in the settlement, Smith was completely in
charge and imposed the rule that “he that will not worke shall not eat.”
Jamestown survived a second winter. The Virginia Company was intended to
be a moneymaking enterprise, and after two disastrous years, there was
no whiff of profit. The directors of the company decided that they
needed a new model of governance, replacing the ruling council with a
single governor. The first man appointed to this position was Sir Thomas
Gates. Heeding some aspects of Smith’s warning, the company realized
that they had to try something new. This realization was driven home by
the events of the winter of 1609/1610—the so-called “starving time.” The
new mode of governance left no room for Smith, who, disgruntled,
returned to England in the autumn of 1609. Without his resourcefulness,
and with Wahunsunacock throttling the food supply, the colonists in
Jamestown perished. Of the five hundred who entered the winter, only
sixty were alive by March. The situation was so desperate that they
resorted to cannibalism. The “something new” that was imposed on the
colony by Gates and his deputy, Sir Thomas Dale, was a work regime of
draconian severity for English settlers—though not of course for the
elite running the colony. It was Dale who propagated the “Lawes Divine,
Morall and Martiall.” This included the clauses</p>
<p>No man or woman shall run away from the colony to the Indians, upon
pain of death. Anyone who robs a garden, public or private, or a
vineyard, or who steals ears of corn shall be punished with death. No
member of the colony will sell or give any commodity of this country to
a captain, mariner, master or sailor to transport out of the colony, for
his own private uses, upon pain of death. If the indigenous peoples
could not be exploited, reasoned the Virginia Company, perhaps the
colonists could. The new model of colonial development entailed the
Virginia Company owning all the land. Men were housed in barracks, and
given company-determined rations. Work gangs were chosen, each one
overseen by an agent of the company. It was close to martial law, with
execution as the punishment of first resort. As part of the new
institutions for the colony, the first clause just given is significant.
The company threatened with death those who ran away. Given the new work
regime, running away to live with the locals became more and more of an
attractive option for the colonists who had to do the work. Also
available, given the low density of even indigenous populations in
Virginia at that time, was the prospect of going it alone on the
frontier beyond the control of the Virginia Company. The power of the
company in the face of these options was limited. It could not coerce
the English settlers into hard work at subsistence rations. Map 2 shows
an estimate of the population density of different regions of the
Americas at the time on the Spanish conquest. The population density of
the United States, outside of a few pockets, was at most three-quarters
of a person per square mile. In central Mexico or Andean Peru, the
population density was as high as four hundred people per square mile,
more than five hundred times higher. What was possible in Mexico or Peru
was not feasible in Virginia. It took the Virginia Company some time to
recognize that its initial model of colonization did not work in
Virginia, and it took a while, too, for the failure of the “Lawes
Divine, Morall and Martiall” to sink in. Starting in 1618, a
dramatically new strategy was adopted. Since it was possible to coerce
neither the locals nor the settlers, the only alternative was to give
the settlers incentives. In 1618 the company began the “headright
system,” which gave each male settler fifty acres of land and fifty more
acres for each member of his family and for all servants that a family
could bring to Virginia. Settlers were given their houses and freed from
their contracts, and in 1619 a General Assembly was introduced that
effectively gave all adult men a say in the laws and institutions
governing the colony. It was the start of democracy in the United
States. It took the Virginia Company twelve years to learn its first
lesson that what had worked for the Spanish in Mexico and in Central and
South America would not work in the north. The rest of the seventeenth
century saw a long series of struggles over the second lesson: that the
only option for an economically viable colony was to create institutions
that gave the colonists incentives to invest and to work hard. As North
America developed, English elites tried time and time again to set up
institutions that would heavily restrict the economic and political
rights for all but a privileged few of the inhabitants of the colony,
just as the Spanish did. Yet in each case this model broke down, as it
had in Virginia. One of the most ambitious attempts began soon after the
change in strategy of the Virginia Company. In 1632 ten million acres of
land on the upper Chesapeake Bay were granted by the English king
Charles I to Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore. The Charter of Maryland
gave Lord Baltimore complete freedom to create a government along any
lines he wished, with clause VII noting that Baltimore had “for the good
and happy Government of the said Province, free, full, and absolute
Power, by the Tenor of these Presents, to Ordain, Make, and Enact Laws,
of what Kind soever.”</p>
<p>Baltimore drew up a detailed plan for creating a manorial society, a
North American variant of an idealized version of seventeenth-century
rural England. It entailed dividing the land into plots of thousands of
acres, which would be run by lords. The lords would recruit tenants, who
would work the lands and pay rents to the privileged elite controlling
the land. Another similar attempt was made later in 1663, with the
founding of Carolina by eight proprietors, including Sir Anthony
Ashley-Cooper. Ashley-Cooper, along with his secretary, the great
English philosopher John Locke, formulated the Fundamental Constitutions
of Carolina. This document, like the Charter of Maryland before it,
provided a blueprint for an elitist, hierarchical society based on
control by a landed elite. The preamble noted that “the government of
this province may be made most agreeable to the monarchy under which we
live and of which this province is a part; and that we may avoid
erecting a numerous democracy.”</p>
<p>The clauses of the Fundamental Constitutions laid out a rigid social
structure. At the bottom were the “leet-men,” with clause 23 noting,
“All the children of leet-men shall be leet-men, and so to all
generations.” Above the leet-men, who had no political power, were the
landgraves and caziques, who were to form the aristocracy. Landgraves
were to be allocated forty-eight thousand acres of land each, and
caziques twenty-four thousand acres. There was to be a parliament, in
which landgraves and caziques were represented, but it would be
permitted to debate only those measures that had previously been
approved by the eight proprietors. Just as the attempt to impose
draconian rule in Virginia failed, so did the plans for the same type of
institutions in Maryland and Carolina. The reasons were similar. In all
cases it proved to be impossible to force settlers into a rigid
hierarchical society, because there were simply too many options open to
them in the New World. Instead, they had to be provided with incentives
for them to want to work. And soon they were demanding more economic
freedom and further political rights. In Maryland, too, settlers
insisted on getting their own land, and they forced Lord Baltimore into
creating an assembly. In 1691 the assembly induced the king to declare
Maryland a Crown colony, thus removing the political privileges of
Baltimore and his great lords. A similar protracted struggle took place
in the Carolinas, again with the proprietors losing. South Carolina
became a royal colony in 1729. By the 1720s, all the thirteen colonies
of what was to become the United States had similar structures of
government. In all cases there was a governor, and an assembly based on
a franchise of male property holders. They were not democracies; women,
slaves, and the propertyless could not vote. But political rights were
very broad compared with contemporary societies elsewhere. It was these
assemblies and their leaders that coalesced to form the First
Continental Congress in 1774, the prelude to the independence of the
United States. The assemblies believed they had the right to determine
both their own membership and the right to taxation. This, as we know,
created problems for the English colonial government.</p>
<p>A TALE OF TWO CONSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>It should now be apparent that it is not a coincidence that the
United States, and not Mexico, adopted and enforced a constitution that
espoused democratic principles, created limitations on the use of
political power, and distributed that power broadly in society. The
document that the delegates sat down to write in Philadelphia in May
1787 was the outcome of a long process initiated by the formation of the
General Assembly in Jamestown in 1619. The contrast between the
constitutional process that took place at the time of the independence
of the United States and the one that took place a little afterward in
Mexico is stark. In February 1808, Napoleon Bonaparte’s French armies
invaded Spain. By May they had taken Madrid, the Spanish capital. By
September the Spanish king Ferdinand had been captured and had
abdicated. A national junta, the Junta Central, took his place, taking
the torch in the fight against the French. The Junta met first at
Aranjuez, but retreated south in the face of the French armies. Finally
it reached the port of Cádiz, which, though besieged by Napoleonic
forces, held out. Here the Junta formed a parliament, called the Cortes.
In 1812 the Cortes produced what became known as the Cádiz Constitution,
which called for the introduction of a constitutional monarchy based on
notions of popular sovereignty. It also called for the end of special
privileges and the introduction of equality before the law. These
demands were all anathema to the elites of South America, who were still
ruling an institutional environment shaped by the encomienda, forced
labor, and absolute power vested in them and the colonial state. The
collapse of the Spanish state with the Napoleonic invasion created a
constitutional crisis throughout colonial Latin America. There was much
dispute about whether to recognize the authority of the Junta Central,
and in response, many Latin Americans began to form their own juntas. It
was only a matter of time before they began to sense the possibility of
becoming truly independent from Spain. The first declaration of
independence took place in La Paz, Bolivia, in 1809, though it was
quickly crushed by Spanish troops sent from Peru. In Mexico the
political attitudes of the elite had been shaped by the 1810 Hidalgo
Revolt, led by a priest, Father Miguel Hidalgo. When Hidalgo’s army
sacked Guanajuato on September 23, they killed the intendant, the senior
colonial official, and then started indiscriminately to kill white
people. It was more like class or even ethnic warfare than an
independence movement, and it united all the elites in opposition. If
independence allowed popular participation in politics, the local
elites, not just Spaniards, were against it. Consequentially, Mexican
elites viewed the Cádiz Constitution, which opened the way to popular
participation, with extreme skepticism; they would never recognize its
legitimacy. In 1815, as Napoleon’s European empire collapsed, King
Ferdinand VII returned to power and the Cádiz Constitution was
abrogated. As the Spanish Crown began trying to reclaim its American
colonies, it did not face a problem with loyalist Mexico. Yet, in 1820,
a Spanish army that had assembled in Cádiz to sail to the Americas to
help restore Spanish authority mutinied against Ferdinand VII. They were
soon joined by army units throughout the country, and Ferdinand was
forced to restore the Cádiz Constitution and recall the Cortes. This
Cortes was even more radical than the one that had written the Cádiz
Constitution, and it proposed abolishing all forms of labor coercion. It
also attacked special privileges—for example, the right of the military
to be tried for crimes in their own courts. Faced finally with the
imposition of this document in Mexico, the elites there decided that it
was better to go it alone and declare independence. This independence
movement was led by Augustín de Iturbide, who had been an officer in the
Spanish army. On February 24, 1821, he published the Plan de Iguala, his
vision for an independent Mexico. The plan featured a constitutional
monarchy with a Mexican emperor, and removed the provisions of the Cádiz
Constitution that Mexican elites found so threatening to their status
and privileges. It received instantaneous support, and Spain quickly
realized that it could not stop the inevitable. But Iturbide did not
just organize Mexican secession. Recognizing the power vacuum, he
quickly took advantage of his military backing to have himself declared
emperor, a position that the great leader of South American independence
Simón Bolivar described as “by the grace of God and of bayonets.”
Iturbide was not constrained by the same political institutions that
constrained presidents of the United States; he quickly made himself a
dictator, and by October 1822 he had dismissed the constitutionally
sanctioned congress and replaced it with a junta of his choosing. Though
Iturbide did not last long, this pattern of events was to be repeated
time and time again in nineteenth-century Mexico. The Constitution of
the United States did not create a democracy by modern standards. Who
could vote in elections was left up to the individual states to
determine. While northern states quickly conceded the vote to all white
men irrespective of how much income they earned or property they owned,
southern states did so only gradually. No state enfranchised women or
slaves, and as property and wealth restrictions were lifted on white
men, racial franchises explicitly disenfranchising black men were
introduced. Slavery, of course, was deemed constitutional when the
Constitution of the United States was written in Philadelphia, and the
most sordid negotiation concerned the division of the seats in the House
of Representatives among the states. These were to be allocated on the
basis of a state’s population, but the congressional representatives of
southern states then demanded that the slaves be counted. Northerners
objected. The compromise was that in apportioning seats to the House of
Representatives, a slave would count as three-fifths of a free person.
The conflicts between the North and South of the United States were
repressed during the constitutional process as the three-fifths rule and
other compromises were worked out. New fixes were added over time—for
example, the Missouri Compromise, an arrangement where one proslavery
and one antislavery state were always added to the union together, to
keep the balance in the Senate between those for and those against
slavery. These fudges kept the political institutions of the United
States working peacefully until the Civil War finally resolved the
conflicts in favor of the North. The Civil War was bloody and
destructive. But both before and after it there were ample economic
opportunities for a large fraction of the population, especially in the
northern and western United States. The situation in Mexico was very
different. If the United States experienced five years of political
instability between 1860 and 1865, Mexico experienced almost nonstop
instability for the first fifty years of independence. This is best
illustrated via the career of Antonio López de Santa Ana. Santa Ana, son
of a colonial official in Veracruz, came to prominence as a soldier
fighting for the Spanish in the independence wars. In 1821 he switched
sides with Iturbide and never looked back. He became president of Mexico
for the first time in May of 1833, though he exercised power for less
than a month, preferring to let Valentín Gómez Farías act as president.
Gómez Farías’s presidency lasted fifteen days, after which Santa Ana
retook power. This was as brief as his first spell, however, and he was
again replaced by Gómez Farías, in early July. Santa Ana and Gómez
Farías continued this dance until the middle of 1835, when Santa Ana was
replaced by Miguel Barragán. But Santa Ana was not a quitter. He was
back as president in 1839, 1841, 1844, 1847, and, finally, between 1853
and 1855. In all, he was president eleven times, during which he
presided over the loss of the Alamo and Texas and the disastrous
Mexican-American War, which led to the loss of what became New Mexico
and Arizona. Between 1824 and 1867 there were fifty-two presidents in
Mexico, few of whom assumed power according to any constitutionally
sanctioned procedure. The consequence of this unprecedented political
instability for economic institutions and incentives should be obvious.
Such instability led to highly insecure property rights. It also led to
a severe weakening of the Mexican state, which now had little authority
and little ability to raise taxes or provide public services. Indeed,
even though Santa Ana was president in Mexico, large parts of the
country were not under his control, which enabled the annexation of
Texas by the United States. In addition, as we just saw, the motivation
behind the Mexican declaration of independence was to protect the set of
economic institutions developed during the colonial period, which had
made Mexico, in the words of the great German explorer and geographer of
Latin America Alexander von Humbolt, “the country of inequality.” These
institutions, by basing the society on the exploitation of indigenous
people and the creation of monopolies, blocked the economic incentives
and initiatives of the great mass of the population. As the United
States began to experience the Industrial Revolution in the first half
of the nineteenth century, Mexico got poorer.</p>
<p>HAVING AN IDEA, STARTING A FIRM, AND GETTING A LOAN</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution started in England. Its first success was
to revolutionize the production of cotton cloth using new machines
powered by water wheels and later by steam engines. Mechanization of
cotton production massively increased the productivity of workers in,
first, textiles and, subsequently, other industries. The engine of
technological breakthroughs throughout the economy was innovation,
spearheaded by new entrepreneurs and businessmen eager to apply their
new ideas. This initial flowering soon spread across the North Atlantic
to the United States. People saw the great economic opportunities
available in adopting the new technologies developed in England. They
were also inspired to develop their own inventions. We can try to
understand the nature of these inventions by looking at who was granted
patents. The patent system, which protects property rights in ideas, was
systematized in the Statute of Monopolies legislated by the English
Parliament in 1623, partially as an attempt to stop the king from
arbitrarily granting “letters patent” to whomever he wanted—effectively
granting exclusive rights to undertake certain activities or businesses.
The striking thing about the evidence on patenting in the United States
is that people who were granted patents came from all sorts of
backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the rich and the elite. Many
made fortunes based on their patents. Take Thomas Edison, the inventor
of the phonogram and the lightbulb and the founder of General Electric,
still one of the world’s largest companies. Edison was the last of seven
children. His father, Samuel Edison, followed many occupations, from
splitting shingles for roofs to tailoring to keeping a tavern. Thomas
had little formal schooling but was homeschooled by his mother. Between
1820 and 1845, only 19 percent of patentees in the United States had
parents who were professionals or were from recognizable major
landowning families. During the same period, 40 percent of those who
took out patents had only primary schooling or less, just like Edison.
Moreover, they often exploited their patent by starting a firm, again
like Edison. Just as the United States in the nineteenth century was
more democratic politically than almost any other nation in the world at
the time, it was also more democratic than others when it came to
innovation. This was critical to its path to becoming the most
economically innovative nation in the world. If you were poor with a
good idea, it was one thing to take out a patent, which was not so
expensive, after all. It was another thing entirely to use that patent
to make money. One way, of course, was to sell the patent to someone
else. This is what Edison did early on, to raise some capital, when he
sold his Quadruplex telegraph to Western Union for 0,000. But selling
patents was a good idea only for someone like Edison, who had ideas
faster than he could put them to practice. (He had a world-record 1,093
patents issued to him in the United States and 1,500 worldwide.) The
real way to make money from a patent was to start your own business. But
to start a business, you need capital, and you need banks to lend the
capital to you. Inventors in the United States were once again
fortunate. During the nineteenth century there was a rapid expansion of
financial intermediation and banking that was a crucial facilitator of
the rapid growth and industrialization that the economy experienced.
While in 1818 there were 338 banks in operation in the United States,
with total assets of 60 million, by 1914 there were 27,864 banks, with
total assets of 7.3 billion. Potential inventors in the United States
had ready access to capital to start their businesses. Moreover, the
intense competition among banks and financial institutions in the United
States meant that this capital was available at fairly low interest
rates. The same was not true in Mexico. In fact, in 1910, the year in
which the Mexican Revolution started, there were only forty-two banks in
Mexico, and two of these controlled 60 percent of total banking assets.
Unlike in the United States, where competition was fierce, there was
practically no competition among Mexican banks. This lack of competition
meant that the banks were able to charge their customers very high
interest rates, and typically confined lending to the privileged and the
already wealthy, who would then use their access to credit to increase
their grip over the various sectors of the economy. The form that the
Mexican banking industry took in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
was a direct result of the postindependence political institutions of
the country. The chaos of the Santa Ana era was followed by an abortive
attempt by the French government of Emperor Napoleon II to create a
colonial regime in Mexico under Emperor Maximilian between 1864 and
1867. The French were expelled, and a new constitution was written. But
the government formed first by Benito Juárez and, after his death, by
Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada was soon challenged by a young military man
named Porfirio Díaz. Díaz had been a victorious general in the war
against the French and had developed aspirations of power. He formed a
rebel army and, in November of 1876, defeated the army of the government
at the Battle of Tecoac. In May of the next year, he had himself elected
president. He went on to rule Mexico in a more or less unbroken and
increasingly authoritarian fashion until his overthrow at the outbreak
of the revolution thirty-four years later. Like Iturbide and Santa Ana
before him, Díaz started life as a military commander. Such a career
path into politics was certainly known in the United States. The first
president of the United States, George Washington, was also a successful
general in the War of Independence. Ulysses S. Grant, one of the
victorious Union generals of the Civil War, became president in 1869,
and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied Forces in
Europe during the Second World War, was president of the United States
between 1953 and 1961. Unlike Iturbide, Santa Ana, and Díaz, however,
none of these military men used force to get into power. Nor did they
use force to avoid having to relinquish power. They abided by the
Constitution. Though Mexico had constitutions in the nineteenth century,
they put few constraints on what Iturbide, Santa Ana, and Díaz could do.
These men could be removed from power only the same way they had
attained it: by the use of force. Díaz violated people’s property
rights, facilitating the expropriation of vast amounts of land, and he
granted monopolies and favors to his supporters in all lines of
business, including banking. There was nothing new about this behavior.
This is exactly what Spanish conquistadors had done, and what Santa Ana
did in their footsteps. The reason that the United States had a banking
industry that was radically better for the economic prosperity of the
country had nothing to do with differences in the motivation of those
who owned the banks. Indeed, the profit motive, which underpinned the
monopolistic nature of the banking industry in Mexico, was present in
the United States, too. But this profit motive was channeled differently
because of the radically different U.S. institutions. The bankers faced
different economic institutions, institutions that subjected them to
much greater competition. And this was largely because the politicians
who wrote the rules for the bankers faced very different incentives
themselves, forged by different political institutions. Indeed, in the
late eighteenth century, shortly after the Constitution of the United
States came into operation, a banking system looking similar to that
which subsequently dominated Mexico began to emerge. Politicians tried
to set up state banking monopolies, which they could give to their
friends and partners in exchange for part of the monopoly profits. The
banks also quickly got into the business of lending money to the
politicians who regulated them, just as in Mexico. But this situation
was not sustainable in the United States, because the politicians who
attempted to create these banking monopolies, unlike their Mexican
counterparts, were subject to election and reelection. Creating banking
monopolies and giving loans to politicians is good business for
politicians, if they can get away with it. It is not particularly good
for the citizens, however. Unlike in Mexico, in the United States the
citizens could keep politicians in check and get rid of ones who would
use their offices to enrich themselves or create monopolies for their
cronies. In consequence, the banking monopolies crumbled. The broad
distribution of political rights in the United States, especially when
compared to Mexico, guaranteed equal access to finance and loans. This
in turn ensured that those with ideas and inventions could benefit from
them.</p>
<p>PATH-DEPENDENT CHANGE</p>
<p>The world was changing in the 1870s and ’80s. Latin America was no
exception. The institutions that Porfirio Díaz established were not
identical to those of Santa Ana or the Spanish colonial state. The world
economy boomed in the second half of the nineteenth century, and
innovations in transportation such as the steamship and the railway led
to a huge expansion of international trade. This wave of globalization
meant that resource-rich countries such as Mexico—or, more
appropriately, the elites in such countries—could enrich themselves by
exporting raw materials and natural resources to industrializing North
America or Western Europe. Díaz and his cronies thus found themselves in
a different and rapidly evolving world. They realized that Mexico had to
change, too. But this didn’t mean uprooting the colonial institutions
and replacing them with institutions similar to those in the United
States. Instead, theirs was “path-dependent” change leading only to the
next stage of the institutions that had already made much of Latin
America poor and unequal. Globalization made the large open spaces of
the Americas, its “open frontiers,” valuable. Often these frontiers were
only mythically open, since they were inhabited by indigenous peoples
who were brutally dispossessed. All the same, the scramble for this
newly valuable resource was one of the defining processes of the
Americas in the second half of the nineteenth century. The sudden
opening of this valuable frontier led not to parallel processes in the
United States and Latin America, but to a further divergence, shaped by
the existing institutional differences, especially those concerning who
had access to the land. In the United States a long series of
legislative acts, ranging from the Land Ordinance of 1785 to the
Homestead Act of 1862, gave broad access to frontier lands. Though
indigenous peoples had been sidelined, this created an egalitarian and
economically dynamic frontier. In most Latin American countries,
however, the political institutions there created a very different
outcome. Frontier lands were allocated to the politically powerful and
those with wealth and contacts, making such people even more powerful.
Díaz also started to dismantle many of the specific colonial
institutional legacies preventing international trade, which he
anticipated could greatly enrich him and his supporters. His model,
however, continued to be not the type of economic development he saw
north of the Rio Grande but that of Cortés, Pizarro, and de Toledo,
where the elite would make huge fortunes while the rest were excluded.
When the elite invested, the economy would grow a little, but such
economic growth was always going to be disappointing. It also came at
the expense of those lacking rights in this new order, such as the Yaqui
people of Sonora, in the hinterland of Nogales. Between 1900 and 1910,
possibly thirty thousand Yaqui were deported, essentially enslaved, and
sent to work in the henequen plantations of Yucatán. (The fibers of the
henequen plant were a valuable export, since they could be used to make
rope and twine.)</p>
<p>The persistence into the twentieth century of a specific
institutional pattern inimical to growth in Mexico and Latin America is
well illustrated by the fact that, just as in the nineteenth century,
the pattern generated economic stagnation and political instability,
civil wars and coups, as groups struggled for the benefits of power.
Díaz finally lost power to revolutionary forces in 1910. The Mexican
Revolution was followed by others in Bolivia in 1952, Cuba in 1959, and
Nicaragua in 1979. Meanwhile, sustained civil wars raged in Colombia, El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. Expropriation or the threat of
expropriation of assets continued apace, with mass agrarian reforms (or
attempted reforms) in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru,
and Venezuela. Revolutions, expropriations, and political instability
came along with military governments and various types of dictatorships.
Though there was also a gradual drift toward greater political rights,
it was only in the 1990s that most Latin American countries became
democracies, and even then they remain mired in instability. This
instability was accompanied by mass repression and murder. The 1991
National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Report in Chile
determined that 2,279 persons were killed for political reasons during
the Pinochet dictatorship between 1973 and 1990. Possibly 50,000 were
imprisoned and tortured, and hundreds of thousands of people were fired
from their jobs. The Guatemalan Commission for Historical Clarification
Report in 1999 identified a total of 42,275 named victims, though others
have claimed that as many as 200,000 were murdered in Guatemala between
1962 and 1996, 70,000 during the regime of General Efrain Ríos Montt,
who was able to commit these crimes with such impunity that he could run
for president in 2003; fortunately he did not win. The National
Commission on the Disappearance of Persons in Argentina put the number
of people murdered by the military there at 9,000 persons from 1976 to
1983, although it noted that the actual number could be higher.
(Estimates by human rights organizations usually place it at
30,000.)</p>
<p>MAKING A BILLION OR TWO</p>
<p>The enduring implications of the organization of colonial society and
those societies’ institutional legacies shape the modern differences
between the United States and Mexico, and thus the two parts of Nogales.
The contrast between how Bill Gates and Carlos Slim became the two
richest men in the world—Warren Buffett is also a contender—illustrates
the forces at work. The rise of Gates and Microsoft is well known, but
Gates’s status as the world’s richest person and the founder of one of
the most technologically innovative companies did not stop the U.S.
Department of Justice from filing civil actions against the Microsoft
Corporation on May 8, 1998, claiming that Microsoft had abused monopoly
power. Particularly at issue was the way that Microsoft had tied its Web
browser, Internet Explorer, to its Windows operating system. The
government had been keeping an eye on Gates for quite some time, and as
early as 1991, the Federal Trade Commission had launched an inquiry into
whether Microsoft was abusing its monopoly on PC operating systems. In
November 2001, Microsoft reached a deal with the Justice Department. It
had its wings clipped, even if the penalties were less than many
demanded. In Mexico, Carlos Slim did not make his money by innovation.
Initially he excelled in stock market deals, and in buying and revamping
unprofitable firms. His major coup was the acquisition of Telmex, the
Mexican telecommunications monopoly that was privatized by President
Carlos Salinas in 1990. The government announced its intention to sell
51 percent of the voting stock (20.4 percent of total stock) in the
company in September 1989 and received bids in November 1990. Even
though Slim did not put in the highest bid, a consortium led by his
Grupo Corso won the auction. Instead of paying for the shares right
away, Slim managed to delay payment, using the dividends of Telmex
itself to pay for the stock. What was once a public monopoly now became
Slim’s monopoly, and it was hugely profitable. The economic institutions
that made Carlos Slim who he is are very different from those in the
United States. If you’re a Mexican entrepreneur, entry barriers will
play a crucial role at every stage of your career. These barriers
include expensive licenses you have to obtain, red tape you have to cut
through, politicians and incumbents who will stand in your way, and the
difficulty of getting funding from a financial sector often in cahoots
with the incumbents you’re trying to compete against. These barriers can
be either insurmountable, keeping you out of lucrative areas, or your
greatest friend, keeping your competitors at bay. The difference between
the two scenarios is of course whom you know and whom you can
influence—and yes, whom you can bribe. Carlos Slim, a talented,
ambitious man from a relatively modest background of Lebanese
immigrants, has been a master at obtaining exclusive contracts; he
managed to monopolize the lucrative telecommunications market in Mexico,
and then to extend his reach to the rest of Latin America. There have
been challenges to Slim’s Telmex monopoly. But they have not been
successful. In 1996 Avantel, a long-distance phone provider, petitioned
the Mexican Competition Commission to check whether Telmex had a
dominant position in the telecommunications market. In 1997 the
commission declared that Telmex had substantial monopoly power with
respect to local telephony, national long-distance calls, and
international long-distance calls, among other things. But attempts by
the regulatory authorities in Mexico to limit these monopolies have come
to nothing. One reason is that Slim and Telmex can use what is known as
a recurso de amparo, literally an “appeal for protection.” An amparo is
in effect a petition to argue that a particular law does not apply to
you. The idea of the amparo dates back to the Mexican constitution of
1857 and was originally intended as a safeguard of individual rights and
freedoms. In the hands of Telmex and other Mexican monopolies, however,
it has become a formidable tool for cementing monopoly power. Rather
than protecting people’s rights, the amparo provides a loophole in
equality before the law. Slim has made his money in the Mexican economy
in large part thanks to his political connections. When he has ventured
into the United States, he has not been successful. In 1999 his Grupo
Curso bought the computer retailer CompUSA. At the time, CompUSA had
given a franchise to a firm called COC Services to sell its merchandise
in Mexico. Slim immediately violated this contract with the intention of
setting up his own chain of stores, without any competition from COC.
But COC sued CompUSA in a Dallas court. There are no amparos in Dallas,
so Slim lost, and was fined 54 million. The lawyer for COC, Mark Werner,
noted afterward that “the message of this verdict is that in this global
economy, firms have to respect the rules of the United States if they
want to come here.” When Slim was subject to the institutions of the
United States, his usual tactics for making money didn’t work.</p>
<p>TOWARD A THEORY OF WORLD INEQUALITY</p>
<p>We live in an unequal world. The differences among nations are
similar to those between the two parts of Nogales, just on a larger
scale. In rich countries, individuals are healthier, live longer, and
are much better educated. They also have access to a range of amenities
and options in life, from vacations to career paths, that people in poor
countries can only dream of. People in rich countries also drive on
roads without potholes, and enjoy toilets, electricity, and running
water in their houses. They also typically have governments that do not
arbitrarily arrest or harass them; on the contrary, the governments
provide services, including education, health care, roads, and law and
order. Notable, too, is the fact that the citizens vote in elections and
have some voice in the political direction their countries take. The
great differences in world inequality are evident to everyone, even to
those in poor countries, though many lack access to television or the
Internet. It is the perception and reality of these differences that
drive people to cross the Rio Grande or the Mediterranean Sea illegally
to have the chance to experience rich-country living standards and
opportunities. This inequality doesn’t just have consequences for the
lives of individual people in poor countries; it also causes grievances
and resentment, with huge political consequences in the United States
and elsewhere. Understanding why these differences exist and what causes
them is our focus in this book. Developing such an understanding is not
just an end in itself, but also a first step toward generating better
ideas about how to improve the lives of billions who still live in
poverty. The disparities on the two sides of the fence in Nogales are
just the tip of the iceberg. As in the rest of northern Mexico, which
benefits from trade with the United States, even if not all of it is
legal, the residents of Nogales are more prosperous than other Mexicans,
whose average annual household income is around ,000. This greater
relative prosperity of Nogales, Sonora, comes from maquiladora
manufacturing plants centered in industrial parks, the first of which
was started by Richard Campbell, Jr., a California basket manufacturer.
The first tenant was Coin-Art, a musical instrument company owned by
Richard Bosse, owner of the Artley flute and saxophone company in
Nogales, Arizona. Coin-Art was followed by Memorex (computer wiring);
Avent (hospital clothing); Grant (sunglasses); Chamberlain (a
manufacturer of garage door openers for Sears); and Samsonite
(suitcases). Significantly, all are U.S.-based businesses and
businessmen, using U.S. capital and know-how. The greater prosperity of
Nogales, Sonora, relative to the rest of Mexico, therefore, comes from
outside. The differences between the United States and Mexico are in
turn small compared with those across the entire globe. The average
citizen of the United States is seven times as prosperous as the average
Mexican and more than ten times as the resident of Peru or Central
America. She is about twenty times as prosperous as the average
inhabitant of sub-Saharan Africa, and almost forty times as those living
in the poorest African countries such as Mali, Ethiopia, and Sierra
Leone. And it’s not just the United States. There is a small but growing
group of rich countries—mostly in Europe and North America, joined by
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan—whose
citizens enjoy very different lives from those of the inhabitants of the
rest of the globe. The reason that Nogales, Arizona, is much richer than
Nogales, Sonora, is simple; it is because of the very different
institutions on the two sides of the border, which create very different
incentives for the inhabitants of Nogales, Arizona, versus Nogales,
Sonora. The United States is also far richer today than either Mexico or
Peru because of the way its institutions, both economic and political,
shape the incentives of businesses, individuals, and politicians. Each
society functions with a set of economic and political rules created and
enforced by the state and the citizens collectively. Economic
institutions shape economic incentives: the incentives to become
educated, to save and invest, to innovate and adopt new technologies,
and so on. It is the political process that determines what economic
institutions people live under, and it is the political institutions
that determine how this process works. For example, it is the political
institutions of a nation that determine the ability of citizens to
control politicians and influence how they behave. This in turn
determines whether politicians are agents of the citizens, albeit
imperfect, or are able to abuse the power entrusted to them, or that
they have usurped, to amass their own fortunes and to pursue their own
agendas, ones detrimental to those of the citizens. Political
institutions include but are not limited to written constitutions and to
whether the society is a democracy. They include the power and capacity
of the state to regulate and govern society. It is also necessary to
consider more broadly the factors that determine how political power is
distributed in society, particularly the ability of different groups to
act collectively to pursue their objectives or to stop other people from
pursuing theirs. As institutions influence behavior and incentives in
real life, they forge the success or failure of nations. Individual
talent matters at every level of society, but even that needs an
institutional framework to transform it into a positive force. Bill
Gates, like other legendary figures in the information technology
industry (such as Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer, Steve Jobs, Larry Page,
Sergey Brin, and Jeff Bezos), had immense talent and ambition. But he
ultimately responded to incentives. The schooling system in the United
States enabled Gates and others like him to acquire a unique set of
skills to complement their talents. The economic institutions in the
United States enabled these men to start companies with ease, without
facing insurmountable barriers. Those institutions also made the
financing of their projects feasible. The U.S. labor markets enabled
them to hire qualified personnel, and the relatively competitive market
environment enabled them to expand their companies and market their
products. These entrepreneurs were confident from the beginning that
their dream projects could be implemented: they trusted the institutions
and the rule of law that these generated and they did not worry about
the security of their property rights. Finally, the political
institutions ensured stability and continuity. For one thing, they made
sure that there was no risk of a dictator taking power and changing the
rules of the game, expropriating their wealth, imprisoning them, or
threatening their lives and livelihoods. They also made sure that no
particular interest in society could warp the government in an
economically disastrous direction, because political power was both
limited and distributed sufficiently broadly that a set of economic
institutions that created the incentives for prosperity could emerge.
This book will show that while economic institutions are critical for
determining whether a country is poor or prosperous, it is politics and
political institutions that determine what economic institutions a
country has. Ultimately the good economic institutions of the United
States resulted from the political institutions that gradually emerged
after 1619. Our theory for world inequality shows how political and
economic institutions interact in causing poverty or prosperity, and how
different parts of the world ended up with such different sets of
institutions. Our brief review of the history of the Americas begins to
give a sense of the forces that shape political and economic
institutions. Different patterns of institutions today are deeply rooted
in the past because once society gets organized in a particular way,
this tends to persist. We’ll show that this fact comes from the way that
political and economic institutions interact. This persistence and the
forces that create it also explain why it is so difficult to remove
world inequality and to make poor countries prosperous. Though
institutions are the key to the differences between the two Nogaleses
and between Mexico and the United States, that doesn’t mean there will
be a consensus in Mexico to change institutions. There is no necessity
for a society to develop or adopt the institutions that are best for
economic growth or the welfare of its citizens, because other
institutions may be even better for those who control politics and
political institutions. The powerful and the rest of society will often
disagree about which set of institutions should remain in place and
which ones should be changed. Carlos Slim would not have been happy to
see his political connections disappear and the entry barriers
protecting his businesses fizzle—no matter that the entry of new
businesses would enrich millions of Mexicans. Because there is no such
consensus, what rules society ends up with is determined by politics:
who has power and how this power can be exercised. Carlos Slim has the
power to get what he wants. Bill Gates’s power is far more limited.
That’s why our theory is about not just economics but also politics. It
is about the effects of institutions on the success and failure of
nations—thus the economics of poverty and prosperity; it is also about
how institutions are determined and change over time, and how they fail
to change even when they create poverty and misery for millions—thus the
politics of poverty and prosperity.</p>
