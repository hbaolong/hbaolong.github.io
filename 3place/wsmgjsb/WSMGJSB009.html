<h4 id="not-on-our-turf-barriers-to-development">8. NOT ON OUR TURF:
BARRIERS TO DEVELOPMENT</h4>
<p>NO PRINTING ALLOWED</p>
<p>IN 1445 IN THE GERMAN city of Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg unveiled an
innovation with profound consequences for subsequent economic history: a
printing press based on movable type. Until then, books either had to be
hand-copied by scribes, a very slow and laborious process, or they were
block-printed with specific pieces of wood cut for printing each page.
Books were few and far between, and very expensive. After Gutenberg’s
invention, things began to change. Books were printed and became more
readily available. Without this innovation, mass literacy and education
would have been impossible. In Western Europe, the importance of the
printing press was quickly recognized. In 1460 there was already a
printing press across the border, in Strasbourg, France. By the late
1460s the technology had spread throughout Italy, with presses in Rome
and Venice, soon followed by Florence, Milan, and Turin. By 1476 William
Caxton had set up a printing press in London, and two years later there
was one in Oxford. During the same period, printing spread throughout
the Low Countries, into Spain, and even into Eastern Europe, with a
press opening in Budapest in 1473 and in Cracow a year later. Not
everyone saw printing as a desirable innovation. As early as 1485 the
Ottoman sultan Bayezid II issued an edict that Muslims were expressly
forbidden from printing in Arabic. This rule was further reinforced by
Sultan Selim I in 1515. It was not until 1727 that the first printing
press was allowed in the Ottoman lands. Then Sultan Ahmed III issued a
decree granting İbrahim Müteferrika permission to set up a press. Even
this belated step was hedged with restraints. Though the decree noted
“the fortunate day this Western technique will be unveiled like a bride
and will not again be hidden,” Müteferrika’s printing was going to be
closely monitored. The decree stated:</p>
<p>so that the printed books will be free from printing mistakes, the
wise, respected and meritorious religious scholars specializing in
Islamic Law, the excellent Kadi of Istanbul, Mevlana İshak, and
Selaniki’s Kadi, Mevlana Sahib, and Galata’s Kadi, Mevlana Asad, may
their merits be increased, and from the illustrious religious orders,
the pillar of the righteous religious scholars, the Sheykh of the Kasim
Paşa Mevlevihane, Mevlana Musa, may his wisdom and knowledge increase,
will oversee the proofreading.</p>
<p>Müteferrika was allowed to set up a printing press, but whatever he
printed had to be vetted by a panel of three religious and legal
scholars, the Kadis. Maybe the wisdom and knowledge of the Kadis, like
everybody else’s, would have increased much faster had the printing
press been more readily available. But that was not to be, even after
Müteferrika was given permission to set up his press. Not surprisingly
Müteferrika printed few books in the end, only seventeen between 1729,
when the press began to operate, and 1743, when he stopped working. His
family tried to continue the tradition, but they managed to print only
another seven books by the time they finally gave up in 1797. Outside of
the core of the Ottoman Empire in Turkey, printing lagged even further
behind. In Egypt, for instance, the first printing press was set up only
in 1798, by Frenchmen who were part of the abortive attempt by Napoleon
Bonaparte to capture the country. Until well into the second half of the
nineteenth century, book production in the Ottoman Empire was still
primarily undertaken by scribes hand-copying existing books. In the
early eighteenth century, there were reputed to be eighty thousand such
scribes active in Istanbul. This opposition to the printing press had
the obvious consequences for literacy, education, and economic success.
In 1800 probably only 2 to 3 percent of the citizens of the Ottoman
Empire were literate, compared with 60 percent of adult males and 40
percent of adult females in England. In the Netherlands and Germany,
literacy rates were even higher. The Ottoman lands lagged far behind the
European countries with the lowest educational attainment in this
period, such as Portugal, where probably only around 20 percent of
adults could read and write. Given the highly absolutist and extractive
Ottoman institutions, the sultan’s hostility to the printing press is
easy to understand. Books spread ideas and make the population much
harder to control. Some of these ideas may be valuable new ways to
increase economic growth, but others may be subversive and challenge the
existing political and social status quo. Books also undermine the power
of those who control oral knowledge, since they make that knowledge
readily available to anyone who can master literacy. This threatened to
undermine the existing status quo, where knowledge was controlled by
elites. The Ottoman sultans and religious establishment feared the
creative destruction that would result. Their solution was to forbid
printing.</p>
<p>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION created a critical juncture that affected
almost every country. Some nations, such as England, not only allowed,
but actively encouraged, commerce, industrialization, and
entrepreneurship, and grew rapidly. Many, such as the Ottoman Empire,
China, and other absolutist regimes, lagged behind as they blocked or at
the very least did nothing to encourage the spread of industry.
Political and economic institutions shaped the response to technological
innovation, creating once again the familiar pattern of interaction
between existing institutions and critical junctures leading to
divergence in institutions and economic outcomes. The Ottoman Empire
remained absolutist until it collapsed at the end of the First World
War, and was thus able to successfully oppose or impede innovations such
as the printing press and the creative destruction that would have
resulted. The reason that the economic changes that took place in
England did not happen in the Ottoman Empire is the natural connection
between extractive, absolutist political institutions and extractive
economic institutions. Absolutism is rule unconstrained by law or the
wishes of others, though in reality absolutists rule with the support of
some small group or elite. In nineteenth-century Russia, for example,
the tsars were absolutist rulers supported by a nobility that
represented about 1 percent of the total population. This narrow group
organized political institutions to perpetuate their power. There was no
Parliament or political representation of other groups in Russian
society until 1905, when the tsar created the Duma, though he quickly
undermined what few powers he had given to it. Unsurprisingly, economic
institutions were extractive, organized to make the tsar and nobility as
wealthy as possible. The basis of this, as of many extractive economic
systems, was a mass system of labor coercion and control, in the
particularly pernicious form of Russian serfdom. Absolutism was not the
only type of political institution preventing industrialization. Though
absolutist regimes were not pluralistic and feared creative destruction,
many had centralized states, or at least states that were centralized
enough to impose bans on innovations such as the printing press. Even
today, countries such as Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nepal have national
states that lack political centralization. In sub-Saharan Africa the
situation is even worse. As we argued earlier, without a centralized
state to provide order and enforce rules and property rights, inclusive
institutions could not emerge. We will see in this chapter that in many
parts of sub-Saharan Africa (for example, Somalia and southern Sudan) a
major barrier to industrialization was the lack of any form of political
centralization. Without these natural prerequisites, industrialization
had no chance of getting off the ground. Absolutism and a lack of, or
weak, political centralization are two different barriers to the spread
of industry. But they are also connected; both are kept in place by fear
of creative destruction and because the process of political
centralization often creates a tendency toward absolutism. Resistance to
political centralization is motivated by reasons similar to resistance
to inclusive political institutions: fear of losing political power,
this time to the newly centralizing state and those who control it. We
saw in the previous chapter how the process of political centralization
under the Tudor monarchy in England increased demands for voice and
representation by different local elites in national political
institutions as a way of staving off this loss of political power. A
stronger Parliament was created, ultimately enabling the emergence of
inclusive political institutions. But in many other cases, just the
opposite takes place, and the process of political centralization also
ushers in an era of greater absolutism. This is illustrated by the
origins of Russian absolutism, which was forged by Peter the Great
between 1682 and his death in 1725. Peter built a new capital at Saint
Petersburg, stripping away power from the old aristocracy, the Boyars,
in order to create a modern bureaucratic state and modern army. He even
abolished the Boyar Duma that had made him tsar. Peter introduced the
Table of Ranks, a completely new social hierarchy whose essence was
service to the tsar. He also took control over the Church, just as Henry
VIII did when centralizing the state in England. With this process of
political centralization, Peter was taking power away from others and
redirecting it toward himself. His military reforms led the traditional
royal guards, the Streltsy, to rebel. Their revolt was followed by
others, such as the Bashkirs in Central Asia and the Bulavin Rebellion.
None succeeded. Though Peter the Great’s project of political
centralization was a success and the opposition was overcome, the type
of forces that opposed state centralization, such as the Streltsy, who
saw their power being challenged, won out in many parts of the world,
and the resulting lack of state centralization meant the persistence of
a different type of extractive political institutions. In this chapter,
we will see how during the critical juncture created by the Industrial
Revolution, many nations missed the boat and failed to take advantage of
the spread of industry. Either they had absolutist political and
extractive economic institutions, as in the Ottoman Empire, or they
lacked political centralization, as in Somalia.</p>
<p>A SMALL DIFFERENCE THAT MATTERED</p>
<p>Absolutism crumbled in England during the seventeenth century but got
stronger in Spain. The Spanish equivalent of the English Parliament, the
Cortes, existed in name only. Spain was forged in 1492 with the merger
of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon via the marriage of Queen Isabella
and King Ferdinand. That date coincided with the end of the Reconquest,
the long process of ousting the Arabs who had occupied the south of
Spain, and built the great cities of Granada, Cordova, and Seville,
since the eighth century. The last Arab state on the Iberian Peninsula,
Granada, fell to Spain at the same time Christopher Columbus arrived in
the Americas and started claiming lands for Queen Isabella and King
Ferdinand, who had funded his voyage. The merger of the crowns of
Castile and Aragon and subsequent dynastic marriages and inheritances
created a European superstate. Isabella died in 1504, and her daughter
Joanna was crowned queen of Castile. Joanna was married to Philip of the
House of Habsburg, the son of the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire,
Maximilian I. In 1516 Charles, Joanna and Philip’s son, was crowned
Charles I of Castile and Aragon. When his father died, Charles inherited
the Netherlands and Franche-Comté, which he added to his territories in
Iberia and the Americas. In 1519, when Maximilian I died, Charles also
inherited the Habsburg territories in Germany and became Emperor Charles
V of the Holy Roman Empire. What had been a merger of two Spanish
kingdoms in 1492 became a multicontinental empire, and Charles continued
the project of strengthening the absolutist state that Isabella and
Ferdinand had begun. The effort to build and consolidate absolutism in
Spain was massively aided by the discovery of precious metals in the
Americas. Silver had already been discovered in large quantities in
Guanajuato, in Mexico, by the 1520s, and soon thereafter in Zacatecas,
Mexico. The conquest of Peru after 1532 created even more wealth for the
monarchy. This came in the form of a share, the “royal fifth,” in any
loot from conquest and also from mines. As we saw in chapter 1, a
mountain of silver was discovered in Potosí by the 1540s, pouring more
wealth into the coffers of the Spanish king. At the time of the merger
of Castile and Aragon, Spain was among the most economically successful
parts of Europe. After its absolutist political system solidified, it
went into relative and then, after 1600, absolute economic decline.
Almost the first acts of Isabella and Ferdinand after the Reconquest was
the expropriation of the Jews. The approximately two hundred thousand
Jews in Spain were given four months to leave. They had to sell off all
their land and assets at very low prices and were not allowed to take
any gold or silver out of the country. A similar human tragedy was
played out just over one hundred years later. Between 1609 and 1614,
Philip III expelled the Moriscos, the descendants of the citizens of the
former Arab states in the south of Spain. Just as with the Jews, the
Moriscos had to leave with only what they could carry and were not
allowed to take with them any gold, silver, or other precious metals.
Property rights were insecure in other dimensions under Habsburg rule in
Spain. Philip II, who succeeded his father, Charles V, in 1556,
defaulted on his debts in 1557 and again in 1560, ruining the Fugger and
Welser banking families. The role of the German banking families was
then assumed by Genoese banking families, who were in turn ruined by
subsequent Spanish defaults during the reign of the Habsburgs in 1575,
1596, 1607, 1627, 1647, 1652, 1660, and 1662. Just as crucial as the
instability of property rights in absolutist Spain was the impact of
absolutism on the economic institutions of trade and the development of
the Spanish colonial empire. As we saw in the previous chapter, the
economic success of England was based on rapid mercantile expansion.
Though, compared with Spain and Portugal, England was a latecomer to
Atlantic trade, she allowed for relatively broad-based participation in
trading and colonial opportunities. What filled the Crown’s coffers in
Spain enriched the newly emerging merchant class in England. It was this
merchant class that would form the basis of early England economic
dynamism and become the bulwark of the anti-absolutist political
coalition. In Spain these processes that led to economic progress and
institutional change did not take place. After the Americas had been
discovered, Isabella and Ferdinand organized trade between their new
colonies and Spain via a guild of merchants in Seville. These merchants
controlled all trade and made sure that the monarchy got its share of
the wealth of the Americas. There was no free trade with any of the
colonies, and each year a large flotilla of ships would return from the
Americas bringing precious metals and valuable goods to Seville. The
narrow, monopolized base of this trade meant that no broad class of
merchants could emerge via trading opportunities with the colonies. Even
trade within the Americas was heavily regulated. For example, a merchant
in a colony such as New Spain, roughly modern Mexico, could not trade
directly with anyone in New Granada, modern Colombia. These restrictions
on trade within the Spanish Empire reduced its economic prosperity and
also, indirectly, the potential benefits that Spain could have gained by
trading with another, more prosperous empire. Nevertheless, they were
attractive because they guaranteed that the silver and gold would keep
flowing to Spain. The extractive economic institutions of Spain were a
direct result of the construction of absolutism and the different path,
compared with England, taken by political institutions. Both the Kingdom
of Castile and the Kingdom of Aragon had their Cortes, a parliament
representing the different groups, or “estates,” of the kingdom. As with
the English Parliament, the Castilian Cortes needed to be summoned to
assent to new taxes. Nevertheless, the Cortes in Castile and Aragon
primarily represented the major cities, rather than both the urban and
rural areas, as the English Parliament did. By the fifteenth century, it
represented only eighteen cities, each of whom sent two deputies. In
consequence, the Cortes did not represent as broad a set of groups as
the English Parliament did, and it never developed as a nexus of diverse
interests vying to place constraints on absolutism. It could not
legislate, and even the scope of its powers with respect to taxation was
limited. This all made it easier for the Spanish monarchy to sideline
the Cortes in the process of consolidating its own absolutism. Even with
silver coming from the Americas, Charles V and Philip II required
ever-increasing tax revenues to finance a series of expensive wars. In
1520 Charles V decided to present the Cortes with demands for increased
taxation. Urban elites used the moment to call for much wider change in
the Cortes and its powers. This opposition turned violent and quickly
became known as the Comunero Rebellion. Charles was able to crush the
rebellion with loyal troops. Throughout the rest of the sixteenth
century, though, there was a continuous battle as the Crown tried to
wrest away from the Cortes what rights to levy new taxes and increase
old ones that it had. Though this battle ebbed and flowed, it was
ultimately won by the monarchy. After 1664 the Cortes did not meet again
until it would be reconstructed during the Napoleonic invasions almost
150 years later. In England the defeat of absolutism in 1688 led not
only to pluralistic political institutions but also to the further
development of a much more effective centralized state. In Spain the
opposite happened as absolutism triumphed. Though the monarchy
emasculated the Cortes and removed any potential constraints on its
behavior, it became increasingly difficult to raise taxes, even when
attempted by direct negotiations with individual cities. While the
English state was creating a modern, efficient tax bureaucracy, the
Spanish state was again moving in the opposite direction. The monarchy
was not only failing to create secure property rights for entrepreneurs
and monopolizing trade, but it was also selling offices, often making
them hereditary, indulging in tax farming, and even selling immunity
from justice. The consequences of these extractive political and
economic institutions in Spain were predictable. During the seventeenth
century, while England was moving toward commercial growth and then
rapid industrialization, Spain was tailspinning toward widespread
economic decline. At the start of the century, one in five people in
Spain was living in urban areas. By the end, this figure had halved to
one in ten, in a process that corresponded to increasing impoverishment
of the Spanish population. Spanish incomes fell, while England grew
rich. The persistence and the strengthening of absolutism in Spain,
while it was being uprooted in England, is another example of small
differences mattering during critical junctures. The small differences
were in the strengths and nature of representative institutions; the
critical juncture was the discovery of the Americas. The interaction of
these sent Spain off on a very different institutional path from
England. The relatively inclusive economic institutions that resulted in
England created unprecedented economic dynamism, culminating in the
Industrial Revolution, while industrialization did not stand a chance in
Spain. By the time industrial technology was spreading in many parts of
the world, the Spanish economy had declined so much that there was not
even a need for the Crown or the land-owning elites in Spain to block
industrialization.</p>
<p>FEAR OF INDUSTRY</p>
<p>Without the changes in political institutions and political power
similar to those that emerged in England after 1688, there was little
chance for absolutist countries to benefit from the innovations and new
technologies of the Industrial Revolution. In Spain, for example, the
lack of secure property rights and the widespread economic decline meant
that people simply did not have the incentive to make the necessary
investments and sacrifices. In Russia and Austria-Hungary, it wasn’t
simply the neglect and mismanagement of the elites and the insidious
economic slide under extractive institutions that prevented
industrialization; instead, the rulers actively blocked any attempt to
introduce these technologies and basic investments in infrastructure
such as railroads that could have acted as their conduits. At the time
of the Industrial Revolution, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, the political map of Europe was quite different from how it
is today. The Holy Roman Empire, a patchwork quilt of more than four
hundred polities, most of which would eventually coalesce into Germany,
occupied most of Central Europe. The House of Habsburg was still a major
political force, and its empire, known as the Habsburg or
Austro-Hungarian Empire, spread over a vast area of around 250,000
square miles, even if it no longer included Spain, after the Bourbons
had taken over the Spanish throne in 1700. In terms of population, it
was the third-largest state in Europe and comprised one-seventh of the
population of Europe. In the late eighteenth century the Habsburg lands
included, in the west, what is today Belgium, then known as the Austrian
Netherlands. The largest part, however, was the contiguous block of
lands based around Austria and Hungary, including the Czech Republic and
Slovakia to the north, and Slovenia, Croatia, and large parts of Italy
and Serbia to the south. To the east it also incorporated much of what
is today Romania and Poland. Merchants in the Habsburg domains were much
less important than in England, and serfdom prevailed in the lands in
Eastern Europe. As we saw in chapter 4, Hungary and Poland were at the
heart of the Second Serfdom of Eastern Europe. The Habsburgs, unlike the
Stuarts, were successful in sustaining strongly absolutist rule. Francis
I, who ruled as the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, between 1792
and 1806, and then emperor of Austria-Hungary until his death in 1835,
was a consummate absolutist. He did not recognize any limitations on his
power and, above all, he wished to preserve the political status quo.
His basic strategy was opposing change, any sort of change. In 1821 he
made this clear in a speech, characteristic of Habsburg rulers, he gave
to the teachers at a school in Laibach, asserting, “I do not need
savants, but good, honest citizens. Your task is to bring young men up
to be this. He who serves me must teach what I order him. If anyone
can’t do this, or comes with new ideas, he can go, or I will remove
him.”</p>
<p>The empress Maria Theresa, who reigned between 1740 and 1780,
frequently responded to suggestions about how to improve or change
institutions by remarking. “Leave everything as it is.” Nevertheless,
she and her son Joseph II, who was emperor between 1780 and 1790, were
responsible for an attempt to construct a more powerful central state
and more effective administrative system. Yet they did this in the
context of a political system with no real constraints on their actions
and with few elements of pluralism. There was no national parliament
that would exert even a modicum of control on the monarch, only a system
of regional estates and diets, which historically had some powers with
respect to taxation and military recruitment. There were even fewer
controls on what the Austro-Hungarian Habsburgs could do than there were
on Spanish monarchs, and political power was narrowly concentrated. As
Habsburg absolutism strengthened in the eighteenth century, the power of
all non-monarchical institutions weakened further. When a deputation of
citizens from the Austrian province of the Tyrol petitioned Francis for
a constitution, he responded, “So, you want a constitution! … Now look,
I don’t care for it, I will give you a constitution but you must know
that the soldiers obey me, and I will not ask you twice if I need money
… In any case I advise you to be careful what you are going to say.”
Given this response, the Tyrolese leaders replied, “If thou thinkest
thus, it is better to have no constitution,” to which Francis answered,
“That is also my opinion.”</p>
<p>Francis dissolved the State Council that Maria Theresa had used as a
forum for consultation with her ministers. From then on there would be
no consultation or public discussion of the Crown’s decisions. Francis
created a police state and ruthlessly censored anything that could be
regarded as mildly radical. His philosophy of rule was characterized by
Count Hartig, a long-standing aide, as the “unabated maintenance of the
sovereign’s authority, and a denial of all claims on the part of the
people to a participation in that authority.” He was helped in all this
by Prince von Metternich, appointed as his foreign minister in 1809.
Metternich’s power and influence actually outlasted that of Francis, and
he remained foreign minister for almost forty years. At the center of
Habsburg economic institutions stood the feudal order and serfdom. As
one moved east within the empire, feudalism became more intense, a
reflection of the more general gradient in economic institutions we saw
in chapter 4, as one moved from Western to Eastern Europe. Labor
mobility was highly circumscribed, and emigration was illegal. When the
English philanthropist Robert Owen tried to convince the Austrian
government to adopt some social reforms in order to ameliorate the
conditions of poor people, one of Metternich’s assistants, Friedrich von
Gentz, replied, “We do not desire at all that the great masses shall
become well off and independent … How could we otherwise rule over
them?”</p>
<p>In addition to serfdom, which completely blocked the emergence of a
labor market and removed the economic incentives or initiative from the
mass of the rural population, Habsburg absolutism thrived on monopolies
and other restrictions on trade. The urban economy was dominated by
guilds, which restricted entry into professions. Until 1775 there were
internal tariffs within Austria itself and in Hungary until 1784. There
were very high tariffs on imported goods, with many explicit
prohibitions on the import and export of goods. The suppression of
markets and the creation of extractive economic institutions are of
course quite characteristic of absolutism, but Francis went further. It
was not simply that extractive economic institutions removed the
incentive for individuals to innovate or adopt new technology. We saw in
chapter 2 how in the Kingdom of Kongo attempts to promote the use of
plows were unsuccessful because people lacked any incentive, given the
extractive nature of the economic institutions. The king of Kongo
realized that if he could induce people to use plows, agricultural
productivity would be higher, generating more wealth, which he could
benefit from. This is a potential incentive for all governments, even
absolutist ones. The problem in Kongo was that people understood that
whatever they produced could be confiscated by an absolutist monarch,
and therefore they had no incentive to invest or use better technology.
In the Habsburg lands, Francis did not encourage his citizens to adopt
better technology; on the contrary, he actually opposed it, and blocked
the dissemination of technologies that people would have been otherwise
willing to adopt with the existing economic institutions. Opposition to
innovation was manifested in two ways. First, Francis I was opposed to
the development of industry. Industry led to factories, and factories
would concentrate poor workers in cities, particularly in the capital
city of Vienna. Those workers might then become supporters for opponents
of absolutism. His policies were aimed at locking into place the
traditional elites and the political and economic status quo. He wanted
to keep society primarily agrarian. The best way to do this, Francis
believed, was to stop the factories being built in the first place. This
he did directly—for instance, in 1802, banning the creation of new
factories in Vienna. Instead of encouraging the importation and adoption
of new machinery, the basis of industrialization, he banned it until
1811. Second, he opposed the construction of railways, one of the key
new technologies that came with the Industrial Revolution. When a plan
to build a northern railway was put before Francis I, he replied, “No,
no, I will have nothing to do with it, lest the revolution might come
into the country.”</p>
<p>Since the government would not grant a concession to build a steam
railway, the first railway built in the empire had to use horse-drawn
carriages. The line, which ran between the city of Linz, on the Danube,
to the Bohemian city of Budweis, on the Moldau River, was built with
gradients and corners, which meant that it was impossible subsequently
to convert it to steam engines. So it continued with horse power until
the 1860s. The economic potential for railway development in the empire
had been sensed early by the banker Salomon Rothschild, the
representative in Vienna of the great banking family. Salomon’s brother
Nathan, who was based in England, was very impressed by George
Stephenson’s engine “The Rocket” and the potential for steam locomotion.
He contacted his brother to encourage him to look for opportunities to
develop railways in Austria, since he believed that the family could
make large profits by financing railway development. Nathan agreed, but
the scheme went nowhere because Emperor Francis again simply said no.
The opposition to industry and steam railways stemmed from Francis’s
concern about the creative destruction that accompanied the development
of a modern economy. His main priorities were ensuring the stability of
the extractive institutions over which he ruled and protecting the
advantages of the traditional elites who supported him. Not only was
there little to gain from industrialization, which would undermine the
feudal order by attracting labor from the countryside to the cities, but
Francis also recognized the threat that major economic changes would
pose to his political power. As a consequence, he blocked industry and
economic progress, locking in economic backwardness, which manifested
itself in many ways. For instance, as late as 1883, when 90 percent of
world iron output was produced using coal, more than half of the output
in the Habsburg territories still used much less efficient charcoal.
Similarly, right up to the First World War, when the empire collapsed,
textile weaving was never fully mechanized but still undertaken by hand.
Austria-Hungary was not alone in fearing industry. Farther east, Russia
had an equally absolutist set of political institutions, forged by Peter
the Great, as we saw earlier in this chapter. Like Austria-Hungary,
Russia’s economic institutions were highly extractive, based on serfdom,
keeping at least half of the population tied to the land. Serfs had to
work for nothing three days a week on the lands of their lords. They
could not move, they lacked freedom of occupation, and they could be
sold at will by their lord to another lord. The radical philosopher
Peter Kropotkin, one of the founders of modern anarchism, left a vivid
depiction of the way serfdom worked during the reign of Tsar Nicholas I,
who ruled Russia from 1825 until 1855. He recalled from his
childhood</p>
<p>stories of men and women torn from their families and their villages
and sold, lost in gambling, or exchanged for a couple of hunting dogs,
and transported to some remote part of Russia … of children taken from
their parents and sold to cruel or dissolute masters; of flogging “in
the stables,” which occurred every day with unheard of cruelty; of a
girl who found her only salvation in drowning herself; of an old man who
had grown grey-haired in his master’s service and at last hanged himself
under his master’s window; and of revolts of serfs, which were
suppressed by Nicholas I’s generals by flogging to death each tenth or
fifth man taken out of the ranks, and by laying waste the village … As
to the poverty which I saw during our journeys in certain villages,
especially in those which belonged to the imperial family, no words
would be adequate to describe the misery to readers who have not seen
it.</p>
<p>Exactly as in Austria-Hungary, absolutism didn’t just create a set of
economic institutions that impeded the prosperity of the society. There
was a similar fear of creative destruction and a fear of industry and
the railways. At the heart of this during the reign of Nicholas I was
Count Egor Kankrin, who served as finance minister between 1823 and 1844
and played a key role in opposing the changes in society necessary for
promoting economic prosperity. Kankrin’s policies were aimed at
strengthening the traditional political pillars of the regime,
particularly the landed aristocracy, and keeping the society rural and
agrarian. Upon becoming minister of finance, Kankrin quickly opposed and
reversed a proposal by the previous finance minister, Gurev, to develop
a government-owned Commercial Bank to lend to industry. Instead, Kankrin
reopened the State Loan Bank, which had been closed during the
Napoleonic Wars. This bank was originally created to lend to large
landowners at subsidized rates, a policy Kankrin approved of. The loans
required the applicants to put up serfs as “security,” or collateral, so
that only feudal landowners could get such loans. To finance the State
Loan Bank, Kankrin transferred assets from the Commercial Bank, killing
two birds with one stone: there would now be little money left for
industry. Kankrin’s attitudes were presciently shaped by the fear that
economic change would bring political change, and so were those of Tsar
Nicholas. Nicholas’s assumption of power in December 1825 had been
almost aborted by an attempted coup by military officers, the so-called
Decembrists, who had a radical program of social change. Nicholas wrote
to Grand Duke Mikhail: “Revolution is on Russia’s doorstep, but I swear
that it will not penetrate the country while there is breath in my
body.”</p>
<p>Nicholas feared the social changes that creating a modern economy
would bring. As he put it in a speech he made to a meeting of
manufacturers at an industrial exhibit in Moscow:</p>
<p>both the state and manufacturers must turn their attention to a
subject, without which the very factories would become an evil rather
than a blessing; this is the care of the workers who increase in number
annually. They need energetic and paternal supervision of their morals;
without it this mass of people will gradually be corrupted and
eventually turn into a class as miserable as they are dangerous for
their masters.</p>
<p>Just as with Francis I, Nicholas feared that the creative destruction
unleashed by a modern industrial economy would undermine the political
status quo in Russia. Urged on by Nicholas, Kankrin took specific steps
to slow the potential for industry. He banned several industrial
exhibitions, which had previously been held periodically to showcase new
technology and facilitate technology adoption. In 1848 Europe was rocked
by a series of revolutionary outbursts. In response, A. A. Zakrevskii,
the military governor of Moscow, who was in charge of maintaining public
order, wrote to Nicholas: “For the preservation of calm and prosperity,
which at present time only Russia enjoys, the government must not permit
the gathering of homeless and dissolute people, who will easily join
every movement, destroying social or private peace.” His advice was
brought before Nicholas’s ministers, and in 1849 a new law was enacted
that put severe limits on the number of factories that could be opened
in any part of Moscow. It specifically forbade the opening of any new
cotton or woolen spinning mills and iron foundries. Other industries,
such as weaving and dyeing, had to petition the military governor if
they wanted to open new factories. Eventually cotton spinning was
explicitly banned. The law was intended to stop any further
concentration of potentially rebellious workers in the city. Opposition
to railways accompanied opposition to industry, exactly as in
Austria-Hungary. Before 1842 there was only one railway in Russia. This
was the Tsarskoe Selo Railway, which ran seventeen miles from Saint
Petersburg to the imperial residencies of Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk.
Just as Kankrin opposed industry, he saw no reason to promote railways,
which he argued would bring a socially dangerous mobility, noting that
“railways do not always result from natural necessity, but are more an
object of artificial need or luxury. They encourage unnecessary travel
from place to place, which is entirely typical of our time.”</p>
<p>Kankrin turned down numerous bids to build railways, and it was only
in 1851 that a line was built linking Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
Kankrin’s policy was continued by Count Kleinmichel, who was made head
of the main administration of Transport and Public Buildings. This
institution became the main arbiter of railway construction, and
Kleinmichel used it as a platform to discourage their construction.
After 1849 he even used his power to censor discussion in the newspapers
of railway development. Map 13 (opposite) shows the consequences of this
logic. While Britain and most of northwest Europe was crisscrossed with
railways in 1870, very few penetrated the vast territory of Russia. The
policy against railways was only reversed after Russia’s conclusive
defeat by British, French, and Ottoman forces in the Crimean War,
1853–1856, when the backwardness of its transportation network was
understood to be a serious liability for Russian security. There was
also little railway development in Austria-Hungary outside of Austria
and the western parts of the empire, though the 1848 Revolutions had
brought change to these territories, particularly the abolition of
serfdom.</p>
<p>NO SHIPPING ALLOWED</p>
<p>Absolutism reigned not just in much of Europe but also in Asia, and
similarly prevented industrialization during the critical juncture
created by the Industrial Revolution. The Ming and Qing dynasties of
China and the absolutism of the Ottoman Empire illustrate this pattern.
Under the Song dynasty, between 960 and 1279, China led the world in
many technological innovations. The Chinese invented clocks, the
compass, gunpowder, paper and paper money, porcelain, and blast furnaces
to make cast iron before Europe did. They independently developed
spinning wheels and waterpower at more or less the same time that these
emerged at the other end of Eurasia. In consequence, in 1500 standards
of living were probably at least as high in China as they were in
Europe. For centuries China also had a centralized state with a
meritocratically recruited civil service. Yet China was absolutist, and
the growth under the Song dynasty was under extractive institutions.
There was no political representation for groups other than the monarchy
in society, nothing resembling a Parliament or a Cortes. Merchants
always had a precarious status in China, and the great inventions of the
Song were not spurred by market incentives but were brought into
existence under the auspices, or even the orders, of the government.
Little of this was commercialized. The grip of the state tightened
during the Ming and Qing dynasties that followed the Song. At the root
of all this was the usual logic of extractive institutions. As most
rulers presiding over extractive institutions, the absolutist emperors
of China opposed change, sought stability, and in essence feared
creative destruction. This is best illustrated by the history of
international trade. As we have seen, the discovery of the Americas and
the way international trade was organized played a key role in the
political conflicts and institutional changes of early modern Europe. In
China, while private merchants were commonly involved in trade within
the country, the state monopolized overseas trade. When the Ming dynasty
came to power in 1368, it was Emperor Hongwu who first ruled, for thirty
years. Hongwu was concerned that overseas trade would be politically and
socially destabilizing and he allowed international trade to take place
only if it were organized by the government and only if it involved
tribute giving, and not commercial activity. Hongwu even executed
hundreds of people accused of trying to turn tribute missions into
commercial ventures. Between 1377 and 1397, no oceangoing tribute
missions were allowed. He banned private individuals from trading with
foreigners and would not allow Chinese to sail overseas. In 1402 Emperor
Yongle came to the throne and initiated one of the most famous periods
of Chinese history by restarting government-sponsored foreign trade on a
big scale. Yongle sponsored Admiral Zheng He to undertake six huge
missions to Southeast and South Asia, Arabia, and Africa. The Chinese
knew about these places from a long history of trading relations, but
nothing had ever happened on this scale before. The first fleet included
27,800 men and 62 large treasure ships, accompanied by 190 smaller
ships, including ones specifically for carrying freshwater, others for
supplies, and others for troops. Yet Emperor Yongle put a temporary stop
on the missions after the sixth one in 1422. This was made permanent by
his successor, Hongxi, who ruled from 1424 to 1425. Hongxi’s premature
death brought to the throne Emperor Xuande, who at first allowed Zheng
He a final mission, in 1433. But after this, all overseas trade was
banned. By 1436 the construction of seagoing ships was even made
illegal. The ban on overseas trade was not lifted until 1567. These
events, though only the tip of the extractive iceberg that prevented
many economic activities deemed to be potentially destabilizing, were to
have a fundamental impact on Chinese economic development. Just at the
time when international trade and the discovery of the Americas were
fundamentally transforming the institutions of England, China was
cutting itself off from this critical juncture and turning inward. This
inward turn did not end in 1567. The Ming dynasty was overrun in 1644 by
the Jurchen people, the Manchus of inner Asia, who created the Qing
dynasty. A period of intense political instability then ensued. The
Qings engaged in mass expropriation of property and assets. In the
1690s, T’ang Chen, a retired Chinese scholar and failed merchant,
wrote:</p>
<p>More than fifty years have passed since the founding of the Ch’ing
〔Qing〕 dynasty, and the empire grows poorer each day. Farmers are
destitute, artisans are destitute, merchants are destitute, and
officials too are destitute. Grain is cheap, yet it is hard to eat one’s
fill. Cloth is cheap, yet it is hard to cover one’s skin. Boatloads of
goods travel from one marketplace to another, but the cargoes must be
sold at a loss. Officials upon leaving their posts discover they have no
wherewithal to support their households. Indeed the four occupations are
all impoverished.</p>
<p>In 1661 the emperor Kangxi ordered that all people living along the
coast from Vietnam to Chekiang—essentially the entire southern coast,
once the most commercially active part of China—should move seventeen
miles inland. The coast was patrolled by troops to enforce the measure,
and until 1693 there was a ban on shipping everywhere on the coast. This
ban was periodically reimposed in the eighteenth century, effectively
stunting the emergence of Chinese overseas trade. Though some did
develop, few were willing to invest when the emperor could suddenly
change his mind and ban trade, making investments in ships, equipment,
and trading relations worthless or even worse. The reasoning of the Ming
and Qing states for opposing international trade is by now familiar: the
fear of creative destruction. The leaders’ primary aim was political
stability. International trade was potentially destabilizing as
merchants were enriched and emboldened, as they were in England during
the era of Atlantic expansion. This was not just what the rulers
believed during the Ming and Qing dynasties, but also the attitude of
the rulers of the Song dynasty, even if they were willing to sponsor
technological innovations and permit greater commercial freedom,
provided that this was under their control. Things got worse under the
Ming and Qing dynasties as the control of the state on economic activity
tightened and overseas trade was banned. There were certainly markets
and trade in Ming and Qing China, and the government taxed the domestic
economy quite lightly. However, it did little to support innovation, and
it exchanged the development of mercantile or industrial prosperity for
political stability. The consequence of all this absolutist control of
the economy was predictable: the Chinese economy was stagnant throughout
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries while other economies were
industrializing. By the time Mao set up his communist regime in 1949,
China had become one of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p>THE ABSOLUTISM OF PRESTER JOHN</p>
<p>Absolutism as a set of political institutions and the economic
consequences that flowed from it were not restricted to Europe and Asia.
It was present in Africa, for example, with the Kingdom of Kongo, as we
saw in chapter 2. An even more durable example of African absolutism is
Ethiopia, or Abyssinia, whose roots we came across in chapter 6, when we
discussed the emergence of feudalism after the decline of Aksum.
Abyssinian absolutism was even more long-lived than its European
counterparts, because it was faced with very different challenges and
critical junctures. After the conversion of the Aksumite king Ezana to
Christianity, the Ethiopians remained Christian, and by the fourteenth
century they had become the focus of the myth of King Prester John.
Prester John was a Christian king who had been cut off from Europe by
the rise of Islam in the Middle East. Initially his kingdom was thought
to be located in India. However, as European knowledge of India
increased, people realized that this was not true. The king of Ethiopia,
since he was a Christian, then became a natural target for the myth.
Ethiopian kings in fact tried hard to forge alliances with European
monarchs against Arab invasions, sending diplomatic missions to Europe
from at least 1300 onward, even persuading the Portuguese king to send
soldiers. These soldiers, along with diplomats, Jesuits, and travelers
wishing to meet Prester John, left many accounts of Ethiopia. Some of
the most interesting from an economic point of view are by Francisco
Álvares, a chaplain accompanying a Portuguese diplomatic mission, who
was in Ethiopia from 1520 to 1527. In addition, there are accounts by
Jesuit Manoel de Almeida, who lived in Ethiopia from 1624, and by John
Bruce, a traveler who was in the country between 1768 and 1773. The
writings of these people give a rich account of political and economic
institutions at the time in Ethiopia and leave no doubt that Ethiopia
was a perfect specimen of absolutism. There were no pluralistic
institutions of any kind, nor any checks and constraints on the power of
the emperor, who claimed the right to rule on the basis of supposed
descent from the legendary King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. The
consequence of absolutism was great insecurity of property rights driven
by the political strategy of the emperor. Bruce, for example, noted
that</p>
<p>all the land is the king’s; he gives it to whom he pleases during
pleasure, and resumes it when it is his will. As soon as he dies the
whole land in the kingdom is at the disposal of the Crown; and not only
so, but, by death of the present owner, his possessions however long
enjoyed, revert to the king, and do not fall to the eldest son.</p>
<p>Álvares claimed there would be much more “fruit and tillage if the
great men did not ill-treat the people.” Alameida’s account of how the
society worked is very consistent. He observed:</p>
<p>It is so usual for the emperor to exchange, alter and take away the
lands each man holds every two or three years, sometimes every year and
even many times in the course of a year, that it causes no surprise.
Often one man plows the soil, another sows it and another reaps. Hence
it arises that there is no one who takes care of the land he enjoys;
there is not even anyone to plant a tree because he knows that he who
plants it very rarely gathers the fruit. For the king, however, it is
useful that they should be so dependent upon him.</p>
<p>These descriptions suggest major similarities between the political
and economic structures of Ethiopia and those of European absolutism,
though they also make it clear that absolutism was more intense in
Ethiopia, and economic institutions even more extractive. Moreover, as
we emphasized in chapter 6, Ethiopia was not subject to the same
critical junctures that helped undermine the absolutist regime in
England. It was cut off from many of the processes that shaped the
modern world. Even if this had not been the case, the intensity of its
absolutism would probably have led the absolutism to strengthen even
more. For example, as in Spain, international trade in Ethiopia,
including the lucrative slave trade, was controlled by the monarch.
Ethiopia was not completely isolated: Europeans did search for Prester
John, and it did have to fight wars against surrounding Islamic
polities. Nevertheless, the historian Edward Gibbon noted with some
accuracy that “encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their
religion, the Aethiopians slept near a thousand years, forgetful of the
world by whom they were forgotten.”</p>
<p>As the European colonization of Africa began in the nineteenth
century, Ethiopia was an independent kingdom under Ras (Duke) Kassa, who
was crowned Emperor Tewodros II in 1855. Tewodros embarked on a
modernization of the state, creating a more centralized bureaucracy and
judiciary, and a military capable of controlling the country and
possibly fighting the Europeans. He placed military governors,
responsible for collecting taxes and remitting them to him, in charge of
all the provinces. His negotiations with European powers were difficult,
and in exasperation he imprisoned the English consul. In 1868 the
English sent an expeditionary force, which sacked his capital. Tewodros
committed suicide. All the same, Tewodros’s reconstructed government did
manage to pull off one of the great anticolonial triumphs of the
nineteenth century, against the Italians. In 1889 the throne went to
Menelik II, who was immediately faced with the interest of Italy in
establishing a colony there. In 1885 the German chancellor Bismarck had
convened a conference in Berlin where the European powers hatched the
“Scramble for Africa”—that is, they decided how to divide up Africa into
different spheres of interest. At the conference, Italy secured its
rights to colonies in Eritrea, along the coast of Ethiopia, and Somalia.
Ethiopia, though not represented at the conference, somehow managed to
survive intact. But the Italians still kept designs, and in 1896 they
marched an army south from Eritrea. Menelik’s response was similar to
that of a European medieval king; he formed an army by getting the
nobility to call up their armed men. This approach could not put an army
in the field for long, but it could put a huge one together for a short
time. This short time was just enough to defeat the Italians, whose
fifteen thousand men were overwhelmed by Menelik’s one hundred thousand
in the Battle of Adowa in 1896. It was the most serious military defeat
a precolonial African country was able to inflict on a European power,
and secured Ethiopia’s independence for another forty years. The last
emperor of Ethiopia, Ras Tafari, was crowned Haile Selassie in 1930.
Haile Selassie ruled until he was overthrown by a second Italian
invasion, which began in 1935, but he returned from exile with the help
of the English in 1941. He then ruled until he was overthrown in a 1974
coup by the Derg, “the Committee,” a group of Marxist army officers, who
then proceeded to further impoverish and ravage the country. The basic
extractive economic institutions of the absolutist Ethiopian empire,
such as gult (this page), and the feudalism created after the decline of
Aksum, lasted until they were abolished after the 1974 revolution. Today
Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world. The income of an
average Ethiopian is about one-fortieth that of an average citizen of
England. Most people live in rural areas and practice subsistence
agriculture. They lack clean water, electricity, and access to proper
schools or health care. Life expectancy is about fifty-five years and
only one-third of adults are literate. A comparison between England and
Ethiopia spans world inequality. The reason Ethiopia is where it is
today is that, unlike in England, in Ethiopia absolutism persisted until
the recent past. With absolutism came extractive economic institutions
and poverty for the mass of Ethiopians, though of course the emperors
and nobility benefited hugely. But the most enduring implication of the
absolutism was that Ethiopian society failed to take advantage of
industrialization opportunities during the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, underpinning the abject poverty of its citizens
today.</p>
<p>THE CHILDREN OF SAMAALE</p>
<p>Absolutist political institutions around the world impeded
industrialization either indirectly, in the way they organized the
economy, or directly, as we have seen in Austria-Hungary and Russia. But
absolutism was not the only barrier to the emergence of inclusive
economic institutions. At the dawn of the nineteenth century, many parts
of the world, especially in Africa, lacked a state that could provide
even a minimal degree of law and order, which is a prerequisite for
having a modern economy. There was not the equivalent of Peter the Great
in Russia starting the process of political centralization and then
forging Russian absolutism, let alone that of the Tudors in England
centralizing the state without fully destroying—or, more appropriately,
without fully being able to destroy—the Parliament and other constraints
on their power. Without some degree of political centralization, even if
the elites of these African polities had wished to greet
industrialization with open arms, there wouldn’t have been much they
could have done. Somalia, situated in the Horn of Africa, illustrates
the devastating effects of lack of political centralization. Somalia has
been dominated historically by people organized into six clan families.
The four largest of these, the Dir, Darod, Isaq, and Hawiye, all trace
their ancestry back to a mythical ancestor, Samaale. These clan families
originated in the north of Somalia and gradually spread south and east,
and are even today primarily pastoral people who migrate with their
flocks of goats, sheep, and camels. In the south, the Digil and the
Rahanweyn, sedentary agriculturalists, make up the last two of the clan
families. The territories of these clans are depicted on Map 12. Somalis
identify first with their clan family, but these are very large and
contain many subgroups. First among these are clans that trace their
descent back to one of the larger clan families. More significant are
the groupings within clans called diya-paying groups, which consist of
closely related kinspeople who pay and collect diya, or “blood wealth,”
compensation against the murder of one of their members. Somali clans
and diya-paying groups were historically locked in to almost continual
conflict over the scarce resources at their disposal, particularly water
sources and good grazing land for their animals. They also constantly
raided the herds of neighboring clans and diya-paying groups. Though
clans had leaders called sultans, and also elders, these people had no
real power. Political power was very widely dispersed, with every Somali
adult man being able to have his say on decisions that might affect the
clan or group. This was achieved through an informal council made up of
all adult males. There was no written law, no police, and no legal
system to speak of, except that Sharia law was used as a framework
within which informal laws were embedded. These informal laws for a
diya-paying group would be encoded in what was called a heer, a body of
explicitly formulated obligations, rights, and duties the group demanded
others obey in their interactions with the group. With the advent of
colonial rule, these heers began to be written down. For example, the
Hassan Ugaas lineage formed a diya-paying group of about fifteen hundred
men and was a subclan of the Dir clan family in British Somaliland. On
March 8, 1950, their heer was recorded by the British district
commissioner, the first three clauses of which read</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a man of the Hassan Ugaas is murdered by an external group
twenty camels of his blood wealth (100) will be taken by his next of kin
and the remaining eighty camels shared amongst all the Hassan Ugaas. 2.
If a man of the Hassan Ugaas is wounded by an outsider and his injuries
are valued at thirty-three-and-a-third camels, ten camels must be given
to him and the remained to his jiffo-group (a sub-group of the diya
group). 3. Homicide amongst members of the Hassan Ugaas is subject to
compensation at the rate of thirty-three-and-a-third camels, payable
only to the deceased’s next of kin. If the culprit is unable to pay all
or part, he will be assisted by his lineage. The heavy focus of the heer
on killing and wounding reflects the almost constant state of warfare
between diya-paying groups and clans. Central to this was blood wealth
and blood feuding. A crime against a particular person was a crime
against the whole diya-paying group, and necessitated collective
compensation, blood wealth. If such blood wealth was not paid, the
diya-paying group of the person who had committed the crime faced the
collective retribution of the victim. When modern transportation reached
Somalia, blood wealth was extended to people who were killed or injured
in motor accidents. The Hassan Ugaas’s heer didn’t refer only to murder;
clause 6 was “If one man of the Hassan Ugaas insults another at a Hassan
Ugaas council he shall pay 150 shillings to the offended party.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In early 1955, the flocks of two clans, the Habar Tol Ja’lo and the
Habar Yuunis, were grazing close to each other in the region of
Domberelly. A man from the Yuunis was wounded after a dispute with a
member of the Tol Ja’lo over camel herding. The Yuunis clan immediately
retaliated, attacking the Tol Ja’lo clan and killing a man. This death
led, following the code of blood wealth, to the Yuunis clan offering
compensation to the Tol Ja’lo clan, which was accepted. The blood wealth
was to be handed over in person, as usual in the form of camels. At the
handing-over ceremony, one of the Tol Ja’lo killed a member of the
Yuunis, mistaking him for a member of the diya-paying group of the
murderer. This led to all-out warfare, and within the next forty-eight
hours thirteen Yuunis and twenty-six Tol Ja’lo had been killed. Warfare
continued for another year before elders from both clans, brought
together by the English colonial administration, managed to broker a
deal (the exchange of blood wealth) that satisfied both sides and was
paid over the next three years. The paying of blood wealth took place in
the shadow of the threat of force and feuding, and even when it was
paid, it did not necessarily stop conflict. Usually conflict died down
and then flared up again. Political power was thus widely dispersed in
Somali society, almost pluralistically. But without the authority of a
centralized state to enforce order, let alone property rights, this led
not to inclusive institutions. Nobody respected the authority of
another, and nobody, including the British colonial state when it
eventually arrived, was able to impose order. The lack of political
centralization made it impossible for Somalia to benefit from the
Industrial Revolution. In such a climate it would have been unimaginable
to invest in or adopt the new technologies emanating from Britain, or
indeed to create the types of organizations necessary to do so. The
complex politics of Somalia had even more subtle implications for
economic progress. We mentioned earlier some of the great technological
puzzles of African history. Prior to the expansion of colonial rule in
the late nineteenth century, African societies did not use wheeled
transportation or plow agriculture and few had writing. Ethiopia did, as
we have seen. The Somalis also had a written script, but unlike the
Ethiopians, they did not use it. We have already seen instances of this
in African history. African societies may not have used wheels or plows,
but they certainly knew about them. In the case of the Kingdom of Kongo,
as we have seen, this was fundamentally due to the fact that the
economic institutions created no incentives for people to adopt these
technologies. Could the same issues arise with the adoption of
writing?</p>
<p>We can get some sense of this from the Kingdom of Taqali, situated to
the northwest of Somalia, in the Nuba Hills of southern Sudan. The
Kingdom of Taqali was formed in the late eighteenth century by a band of
warriors led by a man called Isma’il, and it stayed independent until
amalgamated into the British Empire in 1884. The Taqali kings and people
had access to writing in Arabic, but it was not used—except by the
kings, for external communication with other polities and diplomatic
correspondence. At first this situation seems very puzzling. The
traditional account of the origin of writing in Mesopotamia is that it
was developed by states in order to record information, control people,
and levy taxes. Wasn’t the Taqali state interested in this?</p>
<p>These questions were investigated by the historian Janet Ewald in the
late 1970s as she tried to reconstruct the history of the Taqali state.
Part of the story is that the citizens resisted the use of writing
because they feared that it would be used to control resources, such as
valuable land, by allowing the state to claim ownership. They also
feared that it would lead to more systematic taxation. The dynasty that
Isma’il started did not gel into a powerful state. Even if it had wanted
to, the state was not strong enough to impose its will over the
objections of the citizens. But there were other, more subtle factors at
work. Various elites also opposed political centralization, for example,
preferring oral to written interaction with citizens, because this
allowed them maximum discretion. Written laws or orders could not be
taken back or denied and were harder to change; they set benchmarks that
governing elites might want to reverse. So neither the ruled nor the
rulers of Taqali saw the introduction of writing to be to their
advantage. The ruled feared how the rulers would use it, and the rulers
themselves saw the absence of writing as aiding their quite precarious
grip on power. It was the politics of Taqali that kept writing from
being introduced. Though the Somalis had even less of a well-defined
elite compared with the Taqali kingdom, it is quite plausible that the
same forces inhibited their use of writing and their adoption of other
basic technologies. The Somali case shows the consequences of the lack
of political centralization for economic growth. The historical
literature does not record instances of attempts to create such
centralization in Somalia. However, it is clear why this would have been
very difficult. To politically centralize would have meant that some
clans would have been subject to the control of others. But they
rejected any such dominance, and the surrender of their power that this
would have entailed; the balance of military power in the society would
also have made it difficult to create such centralized institutions. In
fact, it is likely that any group or clan attempting to centralize power
would not only have faced stiff resistance but would have lost its
existing power and privileges. As a consequence of this lack of
political centralization and the implied absence of even the most basic
security of property rights, Somali society never generated incentives
to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies. As the process of
industrialization was under way in other parts of the world in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Somalis were feuding and
fending for their lives, and their economic backwardness became more
ingrained.</p>
<p>ENDURING BACKWARDNESS</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution created a transformative critical juncture
for the whole world during the nineteenth century and beyond: those
societies that allowed and incentivized their citizens to invest in new
technologies could grow rapidly. But many around the world failed to do
so—or explicitly chose not to do so. Nations under the grip of
extractive political and economic institutions did not generate such
incentives. Spain and Ethiopia provide examples where the absolutist
control of political institutions and the implied extractive economic
institutions choked economic incentives long before the dawn of the
nineteenth century. The outcome was similar in other absolutist
regimes—for example, in Austria-Hungary, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and
China, though in these cases the rulers, because of fear of creative
destruction, not only neglected to encourage economic progress but also
took explicit steps to block the spread of industry and the introduction
of new technologies that would bring industrialization. Absolutism is
not the only form of extractive political institutions and was not the
only factor preventing industrialization. Inclusive political and
economic institutions necessitate some degree of political
centralization so that the state can enforce law and order, uphold
property rights, and encourage economic activity when necessary by
investing in public services. Yet even today, many nations, such as
Afghanistan, Haiti, Nepal, and Somalia, have states that are unable to
maintain the most rudimentary order, and economic incentives are all but
destroyed. The case of Somalia illustrates how the process of
industrialization also passed by such societies. Political
centralization is resisted for the same reason that absolutist regimes
resist change: the often well-placed fear that change will reallocate
political power from those that dominate today to new individuals and
groups. Thus, as absolutism blocks moves toward pluralism and economic
change, so do the traditional elites and clans dominating the scene in
societies without state centralization. As a consequence, societies that
still lacked such centralization in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries were particularly disadvantaged in the age of industry. While
the variety of extractive institutions ranging from absolutism to states
with little centralization failed to take advantage of the spread of
industry, the critical juncture of the Industrial Revolution had very
different effects in other parts of the world. As we will see in chapter
10, societies that had already taken steps toward inclusive political
and economic institutions, such as the United States and Australia, and
those where absolutism was more seriously challenged, such as France and
Japan, took advantage of these new economic opportunities and started a
process of rapid economic growth. As such, the usual pattern of
interaction between a critical juncture and existing institutional
differences leading to further institutional and economic divergence
played out again in the nineteenth century, and this time with an even
bigger bang and more fundamental effects on the prosperity and poverty
of nations.</p>
