<h4 id="the-making-of-prosperity-and-poverty">3. THE MAKING OF
PROSPERITY AND POVERTY</h4>
<p>THE ECONOMICS OF THE 38TH PARALLEL</p>
<p>IN THE SUMMER OF 1945, as the Second World War was drawing to a
close, the Japanese colony in Korea began to collapse. Within a month of
Japan’s August 15 unconditional surrender, Korea was divided at the 38th
parallel into two spheres of influence. The South was administered by
the United States. The North, by Russia. The uneasy peace of the cold
war was shattered in June 1950 when the North Korean army invaded the
South. Though initially the North Koreans made large inroads, capturing
the capital city, Seoul, by the autumn, they were in full retreat. It
was then that Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn and his brother were separated. Hwang
Pyŏng-Wŏn managed to hide and avoid being drafted into the North Korean
army. He stayed in the South and worked as a pharmacist. His brother, a
doctor working in Seoul treating wounded soldiers from the South Korean
army, was taken north as the North Korean army retreated. Dragged apart
in 1950, they met again in 2000 in Seoul for the first time in fifty
years, after the two governments finally agreed to initiate a limited
program of family reunification. As a doctor, Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn’s brother
had ended up working for the air force, a good job in a military
dictatorship. But even those with privileges in North Korea don’t do
that well. When the brothers met, Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn asked about how life
was north of the 38th parallel. He had a car, but his brother didn’t.
“Do you have a telephone?” he asked his brother. “No,” said his brother.
“My daughter, who works at the Foreign Ministry, has a phone, but if you
don’t know the code you can’t call.” Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn recalled how all
the people from the North at the reunion were asking for money, so he
offered some to his brother. But his brother said, “If I go back with
money the government will say, ‘Give that money to us,’ so keep it.”
Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn noticed his brother’s coat was threadbare: “Take off
that coat and leave it, and when you go back wear this one,” he
suggested. “I can’t do that,” his brother replied. “This is just
borrowed from the government to come here.” Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn recalled how
when they parted, his brother was ill at ease and always nervous as
though someone were listening. He was poorer than Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn
imagined. His brother said he lived well, but Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn thought he
looked awful and was thin as a rake. The people of South Korea have
living standards similar to those of Portugal and Spain. To the north,
in the so-called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or North Korea,
living standards are akin to those of a sub-Saharan African country,
about one-tenth of average living standards in South Korea. The health
of North Koreans is in an even worse state; the average North Korean can
expect to live ten years less than his cousins south of the 38th
parallel. Map 7 illustrates in a dramatic way the economic gap between
the Koreas. It plots data on the intensity of light at night from
satellite images. North Korea is almost completely dark due to lack of
electricity; South Korea is blazing with light. These striking
differences are not ancient. In fact, they did not exist prior to the
end of the Second World War. But after 1945, the different governments
in the North and the South adopted very different ways of organizing
their economies. South Korea was led, and its early economic and
political institutions were shaped, by the Harvard- and
Princeton-educated, staunchly anticommunist Syngman Rhee, with
significant support from the United States. Rhee was elected president
in 1948. Forged in the midst of the Korean War and against the threat of
communism spreading to the south of the 38th parallel, South Korea was
no democracy. Both Rhee and his equally famous successor, General Park
Chung-Hee, secured their places in history as authoritarian presidents.
But both governed a market economy where private property was
recognized, and after 1961, Park effectively threw the weight of the
state behind rapid economic growth, channeling credit and subsidies to
firms that were successful. The situation north of the 38th parallel was
different. Kim Il-Sung, a leader of anti-Japanese communist partisans
during the Second World War, established himself as dictator by 1947
and, with the help of the Soviet Union, introduced a rigid form of
centrally planned economy as part of the so-called Juche system. Private
property was outlawed, and markets were banned. Freedoms were curtailed
not only in the marketplace, but in every sphere of North Koreans’
lives—except for those who happened to be part of the very small ruling
elite around Kim Il-Sung and, later, his son and successor Kim Jong-Il.
It should not surprise us that the economic fortunes of South and North
Korea diverged sharply. Kim Il-Sung’s command economy and the Juche
system soon proved to be a disaster. Detailed statistics are not
available from North Korea, which is a secretive state, to say the
least. Nonetheless, available evidence confirms what we know from the
all-too-often recurring famines: not only did industrial production fail
to take off, but North Korea in fact experienced a collapse in
agricultural productivity. Lack of private property meant that few
people had incentives to invest or to exert effort to increase or even
maintain productivity. The stifling, repressive regime was inimical to
innovation and the adoption of new technologies. But Kim Il-Sung, Kim
Jong-Il, and their cronies had no intention of reforming the system, or
introducing private property, markets, private contracts, or changing
economic and political institutions. North Korea continues to stagnate
economically. Meanwhile, in the South, economic institutions encouraged
investment and trade. South Korean politicians invested in education,
achieving high rates of literacy and schooling. South Korean companies
were quick to take advantage of the relatively educated population, the
policies encouraging investment and industrialization, exports, and the
transfer of technology. South Korea quickly became one of East Asia’s
“Miracle Economies,” one of the most rapidly growing nations in the
world. By the late 1990s, in just about half a century, South Korean
growth and North Korean stagnation led to a tenfold gap between the two
halves of this once-united country—imagine what a difference a couple of
centuries could make. The economic disaster of North Korea, which led to
the starvation of millions, when placed against the South Korean
economic success, is striking: neither culture nor geography nor
ignorance can explain the divergent paths of North and South Korea. We
have to look at institutions for an answer.</p>
<p>EXTRACTIVE AND INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Countries differ in their economic success because of their different
institutions, the rules influencing how the economy works, and the
incentives that motivate people. Imagine teenagers in North and South
Korea and what they expect from life. Those in the North grow up in
poverty, without entrepreneurial initiative, creativity, or adequate
education to prepare them for skilled work. Much of the education they
receive at school is pure propaganda, meant to shore up the legitimacy
of the regime; there are few books, let alone computers. After finishing
school, everyone has to go into the army for ten years. These teenagers
know that they will not be able to own property, start a business, or
become more prosperous even if many people engage illegally in private
economic activities to make a living. They also know that they will not
have legal access to markets where they can use their skills or their
earnings to purchase the goods they need and desire. They are even
unsure about what kind of human rights they will have. Those in the
South obtain a good education, and face incentives that encourage them
to exert effort and excel in their chosen vocation. South Korea is a
market economy, built on private property. South Korean teenagers know
that, if successful as entrepreneurs or workers, they can one day enjoy
the fruits of their investments and efforts; they can improve their
standard of living and buy cars, houses, and health care. In the South
the state supports economic activity. So it is possible for
entrepreneurs to borrow money from banks and financial markets, for
foreign companies to enter into partnerships with South Korean firms,
for individuals to take up mortgages to buy houses. In the South, by and
large, you are free to open any business you like. In the North, you are
not. In the South, you can hire workers, sell your products or services,
and spend your money in the marketplace in whichever way you want. In
the North, there are only black markets. These different rules are the
institutions under which North and South Koreans live. Inclusive
economic institutions, such as those in South Korea or in the United
States, are those that allow and encourage participation by the great
mass of people in economic activities that make best use of their
talents and skills and that enable individuals to make the choices they
wish. To be inclusive, economic institutions must feature secure private
property, an unbiased system of law, and a provision of public services
that provides a level playing field in which people can exchange and
contract; it also must permit the entry of new businesses and allow
people to choose their careers.</p>
<p>THE CONTRAST OF South and North Korea, and of the United States and
Latin America, illustrates a general principle. Inclusive economic
institutions foster economic activity, productivity growth, and economic
prosperity. Secure private property rights are central, since only those
with such rights will be willing to invest and increase productivity. A
businessman who expects his output to be stolen, expropriated, or
entirely taxed away will have little incentive to work, let alone any
incentive to undertake investments and innovations. But such rights must
exist for the majority of people in society. In 1680 the English
government conducted a census of the population of its West Indian
colony of Barbados. The census revealed that of the total population on
the island of around 60,000, almost 39,000 were African slaves who were
the property of the remaining one-third of the population. Indeed, they
were mostly the property of the largest 175 sugar planters, who also
owned most of the land. These large planters had secure and
well-enforced property rights over their land and even over their
slaves. If one planter wanted to sell slaves to another, he could do so
and expect a court to enforce such a sale or any other contract he
wrote. Why? Of the forty judges and justices of the peace on the island,
twenty-nine of them were large planters. Also, the eight most senior
military officials were all large planters. Despite well-defined,
secure, and enforced property rights and contracts for the island’s
elite, Barbados did not have inclusive economic institutions, since
two-thirds of the population were slaves with no access to education or
economic opportunities, and no ability or incentive to use their talents
or skills. Inclusive economic institutions require secure property
rights and economic opportunities not just for the elite but for a broad
cross-section of society. Secure property rights, the law, public
services, and the freedom to contract and exchange all rely on the
state, the institution with the coercive capacity to impose order,
prevent theft and fraud, and enforce contracts between private parties.
To function well, society also needs other public services: roads and a
transport network so that goods can be transported; a public
infrastructure so that economic activity can flourish; and some type of
basic regulation to prevent fraud and malfeasance. Though many of these
public services can be provided by markets and private citizens, the
degree of coordination necessary to do so on a large scale often eludes
all but a central authority. The state is thus inexorably intertwined
with economic institutions, as the enforcer of law and order, private
property, and contracts, and often as a key provider of public services.
Inclusive economic institutions need and use the state. The economic
institutions of North Korea or of colonial Latin America—the mita,
encomienda, or repartimiento described earlier—do not have these
properties. Private property is nonexistent in North Korea. In colonial
Latin America there was private property for Spaniards, but the property
of the indigenous peoples was highly insecure. In neither type of
society was the vast mass of people able to make the economic decisions
they wanted to; they were subject to mass coercion. In neither type of
society was the power of the state used to provide key public services
that promoted prosperity. In North Korea, the state built an education
system to inculcate propaganda, but was unable to prevent famine. In
colonial Latin America, the state focused on coercing indigenous
peoples. In neither type of society was there a level playing field or
an unbiased legal system. In North Korea, the legal system is an arm of
the ruling Communist Party, and in Latin America it was a tool of
discrimination against the mass of people. We call such institutions,
which have opposite properties to those we call inclusive, extractive
economic institutions—extractive because such institutions are designed
to extract incomes and wealth from one subset of society to benefit a
different subset.</p>
<p>ENGINES OF PROSPERITY</p>
<p>Inclusive economic institutions create inclusive markets, which not
only give people freedom to pursue the vocations in life that best suit
their talents but also provide a level playing field that gives them the
opportunity to do so. Those who have good ideas will be able to start
businesses, workers will tend to go to activities where their
productivity is greater, and less efficient firms can be replaced by
more efficient ones. Contrast how people choose their occupations under
inclusive markets to colonial Peru and Bolivia, where under the mita,
many were forced to work in silver and mercury mines, regardless of
their skills or whether they wanted to. Inclusive markets are not just
free markets. Barbados in the seventeenth century also had markets. But
in the same way that it lacked property rights for all but the narrow
planter elite, its markets were far from inclusive; markets in slaves
were in fact one part of the economic institutions systematically
coercing the majority of the population and robbing them of the ability
to choose their occupations and how they should utilize their talents.
Inclusive economic institutions also pave the way for two other engines
of prosperity: technology and education. Sustained economic growth is
almost always accompanied by technological improvements that enable
people (labor), land, and existing capital (buildings, existing
machines, and so on) to become more productive. Think of our
great-great-grandparents, just over a century ago, who did not have
access to planes or automobiles or most of the drugs and health care we
now take for granted, not to mention indoor plumbing, air-conditioning,
shopping malls, radio, or motion pictures; let alone information
technology, robotics, or computer-controlled machinery. And going back a
few more generations, the technological know-how and living standards
were even more backward, so much so that we would find it hard to
imagine how most people struggled through life. These improvements
follow from science and from entrepreneurs such as Thomas Edison, who
applied science to create profitable businesses. This process of
innovation is made possible by economic institutions that encourage
private property, uphold contracts, create a level playing field, and
encourage and allow the entry of new businesses that can bring new
technologies to life. It should therefore be no surprise that it was
U.S. society, not Mexico or Peru, that produced Thomas Edison, and that
it was South Korea, not North Korea, that today produces technologically
innovative companies such as Samsung and Hyundai. Intimately linked to
technology are the education, skills, competencies, and know-how of the
workforce, acquired in schools, at home, and on the job. We are so much
more productive than a century ago not just because of better technology
embodied in machines but also because of the greater know-how that
workers possess. All the technology in the world would be of little use
without workers who knew how to operate it. But there is more to skills
and competencies than just the ability to run machines. It is the
education and skills of the workforce that generate the scientific
knowledge upon which our progress is built and that enable the
adaptation and adoption of these technologies in diverse lines of
business. Though we saw in chapter 1 that many of the innovators of the
Industrial Revolution and afterward, like Thomas Edison, were not highly
educated, these innovations were much simpler than modern technology.
Today technological change requires education both for the innovator and
the worker. And here we see the importance of economic institutions that
create a level playing field. The United States could produce, or
attract from foreign lands, the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sergey
Brin, Larry Page, and Jeff Bezos, and the hundreds of scientists who
made fundamental discoveries in information technology, nuclear power,
biotech, and other fields upon which these entrepreneurs built their
businesses. The supply of talent was there to be harnessed because most
teenagers in the United States have access to as much schooling as they
wish or are capable of attaining. Now imagine a different society, for
example the Congo or Haiti, where a large fraction of the population has
no means of attending school, or where, if they manage to go to school,
the quality of teaching is lamentable, where teachers do not show up for
work, and even if they do, there may not be any books. The low education
level of poor countries is caused by economic institutions that fail to
create incentives for parents to educate their children and by political
institutions that fail to induce the government to build, finance, and
support schools and the wishes of parents and children. The price these
nations pay for low education of their population and lack of inclusive
markets is high. They fail to mobilize their nascent talent. They have
many potential Bill Gateses and perhaps one or two Albert Einsteins who
are now working as poor, uneducated farmers, being coerced to do what
they don’t want to do or being drafted into the army, because they never
had the opportunity to realize their vocation in life. The ability of
economic institutions to harness the potential of inclusive markets,
encourage technological innovation, invest in people, and mobilize the
talents and skills of a large number of individuals is critical for
economic growth. Explaining why so many economic institutions fail to
meet these simple objectives is the central theme of this book.</p>
<p>EXTRACTIVE AND INCLUSIVE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>All economic institutions are created by society. Those of North
Korea, for example, were forced on its citizens by the communists who
took over the country in the 1940s, while those of colonial Latin
America were imposed by Spanish conquistadors. South Korea ended up with
very different economic institutions than the North because different
people with different interests and objectives made the decisions about
how to structure society. In other words, South Korea had different
politics. Politics is the process by which a society chooses the rules
that will govern it. Politics surrounds institutions for the simple
reason that while inclusive institutions may be good for the economic
prosperity of a nation, some people or groups, such as the elite of the
Communist Party of North Korea or the sugar planters of colonial
Barbados, will be much better off by setting up institutions that are
extractive. When there is conflict over institutions, what happens
depends on which people or group wins out in the game of politics—who
can get more support, obtain additional resources, and form more
effective alliances. In short, who wins depends on the distribution of
political power in society. The political institutions of a society are
a key determinant of the outcome of this game. They are the rules that
govern incentives in politics. They determine how the government is
chosen and which part of the government has the right to do what.
Political institutions determine who has power in society and to what
ends that power can be used. If the distribution of power is narrow and
unconstrained, then the political institutions are absolutist, as
exemplified by the absolutist monarchies reigning throughout the world
during much of history. Under absolutist political institutions such as
those in North Korea and colonial Latin America, those who can wield
this power will be able to set up economic institutions to enrich
themselves and augment their power at the expense of society. In
contrast, political institutions that distribute power broadly in
society and subject it to constraints are pluralistic. Instead of being
vested in a single individual or a narrow group, political power rests
with a broad coalition or a plurality of groups. There is obviously a
close connection between pluralism and inclusive economic institutions.
But the key to understanding why South Korea and the United States have
inclusive economic institutions is not just their pluralistic political
institutions but also their sufficiently centralized and powerful
states. A telling contrast is with the East African nation of Somalia.
As we will see later in the book, political power in Somalia has long
been widely distributed—almost pluralistic. Indeed there is no real
authority that can control or sanction what anyone does. Society is
divided into deeply antagonistic clans that cannot dominate one another.
The power of one clan is constrained only by the guns of another. This
distribution of power leads not to inclusive institutions but to chaos,
and at the root of it is the Somali state’s lack of any kind of
political centralization, or state centralization, and its inability to
enforce even the minimal amount of law and order to support economic
activity, trade, or even the basic security of its citizens. Max Weber,
who we met in the previous chapter, provided the most famous and widely
accepted definition of the state, identifying it with the “monopoly of
legitimate violence” in society. Without such a monopoly and the degree
of centralization that it entails, the state cannot play its role as
enforcer of law and order, let alone provide public services and
encourage and regulate economic activity. When the state fails to
achieve almost any political centralization, society sooner or later
descends into chaos, as did Somalia. We will refer to political
institutions that are sufficiently centralized and pluralistic as
inclusive political institutions. When either of these conditions fails,
we will refer to the institutions as extractive political institutions.
There is strong synergy between economic and political institutions.
Extractive political institutions concentrate power in the hands of a
narrow elite and place few constraints on the exercise of this power.
Economic institutions are then often structured by this elite to extract
resources from the rest of the society. Extractive economic institutions
thus naturally accompany extractive political institutions. In fact,
they must inherently depend on extractive political institutions for
their survival. Inclusive political institutions, vesting power broadly,
would tend to uproot economic institutions that expropriate the
resources of the many, erect entry barriers, and suppress the
functioning of markets so that only a few benefit. In Barbados, for
example, the plantation system based on the exploitation of slaves could
not have survived without political institutions that suppressed and
completely excluded the slaves from the political process. The economic
system impoverishing millions for the benefit of a narrow communist
elite in North Korea would also be unthinkable without the total
political domination of the Communist Party. This synergistic
relationship between extractive economic and political institutions
introduces a strong feedback loop: political institutions enable the
elites controlling political power to choose economic institutions with
few constraints or opposing forces. They also enable the elites to
structure future political institutions and their evolution. Extractive
economic institutions, in turn, enrich the same elites, and their
economic wealth and power help consolidate their political dominance. In
Barbados or in Latin America, for example, the colonists were able to
use their political power to impose a set of economic institutions that
made them huge fortunes at the expense of the rest of the population.
The resources these economic institutions generated enabled these elites
to build armies and security forces to defend their absolutist monopoly
of political power. The implication of course is that extractive
political and economic institutions support each other and tend to
persist. There is in fact more to the synergy between extractive
economic and political institutions. When existing elites are challenged
under extractive political institutions and the newcomers break through,
the newcomers are likewise subject to only a few constraints. They thus
have incentives to maintain these political institutions and create a
similar set of economic institutions, as Porfirio Díaz and the elite
surrounding him did at the end of the nineteenth century in Mexico.
Inclusive economic institutions, in turn, are forged on foundations laid
by inclusive political institutions, which make power broadly
distributed in society and constrain its arbitrary exercise. Such
political institutions also make it harder for others to usurp power and
undermine the foundations of inclusive institutions. Those controlling
political power cannot easily use it to set up extractive economic
institutions for their own benefit. Inclusive economic institutions, in
turn, create a more equitable distribution of resources, facilitating
the persistence of inclusive political institutions. It was not a
coincidence that when, in 1618, the Virginia Company gave land, and
freedom from their draconian contracts, to the colonists it had
previously tried to coerce, the General Assembly in the following year
allowed the colonists to begin governing themselves. Economic rights
without political rights would not have been trusted by the colonists,
who had seen the persistent efforts of the Virginia Company to coerce
them. Neither would these economies have been stable and durable. In
fact, combinations of extractive and inclusive institutions are
generally unstable. Extractive economic institutions under inclusive
political institutions are unlikely to survive for long, as our
discussion of Barbados suggests. Similarly, inclusive economic
institutions will neither support nor be supported by extractive
political ones. Either they will be transformed into extractive economic
institutions to the benefit of the narrow interests that hold power, or
the economic dynamism they create will destabilize the extractive
political institutions, opening the way for the emergence of inclusive
political institutions. Inclusive economic institutions also tend to
reduce the benefits the elites can enjoy by ruling over extractive
political institutions, since those institutions face competition in the
marketplace and are constrained by the contracts and property rights of
the rest of society.</p>
<p>WHY NOT ALWAYS CHOOSE PROSPERITY?</p>
<p>Political and economic institutions, which are ultimately the choice
of society, can be inclusive and encourage economic growth. Or they can
be extractive and become impediments to economic growth. Nations fail
when they have extractive economic institutions, supported by extractive
political institutions that impede and even block economic growth. But
this means that the choice of institutions—that is, the politics of
institutions—is central to our quest for understanding the reasons for
the success and failure of nations. We have to understand why the
politics of some societies lead to inclusive institutions that foster
economic growth, while the politics of the vast majority of societies
throughout history has led, and still leads today, to extractive
institutions that hamper economic growth. It might seem obvious that
everyone should have an interest in creating the type of economic
institutions that will bring prosperity. Wouldn’t every citizen, every
politician, and even a predatory dictator want to make his country as
wealthy as possible?</p>
<p>Let’s return to the Kingdom of Kongo we discussed earlier. Though
this kingdom collapsed in the seventeenth century, it provided the name
for the modern country that became independent from Belgian colonial
rule in 1960. As an independent polity, Congo experienced almost
unbroken economic decline and mounting poverty under the rule of Joseph
Mobutu between 1965 and 1997. This decline continued after Mobutu was
overthrown by Laurent Kabila. Mobutu created a highly extractive set of
economic institutions. The citizens were impoverished, but Mobutu and
the elite surrounding him, known as Les Grosses Legumes (the Big
Vegetables), became fabulously wealthy. Mobutu built himself a palace at
his birthplace, Gbadolite, in the north of the country, with an airport
large enough to land a supersonic Concord jet, a plane he frequently
rented from Air France for travel to Europe. In Europe he bought castles
and owned large tracts of the Belgian capital of Brussels. Wouldn’t it
have been better for Mobutu to set up economic institutions that
increased the wealth of the Congolese rather than deepening their
poverty? If Mobutu had managed to increase the prosperity of his nation,
would he not have been able to appropriate even more money, buy a
Concord instead of renting one, have more castles and mansions, possibly
a bigger and more powerful army? Unfortunately for the citizens of many
countries in the world, the answer is no. Economic institutions that
create incentives for economic progress may simultaneously redistribute
income and power in such a way that a predatory dictator and others with
political power may become worse off. The fundamental problem is that
there will necessarily be disputes and conflict over economic
institutions. Different institutions have different consequences for the
prosperity of a nation, how that prosperity is distributed, and who has
power. The economic growth which can be induced by institutions creates
both winners and losers. This was clear during the Industrial Revolution
in England, which laid the foundations of the prosperity we see in the
rich countries of the world today. It centered on a series of
pathbreaking technological changes in steam power, transportation, and
textile production. Even though mechanization led to enormous increases
in total incomes and ultimately became the foundation of modern
industrial society, it was bitterly opposed by many. Not because of
ignorance or shortsightedness; quite the opposite. Rather, such
opposition to economic growth has its own, unfortunately coherent,
logic. Economic growth and technological change are accompanied by what
the great economist Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction. They
replace the old with the new. New sectors attract resources away from
old ones. New firms take business away from established ones. New
technologies make existing skills and machines obsolete. The process of
economic growth and the inclusive institutions upon which it is based
create losers as well as winners in the political arena and in the
economic marketplace. Fear of creative destruction is often at the root
of the opposition to inclusive economic and political institutions.
European history provides a vivid example of the consequences of
creative destruction. On the eve of the Industrial Revolution in the
eighteenth century, the governments of most European countries were
controlled by aristocracies and traditional elites, whose major source
of income was from landholdings or from trading privileges they enjoyed
thanks to monopolies granted and entry barriers imposed by monarchs.
Consistent with the idea of creative destruction, the spread of
industries, factories, and towns took resources away from the land,
reduced land rents, and increased the wages that landowners had to pay
their workers. These elites also saw the emergence of new businessmen
and merchants eroding their trading privileges. All in all, they were
the clear economic losers from industrialization. Urbanization and the
emergence of a socially conscious middle and working class also
challenged the political monopoly of landed aristocracies. So with the
spread of the Industrial Revolution the aristocracies weren’t just the
economic losers; they also risked becoming political losers, losing
their hold on political power. With their economic and political power
under threat, these elites often formed a formidable opposition against
industrialization. The aristocracy was not the only loser from
industrialization. Artisans whose manual skills were being replaced by
mechanization likewise opposed the spread of industry. Many organized
against it, rioting and destroying the machines they saw as responsible
for the decline of their livelihood. They were the Luddites, a word that
has today become synonymous with resistance to technological change.
John Kay, English inventor of the “flying shuttle” in 1733, one of the
first significant improvements in the mechanization of weaving, had his
house burned down by Luddites in 1753. James Hargreaves, inventor of the
“spinning jenny,” a complementary revolutionary improvement in spinning,
got similar treatment. In reality, the artisans were much less effective
than the landowners and elites in opposing industrialization. The
Luddites did not possess the political power—the ability to affect
political outcomes against the wishes of other groups—of the landed
aristocracy. In England, industrialization marched on, despite the
Luddites’ opposition, because aristocratic opposition, though real, was
muted. In the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian empires, where the
absolutist monarchs and aristocrats had far more to lose,
industrialization was blocked. In consequence, the economies of
Austria-Hungary and Russia stalled. They fell behind other European
nations, where economic growth took off during the nineteenth century.
The success and failure of specific groups notwithstanding, one lesson
is clear: powerful groups often stand against economic progress and
against the engines of prosperity. Economic growth is not just a process
of more and better machines, and more and better educated people, but
also a transformative and destabilizing process associated with
widespread creative destruction. Growth thus moves forward only if not
blocked by the economic losers who anticipate that their economic
privileges will be lost and by the political losers who fear that their
political power will be eroded. Conflict over scarce resources, income
and power, translates into conflict over the rules of the game, the
economic institutions, which will determine the economic activities and
who will benefit from them. When there is a conflict, the wishes of all
parties cannot be simultaneously met. Some will be defeated and
frustrated, while others will succeed in securing outcomes they like.
Who the winners of this conflict are has fundamental implications for a
nation’s economic trajectory. If the groups standing against growth are
the winners, they can successfully block economic growth, and the
economy will stagnate. The logic of why the powerful would not
necessarily want to set up the economic institutions that promote
economic success extends easily to the choice of political institutions.
In an absolutist regime, some elites can wield power to set up economic
institutions they prefer. Would they be interested in changing political
institutions to make them more pluralistic? In general not, since this
would only dilute their political power, making it more difficult, maybe
impossible, for them to structure economic institutions to further their
own interests. Here again we see a ready source of conflict. The people
who suffer from the extractive economic institutions cannot hope for
absolutist rulers to voluntarily change political institutions and
redistribute power in society. The only way to change these political
institutions is to force the elite to create more pluralistic
institutions. In the same way that there is no reason why political
institutions should automatically become pluralistic, there is no
natural tendency toward political centralization. There would certainly
be incentives to create more centralized state institutions in any
society, particularly in those with no such centralization whatsoever.
For example, in Somalia, if one clan created a centralized state capable
of imposing order on the country, this could lead to economic benefits
and make this clan richer. What stops this? The main barrier to
political centralization is again a form of fear from change: any clan,
group, or politician attempting to centralize power in the state will
also be centralizing power in their own hands, and this is likely to
meet the ire of other clans, groups, and individuals, who would be the
political losers of this process. Lack of political centralization means
not only lack of law and order in much of a territory but also there
being many actors with sufficient powers to block or disrupt things, and
the fear of their opposition and violent reaction will often deter many
would-be centralizers. Political centralization is likely only when one
group of people is sufficiently more powerful than others to build a
state. In Somalia, power is evenly balanced, and no one clan can impose
its will on any other. Therefore, the lack of political centralization
persists.</p>
<p>THE LONG AGONY OF THE CONGO</p>
<p>There are few better, or more depressing, examples of the forces that
explain the logic of why economic prosperity is so persistently rare
under extractive institutions or that illustrate the synergy between
extractive economic and political institutions than the Congo.
Portuguese and Dutch visitors to Kongo in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries remarked on the “miserable poverty” there. Technology was
rudimentary by European standards, with the Kongolese having neither
writing, the wheel, nor the plow. The reason for this poverty, and the
reluctance of Kongolese farmers to adopt better technologies when they
learned of them, is clear from existing historical accounts. It was due
to the extractive nature of the country’s economic institutions. As we
have seen, the Kingdom of Kongo was governed by the king in Mbanza,
subsequently São Salvador. Areas away from the capital were ruled by an
elite who played the roles of governors of different parts of the
kingdom. The wealth of this elite was based on slave plantations around
São Salvador and the extraction of taxes from the rest of the country.
Slavery was central to the economy, used by the elite to supply their
own plantations and by Europeans on the coast. Taxes were arbitrary; one
tax was even collected every time the king’s beret fell off. To become
more prosperous, the Kongolese people would have had to save and
invest—for example, by buying plows. But it would not have been
worthwhile, since any extra output that they produced using better
technology would have been subject to expropriation by the king and his
elite. Instead of investing to increase their productivity and selling
their products in markets, the Kongolese moved their villages away from
the market; they were trying to be as far away from the roads as
possible, in order to reduce the incidence of plunder and to escape the
reach of slave traders. The poverty of the Kongo was therefore the
result of extractive economic institutions that blocked all the engines
of prosperity or even made them work in reverse. The Kongo’s government
provided very few public services to its citizens, not even basic ones,
such as secure property rights or law and order. On the contrary, the
government was itself the biggest threat to its subjects’ property and
human rights. The institution of slavery meant that the most fundamental
market of all, an inclusive labor market where people can choose their
occupation or jobs in ways that are so crucial for a prosperous economy,
did not exist. Moreover, long-distance trade and mercantile activities
were controlled by the king and were open only to those associated with
him. Though the elite quickly became literate after the Portuguese
introduced writing, the king made no attempt to spread literacy to the
great mass of the population. Nevertheless, though “miserable poverty”
was widespread, the Kongolese extractive institutions had their own
impeccable logic: they made a few people, those with political power,
very rich. In the sixteenth century, the king of Kongo and the
aristocracy were able to import European luxury goods and were
surrounded by servants and slaves. The roots of the economic
institutions of Kongolese society flowed from the distribution of
political power in society and thus from the nature of political
institutions. There was nothing to stop the king from taking people’s
possessions or bodies, other than the threat of revolt. Though this
threat was real, it was not enough to make people or their wealth
secure. The political institutions of Kongo were truly absolutist,
making the king and the elite subject to essentially no constraints, and
it gave no say to the citizens in the way their society was organized.
Of course, it is not difficult to see that the political institutions of
Kongo contrast sharply with inclusive political institutions where power
is constrained and broadly distributed. The absolutist institutions of
Kongo were kept in place by the army. The king had a standing army of
five thousand troops in the mid-seventeenth century, with a core of five
hundred musketeers—a formidable force for its time. Why the king and the
aristocracy so eagerly adopted European firearms is thus easy to
understand. There was no chance of sustained economic growth under this
set of economic institutions and even incentives for generating
temporary growth were highly limited. Reforming economic institutions to
improve individual property rights would have made the Kongolese society
at large more prosperous. But it is unlikely that the elite would have
benefited from this wider prosperity. First, such reforms would have
made the elite economic losers, by undermining the wealth that the slave
trade and slave plantations brought them. Second, such reforms would
have been possible only if the political power of the king and the elite
were curtailed. For instance, if the king continued to command his five
hundred musketeers, who would have believed an announcement that slavery
had been abolished? What would have stopped the king from changing his
mind later on? The only real guarantee would have been a change in
political institutions so that citizens gained some countervailing
political power, giving them some say over taxation or what the
musketeers did. But in this case it is dubious that sustaining the
consumption and lifestyle of the king and the elite would have been high
on their list of priorities. In this scenario, changes that would have
created better economic institutions in society would have made the king
and aristocracy political as well as economic losers. The interaction of
economic and political institutions five hundred years ago is still
relevant for understanding why the modern state of Congo is still
miserably poor today. The advent of European rule in this area, and
deeper into the basin of the River Congo at the time of the “scramble
for Africa” in the late nineteenth century, led to an insecurity of
human and property rights even more egregious than that which
characterized the precolonial Kongo. In addition, it reproduced the
pattern of extractive institutions and political absolutism that
empowered and enriched a few at the expense of the masses, though the
few now were Belgian colonialists, most notably King Leopold II. When
Congo became independent in 1960, the same pattern of economic
institutions, incentives, and performance reproduced itself. These
Congolese extractive economic institutions were again supported by
highly extractive political institutions. The situation was worsened
because European colonialism created a polity, Congo, made up of many
different precolonial states and societies that the national state, run
from Kinshasa, had little control over. Though President Mobutu used the
state to enrich himself and his cronies—for example, through the
Zairianization program of 1973, which involved the mass expropriation of
foreign economic interests—he presided over a noncentralized state with
little authority over much of the country, and had to appeal to foreign
assistance to stop the provinces of Katanga and Kasai from seceding in
the 1960s. This lack of political centralization, almost to the point of
total collapse of the state, is a feature that Congo shares with much of
sub-Saharan Africa. The modern Democratic Republic of Congo remains poor
because its citizens still lack the economic institutions that create
the basic incentives that make a society prosperous. It is not
geography, culture, or the ignorance of its citizens or politicians that
keep the Congo poor, but its extractive economic institutions. These are
still in place after all these centuries because political power
continues to be narrowly concentrated in the hands of an elite who have
little incentive to enforce secure property rights for the people, to
provide the basic public services that would improve the quality of
life, or to encourage economic progress. Rather, their interests are to
extract income and sustain their power. They have not used this power to
build a centralized state, for to do so would create the same problems
of opposition and political challenges that promoting economic growth
would. Moreover, as in much of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa,
infighting triggered by rival groups attempting to take control of
extractive institutions destroyed any tendency for state centralization
that might have existed. The history of the Kingdom of Kongo, and the
more recent history of the Congo, vividly illustrates how political
institutions determine economic institutions and, through these, the
economic incentives and the scope for economic growth. It also
illustrates the symbiotic relationship between political absolutism and
economic institutions that empower and enrich a few at the expense of
many.</p>
<p>GROWTH UNDER EXTRACTIVE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Congo today is an extreme example, with lawlessness and highly
insecure property rights. However, in most cases such extremism would
not serve the interest of the elite, since it would destroy all economic
incentives and generate few resources to be extracted. The central
thesis of this book is that economic growth and prosperity are
associated with inclusive economic and political institutions, while
extractive institutions typically lead to stagnation and poverty. But
this implies neither that extractive institutions can never generate
growth nor that all extractive institutions are created equal. There are
two distinct but complementary ways in which growth under extractive
political institutions can emerge. First, even if economic institutions
are extractive, growth is possible when elites can directly allocate
resources to high-productivity activities that they themselves control.
A prominent example of this type of growth under extractive institutions
was the Caribbean Islands between the sixteenth and eighteenth
centuries. Most people were slaves, working under gruesome conditions in
plantations, living barely above subsistence level. Many died from
malnutrition and exhaustion. In Barbados, Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a small minority, the planter
elite, controlled all political power and owned all the assets,
including all the slaves. While the majority had no rights, the planter
elite’s property and assets were well protected. Despite the extractive
economic institutions that savagely exploited the majority of the
population, these islands were among the richest places in the world,
because they could produce sugar and sell it in world markets. The
economy of the islands stagnated only when there was a need to shift to
new economic activities, which threatened both the incomes and the
political power of the planter elite. Another example is the economic
growth and industrialization of the Soviet Union from the first
Five-Year Plan in 1928 until the 1970s. Political and economic
institutions were highly extractive, and markets were heavily
constrained. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union was able to achieve rapid
economic growth because it could use the power of the state to move
resources from agriculture, where they were very inefficiently used,
into industry. The second type of growth under extractive political
institutions arises when the institutions permit the development of
somewhat, even if not completely, inclusive economic institutions. Many
societies with extractive political institutions will shy away from
inclusive economic institutions because of fear of creative destruction.
But the degree to which the elite manage to monopolize power varies
across societies. In some, the position of the elite could be
sufficiently secure that they may permit some moves toward inclusive
economic institutions when they are fairly certain that this will not
threaten their political power. Alternatively, the historical situation
could be such as to endow an extractive political regime with rather
inclusive economic institutions, which they decide not to block. These
provide the second way in which growth can take place under extractive
political institutions. The rapid industrialization of South Korea under
General Park is an example. Park came to power via a military coup in
1961, but he did so in a society heavily supported by the United States
and with an economy where economic institutions were essentially
inclusive. Though Park’s regime was authoritarian, it felt secure enough
to promote economic growth, and in fact did so very actively—perhaps
partly because the regime was not directly supported by extractive
economic institutions. Differently from the Soviet Union and most other
cases of growth under extractive institutions, South Korea transitioned
from extractive political institutions toward inclusive political
institutions in the 1980s. This successful transition was due to a
confluence of factors. By the 1970s, economic institutions in South
Korea had become sufficiently inclusive that they reduced one of the
strong rationales for extractive political institutions—the economic
elite had little to gain from their own or the military’s dominance of
politics. The relative equality of income in South Korea also meant that
the elite had less to fear from pluralism and democracy. The key
influence of the United States, particularly given the threat from North
Korea, also meant that the strong democracy movement that challenged the
military dictatorship could not be repressed for long. Though General
Park’s assassination in 1979 was followed by another military coup, led
by Chun Doo-hwan, Chun’s chosen successor, Roh Tae-woo, initiated a
process of political reforms that led to the consolidation of a
pluralistic democracy after 1992. Of course, no transition of this sort
took place in the Soviet Union. In consequence, Soviet growth ran out of
steam, and the economy began to collapse in the 1980s and then totally
fell apart in the 1990s. Chinese economic growth today also has several
commonalities with both the Soviet and South Korean experiences. While
the early stages of Chinese growth were spearheaded by radical market
reforms in the agricultural sector, reforms in the industrial sector
have been more muted. Even today, the state and the Communist Party play
a central role in deciding which sectors and which companies will
receive additional capital and will expand—in the process, making and
breaking fortunes. As in the Soviet Union in its heyday, China is
growing rapidly, but this is still growth under extractive institutions,
under the control of the state, with little sign of a transition to
inclusive political institutions. The fact that Chinese economic
institutions are still far from fully inclusive also suggests that a
South Korean–style transition is less likely, though of course not
impossible. It is worth noting that political centralization is key to
both ways in which growth under extractive political institutions can
occur. Without some degree of political centralization, the planter
elite in Barbados, Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica would not have been able to
keep law and order and defend their own assets and property. Without
significant political centralization and a firm grip on political power,
neither the South Korean military elites nor the Chinese Communist Party
would have felt secure enough to manufacture significant economic
reforms and still manage to cling to power. And without such
centralization, the state in the Soviet Union or China could not have
been able to coordinate economic activity to channel resources toward
high productivity areas. A major dividing line between extractive
political institutions is therefore their degree of political
centralization. Those without it, such as many in sub-Saharan Africa,
will find it difficult to achieve even limited growth. Even though
extractive institutions can generate some growth, they will usually not
generate sustained economic growth, and certainly not the type of growth
that is accompanied by creative destruction. When both political and
economic institutions are extractive, the incentives will not be there
for creative destruction and technological change. For a while the state
may be able to create rapid economic growth by allocating resources and
people by fiat, but this process is intrinsically limited. When the
limits are hit, growth stops, as it did in the Soviet Union in the
1970s. Even when the Soviets achieved rapid economic growth, there was
little technological change in most of the economy, though by pouring
massive resources into the military they were able to develop military
technologies and even pull ahead of the United States in the space and
nuclear race for a short while. But this growth without creative
destruction and without broad-based technological innovation was not
sustainable and came to an abrupt end. In addition, the arrangements
that support economic growth under extractive political institutions
are, by their nature, fragile—they can collapse or can be easily
destroyed by the infighting that the extractive institutions themselves
generate. In fact, extractive political and economic institutions create
a general tendency for infighting, because they lead to the
concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a narrow elite. If
another group can overwhelm and outmaneuver this elite and take control
of the state, they will be the ones enjoying this wealth and power.
Consequently, as our discussion of the collapse of the later Roman
Empire and the Maya cities will illustrate (this page and this page),
fighting to control the all-powerful state is always latent, and it will
periodically intensify and bring the undoing of these regimes, as it
turns into civil war and sometimes into total breakdown and collapse of
the state. One implication of this is that even if a society under
extractive institutions initially achieves some degree of state
centralization, it will not last. In fact, the infighting to take
control of extractive institutions often leads to civil wars and
widespread lawlessness, enshrining a persistent absence of state
centralization as in many nations in sub-Saharan Africa and some in
Latin America and South Asia. Finally, when growth comes under
extractive political institutions but where economic institutions have
inclusive aspects, as they did in South Korea, there is always the
danger that economic institutions become more extractive and growth
stops. Those controlling political power will eventually find it more
beneficial to use their power to limit competition, to increase their
share of the pie, or even to steal and loot from others rather than
support economic progress. The distribution and ability to exercise
power will ultimately undermine the very foundations of economic
prosperity, unless political institutions are transformed from
extractive to inclusive.</p>
