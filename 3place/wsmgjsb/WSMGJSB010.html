<h4 id="reversing-development">9. REVERSING DEVELOPMENT</h4>
<p>SPICE AND GENOCIDE</p>
<p>THE MOLUCCAN ARCHIPELAGO in modern Indonesia is made up of three
groups of islands. In the early seventeenth century, the northern
Moluccas housed the independent kingdoms of Tidore, Ternate, and Bacan.
The middle Moluccas were home to the island kingdom of Ambon. In the
south were the Banda Islands, a small archipelago that was not yet
politically unified. Though they seem remote to us today, the Moluccas
were then central to world trade as the only producers of the valuable
spices cloves, mace, and nutmeg. Of these, nutmeg and mace grew only in
the Banda Islands. Inhabitants of these islands produced and exported
these rare spices in exchange for food and manufactured goods coming
from the island of Java, from the entrepôt of Melaka on the Malaysian
Peninsula, and from India, China, and Arabia. The first contact the
inhabitants had with Europeans was in the sixteenth century, with
Portuguese mariners who came to buy spices. Before then spices had to be
shipped through the Middle East, via trade routes controlled by the
Ottoman Empire. Europeans searched for a passage around Africa or across
the Atlantic to gain direct access to the Spice Islands and the spice
trade. The Cape of Good Hope was rounded by the Portuguese mariner
Bartolomeu Dias in 1488, and India was reached via the same route by
Vasco da Gama in 1498. For the first time the Europeans now had their
own independent route to the Spice Islands. The Portuguese immediately
set about the task of trying to control the trade in spices. They
captured Melaka in 1511. Strategically situated on the western side of
the Malaysian Peninsula, merchants from all over Southeast Asia came
there to sell their spices to other merchants, Indian, Chinese, and
Arabs, who then shipped them to the West. As the Portuguese traveler
Tomé Pires put it in 1515: “The trade and commerce between the different
nations for a thousand leagues on every hand must come to Melaka …
Whoever is lord of Melaka has his hands at the throat of Venice.”</p>
<p>With Melaka in their hands, the Portuguese systematically tried to
gain a monopoly of the valuable spice trade. They failed. The opponents
they faced were not negligible. Between the fourteenth and sixteenth
centuries, there was a great deal of economic development in Southeast
Asia based on trade in spices. City-states such as Aceh, Banten, Melaka,
Makassar, Pegu, and Brunei expanded rapidly, producing and exporting
spices along with other products such as hardwoods. These states had
absolutist forms of government similar to those in Europe in the same
period. The development of political institutions was spurred by similar
processes, including technological change in methods of warfare and
international trade. State institutions became more centralized, with a
king at the center claiming absolute power. Like absolutist rulers in
Europe, Southeast Asian kings relied heavily on revenues from trade,
both engaging in it themselves and granting monopolies to local and
foreign elites. As in absolutist Europe, this generated some economic
growth but was a far-from-ideal set of economic institutions for
economic prosperity, with significant entry barriers and insecure
property rights for most. But the process of commercialization was under
way even as the Portuguese were trying to establish their dominance in
the Indian Ocean. The presence of Europeans swelled and had a much
greater impact with the arrival of the Dutch. The Dutch quickly realized
that monopolizing the supply of the valuable spices of the Moluccas
would be much more profitable than competing against local or other
European traders. In 1600 they persuaded the ruler of Ambon to sign an
exclusive agreement that gave them the monopoly on the clove trade in
Ambon. With the founding of the Dutch East India Company in 1602, the
Dutch attempts to capture the entire spice trade and eliminate their
competitors, by hook or by crook, took a turn for the better for the
Dutch and for the worse for Southeast Asia. The Dutch East India Company
was the second European joint stock company, following the English East
India Company, major landmarks in the development of the modern
corporation, which would subsequently play a major role in European
industrial growth. It was also the second company that had its own army
and the power to wage war and colonize foreign lands. With the military
power of the company now brought to bear, the Dutch proceeded to
eliminate all potential interlopers to enforce their treaty with the
ruler of Ambon. They captured a key fort held by the Portuguese in 1605
and forcibly removed all other traders. They then expanded to the
northern Moluccas, forcing the rulers of Tidore, Ternate, and Bacan to
agree that no cloves could be grown or traded in their territories. The
treaty they imposed on Ternate even allowed the Dutch to come and
destroy any clove trees they found there. Ambon was ruled in a manner
similar to much of Europe and the Americas during that time. The
citizens of Ambon owed tribute to the ruler and were subject to forced
labor. The Dutch took over and intensified these systems to extract more
labor and more cloves from the island. Prior to the arrival of the
Dutch, extended families paid tribute in cloves to the Ambonese elite.
The Dutch now stipulated that each household was tied to the soil and
should cultivate a certain number of clove trees. Households were also
obligated to deliver forced labor to the Dutch. The Dutch also took
control of the Banda Islands, intending this time to monopolize mace and
nutmeg. But the Banda Islands were organized very differently from
Ambon. They were made up of many small autonomous city-states, and there
was no hierarchical social or political structure. These small states,
in reality no more than small towns, were run by village meetings of
citizens. There was no central authority whom the Dutch could coerce
into signing a monopoly treaty and no system of tribute that they could
take over to capture the entire supply of nutmeg and mace. At first this
meant that the Dutch had to compete with English, Portuguese, Indian,
and Chinese merchants, losing the spices to their competitors when they
did not pay high prices. Their initial plans of setting up a monopoly of
mace and nutmeg dashed, the Dutch governor of Batavia, Jan Pieterszoon
Coen, came up with an alternative plan. Coen founded Batavia, on the
island of Java, as the Dutch East India Company’s new capital in 1618.
In 1621 he sailed to Banda with a fleet and proceeded to massacre almost
the entire population of the islands, probably about fifteen thousand
people. All their leaders were executed along with the rest, and only a
few were left alive, enough to preserve the know-how necessary for mace
and nutmeg production. After this genocide was complete, Coen then
proceeded to create the political and economic structure necessary for
his plan: a plantation society. The islands were divided into
sixty-eight parcels, which were given to sixty-eight Dutchmen, mostly
former and current employees of the Dutch East India Company. These new
plantation owners were taught how to produce the spices by the few
surviving Bandanese and could buy slaves from the East India Company to
populate the now-empty islands and to produce spices, which would have
to be sold at fixed prices back to the company. The extractive
institutions created by the Dutch in the Spice Islands had the desired
effects, though, in Banda this was at the cost of fifteen thousand
innocent lives and the establishment of a set of economic and political
institutions that would condemn the islands to underdevelopment. By the
end of the seventeenth century, the Dutch had reduced the world supply
of these spices by about 60 percent and the price of nutmeg had doubled.
The Dutch spread the strategy they perfected in the Moluccas to the
entire region, with profound implications for the economic and political
institutions of the rest of Southeast Asia. The long commercial
expansion of several states in the area that had started in the
fourteenth century went into reverse. Even the polities which were not
directly colonized and crushed by the Dutch East India Company turned
inward and abandoned trade. The nascent economic and political change in
Southeast Asia was halted in its tracks. To avoid the threat of the
Dutch East India Company, several states abandoned producing crops for
export and ceased commercial activity. Autarky was safer than facing the
Dutch. In 1620 the state of Banten, on the island of Java, cut down its
pepper trees in the hope that this would induce the Dutch to leave it in
peace. When a Dutch merchant visited Maguindanao, in the southern
Philippines, in 1686, he was told, “Nutmeg and cloves can be grown here,
just as in Malaku. They are not there now because the old Raja had all
of them ruined before his death. He was afraid the Dutch Company would
come to fight with them about it.” What a trader heard about the ruler
of Maguindanao in 1699 was similar: “He had forbidden the continued
planting of pepper so that he could not thereby get involved in war
whether with the 〔Dutch〕 company or with other potentates.” There was
de-urbanization and even population decline. In 1635 the Burmese moved
their capital from Pegu, on the coast, to Ava, far inland up the
Irrawaddy River. We do not know what the path of economic and political
development of Southeast Asian states would have been without Dutch
aggression. They may have developed their own brand of absolutism, they
may have remained in the same state they were in at the end of the
sixteenth century, or they may have continued their commercialization by
gradually adopting more and more inclusive institutions. But as in the
Moluccas, Dutch colonialism fundamentally changed their economic and
political development. The people in Southeast Asia stopped trading,
turned inward, and became more absolutist. In the next two centuries,
they would be in no position to take advantage of the innovations that
would spring up in the Industrial Revolution. And ultimately their
retreat from trade would not save them from Europeans; by the end of the
eighteenth century, nearly all were part of European colonial
empires.</p>
<p>WE SAW IN CHAPTER 7 how European expansion into the Atlantic fueled
the rise of inclusive institutions in Britain. But as illustrated by the
experience of the Moluccas under the Dutch, this expansion sowed the
seeds of underdevelopment in many diverse corners of the world by
imposing, or further strengthening existing, extractive institutions.
These either directly or indirectly destroyed nascent commercial and
industrial activity throughout the globe or they perpetuated
institutions that stopped industrialization. As a result, as
industrialization was spreading in some parts of the world, places that
were part of European colonial empires stood no chance of benefiting
from these new technologies.</p>
<p>THE ALL-TOO-USUAL INSTITUTION</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia the spread of European naval and commercial power
in the early modern period curtailed a promising period of economic
expansion and institutional change. In the same period as the Dutch East
India Company was expanding, a very different sort of trade was
intensifying in Africa: the slave trade. In the United States, southern
slavery was often referred to as the “peculiar institution.” But
historically, as the great classical scholar Moses Finlay pointed out,
slavery was anything but peculiar, it was present in almost every
society. It was, as we saw earlier, endemic in Ancient Rome and in
Africa, long a source of slaves for Europe, though not the only one. In
the Roman period slaves came from Slavic peoples around the Black Sea,
from the Middle East, and also from Northern Europe. But by 1400,
Europeans had stopped enslaving each other. Africa, however, as we saw
in chapter 6, did not undergo the transition from slavery to serfdom as
did medieval Europe. Before the early modern period, there was a vibrant
slave trade in East Africa, and large numbers of slaves were transported
across the Sahara to the Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, the large medieval
West African states of Mali, Ghana, and Songhai made heavy use of slaves
in the government, the army, and agriculture, adopting organizational
models from the Muslim North African states with whom they traded. It
was the development of the sugar plantation colonies of the Caribbean
beginning in the early seventeenth century that led to a dramatic
escalation of the international slave trade and to an unprecedented
increase in the importance of slavery within Africa itself. In the
sixteenth century, probably about 300,000 slaves were traded in the
Atlantic. They came mostly from Central Africa, with heavy involvement
of Kongo and the Portuguese based farther south in Luanda, now the
capital of Angola. During this time, the trans-Saharan slave trade was
still larger, with probably about 550,000 Africans moving north as
slaves. In the seventeenth century, the situation reversed. About
1,350,000 Africans were sold as slaves in the Atlantic trade, the
majority now being shipped to the Americas. The numbers involved in the
Saharan trade were relatively unchanged. The eighteenth century saw
another dramatic increase, with about 6,000,000 slaves being shipped
across the Atlantic and maybe 700,000 across the Sahara. Adding the
figures up over periods and parts of Africa, well over 10,000,000
Africans were shipped out of the continent as slaves. Map 15 (this page)
gives some sense of the scale of the slave trade. Using modern country
boundaries, it depicts estimates of the cumulative extent of slavery
between 1400 and 1900 as a percent of population in 1400. Darker colors
show more intense slavery. For example, in Angola, Benin, Ghana, and
Togo, total cumulative slave exports amounted to more than the entire
population of the country in 1400. The sudden appearance of Europeans
all around the coast of Western and Central Africa eager to buy slaves
could not but have a transformative impact on African societies. Most
slaves who were shipped to the Americas were war captives subsequently
transported to the coast. The increase in warfare was fueled by huge
imports of guns and ammunition, which the Europeans exchanged for
slaves. By 1730 about 180,000 guns were being imported every year just
along the West African coast, and between 1750 and the early nineteenth
century, the British alone sold between 283,000 and 394,000 guns a year.
Between 1750 and 1807, the British sold an extraordinary 22,000 tons of
gunpowder, making an average of about 384,000 kilograms annually, along
with 91,000 kilograms of lead per year. Farther to the south, the trade
was just as vigorous. On the Loango coast, north of the Kingdom of
Kongo, Europeans sold about 50,000 guns a year. All this warfare and
conflict not only caused major loss of life and human suffering but also
put in motion a particular path of institutional development in Africa.
Before the early modern era, African societies were less centralized
politically than those of Eurasia. Most polities were small scale, with
tribal chiefs and perhaps kings controlling land and resources. Many, as
we showed with Somalia, had no structure of hierarchical political
authority at all. The slave trade initiated two adverse political
processes. First, many polities initially became more absolutist,
organized around a single objective: to enslave and sell others to
European slavers. Second, as a consequence but, paradoxically, in
opposition to the first process, warring and slaving ultimately
destroyed whatever order and legitimate state authority existed in
sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from warfare, slaves were also kidnapped and
captured by small-scale raiding. The law also became a tool of
enslavement. No matter what crime you committed, the penalty was
slavery. The English merchant Francis Moore observed the consequences of
this along the Senegambia coast of West Africa in the 1730s:</p>
<p>Since this slave trade has been us’d, all punishments are changed
into slavery; there being an advantage on such condemnations, they
strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling the
criminal. Not only murder, theft and adultery, are punished by selling
the criminal for slave, but every trifling case is punished in the same
manner.</p>
<p>Institutions, even religious ones, became perverted by the desire to
capture and sell slaves. One example is the famous oracle at Arochukwa,
in eastern Nigeria. The oracle was widely believed to speak for a
prominent deity in the region respected by the major local ethnic
groups, the Ijaw, the Ibibio, and the Igbo. The oracle was approached to
settle disputes and adjudicate on disagreements. Plaintiffs who traveled
to Arochukwa to face the oracle had to descend from the town into a
gorge of the Cross River, where the oracle was housed in a tall cave,
the front of which was lined with human skulls. The priests of the
oracle, in league with the Aro slavers and merchants, would dispense the
decision of the oracle. Often this involved people being “swallowed” by
the oracle, which actually meant that once they had passed through the
cave, they were led away down the Cross River and to the waiting ships
of the Europeans. This process in which all laws and customs were
distorted and broken to capture slaves and more slaves had devastating
effects on political centralization, though in some places it did lead
to the rise of powerful states whose main raison d’être was raiding and
slaving. The Kingdom of Kongo itself was probably the first African
state to experience a metamorphosis into a slaving state, until it was
destroyed by civil war. Other slaving states arose most prominently in
West Africa and included Oyo in Nigeria, Dahomey in Benin, and
subsequently Asante in Ghana. The expansion of the state of Oyo in the
middle of the seventeenth century, for example, is directly related to
the increase of slave exports on the coast. The state’s power was the
result of a military revolution that involved the import of horses from
the north and the formation of a powerful cavalry that could decimate
opposing armies. As Oyo expanded south toward the coast, it crushed the
intervening polities and sold many of their inhabitants for slaves. In
the period between 1690 and 1740, Oyo established its monopoly in the
interior of what came to be known as the Slave Coast. It is estimated
that 80 to 90 percent of the slaves sold on the coast were the result of
these conquests. A similar dramatic connection between warfare and slave
supply came farther west in the eighteenth century, on the Gold Coast,
the area that is now Ghana. After 1700 the state of Asante expanded from
the interior, in much the same way as Oyo had previously. During the
first half of the eighteenth century, this expansion triggered the
so-called Akan Wars, as Asante defeated one independent state after
another. The last, Gyaman, was conquered in 1747. The preponderance of
the 375,000 slaves exported from the Gold Coast between 1700 and 1750
were captives taken in these wars. Probably the most obvious impact of
this massive extraction of human beings was demographic. It is difficult
to know with any certitude what the population of Africa was before the
modern period, but scholars have made various plausible estimates of the
impact of the slave trade on the population. The historian Patrick
Manning estimates that the population of those areas of West and
West-Central Africa that provided slaves for export was around
twenty-two to twenty-five million in the early eighteenth century. On
the conservative assumption that during the eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries these areas would have experienced a rate of
population growth of about half a percent a year without the slave
trade, Manning estimated that the population of this region in 1850
ought to have been at least forty-six to fifty-three million. In fact,
it was about one-half of this. This massive difference was not only due
to about eight million people being exported as slaves from this region
between 1700 and 1850, but the millions likely killed by continual
internal warfare aimed at capturing slaves. Slavery and the slave trade
in Africa further disrupted family and marriage structures and may also
have reduced fertility. Beginning in the late eighteenth century, a
strong movement to abolish the slave trade began to gain momentum in
Britain, led by the charismatic figure of William Wilberforce. After
repeated failures, in 1807 the abolitionists persuaded the British
Parliament to pass a bill making the slave trade illegal. The United
States followed with a similar measure the next year. The British
government went further, though: it actively sought to implement this
measure by stationing naval squadrons in the Atlantic to try to stamp
out the slave trade. Though it took some time for these measures to be
truly effective, and it was not until 1834 that slavery itself was
abolished in the British Empire, the days of the Atlantic slave trade,
by far the largest part of the trade, were numbered. Though the end of
the slave trade after 1807 did reduce the external demand for slaves
from Africa, this did not mean that slavery’s impact on African
societies and institutions would magically melt away. Many African
states had become organized around slaving, and the British putting an
end to the trade did not change this reality. Moreover, slavery had
become much more prevalent within Africa itself. These factors would
ultimately shape the path of development in Africa not only before but
also after 1807. In the place of slavery came “legitimate commerce,” a
phrase coined for the export from Africa of new commodities not tied to
the slave trade. These goods included palm oil and kernels, peanuts,
ivory, rubber, and gum arabic. As European and North American incomes
expanded with the spread of the Industrial Revolution, demand for many
of these tropical products rose sharply. Just as African societies took
aggressive advantage of the economic opportunities presented by the
slave trade, they did the same with legitimate commerce. But they did so
in a peculiar context, one in which slavery was a way of life but the
external demand for slaves had suddenly dried up. What were all these
slaves to do now that they could not be sold to Europeans? The answer
was simple: they could be profitably put to work, under coercion, in
Africa, producing the new items of legitimate commerce. One of the best
documented examples was in Asante, in modern Ghana. Prior to 1807, the
Asante Empire had been heavily involved in the capturing and export of
slaves, bringing them down to the coast to be sold at the great slaving
castles of Cape Coast and Elmina. After 1807, with this option closed
off, the Asante political elite reorganized their economy. However,
slaving and slavery did not end. Rather, slaves were settled on large
plantations, initially around the capital city of Kumase, but later
spread throughout the empire (corresponding to most of the interior of
Ghana). They were employed in the production of gold and kola nuts for
export, but also grew large quantities of food and were intensively used
as porters, since Asante did not use wheeled transportation. Farther
east, similar adaptations took place. In Dahomey, for example, the king
had large palm oil plantations near the coastal ports of Whydah and
Porto Novo, all based on slave labor. So the abolition of the slave
trade, rather than making slavery in Africa wither away, simply led to a
redeployment of the slaves, who were now used within Africa rather than
in the Americas. Moreover, many of the political institutions the slave
trade had wrought in the previous two centuries were unaltered and
patterns of behavior persisted. For example, in Nigeria in the 1820s and
’30s the once-great Oyo Kingdom collapsed. It was undermined by civil
wars and the rise of the Yoruba city-states, such as Illorin and Ibadan,
that were directly involved in the slave trade, to its south. In the
1830s, the capital of Oyo was sacked, and after that the Yoruba cities
contested power with Dahomey for regional dominance. They fought an
almost continuous series of wars in the first half of the century, which
generated a massive supply of slaves. Along with this went the normal
rounds of kidnapping and condemnation by oracles and smaller-scale
raiding. Kidnapping was such a problem in some parts of Nigeria that
parents would not let their children play outside for fear they would be
taken and sold into slavery. As a result slavery, rather than
contracting, appears to have expanded in Africa throughout the
nineteenth century. Though accurate figures are hard to come by, a
number of existing accounts written by travelers and merchants during
this time suggest that in the West African kingdoms of Asante and
Dahomey and in the Yoruba city-states well over half of the population
were slaves. More accurate data exist from early French colonial records
for the western Sudan, a large swath of western Africa, stretching from
Senegal, via Mali and Burkina Faso, to Niger and Chad. In this region 30
percent of the population was enslaved in 1900. Just as with the
emergence of legitimate commerce, the advent of formal colonization
after the Scramble for Africa failed to destroy slavery in Africa.
Though much of European penetration into Africa was justified on the
grounds that slavery had to be combated and abolished, the reality was
different. In most parts of colonial Africa, slavery continued well into
the twentieth century. In Sierra Leone, for example, it was only in 1928
that slavery was finally abolished, even though the capital city of
Freetown was originally established in the late eighteenth century as a
haven for slaves repatriated from the Americas. It then became an
important base for the British antislavery squadron and a new home for
freed slaves rescued from slave ships captured by the British navy. Even
with this symbolism slavery lingered in Sierra Leone for 130 years.
Liberia, just south of Sierra Leone, was likewise founded for freed
American slaves in the 1840s. Yet there, too, slavery lingered into the
twentieth century; as late as the 1960s, it was estimated that
one-quarter of the labor force were coerced, living and working in
conditions close to slavery. Given the extractive economic and political
institutions based on the slave trade, industrialization did not spread
to sub-Saharan Africa, which stagnated or even experienced economic
retardation as other parts of the world were transforming their
economies.</p>
<p>MAKING A DUAL ECONOMY</p>
<p>The “dual economy” paradigm, originally proposed in 1955 by Sir
Arthur Lewis, still shapes the way that most social scientists think
about the economic problems of less-developed countries. According to
Lewis, many less-developed or underdeveloped economies have a dual
structure and are divided into a modern sector and a traditional sector.
The modern sector, which corresponds to the more developed part of the
economy, is associated with urban life, modern industry, and the use of
advanced technologies. The traditional sector is associated with rural
life, agriculture, and “backward” institutions and technologies.
Backward agricultural institutions include the communal ownership of
land, which implies the absence of private property rights on land.
Labor was used so inefficiently in the traditional sector, according to
Lewis, that it could be reallocated to the modern sector without
reducing the amount the rural sector could produce. For generations of
development economists building on Lewis’s insights, the “problem of
development” has come to mean moving people and resources out of the
traditional sector, agriculture and the countryside, and into the modern
sector, industry and cities. In 1979 Lewis received the Nobel Prize for
his work on economic development. Lewis and development economists
building on his work were certainly right in identifying dual economies.
South Africa was one of the clearest examples, split into a traditional
sector that was backward and poor and a modern one that was vibrant and
prosperous. Even today the dual economy Lewis identified is everywhere
in South Africa. One of the most dramatic ways to see this is by driving
across the border between the state of KwaZulu-Natal, formerly Natal,
and the state of the Transkei. The border follows the Great Kei River.
To the east of the river in Natal, along the coast, are wealthy
beachfront properties on wide expanses of glorious sandy beaches. The
interior is covered with lush green sugarcane plantations. The roads are
beautiful; the whole area reeks of prosperity. Across the river, it is
as if it were a different time and a different country. The area is
largely devastated. The land is not green, but brown and heavily
deforested. Instead of affluent modern houses with running water,
toilets, and all the modern conveniences, people live in makeshift huts
and cook on open fires. Life is certainly traditional, far from the
modern existence to the east of the river. By now you will not be
surprised that these differences are linked with major differences in
economic institutions between the two sides of the river. To the east,
in Natal, we have private property rights, functioning legal systems,
markets, commercial agriculture, and industry. To the west, the Transkei
had communal property in land and all-powerful traditional chiefs until
recently. Looked at through the lens of Lewis’s theory of dual economy,
the contrast between the Transkei and Natal illustrates the problems of
African development. In fact, we can go further, and note that,
historically, all of Africa was like the Transkei, poor with premodern
economic institutions, backward technology, and rule by chiefs.
According to this perspective, then, economic development should simply
be about ensuring that the Transkei eventually turns into Natal. This
perspective has much truth to it but misses the entire logic of how the
dual economy came into existence and its relationship to the modern
economy. The backwardness of the Transkei is not just a historic remnant
of the natural backwardness of Africa. The dual economy between the
Transkei and Natal is in fact quite recent, and is anything but natural.
It was created by the South African white elites in order to produce a
reservoir of cheap labor for their businesses and reduce competition
from black Africans. The dual economy is another example of
underdevelopment created, not of underdevelopment as it naturally
emerged and persisted over centuries. South Africa and Botswana, as we
will see later, did avoid most of the adverse effects of the slave trade
and the wars it wrought. South Africans’ first major interaction with
Europeans came when the Dutch East India Company founded a base in Table
Bay, now the harbor of Cape Town, in 1652. At this time the western part
of South Africa was sparsely settled, mostly by hunter-gatherers called
the Khoikhoi people. Farther east, in what is now the Ciskei and
Transkei, there were densely populated African societies specializing in
agriculture. They did not initially interact heavily with the new colony
of the Dutch, nor did they become involved in slaving. The South African
coast was far removed from slave markets, and the inhabitants of the
Ciskei and Transkei, known as the Xhosa, were just far enough inland not
to attract anyone’s attention. As a consequence, these societies did not
feel the brunt of many of the adverse currents that hit West and Central
Africa. The isolation of these places changed in the nineteenth century.
For the Europeans there was something very attractive about the climate
and the disease environment of South Africa. Unlike West Africa, for
example, South Africa had a temperate climate that was free of the
tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever that had turned much
of Africa into the “white man’s graveyard” and prevented Europeans from
settling or even setting up permanent outposts. South Africa was a much
better prospect for European settlement. European expansion into the
interior began soon after the British took over Cape Town from the Dutch
during the Napoleonic Wars. This precipitated a long series of Xhosa
wars as the settlement frontier expanded further inland. The penetration
into the South African interior was intensified in 1835, when the
remaining Europeans of Dutch descent, who would become known as
Afrikaners or Boers, started their famous mass migration known as the
Great Trek away from the British control of the coast and the Cape Town
area. The Afrikaners subsequently founded two independent states in the
interior of Africa, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The next
stage in the development of South Africa came with the discovery of vast
diamond reserves in Kimberly in 1867 and of rich gold mines in
Johannesburg in 1886. This huge mineral wealth in the interior
immediately convinced the British to extend their control over all of
South Africa. The resistance of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal
led to the famous Boer Wars in 1880–1881 and 1899–1902. After initial
unexpected defeat, the British managed to merge the Afrikaner states
with the Cape Province and Natal, to found the Union of South Africa in
1910. Beyond the fighting between Afrikaners and the British, the
development of the mining economy and the expansion of European
settlement had other implications for the development of the area. Most
notably, they generated demand for food and other agricultural products
and created new economic opportunities for native Africans both in
agriculture and trade. The Xhosa, in the Ciskei and Transkei, reacted
quickly to these economic opportunities, as the historian Colin Bundy
documented. As early as 1832, even before the mining boom, a Moravian
missionary in the Transkei observed the new economic dynamism in these
areas and noted the demand from the Africans for the new consumer goods
that the spread of Europeans had begun to reveal to them. He wrote, “To
obtain these objects, they look … to get money by the labour of their
hands, and purchase clothes, spades, ploughs, wagons and other useful
articles.”</p>
<p>The civil commissioner John Hemming’s description of his visit to
Fingoland in the Ciskei in 1876 is equally revealing. He wrote that he
was</p>
<p>struck with the very great advancement made by the Fingoes in a few
years … Wherever I went I found substantial huts and brick or stone
tenements. In many cases, substantial brick houses had been erected …
and fruit trees had been planted; wherever a stream of water could be
made available it had been led out and the soil cultivated as far as it
could be irrigated; the slopes of the hills and even the summits of the
mountains were cultivated wherever a plough could be introduced. The
extent of the land turned over surprised me; I have not seen such a
large area of cultivated land for years.</p>
<p>As in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the use of the plow was new
in agriculture, but when given the opportunity, African farmers seemed
to have been quite ready to adopt the technology. They were also
prepared to invest in wagons and irrigation works. As the agricultural
economy developed, the rigid tribal institutions started to give way.
There is a great deal of evidence that changes in property rights to
land took place. In 1879 the magistrate in Umzimkulu of Griqualand East,
in the Transkei, noted “the growing desire of the part of natives to
become proprietors of land—they have purchased 38,000 acres.” Three
years later he recorded that around eight thousand African farmers in
the district had bought and started to work on ninety thousand acres of
land. Africa was certainly not on the verge of an Industrial Revolution,
but real change was under way. Private property in land had weakened the
chiefs and enabled new men to buy land and make their wealth, something
that was unthinkable just decades earlier. This also illustrates how
quickly the weakening of extractive institutions and absolutist control
systems can lead to newfound economic dynamism. One of the success
stories was Stephen Sonjica in the Ciskei, a self-made farmer from a
poor background. In an address in 1911, Sonjica noted how when he first
expressed to his father his desire to buy land, his father had
responded: “Buy land? How can you want to buy land? Don’t you know that
all land is God’s, and he gave it to the chiefs only?” Sonjica’s
father’s reaction was understandable. But Sonjica was not deterred. He
got a job in King William’s Town and noted:</p>
<p>I cunningly opened a private bank account into which I diverted a
portion of my savings … This went only until I had saved eighty pounds …
〔I bought〕 a span of oxen with yokes, gear, plough and the rest of
agricultural paraphernalia … I now purchased a small farm … I cannot too
strongly recommend 〔farming〕 as a profession to my fellow man … They
should however adopt modern methods of profit making.</p>
<p>An extraordinary piece of evidence supporting the economic dynamism
and prosperity of African farmers in this period is revealed in a letter
sent in 1869 by a Methodist missionary, W. J. Davis. Writing to England,
he recorded with pleasure that he had collected forty-six pounds in cash
“for the Lancashire Cotton Relief Fund.” In this period the prosperous
African farmers were donating money for relief of the poor English
textile workers!</p>
<p>This new economic dynamism, not surprisingly, did not please the
traditional chiefs, who, in a pattern that is by now familiar to us, saw
this as eroding their wealth and power. In 1879 Matthew Blyth, the chief
magistrate of the Transkei, observed that there was opposition to
surveying the land so that it could be divided into private property. He
recorded that “some of the chiefs … objected, but most of the people
were pleased … the chiefs see that the granting of individual titles
will destroy their influence among the headmen.”</p>
<p>Chiefs also resisted improvements made on the lands, such as the
digging of irrigation ditches or the building of fences. They recognized
that these improvements were just a prelude to individual property
rights to the land, the beginning of the end for them. European
observers even noted that chiefs and other traditional authorities, such
as witch doctors, attempted to prohibit all “European ways,” which
included new crops, tools such as plows, and items of trade. But the
integration of the Ciskei and the Transkei into the British colonial
state weakened the power of the traditional chiefs and authorities, and
their resistance would not be enough to stop the new economic dynamism
in South Africa. In Fingoland in 1884, a European observer noted that
the people had</p>
<p>transferred their allegiance to us. Their chiefs have been changed to
a sort of titled landowner … without political power. No longer afraid
of the jealousy of the chief or of the deadly weapon … the witchdoctor,
which strikes down the wealthy cattle owner, the able counsellor, the
introduction of novel customs, the skilful agriculturalist, reducing
them all to the uniform level of mediocrity—no longer apprehensive of
this, the Fingo clansman … is a progressive man. Still remaining a
peasant farmer … he owns wagons and ploughs; he opens water furroughs
for irrigation; he is the owner of a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>Even a modicum of inclusive institutions and the erosion of the
powers of the chiefs and their restrictions were sufficient to start a
vigorous African economic boom. Alas, it would be short lived. Between
1890 and 1913 it would come to an abrupt end and go into reverse. During
this period two forces worked to destroy the rural prosperity and
dynamism that Africans had created in the previous fifty years. The
first was antagonism by European farmers who were competing with
Africans. Successful African farmers drove down the price of crops that
Europeans also produced. The response of Europeans was to drive the
Africans out of business. The second force was even more sinister. The
Europeans wanted a cheap labor force to employ in the burgeoning mining
economy, and they could ensure this cheap supply only by impoverishing
the Africans. This they went about methodically over the next several
decades. The 1897 testimony of George Albu, the chairman of the
Association of Mines, given to a Commission of Inquiry pithily describes
the logic of impoverishing Africans so as to obtain cheap labor. He
explained how he proposed to cheapen labor by “simply telling the boys
that their wages are reduced.” His testimony goes as follows:</p>
<p>Commission: Suppose the kaffirs 〔black Africans〕 retire back to
their kraal 〔cattle pen〕? Would you be in favor of asking the
Government to enforce labour?</p>
<p>Albu: Certainly … I would make it compulsory … Why should a nigger be
allowed to do nothing? I think a kaffir should be compelled to work in
order to earn his living.</p>
<p>Commission: If a man can live without work, how can you force him to
work?</p>
<p>Albu: Tax him, then …</p>
<p>Commission: Then you would not allow the kaffir to hold land in the
country, but he must work for the white man to enrich him?</p>
<p>Albu: He must do his part of the work of helping his neighbours.</p>
<p>Both of the goals of removing competition with white farmers and
developing a large low-wage labor force were simultaneously accomplished
by the Natives Land Act of 1913. The act, anticipating Lewis’s notion of
dual economy, divided South Africa into two parts, a modern prosperous
part and a traditional poor part. Except that the prosperity and poverty
were actually being created by the act itself. It stated that 87 percent
of the land was to be given to the Europeans, who represented about 20
percent of the population. The remaining 13 percent was to go to the
Africans. The Land Act had many predecessors, of course, because
gradually Europeans had been confining Africans onto smaller and smaller
reserves. But it was the act of 1913 that definitively institutionalized
the situation and set the stage for the formation of the South African
Apartheid regime, with the white minority having both the political and
economic rights and the black majority being excluded from both. The act
specified that several land reserves, including the Transkei and the
Ciskei, were to become the African “Homelands.” Later these would become
known as the Bantustans, another part of the rhetoric of the Apartheid
regime in South Africa, since it claimed that the African peoples of
Southern Africa were not natives of the area but were descended from the
Bantu people who had migrated out of Eastern Nigeria about a thousand
years before. They thus had no more—and of course, in practice,
less—entitlement to the land than the European settlers. Map 16 (this
page) shows the derisory amount of land allocated to Africans by the
1913 Land Act and its successor in 1936. It also records information
from 1970 on the extent of a similar land allocation that took place
during the construction of another dual economy in Zimbabwe, which we
discuss in chapter 13. The 1913 legislation also included provisions
intended to stop black sharecroppers and squatters from farming on
white-owned land in any capacity other than as labor tenants. As the
secretary for native affairs explained, “The effect of the act was to
put a stop, for the future, to all transactions involving anything in
the nature of partnership between Europeans and natives in respect of
land or the fruits of land. All new contracts with natives must be
contracts of service. Provided there is a bona fide contract of this
nature there is nothing to prevent an employer from paying a native in
kind, or by the privilege of cultivating a defined piece of ground … But
the native cannot pay the master anything for his right to occupy the
land.”</p>
<p>To the development economists who visited South Africa in the 1950s
and ’60s, when the academic discipline was taking shape and the ideas of
Arthur Lewis were spreading, the contrast between these Homelands and
the prosperous modern white European economy seemed to be exactly what
the dual economy theory was about. The European part of the economy was
urban and educated, and used modern technology. The Homelands were poor,
rural, and backward; labor there was very unproductive; people,
uneducated. It seemed to be the essence of timeless, backward Africa.
Except that the dual economy was not natural or inevitable. It had been
created by European colonialism. Yes, the Homelands were poor and
technologically backward, and the people were uneducated. But all this
was an outcome of government policy, which had forcibly stamped out
African economic growth and created the reservoir of cheap, uneducated
African labor to be employed in European-controlled mines and lands.
After 1913 vast numbers of Africans were evicted from their lands, which
were taken over by whites, and crowded into the Homelands, which were
too small for them to earn an independent living from. As intended,
therefore, they would be forced to look for a living in the white
economy, supplying their labor cheaply. As their economic incentives
collapsed, the advances that had taken place in the preceding fifty
years were all reversed. People gave up their plows and reverted to
farming with hoes—that is, if they farmed at all. More often they were
just available as cheap labor, which the Homelands had been structured
to ensure. It was not only the economic incentives that were destroyed.
The political changes that had started to take place also went into
reverse. The power of chiefs and traditional rulers, which had
previously been in decline, was strengthened, because part of the
project of creating a cheap labor force was to remove private property
in land. So the chiefs’ control over land was reaffirmed. These measures
reached their apogee in 1951, when the government passed the Bantu
Authorities Act. As early as 1940, G. Findlay put his finger right on
the issue:</p>
<p>Tribal tenure is a guarantee that the land will never properly be
worked and will never really belong to the natives. Cheap labour must
have a cheap breeding place, and so it is furnished to the Africans at
their own expense.</p>
<p>The dispossession of the African farmers led to their mass
impoverishment. It created not only the institutional foundations of a
backward economy, but the poor people to stock it. The available
evidence demonstrates the reversal in living standards in the Homelands
after the Natives Land Act of 1913. The Transkei and the Ciskei went
into a prolonged economic decline. The employment records from the gold
mining companies collected by the historian Francis Wilson show that
this decline was widespread in the South African economy as a whole.
Following the Natives Land Act and other legislation, miners’ wages fell
by 30 percent between 1911 and 1921. In 1961, despite relatively steady
growth in the South African economy, these wages were still 12 percent
lower than they had been in 1911. No wonder that over this period South
Africa became the most unequal country in the world. But even in these
circumstances, couldn’t black Africans have made their way in the
European, modern economy, started a business, or have become educated
and begun a career? The government made sure these things could not
happen. No African was allowed to own property or start a business in
the European part of the economy—the 87 percent of the land. The
Apartheid regime also realized that educated Africans competed with
whites rather than supplying cheap labor to the mines and to white-owned
agriculture. As early as 1904 a system of job reservation for Europeans
was introduced in the mining economy. No African was allowed to be an
amalgamator, an assayer, a banksman, a blacksmith, a boiler maker, a
brass finisher, a brassmolder, a bricklayer … and the list went on and
on, all the way to woodworking machinist. At a stroke, Africans were
banned from occupying any skilled job in the mining sector. This was the
first incarnation of the famous “colour bar,” one of the several racist
inventions of South Africa’s regime. The colour bar was extended to the
entire economy in 1926, and lasted until the 1980s. It is not surprising
that black Africans were uneducated; the South African state not only
removed the possibility of Africans benefiting economically from an
education but also refused to invest in black schools and discouraged
black education. This policy reached its peak in the 1950s, when, under
the leadership of Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of the
Apartheid regime that would last until 1994, the government passed the
Bantu Education Act. The philosophy behind this act was bluntly spelled
out by Verwoerd himself in a speech in 1954:</p>
<p>The Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects.
There is no place for him in the European community above the level of
certain forms of labour … For that reason it is to no avail to him to
receive a training which has as its aim absorption in the European
community while he cannot and will not be absorbed there.</p>
<p>Naturally, the type of dual economy articulated in Verwoerd’s speech
is rather different from Lewis’s dual economy theory. In South Africa
the dual economy was not an inevitable outcome of the process of
development. It was created by the state. In South Africa there was to
be no seamless movement of poor people from the backward to the modern
sector as the economy developed. On the contrary, the success of the
modern sector relied on the existence of the backward sector, which
enabled white employers to make huge profits by paying very low wages to
black unskilled workers. In South Africa there would not be a process of
the unskilled workers from the traditional sector gradually becoming
educated and skilled, as Lewis’s approach envisaged. In fact, the black
workers were purposefully kept unskilled and were barred from high-skill
occupations so that skilled white workers would not face competition and
could enjoy high wages. In South Africa black Africans were indeed
“trapped” in the traditional economy, in the Homelands. But this was not
the problem of development that growth would make good. The Homelands
were what enabled the development of the white economy. It should also
be no surprise that the type of economic development that white South
Africa was achieving was ultimately limited, being based on extractive
institutions the whites had built to exploit the blacks. South African
whites had property rights, they invested in education, and they were
able to extract gold and diamonds and sell them profitably in the world
market. But over 80 percent of the South African population was
marginalized and excluded from the great majority of desirable economic
activities. Blacks could not use their talents; they could not become
skilled workers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, engineers, or scientists.
Economic institutions were extractive; whites became rich by extracting
from blacks. Indeed, white South Africans shared the living standards of
people of Western European countries, while black South Africans were
scarcely richer than those in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. This
economic growth without creative destruction, from which only the whites
benefited, continued as long as revenues from gold and diamonds
increased. By the 1970s, however, the economy had stopped growing. And
it will again be no surprise that this set of extractive economic
institutions was built on foundations laid by a set of highly extractive
political institutions. Before its overthrow in 1994, the South African
political system vested all power in whites, who were the only ones
allowed to vote and run for office. Whites dominated the police force,
the military, and all political institutions. These institutions were
structured under the military domination of white settlers. At the time
of the foundation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Afrikaner
polities of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal had explicit racial
franchises, barring blacks completely from political participation.
Natal and the Cape Colony allowed blacks to vote if they had sufficient
property, which typically they did not. The status quo of Natal and the
Cape Colony was kept in 1910, but by the 1930s, blacks had been
explicitly disenfranchised everywhere in South Africa. The dual economy
of South Africa did come to an end in 1994. But not because of the
reasons that Sir Arthur Lewis theorized about. It was not the natural
course of economic development that ended the color bar and the
Homelands. Black South Africans protested and rose up against the regime
that did not recognize their basic rights and did not share the gains of
economic growth with them. After the Soweto uprising of 1976, the
protests became more organized and stronger, ultimately bringing down
the Apartheid state. It was the empowerment of blacks who managed to
organize and rise up that ultimately ended South Africa’s dual economy
in the same way that South African whites’ political force had created
it in the first place.</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT REVERSED</p>
<p>World inequality today exists because during the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries some nations were able to take advantage of the
Industrial Revolution and the technologies and methods of organization
that it brought while others were unable to do so. Technological change
is only one of the engines of prosperity, but it is perhaps the most
critical one. The countries that did not take advantage of new
technologies did not benefit from the other engines of prosperity,
either. As we have shown in this and the previous chapter, this failure
was due to their extractive institutions, either a consequence of the
persistence of their absolutist regimes or because they lacked
centralized states. But this chapter has also shown that in several
instances the extractive institutions that underpinned the poverty of
these nations were imposed, or at the very least further strengthened,
by the very same process that fueled European growth: European
commercial and colonial expansion. In fact, the profitability of
European colonial empires was often built on the destruction of
independent polities and indigenous economies around the world, or on
the creation of extractive institutions essentially from the ground up,
as in the Caribbean islands, where, following the almost total collapse
of the native populations, Europeans imported African slaves and set up
plantation systems. We will never know what the trajectories of
independent city-states such as those in the Banda Islands, in Aceh, or
in Burma (Myanmar) would have been without the European intervention.
They may have had their own indigenous Glorious Revolution or slowly
moved toward more inclusive political and economic institutions based on
growing trade in spices and other valuable commodities. But this
possibility was removed by the expansion of the Dutch East India
Company. The company stamped out any hope of indigenous development in
the Banda Islands by carrying out its genocide. Its threat also made the
city-states in many other parts of Southeast Asia pull back from
commerce. The story of one of the oldest civilizations in Asia, India,
is similar, though the reversing of development was done not by the
Dutch but by the British. India was the largest producer and exporter of
textiles in the world in the eighteenth century. Indian calicoes and
muslins flooded the European markets and were traded throughout Asia and
even eastern Africa. The main agent that carried them to the British
Isles was the English East India Company. Founded in 1600, two years
before its Dutch version, the English East India Company spent the
seventeenth century trying to establish a monopoly on the valuable
exports from India. It had to compete with the Portuguese, who had bases
in Goa, Chittagong, and Bombay, and the French with bases at
Pondicherry, Chandernagore, Yanam, and Karaikal. Worse still for the
East India Company was the Glorious Revolution, as we saw in chapter 7.
The monopoly of the East India Company had been granted by the Stuart
kings and was immediately challenged after 1688, and even abolished for
over a decade. The loss of power was significant, as we saw earlier
(this page–this page), because British textile producers were able to
induce Parliament to ban the import of calicoes, the East India
Company’s most profitable item of trade. In the eighteenth century,
under the leadership of Robert Clive, the East India Company switched
strategies and began to develop a continental empire. At the time, India
was split into many competing polities, though many were still nominally
under the control of the Mughal emperor in Delhi. The East India Company
first expanded in Bengal in the east, vanquishing the local powers at
the battles of Plassey in 1757 and Buxar in 1764. The East India Company
looted local wealth and took over, and perhaps even intensified, the
extractive taxation institutions of the Mughal rulers of India. This
expansion coincided with the massive contraction of the Indian textile
industry, since, after all, there was no longer a market for these goods
in Britain. The contraction went along with de-urbanization and
increased poverty. It initiated a long period of reversed development in
India. Soon, instead of producing textiles, Indians were buying them
from Britain and growing opium for the East India Company to sell in
China. The Atlantic slave trade repeated the same pattern in Africa,
even if starting from less developed conditions than in Southeast Asia
and India. Many African states were turned into war machines intent on
capturing and selling slaves to Europeans. As conflict between different
polities and states grew into continuous warfare, state institutions,
which in many cases had not yet achieved much political centralization
in any case, crumbled in large parts of Africa, paving the way for
persistent extractive institutions and the failed states of today that
we will study later. In a few parts of Africa that escaped the slave
trade, such as South Africa, Europeans imposed a different set of
institutions, this time designed to create a reservoir of cheap labor
for their mines and farms. The South African state created a dual
economy, preventing 80 percent of the population from taking part in
skilled occupations, commercial farming, and entrepreneurship. All this
not only explains why industrialization passed by large parts of the
world but also encapsulates how economic development may sometimes feed
on, and even create, the underdevelopment in some other part of the
domestic or the world economy.</p>
