<h4 id="the-diffusion-of-prosperity">10. THE DIFFUSION OF
PROSPERITY</h4>
<p>HONOR AMONG THIEVES</p>
<p>EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND—or more appropriately, Great Britain after
the 1707 union of England, Wales, and Scotland—had a simple solution for
dealing with criminals: out of sight, out of mind, or at least out of
trouble. They transported many to penal colonies in the empire. Before
the War of Independence, the convicted criminals, convicts, were
primarily sent to the American colonies. After 1783 the independent
United States of America was no longer so welcoming to British convicts,
and the authorities in Britain had to find another home for them. They
first thought about West Africa. But the climate, with endemic diseases
such as malaria and yellow fever, against which Europeans had no
immunity, was so deadly that the authorities decided it was unacceptable
to send even convicts to the “white man’s graveyard.” Their next option
was Australia. Its eastern seaboard had been explored by the great
seafarer Captain James Cook. On April 29, 1770, Cook landed in a
wonderful inlet, which he called Botany Bay in honor of the rich species
found there by the naturalists traveling with him. This seemed like an
ideal location to British government officials. The climate was
temperate, and the place was as far out of sight and mind as could be
imagined. A fleet of eleven ships packed with convicts was on its way to
Botany Bay in January 1788 under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip.
On January 26, now celebrated as Australia Day, they set up camp in
Sydney Cove, the heart of the modern city of Sydney. They called the
colony New South Wales. On board one of the ships, the Alexander,
captained by Duncan Sinclair, were a married couple of convicts, Henry
and Susannah Cable. Susannah had been found guilty of stealing and was
initially sentenced to death. This sentence was later commuted to
fourteen years and transportation to the American colonies. That plan
fell through with the independence of the United States. In the
meantime, in Norwich Castle Jail, Susannah met and fell in love with
Henry, a fellow convict. In 1787 she was picked to be transported to the
new convict colony in Australia with the first fleet heading there. But
Henry was not. By this time Susannah and Henry had a young son, also
called Henry. This decision meant the family was to be separated.
Susannah was moved to a prison boat moored on the Thames, but the word
got out about this wrenching event and reached the ears of a
philanthropist, Lady Cadogan. Lady Cadogan organized a successful
campaign to reunite the Cables. Now they were both to be transported
with young Henry to Australia. Lady Cadogan also raised £20 to purchase
goods for them, which they would receive in Australia. They sailed on
the Alexander, but when they arrived in Botany Bay, the parcel of goods
had vanished, or at least that is what Captain Sinclair claimed. What
could the Cables do? Not much, according to English or British law. Even
though in 1787, Britain had inclusive political and economic
institutions, this inclusiveness did not extend to convicts, who had
practically no rights. They could not own property. They could certainly
not sue anyone in court. In fact, they could not even give evidence in
court. Sinclair knew this and probably stole the parcel. Though he would
never admit it, he did boast that he could not be sued by the Cables. He
was right according to British law. And in Britain the whole affair
would have ended there. But not in Australia. A writ was issued to David
Collins, the judge advocate there, as follows:</p>
<p>Whereas Henry Cable and his wife, new settlers of this place, had
before they left England a certain parcel shipped on board the Alexander
transport Duncan Sinclair Master, consisting of cloaths and several
other articles suitable for their present situation, which were
collected and bought at the expence of many charitable disposed persons
for the use of the said Henry Cable, his wife and child. Several
applications has been made for the express purpose of obtaining the said
parcel from the Master of the Alexander now lying at this port, and that
without effect (save and except) a small part of the said parcel
containing a few books, the residue and remainder, which is of a more
considerable value still remains on board the said ship Alexander, the
Master of which, seems to be very neglectfull in not causing the same to
be delivered, to its respective owners as aforesaid.</p>
<p>Henry and Susannah, since they were both illiterate, could not sign
the writ and just put their “crosses” at the bottom. The words “new
settlers of this place” were later crossed out, but were highly
significant. Someone anticipated that if Henry Cable and his wife were
described as convicts, the case would have no hope of proceeding.
Someone had come up instead with the idea of calling them new settlers.
This was probably a bit too much for Judge Collins to take, and most
likely he was the one who had these words struck out. But the writ
worked. Collins did not throw out the case, and convened the court, with
a jury entirely made up of soldiers. Sinclair was called before the
court. Though Collins was less than enthusiastic about the case, and the
jury was composed of the people sent to Australia to guard convicts such
as the Cables, the Cables won. Sinclair contested the whole affair on
the grounds that the Cables were criminals. But the verdict stood, and
he had to pay fifteen pounds. To reach this verdict Judge Collins didn’t
apply British law; he ignored it. This was the first civil case
adjudicated in Australia. The first criminal case would have appeared
equally bizarre to those in Britain. A convict was found guilty of
stealing another convict’s bread, which was worth two pence. At the
time, such a case would not have come to court, since convicts were not
allowed to own anything. Australia was not Britain, and its law would
not be just British. And Australia would soon diverge from Britain in
criminal and civil law as well as in a host of economic and political
institutions. The penal colony of New South Wales initially consisted of
the convicts and their guards, mostly soldiers. There were few “free
settlers” in Australia until the 1820s, and the transportation of
convicts, though it stopped in New South Wales in 1840, continued until
1868 in Western Australia. Convicts had to perform “compulsory work,”
essentially just another name for forced labor, and the guards intended
to make money out of it. Initially the convicts had no pay. They were
given only food in return for the labor they performed. The guards kept
what they produced. But this system, like the ones with which the
Virginia Company experimented in Jamestown, did not work very well,
because convicts did not have the incentives to work hard or do good
work. They were lashed or banished to Norfolk Island, just thirteen
square miles of territory situated more than one thousand miles east of
Australia in the Pacific Ocean. But since neither banishing nor lashing
worked, the alternative was to give them incentives. This was not a
natural idea to the soldiers and guards. Convicts were convicts, and
they were not supposed to sell their labor or own property. But in
Australia there was nobody else to do the work. There were of course
Aboriginals, possibly as many as one million at the time of the founding
of New South Wales. But they were spread out over a vast continent, and
their density in New South Wales was insufficient for the creation of an
economy based on their exploitation. There was no Latin American option
in Australia. The guards thus embarked on a path that would ultimately
lead to institutions that were even more inclusive than those back in
Britain. Convicts were given a set of tasks to do, and if they had extra
time, they could work for themselves and sell what they produced. The
guards also benefited from the convicts’ new economic freedoms.
Production increased, and the guards set up monopolies to sell goods to
the convicts. The most lucrative of these was for rum. New South Wales
at this time, just like other British colonies, was run by a governor,
appointed by the British government. In 1806 Britain appointed William
Bligh, the man who seventeen years previously, in 1789, had been captain
of the H.M.S. Bounty, during the famous “Mutiny on the Bounty.” Bligh
was a strict disciplinarian, a trait that was probably largely
responsible for the mutiny. His ways had not changed, and he immediately
challenged the rum monopolists. This would lead to another mutiny, this
time by the monopolists, led by a former soldier, John Macarthur. The
events, which came to be known as the Rum Rebellion, again led to
Bligh’s being overpowered by rebels, this time on land rather than
aboard the Bounty. Macarthur had Bligh locked up. The British
authorities subsequently sent more soldiers to deal with the rebellion.
Macarthur was arrested and shipped back to Britain. But he was soon
released, and he returned to Australia to play a major role in both the
politics and economics of the colony. The roots of the Rum Rebellion
were economic. The strategy of giving the convicts incentives was making
a lot of money for men such as Macarthur, who arrived in Australia as a
soldier in the second group of ships that landed in 1790. In 1796 he
resigned from the army to concentrate on business. By that time he
already had his first sheep, and realized that there was a lot of money
to be made in sheep farming and wool export. Inland from Sydney were the
Blue Mountains, which were finally crossed in 1813, revealing vast
expanses of open grassland on the other side. It was sheep heaven.
Macarthur was soon the richest man in Australia, and he and his fellow
sheep magnates became known as the Squatters, since the land on which
they grazed their sheep was not theirs. It was owned by the British
government. But at first this was a small detail. The Squatters were the
elite of Australia, or, more appropriately, the Squattocracy. Even with
a squattocracy, New South Wales did not look anything like the
absolutist regimes of Eastern Europe or of the South American colonies.
There were no serfs as in Austria-Hungary and Russia, and no large
indigenous populations to exploit as in Mexico and Peru. Instead, New
South Wales was like Jamestown, Virginia, in many ways: the elite
ultimately found it in their interest to create economic institutions
that were significantly more inclusive than those in Austria-Hungary,
Russia, Mexico, and Peru. Convicts were the only labor force, and the
only way to incentivize them was to pay them wages for the work they
were doing. Convicts were soon allowed to become entrepreneurs and hire
other convicts. More notably, they were even given land after completing
their sentences, and they had all their rights restored. Some of them
started to get rich, even the illiterate Henry Cable. By 1798 he owned a
hotel called the Ramping Horse, and he also had a shop. He bought a ship
and went into the trade of sealskins. By 1809 he owned at least nine
farms of about 470 acres and also a number of shops and houses in
Sydney. The next conflict in New South Wales would be between the elite
and the rest of the society, made up of convicts, ex-convicts, and their
families. The elite, led by former guards and soldiers such as
Macarthur, included some of the free settlers who had been attracted to
the colony because of the boom in the wool economy. Most of the property
was still in the hands of the elite, and the ex-convicts and their
descendants wanted an end to transportation, the opportunity of trial by
a jury of their peers, and access to free land. The elite wanted none of
these. Their main concern was to establish legal title to the lands they
squatted on. The situation was again similar to the events that had
transpired in North America more than two centuries earlier. As we saw
in chapter 1, the victories of the indentured servants against the
Virginia Company were followed by the struggles in Maryland and the
Carolinas. In New South Wales, the roles of Lord Baltimore and Sir
Anthony Ashley-Cooper were played by Macarthur and the Squatters. The
British government was again on the side of the elite, though they also
feared that one day Macarthur and the Squatters might be tempted to
declare independence. The British government dispatched John Bigge to
the colony in 1819 to head a commission of inquiry into the developments
there. Bigge was shocked by the rights that the convicts enjoyed and
surprised by the fundamentally inclusive nature of the economic
institutions of this penal colony. He recommended a radical overhaul:
convicts could not own land, nobody should be allowed to pay convicts
wages anymore, pardons were to be restricted, ex-convicts were not to be
given land, and punishment was to be made much more draconian. Bigge saw
the Squatters as the natural aristocracy of Australia and envisioned an
autocratic society dominated by them. This wasn’t to be. While Bigge was
trying to turn back the clock, ex-convicts and their sons and daughters
were demanding greater rights. Most important, they realized, again just
as in the United States, that to consolidate their economic and
political rights fully they needed political institutions that would
include them in the process of decision making. They demanded elections
in which they could participate as equals and representative
institutions and assemblies in which they could hold office. The
ex-convicts and their sons and daughters were led by the colorful
writer, explorer, and journalist William Wentworth. Wentworth was one of
the leaders of the first expedition that crossed the Blue Mountains,
which opened the vast grasslands to the Squatters; a town on these
mountains is still named after him. His sympathies were with the
convicts, perhaps because of his father, who was accused of highway
robbery and had to accept transportation to Australia to avoid trial and
possible conviction. At this time, Wentworth was a strong advocate of
more inclusive political institutions, an elected assembly, trial by
jury for ex-convicts and their families, and an end to transportation to
New South Wales. He started a newspaper, the Australian, which would
from then on lead the attack on the existing political institutions.
Macarthur didn’t like Wentworth and certainly not what he was asking
for. He went through a list of Wentworth’s supporters, characterizing
them as follows:</p>
<p>sentenced to be hung since he came here</p>
<p>repeatedly flogged at the cart’s tail a</p>
<p>London Jew</p>
<p>Jew publican lately deprived of his license</p>
<p>auctioneer transported for trading in slaves</p>
<p>often flogged here</p>
<p>son of two convicts</p>
<p>a swindler—deeply in debt</p>
<p>an American adventurer</p>
<p>an attorney with a worthless character</p>
<p>a stranger lately failed here in a musick shop</p>
<p>married to the daughter to two convicts</p>
<p>married to a convict who was formerly a tambourine girl.</p>
<p>Macarthur and the Squatters’ vigorous opposition could not stop the
tide in Australia, however. The demand for representative institutions
was strong and could not be suppressed. Until 1823 the governor had
ruled New South Wales more or less on his own. In that year his powers
were limited by the creation of a council appointed by the British
government. Initially the appointees were from the Squatters and
nonconvict elite, Macarthur among them, but this couldn’t last. In 1831
the governor Richard Bourke bowed to pressure and for the first time
allowed ex-convicts to sit on juries. Ex-convicts and in fact many new
free settlers also wanted transportation of convicts from Britain to
stop, because it created competition in the labor market and drove down
wages. The Squatters liked low wages, but they lost. In 1840
transportation to New South Wales was stopped, and in 1842 a legislative
council was created with two-thirds of its members being elected (the
rest appointed). Ex-convicts could stand for office and vote if they
held enough property, and many did. By the 1850s, Australia had
introduced adult white male suffrage. The demands of the citizens,
ex-convicts and their families, were now far ahead of what William
Wentworth had first imagined. In fact, by this time he was on the side
of conservatives insisting on an unelected Legislative Council. But just
like Macarthur before, Wentworth would not be able to halt the tide
toward more inclusive political institutions. In 1856 the state of
Victoria, which had been carved out of New South Wales in 1851, and the
state of Tasmania would become the first places in the world to
introduce an effective secret ballot in elections, which stopped vote
buying and coercion. Today we still call the standard method of
achieving secrecy in voting in elections the Australian ballot. The
initial circumstances in Sydney, New South Wales, were very similar to
those in Jamestown, Virginia, 181 years earlier, though the settlers at
Jamestown were mostly indentured laborers, rather than convicts. In both
cases the initial circumstances did not allow for the creation of
extractive colonial institutions. Neither colony had dense populations
of indigenous peoples to exploit, ready access to precious metals such
as gold or silver, or soil and crops that would make slave plantations
economically viable. The slave trade was still vibrant in the 1780s, and
New South Wales could have been filled up with slaves had it been
profitable. It wasn’t. Both the Virginia Company and the soldiers and
free settlers who ran New South Wales bowed to the pressures, gradually
creating inclusive economic institutions that developed in tandem with
inclusive political institutions. This happened with even less of a
struggle in New South Wales than it had in Virginia, and subsequent
attempts to put this trend into reverse failed.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA, LIKE THE UNITED STATES, experienced a different path to
inclusive institutions than the one taken by England. The same
revolutions that shook England during the Civil War and then the
Glorious Revolution were not needed in the United States or Australia
because of the very different circumstances in which those countries
were founded—though this of course does not mean that inclusive
institutions were established without any conflict, and, in the process,
the United States had to throw off British colonialism. In England there
was a long history of absolutist rule that was deeply entrenched and
required a revolution to remove it. In the United States and Australia,
there was no such thing. Though Lord Baltimore in Maryland and John
Macarthur in New South Wales might have aspired to such a role, they
could not establish a strong enough grip on society for their plans to
bear fruit. The inclusive institutions established in the United States
and Australia meant that the Industrial Revolution spread quickly to
these lands and they began to get rich. The path these countries took
was followed by colonies such as Canada and New Zealand. There were
still other paths to inclusive institutions. Large parts of Western
Europe took yet a third path to inclusive institutions under the impetus
of the French Revolution, which overthrew absolutism in France and then
generated a series of interstate conflicts that spread institutional
reform across much of Western Europe. The economic consequence of these
reforms was the emergence of inclusive economic institutions in most of
Western Europe, the Industrial Revolution, and economic growth.</p>
<p>BREAKING THE BARRIERS: THE FRENCH REVOLUTION</p>
<p>For the three centuries prior to 1789, France was ruled by an
absolutist monarchy. French society was divided into three segments, the
so-called estates. The aristocrats (the nobility) made up the First
Estate, the clergy the Second Estate, and everybody else the Third
Estate. Different estates were subject to different laws, and the first
two estates had rights that the rest of the population did not. The
nobility and the clergy did not pay taxes, while the citizens had to pay
several different taxes, as we would expect from a regime that was
largely extractive. In fact, not only was the Church exempt from taxes,
but it also owned large swaths of land and could impose its own taxes on
peasants. The monarch, the nobility, and the clergy enjoyed a luxurious
lifestyle, while much of the Third Estate lived in dire poverty.
Different laws not only guaranteed a greatly advantageous economic
position to the nobility and the clergy, but it also gave them political
power. Life in French cities of the eighteenth century was harsh and
unhealthy. Manufacturing was regulated by powerful guilds, which
generated good incomes for their members but prevented others from
entering these occupations or starting new businesses. The so-called
ancien régime prided itself on its continuity and stability. Entry by
entrepreneurs and talented individuals into new occupations would create
instability and was not tolerated. If life in the cities was harsh, life
in the villages was probably worse. As we have seen, by this time the
most extreme form of serfdom, which tied people to the land and forced
them to work for and pay dues to the feudal lords, was long in decline
in France. Nevertheless, there were restrictions on mobility and a
plethora of feudal dues that the French peasants were required to pay to
the monarch, the nobility, and the Church. Against this background, the
French Revolution was a radical affair. On August 4, 1789, the National
Constituent Assembly entirely changed French laws by proposing a new
constitution. The first article stated:</p>
<p>The National Assembly hereby completely abolishes the feudal system.
It decrees that, among the existing rights and dues, both feudal and
censuel, all those originating in or representing real or personal
serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification.</p>
<p>Its ninth article then continued:</p>
<p>Pecuniary privileges, personal or real, in the payment of taxes are
abolished forever. Taxes shall be collected from all the citizens, and
from all property, in the same manner and in the same form. Plans shall
be considered by which the taxes shall be paid proportionally by all,
even for the last six months of the current year.</p>
<p>Thus, in one swoop, the French Revolution abolished the feudal system
and all the obligations and dues that it entailed, and it entirely
removed the tax exemptions of the nobility and the clergy. But perhaps
what was most radical, even unthinkable at the time, was the eleventh
article, which stated:</p>
<p>All citizens, without distinction of birth, are eligible to any
office or dignity, whether ecclesiastical, civil, or military; and no
profession shall imply any derogation.</p>
<p>So there was now equality before the law for all, not only in daily
life and business, but also in politics. The reforms of the revolution
continued after August 4. It subsequently abolished the Church’s
authority to levy special taxes and turned the clergy into employees of
the state. Together with the removal of the rigid political and social
roles, critical barriers against economic activities were stamped out.
The guilds and all occupational restrictions were abolished, creating a
more level playing field in the cities. These reforms were a first step
toward ending the reign of the absolutist French monarchs. Several
decades of instability and war followed the declarations of August 4.
But an irreversible step was taken away from absolutism and extractive
institutions and toward inclusive political and economic institutions.
These changes would be followed by other reforms in the economy and in
politics, ultimately culminating in the Third Republic in 1870, which
would bring to France the type of parliamentary system that the Glorious
Revolution put in motion in England. The French Revolution created much
violence, suffering, instability, and war. Nevertheless, thanks to it,
the French did not get trapped with extractive institutions blocking
economic growth and prosperity, as did absolutist regimes of Eastern
Europe such as Austria-Hungary and Russia. How did the absolutist French
monarchy come to the brink of the 1789 revolution? After all, we have
seen that many absolutist regimes were able to survive for long periods
of time, even in the midst of economic stagnation and social upheaval.
As with most instances of revolutions and radical changes, it was a
confluence of factors that opened the way to the French Revolution, and
these were intimately related to the fact that Britain was
industrializing rapidly. And of course the path was, as usual,
contingent, as many attempts to stabilize the regime by the monarchy
failed and the revolution turned out to be more successful in changing
institutions in France and elsewhere in Europe than many could have
imagined in 1789. Many laws and privileges in France were remnants of
medieval times. They not only favored the First and Second Estates
relative to the majority of the population but also gave them privileges
vis-à-vis the Crown. Louis XIV, the Sun King, ruled France for
fifty-four years, between 1661 to his death in 1715, though he actually
came to the throne in 1643, at the age of five. He consolidated the
power of the monarchy, furthering the process toward greater absolutism
that had started centuries earlier. Many monarchs often consulted the
so-called Assembly of Notables, consisting of key aristocrats handpicked
by the Crown. Though largely consultative, the Assembly still acted as a
mild constraint on the monarch’s power. For this reason, Louis XIV ruled
without convening the Assembly. Under his reign, France achieved some
economic growth—for example, via participation in Atlantic and colonial
trade. Louis’s able minister of finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, also
oversaw the development of government-sponsored and
government-controlled industry, a type of extractive growth. This
limited amount of growth benefited almost exclusively the First and
Second Estates. Louis XIV also wanted to rationalize the French tax
system, because the state often had problems financing its frequent
wars, its large standing army, and the King’s own luxurious retinue,
consumption, and palaces. Its inability to tax even the minor nobility
put severe limits on its revenues. Though there had been little economic
growth, by the time Louis XVI came to power in 1774, there had
nevertheless been large changes in society. Moreover, the earlier fiscal
problems had turned into a fiscal crisis, and the Seven Years’ War with
the British between 1756 and 1763, in which France lost Canada, had been
particularly costly. A number of significant figures attempted to
balance the royal budget by restructuring the debt and increasing taxes;
among them were Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, one of the most famous
economists of the time; Jacques Necker, who would also play an important
role after the revolution; and Charles Alexandre de Calonne. But none
succeeded. Calonne, as part of his strategy, persuaded Louis XVI to
summon the Assembly of Notables. The king and his advisers expected the
Assembly to endorse his reforms much in the same way as Charles I
expected the English Parliament to simply agree to pay for an army to
fight the Scottish when he called it in 1640. The Assembly took an
unexpected step and decreed that only a representative body, the
Estates-General, could endorse such reforms. The Estates-General was a
very different body from the Assembly of Notables. While the latter
consisted of the nobility and was largely handpicked by the Crown from
among major aristocrats, the former included representatives from all
three estates. It had last been convened in 1614. When the
Estates-General gathered in 1789 in Versailles, it became immediately
clear that no agreement could be reached. There were irreconcilable
differences, as the Third Estate saw this as its chance to increase its
political power and wanted to have more votes in the Estates-General,
which the nobility and the clergy steadfastly opposed. The meeting ended
on May 5, 1789, without any resolution, except the decision to convene a
more powerful body, the National Assembly, deepening the political
crisis. The Third Estate, particularly the merchants, businessmen,
professionals, and artisans, who all had demands for greater power, saw
these developments as evidence of their increasing clout. In the
National Assembly, they therefore demanded even more say in the
proceedings and greater rights in general. Their support in the streets
all over the country by citizens emboldened by these developments led to
the reconstitution of the Assembly as the National Constituent Assembly
on July 9. Meanwhile, the mood in the country, and especially in Paris,
was becoming more radical. In reaction, the conservative circles around
Louis XVI persuaded him to sack Necker, the reformist finance minister.
This led to further radicalization in the streets. The outcome was the
famous storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. From this point
onward, the revolution started in earnest. Necker was reinstated, and
the revolutionary Marquis de Lafayette was put in charge of the National
Guard of Paris. Even more remarkable than the storming of the Bastille
were the dynamics of the National Constituent Assembly, which on August
4, 1789, with its newfound confidence, passed the new constitution,
abolishing feudalism and the special privileges of the First and Second
Estates. But this radicalization led to fractionalization within the
Assembly, since there were many conflicting views about the shape that
society should take. The first step was the formation of local clubs,
most notably the radical Jacobin Club, which would later take control of
the revolution. At the same time, the nobles were fleeing the country in
great numbers—the so-called émigrés. Many were also encouraging the king
to break with the Assembly and take action, either by himself or with
the help of foreign powers, such as Austria, the native country of Queen
Marie Antoinette and where most of the émigrés had fled. As many in the
streets started to see an imminent threat against the achievements of
the revolution over the past two years, radicalization gathered pace.
The National Constituent Assembly passed the final version of the
constitution on September 29, 1791, turning France into a constitutional
monarchy, with equality of rights for all men, no feudal obligations or
dues, and an end to all trading restrictions imposed by guilds. France
was still a monarchy, but the king now had little role and, in fact, not
even his freedom. But the dynamics of the revolution were then
irreversibly altered by the war that broke out in 1792 between France
and the “first coalition,” led by Austria. The war increased the resolve
and radicalism of the revolutionaries and of the masses (the so-called
sans-culottes, which translates as “without knee breeches,” because they
could not afford to wear the style of trousers then fashionable). The
outcome of this process was the period known as the Terror, under the
command of the Jacobin faction led by Robespierre and Saint-Just,
unleashed after the executions of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. It led
to the executions of not only scores of aristocrats and
counterrevolutionaries but also several major figures of the revolution,
including the former popular leaders Brissot, Danton, and Desmoulins.
But the Terror soon spun out of control and ultimately came to an end in
July 1794 with the execution of its own leaders, including Robespierre
and Saint-Just. There followed a phase of relative stability, first
under the somewhat ineffective Directory, between 1795 and 1799, and
then with more concentrated power in the form of a three-person
Consulate, consisting of Ducos, Sieyès, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Already
during the Directory, the young general Napoleon Bonaparte had become
famous for his military successes, and his influence was only to grow
after 1799. The Consulate soon became Napoleon’s personal rule. The
years between 1799 and the end of Napoleon’s reign, 1815, witnessed a
series of great military victories for France, including those at
Austerlitz, Jena-Auerstadt, and Wagram, bringing continental Europe to
its knees. They also allowed Napoleon to impose his will, his reforms,
and his legal code across a wide swath of territory. The fall of
Napoleon after his final defeat in 1815 would also bring a period of
retrenchment, more restricted political rights, and the restoration of
the French monarchy under Louis XVII. But all these were simply slowing
the ultimate emergence of inclusive political institutions. The forces
unleashed by the revolution of 1789 ended French absolutism and would
inevitably, even if slowly, lead to the emergence of inclusive
institutions. France, and those parts of Europe where the revolutionary
reforms had been exported, would thus take part in the industrialization
process already under way in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>EXPORTING THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>On the eve of the French Revolution in 1789, there were severe
restrictions placed on Jews throughout Europe. In the German city of
Frankfurt, for example, their lives were regulated by orders set out in
a statute dating from the Middle Ages. There could be no more than five
hundred Jewish families in Frankfurt, and they all had to live in a
small, walled part of town, the Judengasse, the Jewish ghetto. They
could not leave the ghetto at night, on Sundays, or during any Christian
festival. The Judengasse was incredibly cramped. It was a quarter of a
mile long but no more than twelve feet wide and in some places less than
ten feet wide. Jews lived under constant repression and regulation. Each
year, at most two new families could be admitted to the ghetto, and at
most twelve Jewish couples could get married, and only if they were both
above the age of twenty-five. Jews could not farm; they could also not
trade in weapons, spices, wine, or grain. Until 1726 they had to wear
specific markers, two concentric yellow rings for men and a striped veil
for women. All Jews had to pay a special poll tax. As the French
Revolution erupted, a successful young businessman, Mayer Amschel
Rothschild, lived in the Frankfurt Judengasse. By the early 1780s,
Rothschild had established himself as the leading dealer in coins,
metals, and antiques in Frankfurt. But like all Jews in the city, he
could not open a business outside the ghetto or even live outside it.
This was all to change soon. In 1791 the French National Assembly
emancipated French Jewry. The French armies were now also occupying the
Rhineland and emancipating the Jews of Western Germany. In Frankfurt
their effect would be more abrupt and perhaps somewhat unintentional. In
1796 the French bombarded Frankfurt, demolishing half of the Judengasse
in the process. Around two thousand Jews were left homeless and had to
move outside the ghetto. The Rothschilds were among them. Once outside
the ghetto, and now freed from the myriad regulations barring them from
entrepreneurship, they could seize new business opportunities. This
included a contract to supply grain to the Austrian army, something they
would previously not have been allowed to do. By the end of the decade,
Rothschild was one of the richest Jews in Frankfurt and already a
well-established businessman. Full emancipation had to wait until 1811;
it was finally implemented by Karl von Dalberg, who had been made Grand
Duke of Frankfurt in Napoleon’s 1806 reorganization of Germany. Mayer
Amschel told his son, “〔Y〕ou are now a citizen.”</p>
<p>Such events did not end the struggle for Jewish emancipation, since
there were subsequent reverses, particularly at the Congress of Vienna
of 1815, which formed the post-Napoleonic political settlement. But
there was no going back to the ghetto for the Rothschilds. Mayer Amschel
and his sons would soon have the largest bank in nineteenth-century
Europe, with branches in Frankfurt, London, Paris, Naples, and Vienna.
This was not an isolated event. First the French Revolutionary Armies
and then Napoleon invaded large parts of continental Europe, and in
almost all the areas they invaded, the existing institutions were
remnants of medieval times, empowering kings, princes, and nobility and
restricting trade both in cities and the countryside. Serfdom and
feudalism were much more important in many of these areas than in France
itself. In Eastern Europe, including Prussia and the Hungarian part of
Austria-Hungary, serfs were tied to the land. In the West this strict
form of serfdom had already vanished, but peasants owed to feudal lords
various seigneurial fees, taxes, and labor obligations. For example, in
the polity of Nassau-Usingen, peasants were subject to 230 different
payments, dues, and services. Dues included one that had to be paid
after an animal had been slaughtered, called the blood tithe; there was
also a bee tithe and a wax tithe. If a piece of property was bought or
sold, the lord was owed fees. The guilds regulating all kinds of
economic activity in the cities were also typically stronger in these
places than in France. In the western German cities of Cologne and
Aachen, the adoption of spinning and weaving textile machines was
blocked by guilds. Many cities, from Berne in Switzerland to Florence in
Italy, were controlled by a few families. The leaders of the French
Revolution and, subsequently, Napoleon exported the revolution to these
lands, destroying absolutism, ending feudal land relations, abolishing
guilds, and imposing equality before the law—the all-important notion of
rule of law, which we will discuss in greater detail in the next
chapter. The French Revolution thus prepared not only France but much of
the rest of Europe for inclusive institutions and the economic growth
that these would spur. As we have seen, alarmed by the developments in
France, several European powers organized around Austria in 1792 to
attack France, ostensibly to free King Louis XVI, but in reality to
crush the French Revolution. The expectation was that the makeshift
armies fielded by the revolution would soon crumble. But after some
early defeats, the armies of the new French Republic were victorious in
an initially defensive war. There were serious organizational problems
to overcome. But the French were ahead of other countries in a major
innovation: mass conscription. Introduced in August 1793, mass
conscription allowed the French to field large armies and develop a
military advantage verging on supremacy even before Napoleon’s famous
military skills came on the scene. Initial military success encouraged
the Republic’s leadership to expand France’s borders, with an eye toward
creating an effective buffer between the new republic and the hostile
monarchs of Prussia and Austria. The French quickly seized the Austrian
Netherlands and the United Provinces, essentially today’s Belgium and
the Netherlands. The French also took over much of modern-day
Switzerland. In all three places, the French had strong control through
the 1790s. Germany was initially hotly contested. But by 1795, the
French had firm control over the Rhineland, the western part of Germany
lying on the left bank of the Rhine River. The Prussians were forced to
recognize this fact under the Treaty of Basel. Between 1795 and 1802,
the French held the Rhineland, but not any other part of Germany. In
1802 the Rhineland was officially incorporated into France. Italy
remained the main seat of war in the second half the 1790s, with the
Austrians as the opponents. Savoy was annexed by France in 1792, and a
stalemate was reached until Napoleon’s invasion in April 1796. In his
first major continental campaign, by early 1797, Napoleon had conquered
almost all Northern Italy, except for Venice, which was taken by the
Austrians. The Treaty of Campo Formio, signed with the Austrians in
October 1797, ended the War of the First Coalition and recognized a
number of French-controlled republics in Northern Italy. However, the
French continued to expand their control over Italy even after this
treaty, invading the Papal States and establishing the Roman Republic in
March 1798. In January 1799, Naples was conquered and the Parthenopean
Republic created. With the exception of Venice, which remained Austrian,
the French now controlled the entire Italian peninsula either directly,
as in the case of Savoy, or through satellite states, such as the
Cisalpine, Ligurian, Roman, and Parthenopean republics. There was
further back-and-forth in the War of the Second Coalition, between 1798
and 1801, but this ended with the French essentially remaining in
control. The French revolutionary armies quickly started carrying out a
radical process of reform in the lands they’d conquered, abolishing the
remaining vestiges of serfdom and feudal land relations and imposing
equality before the law. The clergy were stripped of their special
status and power, and the guilds in urban areas were stamped out or at
the very least much weakened. This happened in the Austrian Netherlands
immediately after the French invasion in 1795 and in the United
Provinces, where the French founded the Batavian Republic, with
political institutions very similar to those in France. In Switzerland
the situation was similar, and the guilds as well as feudal landlords
and the Church were defeated, feudal privileges removed, and the guilds
abolished and expropriated. What was started by the French Revolutionary
Armies was continued, in one form or another, by Napoleon. Napoleon was
first and foremost interested in establishing firm control over the
territories he conquered. This sometimes involved cutting deals with
local elites or putting his family and associates in charge, as during
his brief control of Spain and Poland. But Napoleon also had a genuine
desire to continue and deepen the reforms of the revolution. Most
important, he codified the Roman law and the ideas of equality before
the law into a legal system that became known as the Code Napoleon.
Napoleon saw this code as his greatest legacy and wished to impose it in
every territory he controlled. Of course, the reforms imposed by the
French Revolution and Napoleon were not irreversible. In some places,
such as in Hanover, Germany, the old elites were reinstated shortly
after Napoleon’s fall and much of what the French achieved was lost for
good. But in many other places, feudalism, the guilds, and the nobility
were permanently destroyed or weakened. For instance, even after the
French left, in many cases the Code Napoleon remained in effect. All in
all, French armies wrought much suffering in Europe, but they also
radically changed the lay of the land. In much of Europe, gone were
feudal relations; the power of the guilds; the absolutist control of
monarchs and princes; the grip of the clergy on economic, social, and
political power; and the foundation of ancien régime, which treated
different people unequally based on their birth status. These changes
created the type of inclusive economic institutions that would then
allow industrialization to take root in these places. By the middle of
the nineteenth century, industrialization was rapidly under way in
almost all the places that the French controlled, whereas places such as
Austria-Hungary and Russia, which the French did not conquer, or Poland
and Spain, where French hold was temporary and limited, were still
largely stagnant.</p>
<p>SEEKING MODERNITY</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1867, Ōkubo Toshimichi, a leading courtier of the
feudal Japanese Satsuma domain, traveled from the capital of Edo, now
Tokyo, to the regional city of Yamaguchi. On October 14 he met with
leaders of the Chōshū domain. He had a simple proposal: they would join
forces, march their armies to Edo, and overthrow the shogun, the ruler
of Japan. By this time Ōkubo Toshimichi already had the leaders of the
Tosa and Aki domains on board. Once the leaders of the powerful Chōshū
agreed, a secret Satcho Alliance was formed. In 1868 Japan was an
economically underdeveloped country that had been controlled since 1600
by the Tokugawa family, whose ruler had taken the title shogun
(commander) in 1603. The Japanese emperor was sidelined and assumed a
purely ceremonial role. The Tokugawa shoguns were the dominant members
of a class of feudal lords who ruled and taxed their own domains, among
them those of Satsuma, ruled by the Shimazu family. These lords, along
with their military retainers, the famous samurai, ran a society that
was similar to that of medieval Europe, with strict occupational
categories, restrictions on trade, and high rates of taxation on
farmers. The shogun ruled from Edo, where he monopolized and controlled
foreign trade and banned foreigners from the country. Political and
economic institutions were extractive, and Japan was poor. But the
domination of the shogun was not complete. Even as the Tokugawa family
took over the country in 1600, they could not control everyone. In the
south of the country, the Satsuma domain remained quite autonomous and
was even allowed to trade independently with the outside world through
the Ryūkyū Islands. It was in the Satsuma capital of Kagoshima where
Ōkubo Toshimichi was born in 1830. As the son of a samurai, he, too,
became a samurai. His talent was spotted early on by Shimazu Nariakira,
the lord of Satsuma, who quickly promoted him in the bureaucracy. At the
time, Shimazu Nariakira had already formulated a plan to use Satsuma
troops to overthrow the shogun. He wanted to expand trade with Asia and
Europe, abolish the old feudal economic institutions, and construct a
modern state in Japan. His nascent plan was cut short by his death in
1858. His successor, Shimazu Hisamitsu, was more circumspect, at least
initially. Ōkubo Toshimichi had by now become more and more convinced
that Japan needed to overthrow the feudal shogunate, and he eventually
convinced Shimazu Hisamitsu. To rally support for their cause, they
wrapped it in outrage over the sidelining of the emperor. The treaty
(Ōkubo Toshimichi had already signed with the Tosa domain asserted that
“a country does not have two monarchs, a home does not have two masters;
government devolves to one ruler.” But the real intention was not simply
to restore the emperor to power but to change the political and economic
institutions completely. On the Tosa side, one of the treaty’s signers
was Sakamoto Ryūma. As Satsuma and Chōshū mobilized their armies,
Sakamoto Ryūma presented the shogun with an eight-point plan, urging him
to resign to avoid civil war. The plan was radical, and though clause 1
stated that “political power of the country should be returned to the
Imperial Court, and all decrees issued by the Court,” it included far
more than just the restoration of the emperor. Clauses 2, 3, 4, and 5
stated:</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Two legislative bodies, an Upper and Lower house, should be
established, and all government measures should be decided on the basis
of general opinion. 3. Men of ability among the lords, nobles and people
at large should be employed as councillors, and traditional offices of
the past which have lost their purpose should be abolished. 4. Foreign
affairs should be carried on according to appropriate regulations worked
out on the basis of general opinion. 5. Legislation and regulations of
earlier times should be set aside and a new and adequate code should be
selected. Shogun Yoshinobu agreed to resign, and on January 3, 1868, the
Meiji Restoration was declared; Emperor Kōmei and, one month later after
Kōmei died, his son Meiji were restored to power. Though Satsuma and
Chōshū forces now occupied Edo and the imperial capital Kyōto, they
feared that the Tokugawas would attempt to regain power and re-create
the shogunate. (Ōkubo Toshimichi wanted the Tokugawas crushed forever.
He persuaded the emperor to abolish the Tokugawa domain and confiscate
their lands. On January 27 the former shogun Yoshinobu attacked Satsuma
and Chōshū forces, and civil war broke out; it raged until the summer,
when finally the Tokugawas were vanquished. Following the Meiji
Restoration there was a process of transformative institutional reforms
in Japan. In 1869 feudalism was abolished, and the three hundred fiefs
were surrendered to the government and turned into prefectures, under
the control of an appointed governor. Taxation was centralized, and a
modern bureaucratic state replaced the old feudal one. In 1869 the
equality of all social classes before the law was introduced, and
restrictions on internal migration and trade were abolished. The samurai
class was abolished, though not without having to put down some
rebellions. Individual property rights on land were introduced, and
people were allowed freedom to enter and practice any trade. The state
became heavily involved in the construction of infrastructure. In
contrast to the attitudes of absolutist regimes to railways, in 1869 the
Japanese regime formed a steamship line between Tokyo and Osaka and
built the first railway between Tokyo and Yokohama. It also began to
develop a manufacturing industry, and (Ōkubo Toshimichi, as minister of
finance, oversaw the beginning of a concerted effort of
industrialization. The lord of Satsuma domain had been a leader in this,
building factories for pottery, cannon, and cotton yarn and importing
English textile machinery to create the first modern cotton spinning
mill in Japan in 1861. He also built two modern shipyards. By 1890 Japan
was the first Asian country to adopt a written constitution, and it
created a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament, the Diet,
and an independent judiciary. These changes were decisive factors in
enabling Japan to be the primary beneficiary from the Industrial
Revolution in Asia.</li>
</ol>
<p>IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY both China and Japan were poor nations,
languishing under absolutist regimes. The absolutist regime in China had
been suspicious of change for centuries. Though there were many
similarities between China and Japan—the Tokugawa shogunate had also
banned overseas trade in the seventeenth century, as Chinese emperors
had done earlier, and were opposed to economic and political
change—there were also notable political differences. China was a
centralized bureaucratic empire ruled by an absolute emperor. The
emperor certainly faced constraints on his power, the most important of
which was the threat of rebellion. During the period 1850 to 1864, the
whole of southern China was ravaged by the Taiping Rebellion, in which
millions died either in conflict or through mass starvation. But
opposition to the emperor was not institutionalized. The structure of
Japanese political institutions was different. The shogunate had
sidelined the emperor, but as we have seen, the Tokugawa power was not
absolute, and domains such as that of the Satsumas maintained
independence, even the ability to conduct foreign trade on their own
behalf. As with France, an important consequence of the British
Industrial Revolution for China and Japan was military vulnerability.
China was humbled by British sea power during the First Opium War,
between 1839 and 1842, and the same threat became all too real for the
Japanese as U.S. warships, led by Commodore Matthew Perry, pulled into
Edo Bay in 1853. The reality that economic backwardness created military
backwardness was part of the impetus behind Shimazu Nariakira’s plan to
overthrow the shogunate and put in motion the changes that eventually
led to the Meiji Restoration. The leaders of the Satsuma domain realized
that economic growth—perhaps even Japanese survival—could be achieved
only by institutional reforms, but the shogun opposed this because his
power was tied to the existing set of institutions. To exact reforms,
the shogun had to be overthrown, and he was. The situation was similar
in China, but the different initial political institutions made it much
harder to overthrow the emperor, something that happened only in 1911.
Instead of reforming institutions, the Chinese tried to match the
British militarily by importing modern weapons. The Japanese built their
own armaments industry. As a consequence of these initial differences,
each country responded differently to the challenges of the nineteenth
century, and Japan and China diverged dramatically in the face of the
critical juncture created by the Industrial Revolution. While Japanese
institutions were being transformed and the economy was embarking on a
path of rapid growth, in China forces pushing for institutional change
were not strong enough, and extractive institutions persisted largely
unabated until they would take a turn for the worse with Mao’s communist
revolution in 1949.</p>
<p>ROOTS OF WORLD INEQUALITY</p>
<p>This and the previous three chapters have told the story of how
inclusive economic and political institutions emerged in England to make
the Industrial Revolution possible, and why certain countries benefited
from the Industrial Revolution and embarked on the path to growth, while
others did not or, in fact, steadfastly refused to allow even the
beginning of industrialization. Whether a country did embark on
industrialization was largely a function of its institutions. The United
States, which underwent a transformation similar to the English Glorious
Revolution, had already developed its own brand of inclusive political
and economic institutions by the end of the eighteenth century. It would
thus become the first nation to exploit the new technologies coming from
the British Isles, and would soon surpass Britain and become the
forerunner of industrialization and technological change. Australia
followed a similar path to inclusive institutions, even if somewhat
later and somewhat less noticed. Its citizens, just like those in
England and the United States, had to fight to obtain inclusive
institutions. Once these were in place, Australia would launch its own
process of economic growth. Australia and the United States could
industrialize and grow rapidly because their relatively inclusive
institutions would not block new technologies, innovation, or creative
destruction. Not so in most of the other European colonies. Their
dynamics would be quite the opposite of those in Australia and the
United States. Lack of a native population or resources to be extracted
made colonialism in Australia and the United States a very different
sort of affair, even if their citizens had to fight hard for their
political rights and for inclusive institutions. In the Moluccas as in
the many other places Europeans colonized in Asia, in the Caribbean, and
in South America, citizens had little chance of winning such a fight. In
these places, European colonists imposed a new brand of extractive
institutions, or took over whatever extractive institutions they found,
in order to be able to extract valuable resources, ranging from spices
and sugar to silver and gold. In many of these places, they put in
motion a set of institutional changes that would make the emergence of
inclusive institutions very unlikely. In some of them they explicitly
stamped out whatever burgeoning industry or inclusive economic
institutions existed. Most of these places would be in no situation to
benefit from industrialization in the nineteenth century or even in the
twentieth. The dynamics in the rest of Europe were also quite different
from those in Australia and the United States. As the Industrial
Revolution in Britain was gathering speed at the end of the eighteenth
century, most European countries were ruled by absolutist regimes,
controlled by monarchs and by aristocracies whose major source of income
was from their landholdings or from trading privileges they enjoyed
thanks to prohibitive entry barriers. The creative destruction that
would be wrought by the process of industrialization would erode the
leaders’ trading profits and take resources and labor away from their
lands. The aristocracies would be economic losers from
industrialization. More important, they would also be political losers,
as the process of industrialization would undoubtedly create instability
and political challenges to their monopoly of political power. But the
institutional transitions in Britain and the Industrial Revolution
created new opportunities and challenges for European states. Though
there was absolutism in Western Europe, the region had also shared much
of the institutional drift that had impacted Britain in the previous
millennium. But the situation was very different in Eastern Europe, the
Ottoman Empire, and China. These differences mattered for the
dissemination of industrialization. Just like the Black Death or the
rise of Atlantic trade, the critical juncture created by
industrialization intensified the ever-present conflict over
institutions in many European nations. A major factor was the French
Revolution of 1789. The end of absolutism in France opened the way for
inclusive institutions, and the French ultimately embarked on
industrialization and rapid economic growth. The French Revolution in
fact did more than that. It exported its institutions by invading and
forcibly reforming the extractive institutions of several neighboring
countries. It thus opened the way to industrialization not only in
France, but in Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and parts of
Germany and Italy. Farther east the reaction was similar to that after
the Black Death, when, instead of crumbling, feudalism intensified.
Austria-Hungary, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire fell even further behind
economically, but their absolutist monarchies managed to stay in place
until the First World War. Elsewhere in the world, absolutism was as
resilient as in Eastern Europe. This was particularly true in China,
where the Ming-Qing transition led to a state committed to building a
stable agrarian society and hostile to international trade. But there
were also institutional differences that mattered in Asia. If China
reacted to the Industrial Revolution as Eastern Europe did, Japan
reacted in the same way as Western Europe. Just as in France, it took a
revolution to change the system, this time one led by the renegade lords
of the Satsuma, Chōshū, Tosa, and Aki domains. These lords overthrew the
shogun, created the Meiji Restoration, and moved Japan onto the path of
institutional reforms and economic growth. We also saw that absolutism
was resilient in isolated Ethiopia. Elsewhere on the continent the very
same force of international trade that helped to transform English
institutions in the seventeenth century locked large parts of western
and central Africa into highly extractive institutions via the slave
trade. This destroyed societies in some places and led to the creation
of extractive slaving states in others. The institutional dynamics we
have described ultimately determined which countries took advantage of
the major opportunities present in the nineteenth century onward and
which ones failed to do so. The roots of the world inequality we observe
today can be found in this divergence. With a few exceptions, the rich
countries of today are those that embarked on the process of
industrialization and technological change starting in the nineteenth
century, and the poor ones are those that did not.</p>
