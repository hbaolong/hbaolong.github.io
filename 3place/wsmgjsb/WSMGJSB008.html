<h4 id="the-turning-point">7. THE TURNING POINT</h4>
<p>TROUBLE WITH STOCKINGS</p>
<p>IN 1583 WILLIAM LEE returned from his studies at the University of
Cambridge to become the local priest in Calverton, England. Elizabeth I
(1558–1603) had recently issued a ruling that her people should always
wear a knitted cap. Lee recorded that “knitters were the only means of
producing such garments but it took so long to finish the article. I
began to think. I watched my mother and my sisters sitting in the
evening twilight plying their needles. If garments were made by two
needles and one line of thread, why not several needles to take up the
thread.”</p>
<p>This momentous thought was the beginning of the mechanization of
textile production. Lee became obsessed with making a machine that would
free people from endless hand-knitting. He recalled, “My duties to
Church and family I began to neglect. The idea of my machine and the
creating of it ate into my heart and brain.”</p>
<p>Finally, in 1589, his “stocking frame” knitting machine was ready. He
traveled to London with excitement to seek an interview with Elizabeth I
to show her how useful the machine would be and to ask her for a patent
that would stop other people from copying the design. He rented a
building to set the machine up and, with the help of his local member of
Parliament Richard Parkyns, met Henry Carey, Lord Hundson, a member of
the Queen’s Privy Council. Carey arranged for Queen Elizabeth to come
see the machine, but her reaction was devastating. She refused to grant
Lee a patent, instead observing, “Thou aimest high, Master Lee. Consider
thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects. It would assuredly
bring to them ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them
beggars.” Crushed, Lee moved to France to try his luck there; when he
failed there, too, he returned to England, where he asked James I
(1603–1625), Elizabeth’s successor, for a patent. James I also refused,
on the same grounds as Elizabeth. Both feared that the mechanization of
stocking production would be politically destabilizing. It would throw
people out of work, create unemployment and political instability, and
threaten royal power. The stocking frame was an innovation that promised
huge productivity increases, but it also promised creative
destruction.</p>
<p>THE REACTION TO LEE’S brilliant invention illustrates a key idea of
this book. The fear of creative destruction is the main reason why there
was no sustained increase in living standards between the Neolithic and
Industrial revolutions. Technological innovation makes human societies
prosperous, but also involves the replacement of the old with the new,
and the destruction of the economic privileges and political power of
certain people. For sustained economic growth we need new technologies,
new ways of doing things, and more often than not they will come from
newcomers such as Lee. It may make society prosperous, but the process
of creative destruction that it initiates threatens the livelihood of
those who work with old technologies, such as the hand-knitters who
would have found themselves unemployed by Lee’s technology. More
important, major innovations such as Lee’s stocking frame machine also
threaten to reshape political power. Ultimately it was not concern about
the fate of those who might become unemployed as a result of Lee’s
machine that led Elizabeth I and James I to oppose his patent; it was
their fear that they would become political losers—their concern that
those displaced by the invention would create political instability and
threaten their own power. As we saw with the Luddites (this page–this
page), it is often possible to bypass the resistance of workers such as
hand-knitters. But the elite, especially when their political power is
threatened, form a more formidable barrier to innovation. The fact that
they have much to lose from creative destruction means not only that
they will not be the ones introducing new innovations but also that they
will often resist and try to stop such innovations. Thus society needs
newcomers to introduce the most radical innovations, and these newcomers
and the creative destruction they wreak must often overcome several
sources of resistance, including that from powerful rulers and elites.
Prior to seventeenth-century England, extractive institutions were the
norm throughout history. They have at times been able to generate
economic growth, as shown in the last two chapters, especially when
they’ve contained inclusive elements, as in Venice and Rome. But they
did not permit creative destruction. The growth they generated was not
sustained, and came to an end because of the absence of new innovations,
because of political infighting generated by the desire to benefit from
extraction, or because the nascent inclusive elements were conclusively
reversed, as in Venice. The life expectancy of a resident of the
Natufian village of Abu Hureyra was probably not that much different
from that of a citizen of Ancient Rome. The life expectancy of a typical
Roman was fairly similar to that of an average inhabitant of England in
the seventeenth century. In terms of incomes, in 301 AD the Roman
emperor Diocletian issued the Edict on Maximum Prices, which set out a
schedule of wages that various types of workers would be paid. We don’t
know exactly how well Diocletian’s wages and prices were enforced, but
when the economic historian Robert Allen used his edict to calculate the
living standards of a typical unskilled worker, he found them to be
almost exactly the same as those of an unskilled worker in
seventeenth-century Italy. Farther north, in England, wages were higher
and increasing, and things were changing. How this came to be is the
topic of this chapter.</p>
<p>EVER-PRESENT POLITICAL CONFLICT</p>
<p>Conflict over institutions and the distribution of resources has been
pervasive throughout history. We saw, for example, how political
conflict shaped the evolution of Ancient Rome and Venice, where it was
ultimately resolved in favor of the elites, who were able to increase
their hold on power. English history is also full of conflict between
the monarchy and its subjects, between different factions fighting for
power, and between elites and citizens. The outcome, though, has not
always been to strengthen the power of those who held it. In 1215 the
barons, the layer of the elite beneath the king, stood up to King John
and made him sign the Magna Carta (“the Great Charter”) at Runnymede
(see Map 9, this page). This document enacted some basic principles that
were significant challenges to the authority of the king. Most
important, it established that the king had to consult with the barons
in order to raise taxes. The most contentious clause was number 61,
which stated that “the barons shall choose any twenty-five barons of the
realm they wish, who with all their might are to observe, maintain and
cause to be observed the peace and liberties which we have granted and
confirmed to them by this our present charter.” In essence, the barons
created a council to make sure that the king implemented the charter,
and if he didn’t, these twenty-five barons had the right to seize
castles, lands, and possessions “… until, in their judgement, amends
have been made.” King John didn’t like the Magna Carta, and as soon as
the barons dispersed, he got the pope to annul it. But both the
political power of the barons and the influence of the Magna Carta
remained. England had taken its first hesitant step toward pluralism.
Conflict over political institutions continued, and the power of the
monarchy was further constrained by the first elected Parliament in
1265. Unlike the Plebeian Assembly in Rome or the elected legislatures
of today, its members had originally been feudal nobles, and
subsequently were knights and the wealthiest aristocrats of the nation.
Despite consisting of elites, the English Parliament developed two
distinguishing characteristics. First, it represented not only elites
closely allied to the king but also a broad set of interests, including
minor aristocrats involved in different walks of life, such as commerce
and industry, and later the “gentry,” a new class of commercial and
upwardly mobile farmers. Thus the Parliament empowered a quite broad
section of society—especially by the standards of the time. Second, and
largely as a result of the first characteristic, many members of
Parliament were consistently opposed to the monarchy’s attempts to
increase its power and would become the mainstay of those fighting
against the monarchy in the English Civil War and then in the Glorious
Revolution. The Magna Carta and the first elected Parliament
notwithstanding, political conflict continued over the powers of the
monarchy and who was to be king. This intra-elite conflict ended with
the War of the Roses, a long duel between the Houses of Lancaster and
York, two families with contenders to be king. The winners were the
Lancastrians, whose candidate for king, Henry Tudor, became Henry VII in
1485. Two other interrelated processes took place. The first was
increasing political centralization, put into motion by the Tudors.
After 1485 Henry VII disarmed the aristocracy, in effect demilitarizing
them and thereby massively expanding the power of the central state. His
son, Henry VIII, then implemented through his chief minister, Thomas
Cromwell, a revolution in government. In the 1530s, Cromwell introduced
a nascent bureaucratic state. Instead of the government being just the
private household of the king, it could become a separate set of
enduring institutions. This was complemented by Henry VIII’s break with
the Roman Catholic Church and the “Dissolution of the Monasteries,” in
which Henry expropriated all the Church lands. The removal of the power
of the Church was part of making the state more centralized. This
centralization of state institutions meant that for the first time,
inclusive political institutions became possible. This process initiated
by Henry VII and Henry VIII not only centralized state institutions but
also increased the demand for broader-based political representation.
The process of political centralization can actually lead to a form of
absolutism, as the king and his associates can crush other powerful
groups in society. This is indeed one of the reasons why there will be
opposition against state centralization, as we saw in chapter 3.
However, in opposition to this force, the centralization of state
institutions can also mobilize demand for a nascent form of pluralism,
as it did in Tudor England. When the barons and local elites recognize
that political power will be increasingly more centralized and that this
process is hard to stop, they will make demands to have a say in how
this centralized power is used. In England during the late fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, this meant greater efforts by these groups to have
Parliament as a counterweight against the Crown and to partially control
the way the state functioned. Thus the Tudor project not only initiated
political centralization, one pillar of inclusive institutions, but also
indirectly contributed to pluralism, the other pillar of inclusive
institutions. These developments in political institutions took place in
the context of other major changes in the nature of society.
Particularly significant was the widening of political conflict which
was broadening the set of groups with the ability to make demands on the
monarchy and the political elites. The Peasants’ Revolt of 1381 (this
page) was pivotal, after which the English elite were rocked by a long
sequence of popular insurrections. Political power was being
redistributed not simply from the king to the lords, but also from the
elite to the people. These changes, together with the increasing
constraints on the king’s power, made the emergence of a broad coalition
opposed to absolutism possible and thus laid the foundations for
pluralistic political institutions. Though contested, the political and
economic institutions the Tudors inherited and sustained were clearly
extractive. In 1603 Elizabeth I, Henry VIII’s daughter who had acceded
to the throne of England in 1553, died without children, and the Tudors
were replaced by the Stuart dynasty. The first Stuart king, James I,
inherited not only the institutions but the conflicts over them. He
desired to be an absolutist ruler. Though the state had become more
centralized and social change was redistributing power in society,
political institutions were not yet pluralistic. In the economy,
extractive institutions manifested themselves not just in the opposition
to Lee’s invention, but in the form of monopolies, monopolies, and more
monopolies. In 1601 a list of these was read out in Parliament, with one
member ironically asking, “Is not bread there?” By 1621 there were seven
hundred of them. As the English historian Christopher Hill put it, a man
lived</p>
<p>in a house built with monopoly bricks, with windows … of monopoly
glass; heated by monopoly coal (in Ireland monopoly timber), burning in
a grate made of monopoly iron … He washed himself in monopoly soap, his
clothes in monopoly starch. He dressed in monopoly lace, monopoly linen,
monopoly leather, monopoly gold thread … His clothes were held up by
monopoly belts, monopoly buttons, monopoly pins. They were dyed with
monopoly dyes. He ate monopoly butter, monopoly currants, monopoly red
herrings, monopoly salmon, and monopoly lobsters. His food was seasoned
with monopoly salt, monopoly pepper, monopoly vinegar … He wrote with
monopoly pens, on monopoly writing paper; read (through monopoly
spectacles, by the light of monopoly candles) monopoly printed
books.</p>
<p>These monopolies, and many more, gave individuals or groups the sole
right to control the production of many goods. They impeded the type of
allocation of talent, which is so crucial to economic prosperity. Both
James I and his son and successor Charles I aspired to strengthen the
monarchy, reduce the influence of Parliament, and establish absolutist
institutions similar to those being constructed in Spain and France to
further their and the elite’s control of the economy, making
institutions more extractive. The conflict between James I and
Parliament came to a head in the 1620s. Central in this conflict was the
control of trade both overseas and within the British Isles. The Crown’s
ability to grant monopolies was a key source of revenue for the state,
and was used frequently as a way of granting exclusive rights to
supporters of the king. Not surprisingly, this extractive institution
blocking entry and inhibiting the functioning of the market was also
highly damaging to economic activity and to the interests of many
members of Parliament. In 1623 Parliament scored a notable victory by
managing to pass the Statute of Monopolies, which prohibited James I
from creating new domestic monopolies. He would still be able to grant
monopolies on international trade, however, since the authority of
Parliament did not extend to international affairs. Existing monopolies,
international or otherwise, stood untouched. Parliament did not sit
regularly and had to be called into session by the king. The convention
that emerged after the Magna Carta was that the king was required to
convene Parliament to get assent for new taxes. Charles I came to the
throne in 1625, declined to call Parliament after 1629, and intensified
James I’s efforts to build a more solidly absolutist regime. He induced
forced loans, meaning that people had to “lend” him money, and he
unilaterally changed the terms of loans and refused to repay his debts.
He created and sold monopolies in the one dimension that the Statute of
Monopolies had left to him: overseas trading ventures. He also
undermined the independence of the judiciary and attempted to intervene
to influence the outcome of legal cases. He levied many fines and
charges, the most contentious of which was “ship money”—in 1634 taxing
the coastal counties to pay for the support of the Royal Navy and, in
1635, extending the levy to the inland counties. Ship money was levied
each year until 1640. Charles’s increasingly absolutist behavior and
extractive policies created resentment and resistance throughout the
country. In 1640 he faced conflict with Scotland and, without enough
money to put a proper army into the field, was forced to call Parliament
to ask for more taxes. The so-called Short Parliament sat for only three
weeks. The parliamentarians who came to London refused to talk about
taxes, but aired many grievances, until Charles dismissed them. The
Scots realized that Charles did not have the support of the nation and
invaded England, occupying the city of Newcastle. Charles opened
negotiations, and the Scots demanded that Parliament be involved. This
induced Charles to call what then became known as the Long Parliament,
because it continued to sit until 1648, refusing to dissolve even when
Charles demanded it do so. In 1642 the Civil War broke out between
Charles and Parliament, even though there were many in Parliament who
sided with the Crown. The pattern of conflicts reflected the struggle
over economic and political institutions. Parliament wanted an end to
absolutist political institutions; the king wanted them strengthened.
These conflicts were rooted in economics. Many supported the Crown
because they had been granted lucrative monopolies. For example, the
local monopolies controlled by the rich and powerful merchants of
Shrewsbury and Oswestry were protected by the Crown from competition by
London merchants. These merchants sided with Charles I. On the other
side, the metallurgical industry had flourished around Birmingham
because monopolies were weak there and newcomers to the industry did not
have to serve a seven-year apprenticeship, as they did in other parts of
the country. During the Civil War, they made swords and produced
volunteers for the parliamentary side. Similarly, the lack of guild
regulation in the county of Lancashire allowed for the development
before 1640 of the “New Draperies,” a new style of lighter cloth. The
area where the production of these cloths was concentrated was the only
part of Lancashire to support Parliament. Under the leadership of Oliver
Cromwell, the Parliamentarians—known as the Roundheads after the style
in which their hair was cropped—defeated the royalists, known as
Cavaliers. Charles was tried and executed in 1649. His defeat and the
abolition of the monarchy did not, however, result in inclusive
institutions. Instead, monarchy was replaced by the dictatorship of
Oliver Cromwell. Following Cromwell’s death, the monarchy was restored
in 1660 and clawed back many of the privileges that had been stripped
from it in 1649. Charles’s son, Charles II, then set about the same
program of creating absolutism in England. These attempts were only
intensified by his brother James II, who ascended to the throne after
Charles’s death in 1685. In 1688 James’s attempt to reestablish
absolutism created another crisis and another civil war. Parliament this
time was more united and organized. They invited the Dutch Statholder,
William of Orange, and his wife, Mary, James’s Protestant daughter, to
replace James. William would bring an army and claim the throne, to rule
not as an absolutist monarch but under a constitutional monarchy forged
by Parliament. Two months after William’s landing in the British Isles
at Brixham in Devon (see Map 9, this page), James’s army disintegrated
and he fled to France.</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>After victory in the Glorious Revolution, Parliament and William
negotiated a new constitution. The changes were foreshadowed by
William’s “Declaration,” made shortly prior to his invasion. They were
further enshrined in the Declaration of Rights, produced by Parliament
in February 1689. The Declaration was read out to William at the same
session where he was offered the crown. In many ways the Declaration,
which would be called the Bill of Rights after its signing into law, was
vague. Crucially, however, it did establish some central constitutional
principles. It determined the succession to the throne, and did so in a
way that departed significantly from the then-received hereditary
principles. If Parliament could remove a monarch and replace him with
one more to their liking once, then why not again? The Declaration of
Rights also asserted that the monarch could not suspend or dispense with
laws, and it reiterated the illegality of taxation without parliamentary
consent. In addition, it stated that there could be no standing army in
England without parliamentary consent. Vagueness entered into such
clauses as number 8, which stated, “The election of members of
Parliament ought to be free,” but did not specify how “free” was to be
determined. Even vaguer was clause 13, whose main point was that
Parliaments ought to be held frequently. Since when and whether
Parliament would be held had been such a contentious issue for the
entire century, one might have expected much more specificity in this
clause. Nevertheless, the reason for this vague wording is clear.
Clauses have to be enforced. During the reign of Charles II, a Triennial
Act had been in place that asserted that Parliaments had to be called at
least once every three years. But Charles ignored it, and nothing
happened, because there was no method of enforcing it. After 1688,
Parliament could have tried to introduce a method for enforcing this
clause, as the barons had done with their council after King John signed
the Magna Carta. They did not do so because they did not need to. This
was because authority and decision-making power switched to Parliament
after 1688. Even without specific constitutional rules or laws, William
simply gave up on many of the practices of previous kings. He stopped
interfering in legal decisions and gave up previous “rights,” such as
getting the customs revenues for life. Taken together, these changes in
political institutions represented the triumph of Parliament over the
king, and thus the end of absolutism in England and subsequently Great
Britain—as England and Scotland were united by the Act of Union in 1707.
From then on Parliament was firmly in control of state policy. This made
a huge difference, because the interests of Parliament were very
different from those of the Stuart kings. Since many of those in
Parliament had important investments in trade and industry, they had a
strong stake in enforcing property rights. The Stuarts had frequently
infringed on property rights; now they would be upheld. Moreover, when
the Stuarts controlled how the government spent money, Parliament
opposed greater taxes and balked at strengthening the power of the
state. Now that Parliament itself controlled spending, it was happy to
raise taxes and spend the money on activities that it deemed valuable.
Chief among them was the strengthening of the navy, which would protect
the overseas mercantile interests of many of the members of Parliament.
Even more important than the interest of parliamentarians was the
emerging pluralistic nature of political institutions. The English
people now had access to Parliament, and the policy and economic
institutions made in Parliament, in a way they never had when policy was
driven by the king. This was partially, of course, because members of
Parliament were elected. But since England was far from being a
democracy in this period, this access provided only a modest amount of
responsiveness. Among its many inequities was that less than 2 percent
of the population could vote in the eighteenth century, and these had to
be men. The cities where the Industrial Revolution took place,
Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, and Sheffield, had no independent
representation in Parliament. Instead, rural areas were overrepresented.
Just as bad, the right to vote in the rural areas, the “counties,” was
based on ownership of land, and many urban areas, the “boroughs,” were
controlled by a small elite who did not allow the new industrialists to
vote or run for office. In the borough of Buckingham, for instance,
thirteen burgesses had the exclusive right to vote. On top of this there
were the “rotten boroughs,” which had historically had the right to vote
but had “rotted away,” either because their population had moved over
time or, in the case on Dunwich on the east coast of England, had
actually fallen into the ocean as a result of coastal erosion. In each
of these rotten boroughs, a small number of voters elected two members
of Parliament. Old Sarum had seven voters, Dunwich thirty-two, and each
elected two members of Parliament. But there were other ways to
influence Parliament and thus economic institutions. The most important
was via petitioning, and this was much more significant than the limited
extent of democracy for the emergence of pluralism after the Glorious
Revolution. Anybody could petition Parliament, and petition they did.
Significantly, when people petitioned, Parliament listened. It is this
more than anything that reflects the defeat of absolutism, the
empowerment of a fairly broad segment of society, and the rise of
pluralism in England after 1688. The frantic petitioning activity shows
that it was indeed such a broad group in society, far beyond those
sitting or even being represented in Parliament, that had the power to
influence the way the state worked. And they used it. The case of
monopolies best illustrates this. We saw above how monopolies were at
the heart of extractive economic institutions in the seventeenth
century. They came under attack in 1623 with the Statute of Monopolies,
and were a serious bone of contention during the English Civil War. The
Long Parliament abolished all the domestic monopolies that so impinged
on people’s lives. Though Charles II and James II could not bring these
back, they managed to maintain the ability to grant overseas monopolies.
One was the Royal African Company, whose monopoly charter was issued by
Charles II in 1660. This company held a monopoly on the lucrative
African slave trade, and its governor and major shareholder was
Charles’s brother James, soon to become James II. After 1688 the Company
lost not just its governor, but its main supporter. James had
assiduously protected the monopoly of the company against “interlopers,”
the independent traders who tried to buy slaves in West Africa and sell
them in the Americas. This was a very profitable trade, and the Royal
African Company faced a lot of challenges, since all other English trade
in the Atlantic was free. In 1689 the Company seized the cargo of an
interloper, one Nightingale. Nightingale sued the Company for illegal
seizure of goods, and Chief Justice Holt ruled that the Company’s
seizure was unlawful because it was exercising a monopoly right created
by royal prerogative. Holt reasoned that monopoly privileges could be
created only by statute, and this had to be done by Parliament. So Holt
pushed all future monopolies, not just of the Royal Africa Company, into
the hands of Parliament. Before 1688 James II would quickly have removed
any judge who made such a ruling. After 1688 things were different.
Parliament now had to decide what to do with the monopoly, and the
petitions began to fly. One hundred and thirty-five came from
interlopers demanding free access to trade in the Atlantic. Though the
Royal African Company responded in kind, it could not hope to match the
number or scope of the petitions demanding its demise. The interlopers
succeeded in framing their opposition in terms not just of narrow
self-interest, but of national interest, which indeed it was. As a
result, only 5 of the 135 petitions were signed by the interlopers
themselves, and 73 of the interlopers’ petitions came from the provinces
outside London, as against 8 for the Company. From the colonies, where
petitioning was also allowed, the interlopers gathered 27 petitions, the
Company 11. The interlopers also gathered far more signatures for their
petitions, in total 8,000, as opposed to 2,500 for the Company. The
struggle continued until 1698, when the Royal African Company monopoly
was abolished. Along with this new locus for the determination of
economic institutions and the new responsiveness after 1688,
parliamentarians started making a series of key changes in economic
institutions and government policy that would ultimately pave the way
for the Industrial Revolution. Property rights eroded under the Stuarts
were strengthened. Parliament began a process of reform in economic
institutions to promote manufacturing, rather than taxing and impeding
it. The “hearth tax”—an annual tax for each fireplace or stove, which
fell most heavily on manufacturers, who were bitterly opposed to it—was
abolished in 1689, soon after William and Mary ascended the throne.
Instead of taxing hearths, Parliament moved to start taxing land.
Redistributing the tax burden was not the only pro-manufacturing policy
that Parliament supported. A whole series of acts and legislations that
would expand the market and the profitability of woolen textiles was
passed. This all made political sense, since many of the
parliamentarians who opposed James were heavily invested in these
nascent manufacturing enterprises. Parliament also passed legislation
that allowed for a complete reorganization of property rights in land,
permitting the consolidation and elimination of many archaic forms of
property and user rights. Another priority of Parliament was reforming
finance. Though there had been an expansion of banking and finance in
the period leading up to the Glorious Revolution, this process was
further cemented by the creation of the Bank of England in 1694, as a
source of funds for industry. It was another direct consequence of the
Glorious Revolution. The foundation of the Bank of England paved the way
for a much more extensive “financial revolution,” which led to a great
expansion of financial markets and banking. By the early eighteenth
century, loans would be available to everyone who could put up the
necessary collateral. The records of a relatively small bank, C. Hoare’s
Co. in London, which have survived intact from the period 1702–1724,
illustrate this point. Though the bank did lend money to aristocrats and
lords, fully two-thirds of the biggest borrowers from Hoare’s over this
period were not from the privileged social classes. Instead they were
merchants and businessmen, including one John Smith, a man with the name
of the eponymous average Englishman, who was loaned £2,600 by the bank
during the period 1715–1719. So far we have emphasized how the Glorious
Revolution transformed English political institutions, making them more
pluralistic, and also started laying the foundations for inclusive
economic institutions. There is one more significant change in
institutions that emerged from the Glorious Revolution: Parliament
continued the process of political centralization that was initiated by
the Tudors. It was not just that constraints increased, or that the
state regulated the economy in a different way, or that the English
state spent money on different things; but also the capability and
capacity of the state increased in all directions. This again
illustrates the linkages between political centralization and pluralism:
Parliament had opposed making the state more effective and better
resourced prior to 1688 because it could not control it. After 1688 it
was a different story. The state started expanding, with expenditures
soon reaching around 10 percent of national income. This was underpinned
by an expansion of the tax base, particularly with respect to the excise
tax, which was levied on the production of a long list of domestically
produced commodities. This was a very large state budget for the period,
and is in fact larger than what we see today in many parts of the world.
The state budgets in Colombia, for example, reached this relative size
only in the 1980s. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa—for example, in
Sierra Leone—the state budget even today would be far smaller relative
to the size of the economy without the large inflows of foreign aid. But
the expansion of the size of the state is only part of the process of
political centralization. More important than this was the qualitative
way the state functioned and the way those who controlled it and those
who worked in it behaved. The construction of state institutions in
England reached back into the Middle Ages, but as we’ve seen (this
page), steps toward political centralization and the development of
modern administration were decisively taken by Henry VII and Henry VIII.
Yet the state was still far from the modern form that would emerge after
1688. For example, many appointees were made on political grounds, not
because of merit or talent, and the state still had a very limited
capacity to raise taxes. After 1688 Parliament began to improve the
ability to raise revenue through taxation, a development well
illustrated by the excise tax bureaucracy, which expanded rapidly from
1,211 people in 1690 to 4,800 by 1780. Excise tax inspectors were
stationed throughout the country, supervised by collectors who engaged
in tours of inspection to measure and check the amount of bread, beer,
and other goods subject to the excise tax. The extent of this operation
is illustrated by the reconstruction of the excise rounds of Supervisor
George Cowperthwaite by the historian John Brewer. Between June 12 and
July 5, 1710, Supervisor Cowperthwaite traveled 290 miles in the
Richmond district of Yorkshire. During this period he visited 263
victualers, 71 maltsters, 20 chandlers, and one common brewer. In all,
he took 81 different measurements of production and checked the work of
9 different excisemen who worked for him. Eight years later we find him
working just as hard, but now in the Wakefield district, in a different
part of Yorkshire. In Wakefield, he traveled more than nineteen miles a
day on average and worked six days a week, normally inspecting four or
five premises. On his day off, Sunday, he made up his books, so we have
a complete record of his activities. Indeed, the excise tax system had
very elaborate record keeping. Officers kept three different types of
records, all of which were supposed to match one another, and any
tampering with these records was a serious offense. This remarkable
level of state supervision of society exceeds what the governments of
most poor countries can achieve today, and this in 1710. Also
significantly, after 1688 the state began to rely more on talent and
less on political appointees, and developed a powerful infrastructure to
run the country.</p>
<p>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution was manifested in every aspect of the
English economy. There were major improvements in transportation,
metallurgy, and steam power. But the most significant area of innovation
was the mechanization of textile production and the development of
factories to produce these manufactured textiles. This dynamic process
was unleashed by the institutional changes that flowed from the Glorious
Revolution. This was not just about the abolition of domestic
monopolies, which had been achieved by 1640, or about different taxes or
access to finance. It was about a fundamental reorganization of economic
institutions in favor of innovators and entrepreneurs, based on the
emergence of more secure and efficient property rights. Improvements in
the security and efficiency of property rights, for example, played a
central role in the “transportation revolution,” paving the way for the
Industrial Revolution. Investment in canals and roads, the so-called
turnpikes, massively increased after 1688. These investments, by
reducing the costs of transportation, helped to create an important
prerequisite for the Industrial Revolution. Prior to 1688, investment in
such infrastructure had been impeded by arbitrary acts by the Stuart
kings. The change in the situation after 1688 is vividly illustrated by
the case of the river Salwerpe, in Worcestershire, England. In 1662
Parliament passed an act to encourage investment to make the Salwerpe
navigable, and the Baldwyn family invested £6,000 to this end. In return
they got the right to charge people for navigation on the river. In 1693
a bill was introduced to Parliament to transfer the rights to charge for
navigation to the Earl of Shrewsbury and Lord Coventry. This act was
challenged by Sir Timothy Baldwyn, who immediately submitted a petition
to Parliament claiming that the proposed bill was essentially
expropriating his father, who had already heavily invested in the river
in anticipation of the charges he could then levy. Baldwyn argued that
“the new act tends to make void the said act, and to take away all the
works and materials done in pursuance thereof.” Reallocation of rights
such as this was exactly the sort of thing done by Stuart monarchs.
Baldwyn noted, “〔I〕t is of dangerous consequence to take away any
person’s right, purchased under an act of Parliament, without their
consent.” In the event, the new act failed, and Baldwyn’s rights were
upheld. Property rights were much more secure after 1688, partly because
securing them was consistent with the interests of Parliament and partly
because pluralistic institutions could be influenced by petitioning. We
see here that after 1688 the political system became significantly more
pluralistic and created a relatively level playing field within England.
Underlying the transportation revolution and, more generally, the
reorganization of land that took place in the eighteenth century were
parliamentary acts that changed the nature of property ownership. Until
1688 there was even the legal fiction that all the land in England was
ultimately owned by the Crown, a direct legacy from the feudal
organization of society. Many pieces of land were encumbered by numerous
archaic forms of property rights and many cross-cutting claims. Much
land was held in so-called equitable estates, which meant that the
landowner could not mortgage, lease, or sell the land. Common land could
often be used only for traditional uses. There were enormous impediments
to using land in ways that would be economically desirable. Parliament
began to change this, allowing groups of people to petition Parliament
to simplify and reorganize property rights, alterations that were
subsequently embodied into hundreds of acts of Parliament. This
reorganization of economic institutions also manifested itself in the
emergence of an agenda to protect domestic textile production against
foreign imports. Not surprisingly, parliamentarians and their
constituents were not opposed to all entry barriers and monopolies.
Those that would increase their own market and profits would be welcome.
However, crucially, the pluralistic political institutions—the fact that
Parliament represented, empowered, and listened to a broad segment of
society—meant that these entry barriers would not choke other
industrialists or completely shut out newcomers, as the Serrata did in
Venice (this page–this page). The powerful woolen manufacturers soon
made this discovery. In 1688 some of the most significant imports into
England were textiles from India, calicoes and muslins, which comprised
about one-quarter of all textile imports. Also important were silks from
China. Calicoes and silks were imported by the East India Company, which
prior to 1688 enjoyed a government-sanctioned monopoly over the trade
with Asia. But the monopoly and the political power of the East India
Company was sustained through heavy bribes to James II. After 1688 the
company was in a vulnerable position and soon under attack. This took
the form of an intense war of petitions with traders hoping to trade in
the Far East and India demanding that Parliament sanction competition
for the East India Company, while the company responded with
counterpetitions and offers to lend Parliament money. The company lost,
and a new East India Company to compete with it was founded. But textile
producers did not just want more competition in the trade to India. They
wanted imports of cheap Indian textiles (calicoes) taxed or even banned.
These producers faced strong competition from these cheap Indian
imports. At this point the most important domestic manufacturers
produced woolen textiles, but the producers of cotton cloths were
becoming both more important economically and more powerful politically.
The wool industry mounted attempts to protect itself as early as the
1660s. It promoted the “Sumptuary Laws,” which, among other things,
prohibited the wearing of lighter cloth. It also lobbied Parliament to
pass legislation in 1666 and 1678 that would make it illegal for someone
to be buried in anything other than a woolen shroud. Both measures
protected the market for woolen goods and reduced the competition that
English manufacturers faced from Asia. Nevertheless, in this period the
East India Company was too strong to restrict imports of Asian textiles.
The tide changed after 1688. Between 1696 and 1698, woolen manufacturers
from East Anglia and the West Country allied with silk weavers from
London, Canterbury, and the Levant Company to restrict imports. The silk
importers from the Levant, even if they had recently lost their
monopoly, wished to exclude Asian silks to create a niche for silks from
the Ottoman Empire. This coalition started to present bills to
Parliament to place restrictions on the wearing of Asian cottons and
silks, and also restrictions on the dyeing and printing of Asian
textiles in England. In response, in 1701, Parliament finally passed “an
Act for the more effectual imploying the poor, by incouraging the
manufactures of this kingdom.” From September 1701, it decreed: “All
wrought silks, bengals and stuffs, mixed with silk of herba, of the
manufacture of Persia, China, or East-India, all Calicoes painted, dyed,
printed, or stained there, which are or shall be imported into this
kingdom, shall not be worn.”</p>
<p>It was now illegal to wear Asian silks and calicoes in England. But
it was still possible to import them for reexport to Europe or
elsewhere, in particular to the American colonies. Moreover, plain
calicoes could be imported and finished in England, and muslins were
exempt from the ban. After a long struggle, these loopholes, as the
domestic woolen textile manufacturers viewed them, were closed by the
Calicoe Act of 1721: “After December 25, 1722, it shall not be lawful
for any person or persons whatsoever to use or wear in Great Britain, in
any garment or apparel whatsoever, any printed, painted, stained or dyed
Calicoe.” Though this act removed competition from Asia for English
woolens, it still left an active domestic cotton and linen industry
competing against the woolens: cotton and linen were mixed to produce a
popular cloth called fustian. Having excluded Asian competition, the
wool industry now turned to clamp down on linen. Linen was primarily
made in Scotland and Ireland, which gave some scope to an English
coalition to demand those countries’ exclusion from English markets.
However, there were limits to the power of the woolen manufacturers.
Their new attempts encountered strong opposition from fustian producers
in the burgeoning industrial centers of Manchester, Lancaster, and
Liverpool. The pluralistic political institutions implied that all these
different groups now had access to the policy process in Parliament via
voting and, more important, petitioning. Though the petitions flew from
the pens of both sides, amassing signatures for and against, the outcome
of this conflict was a victory for the new interests against those of
the wool industry. The Manchester Act of 1736 agreed that “great
quantities of stuffs made from linen yarn and cotton wool have for
several years past been manufactured, and have been printed and painted
within this kingdom of Great Britain.” It then went on to assert that
“nothing in the said recited Act 〔of 1721〕 shall extend or be
construed to prohibit the wearing or using in apparel, household stuff,
furniture or otherwise, any sort of stuff made out of linen yarn and
cotton wool, manufactured and printed or painted with any colour or
colours within the kingdom of Great Britain.”</p>
<p>The Manchester Act was a significant victory for the nascent cotton
manufacturers. But its historical and economic significance was in fact
much greater. First, it demonstrated the limits of entry barriers that
the pluralistic political institutions of parliamentary England would
permit. Second, over the next half century, technological innovations in
the manufacture of cotton cloth would play a central role in the
Industrial Revolution and fundamentally transform society by introducing
the factory system. After 1688, though domestically a level playing
field emerged, internationally Parliament strove to tilt it. This was
evident not only from the Calicoe Acts but also from the Navigation
Acts, the first of which was passed in 1651, and they remained in force
with alternations for the next two hundred years. The aim of these acts
was to facilitate England’s monopolization of international trade—though
crucially this was monopolization not by the state but by the private
sector. The basic principle was that English trade should be carried in
English ships. The acts made it illegal for foreign ships to transport
goods from outside Europe to England or its colonies, and it was
similarly illegal for third-party countries’ ships to ship goods from a
country elsewhere in Europe to England. This advantage for English
traders and manufacturers naturally increased their profits and may have
further encouraged innovation in these new and highly profitable
activities. By 1760 the combination of all these factors—improved and
new property rights, improved infrastructure, a changed fiscal regime,
greater access to finance, and aggressive protection of traders and
manufacturers—was beginning to have an effect. After this date, there
was a jump in the number of patented inventions, and the great flowering
of technological change that was to be at the heart of the Industrial
Revolution began to be evident. Innovations took place on many fronts,
reflecting the improved institutional environment. One crucial area was
power, most famously the transformations in the use of the steam engine
that were a result of James Watt’s ideas in the 1760s. Watt’s initial
breakthrough was to introduce a separate condensing chamber for the
steam so that the cylinder that housed the piston could be kept
continually hot, instead of having to be warmed up and cooled down. He
subsequently developed many other ideas, including much more efficient
methods of converting the motion of the steam engine into useful power,
notably his “sun and planets” gear system. In all these areas
technological innovations built on earlier work by others. In the
context of the steam engine, this included early work by English
inventor Thomas Newcomen and also by Dionysius Papin, a French physicist
and inventor. The story of Papin’s invention is another example of how,
under extractive institutions, the threat of creative destruction
impeded technological change. Papin developed a design for a “steam
digester” in 1679, and in 1690 he extended this into a piston engine. In
1705 he used this rudimentary engine to build the world’s first
steamboat. Papin was by this time a professor of mathematics at the
University of Marburg, in the German state of Kassel. He decided to
steam the boat down the river Fulda to the river Weser. Any boat making
this trip was forced to stop at the city of Münden. At that time, river
traffic on the Fulda and Weser was the monopoly of a guild of boatmen.
Papin must have sensed that there might be trouble. His friend and
mentor, the famous German physicist Gottfried Leibniz, wrote to the
Elector of Kassel, the head of state, petitioning that Papin should be
allowed to “… pass unmolested …” through Kassel. Yet Leibniz’s petition
was rebuffed and he received the curt answer that “the Electoral
Councillors have found serious obstacles in the way of granting the
above petition, and, without giving their reasons, have directed me to
inform you of their decision, and that in consequence the request is not
granted by his Electoral Highness.” Undeterred, Papin decided to make
the journey anyway. When his steamer arrived at Münden, the boatmen’s
guild first tried to get a local judge to impound the ship, but was
unsuccessful. The boatmen then set upon Papin’s boat and smashed it and
the steam engine to pieces. Papin died a pauper and was buried in an
unmarked grave. In Tudor or Stuart England, Papin might have received
similar hostile treatment, but this all changed after 1688. Indeed,
Papin was intending to sail his boat to London before it was destroyed.
In metallurgy, key contributions were made in the 1780s by Henry Cort,
who introduced new techniques for dealing with impurities in iron,
allowing for a much better quality wrought iron to be produced. This was
critical for the manufacture of machine parts, nails, and tools. The
production of vast quantities of wrought iron using Cort’s techniques
was facilitated by the innovations of Abraham Darby and his sons, who
pioneered the use of coal to smelt iron beginning in 1709. This process
was enhanced in 1762 by the adaptation, by John Smeaton, of water power
to operate blowing cylinders in making coke. After this, charcoal
vanished from the production of iron, to be replaced by coal, which was
much cheaper and more readily available. Even though innovation is
obviously cumulative, there was a distinct acceleration in the middle of
the eighteenth century. In no place was this more visible than in
textile production. The most basic operation in the production of
textiles is spinning, which involves taking plant or animal fibers, such
as cotton or wool, and twisting them together to form yarn. This yarn is
then woven to make up textiles. One of the great technological
innovations of the medieval period was the spinning wheel, which
replaced hand spinning. This invention appeared around 1280 in Europe,
probably disseminating from the Middle East. The methods of spinning did
not change until the eighteenth century. Significant innovations began
in 1738, when Lewis Paul patented a new method of spinning using rollers
to replace human hands to draw out the fibers being spun. The machine
did not work well, however, and it was the innovations of Richard
Arkwright and James Hargreaves that truly revolutionized spinning. In
1769 Arkwright, one of the dominant figures of the Industrial
Revolution, patented his “water frame,” which was a huge improvement
over Lewis’s machine. He formed a partnership with Jedediah Strutt and
Samuel Need, who were hosiery manufacturers. In 1771 they built one of
the world’s first factories, at Cromford. The new machines were powered
by water, but Arkwright later made the crucial transition to steam
power. By 1774 his firm employed six hundred workers, and he expanded
aggressively, eventually setting up factories in Manchester, Matlock,
Bath, and New Lanark in Scotland. Arkwright’s innovations were
complemented by Hargreaves’s invention in 1764 of the spinning jenny,
which was further developed by Samuel Crompton in 1779 into the “mule,”
and later by Richard Roberts into the “self-acting mule.” The effects of
these innovations were truly revolutionary: earlier in the century, it
took 50,000 hours for hand spinners to spin one hundred pounds of
cotton. Arkwright’s water frame could do it in 300 hours, and the
self-acting mule in 135. Along with the mechanization of spinning came
the mechanization of weaving. An important first step was the invention
of the flying shuttle by John Kay in 1733. Though it initially simply
increased the productivity of hand weavers, its most enduring impact
would be in opening the way to mechanized weaving. Building on the
flying shuttle, Edmund Cartwright introduced the power loom in 1785, a
first step in a series of innovations that would lead to machines
replacing manual skills in weaving as they were also doing in spinning.
The English textile industry not only was the driving force behind the
Industrial Revolution but also revolutionized the world economy. English
exports, led by cotton textiles, doubled between 1780 and 1800. It was
the growth in this sector that pulled ahead the whole economy. The
combination of technological and organizational innovation provides the
model for economic progress that transformed the economies of the world
that became rich. New people with new ideas were crucial to this
transformation. Consider innovation in transportation. In England there
were several waves of such innovations: first canals, then roads, and
finally railways. In each of these waves the innovators were new men.
Canals started to develop in England after 1770, and by 1810 they had
linked up many of the most important manufacturing areas. As the
Industrial Revolution unfolded, canals played an important role in
reducing transportation costs for moving around the bulky new finished
industrial goods, such as cotton textiles, and the inputs that went into
them, particularly raw cotton and coal for the steam engines. Early
innovators in building canals were men such as James Brindley, who was
employed by the Duke of Bridgewater to build the Bridgewater Canal,
which ended up linking the key industrial city of Manchester to the port
of Liverpool. Born in rural Derbyshire, Brindley was a millwright by
profession. His reputation for finding creative solutions to engineering
problems came to the attention of the duke. He had no previous
experience with transportation problems, which also was true of other
great canal engineers such as Thomas Telford, who started life as a
stonemason, or John Smeaton, an instrument maker and engineer. Just as
the great canal engineers had no previous connection to transportation,
neither did the great road and railway engineers. John McAdam, who
invented tarmac around 1816, was the second son of a minor aristocrat.
The first steam train was built by Richard Trevithick in 1804.
Trevithick’s father was involved in mining in Cornwall, and Richard
entered the same business at an early age, becoming fascinated by steam
engines used for pumping out the mines. More significant were the
innovations of George Stephenson, the son of illiterate parents and the
inventor of the famous train “The Rocket,” who began work as an
engineman at a coal mine. New men also drove the critical cotton textile
industry. Some of the pioneers of this new industry were people who had
previously been heavily involved in the production and trade of woolen
cloths. John Foster, for example, employed seven hundred handloom
weavers in the woolen industry at the time he switched to cotton and
opened Black Dyke Mills in 1835. But men such as Foster were a minority.
Only about one-fifth of the leading industrialists at this time had
previously been involved in anything like manufacturing activities. This
is not surprising. For one, the cotton industry developed in new towns
in the north of England. Factories were a completely new way of
organizing production. The woolen industry had been organized in a very
different way, by “putting out” materials to individuals in their homes,
who spun and wove on their own. Most of those in the woolen industry
were therefore ill equipped to switch to cotton, as Foster did.
Newcomers were needed to develop and use the new technologies. The rapid
expansion of cotton decimated the wool industry—creative destruction in
action. Creative destruction redistributes not simply income and wealth,
but also political power, as William Lee learned when he found the
authorities so unreceptive to his invention because they feared its
political consequences. As the industrial economy expanded in Manchester
and Birmingham, the new factory owners and middle-class groups that
emerged around them began to protest their disenfranchisement and the
government policies opposed to their interests. Their prime candidate
was the Corn Laws, which banned the import of “corn”—all grains and
cereals, but principally wheat—if the price got too low, thus ensuring
that the profits of large landowners were kept high. This policy was
very good for big landowners who produced wheat, but bad for
manufacturers, because they had to pay higher wages to compensate for
the high price of bread. With workers concentrated into new factories
and industrial centers, it became easier to organize and riot. By the
1820s, the political exclusion of the new manufacturers and
manufacturing centers was becoming untenable. On August 16, 1819, a
meeting to protest the political system and the policies of the
government was planned to be held in St. Peter’s Fields, Manchester. The
organizer was Joseph Johnson, a local brush manufacturer and one of the
founders of the radical newspaper the Manchester Observer. Other
organizers included John Knight, a cotton manufacturer and reformer, and
John Thacker Saxton, editor of the Manchester Observer. Sixty thousand
protestors gathered, many holding banners such as “No Corn Laws,”
“Universal Suffrage,” and “Vote by Ballot” (meaning voting should take
place secretly, not openly, as it did in 1819). The authorities were
very nervous about the meeting, and a force of six hundred cavalry of
the Fifteenth Hussars had been assembled. As the speeches began, a local
magistrate decided to issue a warrant for the arrest of the speakers. As
police tried to enforce the warrant, they met with the opposition of the
crowd, and fighting broke out. At this point the Hussars charged the
crowd. Within a few chaotic minutes, eleven people were dead and
probably six hundred wounded. The Manchester Observer called it the
Peterloo Massacre. But given the changes that had already taken place in
economic and political institutions, long-run repression was not a
solution in England. The Peterloo Massacre would remain an isolated
incident. Following the riot, the political institutions in England gave
way to the pressure, and the destabilizing threat of much wider social
unrest, particularly after the 1830 revolution in France against Charles
X, who had tried to restore the absolutism destroyed by the French
Revolution of 1789. In 1832 the government passed the First Reform Act.
It enfranchised Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, and Sheffield, and
broadened the base of voting so that manufacturers could be represented
in Parliament. The consequent shift in political power moved policy in
the direction favored by these newly represented interests; in 1846 they
managed to get the hated Corn Laws repealed, demonstrating again that
creative destruction meant a redistribution not just of income, but also
of political power. And naturally, changes in the distribution of
political power in time would lead to a further redistribution of
income. It was the inclusive nature of English institutions that allowed
this process to take place. Those who suffered from and feared creative
destruction were no longer able to stop it.</p>
<p>WHY IN ENGLAND?</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution started and made its biggest strides in
England because of her uniquely inclusive economic institutions. These
in turn were built on foundations laid by the inclusive political
institutions brought about by the Glorious Revolution. It was the
Glorious Revolution that strengthened and rationalized property rights,
improved financial markets, undermined state-sanctioned monopolies in
foreign trade, and removed the barriers to the expansion of industry. It
was the Glorious Revolution that made the political system open and
responsive to the economic needs and aspirations of society. These
inclusive economic institutions gave men of talent and vision such as
James Watt the opportunity and incentive to develop their skills and
ideas and influence the system in ways that benefited them and the
nation. Naturally these men, once they had become successful, had the
same urges as any other person. They wanted to block others from
entering their businesses and competing against them and feared the
process of creative destruction that might put them out of business, as
they had previously bankrupted others. But after 1688 this became harder
to accomplish. In 1775 Richard Arkwright took out an encompassing patent
that he hoped would give him a monopoly on the rapidly expanding cotton
spinning industry in the future. He could not get the courts to enforce
it. Why did this unique process start in England and why in the
seventeenth century? Why did England develop pluralistic political
institutions and break away from extractive institutions? As we have
seen, the political developments leading up to the Glorious Revolution
were shaped by several interlinked processes. Central was the political
conflict between absolutism and its opponents. The outcome of this
conflict not only put a stop to the attempts to create a renewed and
stronger absolutism in England, but also empowered those wishing to
fundamentally change the institutions of society. The opponents of
absolutism did not simply attempt to build a different type of
absolutism. This was not simply the House of Lancaster defeating the
House of York in the War of the Roses. Instead, the Glorious Revolution
involved the emergence of a new regime based on constitutional rule and
pluralism. This outcome was a consequence of the drift in English
institutions and the way they interacted with critical junctures. We saw
in the previous chapter how feudal institutions were created in Western
Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Feudalism spread
throughout most of Europe, West and East. But as chapter 4 showed,
Western and Eastern Europe began to diverge radically after the Black
Death. Small differences in political and economic institutions meant
that in the West the balance of power led to institutional improvement;
in the East, to institutional deterioration. But this was not a path
that would necessarily and inexorably lead to inclusive institutions.
Many more crucial turns would have to be taken on the way. Though the
Magna Carta had attempted to establish some basic institutional
foundations for constitutional rule, many other parts of Europe, even
Eastern Europe, saw similar struggles with similar documents. Yet, after
the Black Death, Western Europe significantly drifted away from the
East. Documents such as the Magna Carta started to have more bite in the
West. In the East, they came to mean little. In England, even before the
conflicts of the seventeenth century, the norm was established that the
king could not raise new taxes without the consent of Parliament. No
less important was the slow, incremental drift of power away from elites
to citizens more generally, as exemplified by the political mobilization
of rural communities, seen in England with such moments as the Peasants’
Revolt of 1381. This drift of institutions now interacted with another
critical juncture caused by the massive expansion of trade into the
Atlantic. As we saw in chapter 4, one crucial way in which this
influenced future institutional dynamics depended on whether or not the
Crown was able to monopolize this trade. In England the somewhat greater
power of Parliament meant that the Tudor and Stuart monarchs could not
do so. This created a new class of merchants and businessmen, who
aggressively opposed the plan to create absolutism in England. By 1686
in London, for example, there were 702 merchants exporting to the
Caribbean and 1,283 importing. North America had 691 exporting and 626
importing merchants. They employed warehousemen, sailors, captains,
dockworkers, clerks—all of whom broadly shared their interests. Other
vibrant ports, such as Bristol, Liverpool, and Portsmouth, were
similarly full of such merchants. These new men wanted and demanded
different economic institutions, and as they got wealthier through
trade, they became more powerful. The same forces were at work in
France, Spain, and Portugal. But there the kings were much more able to
control trade and its profits. The type of new group that was to
transform England did emerge in those countries, but was considerably
smaller and weaker. When the Long Parliament sat and the Civil War broke
out in 1642, these merchants primarily sided with the parliamentary
cause. In the 1670s they were heavily involved in the formation of the
Whig Party, to oppose Stuart absolutism, and in 1688 they would be
pivotal in deposing James II. So the expanding trade opportunities
presented by the Americas, the mass entry of English merchants into this
trade and the economic development of the colonies, and the fortunes
they made in the process, tipped the balance of power in the struggle
between the monarchy and those opposed to absolutism. Perhaps most
critically, the emergence and empowerment of diverse interests—ranging
from the gentry, a class of commercial farmers that had emerged in the
Tudor period, to different types of manufacturers to Atlantic
traders—meant that the coalition against Stuart absolutism was not only
strong but also broad. This coalition was strengthened even more by the
formation of the Whig Party in the 1670s, which provided an organization
to further its interests. Its empowerment was what underpinned pluralism
following the Glorious Revolution. If all those fighting against the
Stuarts had the same interests and the same background, the overthrow of
the Stuart monarchy would have been much more likely to be a replay of
the House of Lancaster versus the House of York, pitting one group
against another narrow set of interests, and ultimately replacing and
re-creating the same or a different form of extractive institutions. A
broad coalition meant that there would be greater demands for the
creation of pluralist political institutions. Without some sort of
pluralism, there would be a danger that one of the diverse interests
would usurp power at the expense of the rest. The fact that Parliament
after 1688 represented such a broad coalition was a crucial factor in
making members of Parliament listen to petitions, even when they came
from people outside of Parliament and even from those without a vote.
This was a crucial factor in preventing attempts by one group to create
a monopoly at the expense of the rest, as wool interests tried to do
before the Manchester Act. The Glorious Revolution was a momentous event
precisely because it was led by an emboldened broad coalition and
further empowered this coalition, which managed to forge a
constitutional regime with constraints on the power of both the
executive and, equally crucially, any one of its members. It was, for
example, these constraints that prevented the wool manufacturers from
being able to crush the potential competition from the cotton and
fustian manufacturers. Thus this broad coalition was essential in the
lead-up to a strong Parliament after 1688, but it also meant that there
were checks within Parliament against any single group becoming too
powerful and abusing its power. It was the critical factor in the
emergence of pluralistic political institutions. The empowerment of such
a broad coalition also played an important role in the persistence and
strengthening of these inclusive economic and political institutions, as
we will see in chapter 11. Still none of this made a truly pluralistic
regime inevitable, and its emergence was in part a consequence of the
contingent path of history. A coalition that was not too different was
able to emerge victorious from the English Civil War against the
Stuarts, but this only led to Oliver Cromwell’s dictatorship. The
strength of this coalition was also no guarantee that absolutism would
be defeated. James II could have defeated William of Orange. The path of
major institutional change was, as usual, no less contingent than the
outcome of other political conflicts. This was so even if the specific
path of institutional drift that created the broad coalition opposed to
absolutism and the critical juncture of Atlantic trading opportunities
stacked the cards against the Stuarts. In this instance, therefore,
contingency and a broad coalition were deciding factors underpinning the
emergence of pluralism and inclusive institutions.</p>
