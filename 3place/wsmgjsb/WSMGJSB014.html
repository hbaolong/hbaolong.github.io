<h4 id="why-nations-fail-today">13. WHY NATIONS FAIL TODAY</h4>
<p>HOW TO WIN THE LOTTERY IN ZIMBABWE</p>
<p>IT WAS JANUARY 2000 in Harare, Zimbabwe. Master of Ceremonies Fallot
Chawawa was in charge of drawing the winning ticket for the national
lottery organized by a partly state-owned bank, the Zimbabwe Banking
Corporation (Zimbank). The lottery was open to all clients who had kept
five thousand or more Zimbabwe dollars in their accounts during December
1999. When Chawawa drew the ticket, he was dumfounded. As the public
statement of Zimbank put it, “Master of Ceremonies Fallot Chawawa could
hardly believe his eyes when the ticket drawn for the Z00,000 prize was
handed to him and he saw His Excellency RG Mugabe written on it.”</p>
<p>President Robert Mugabe, who had ruled Zimbabwe by hook or by crook,
and usually with an iron fist, since 1980, had won the lottery, which
was worth a hundred thousand Zimbabwe dollars, about five times the
annual per capita income of the country. Zimbank claimed that
Mr. Mugabe’s name had been drawn from among thousands of eligible
customers. What a lucky man! Needless to say he didn’t really need the
money. Mugabe had in fact only recently awarded himself and his cabinet
salary hikes of up to 200 percent. The lottery ticket was just one more
indication of Zimbabwe’s extractive institutions. One could call this
corruption, but it is just a symptom of the institutional malaise in
Zimbabwe. The fact that Mugabe could even win the lottery if he wanted
showed how much control he had over matters in Zimbabwe, and gave the
world a glimpse of the extent of the country’s extractive institutions.
The most common reason why nations fail today is because they have
extractive institutions. Zimbabwe under Mugabe’s regime vividly
illustrates the economic and social consequences. Though the national
statistics in Zimbabwe are very unreliable, the best estimate is that by
2008, Zimbabwe’s per capita income was about half of what it was when
the country gained its independence in 1980. Dramatic as this sounds, it
does not in fact begin to capture the deterioration in living standards
in Zimbabwe. The state has collapsed and more or less stopped providing
any basic public services. In 2008–2009 the deterioration in the health
systems led to an outbreak of cholera across the country. As of January
10, 2010, there have been 98,741 reported cases and 4,293 deaths, making
it the deadliest cholera outbreak in Africa over the previous fifteen
years. In the meantime, mass unemployment has also reached unprecedented
levels. In early 2009, the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs claimed that the unemployment rate had hit an
incredible 94 percent. The roots of many economic and political
institutions in Zimbabwe, as is the case for much of sub-Saharan Africa,
can be traced back to the colonial period. In 1890 Cecil Rhodes’s
British South Africa Company sent a military expedition into the
then-kingdom of the Ndebele, based in Matabeleland, and also into the
neighboring Mashonaland. Their superior weaponry quickly suppressed
African resistance, and by 1901 the colony of Southern Rhodesia, named
after Rhodes, had been formed in the area that is currently Zimbabwe.
Now that the area was a privately owned concession of the British South
Africa Company, Rhodes anticipated making money there through
prospecting and mining for precious minerals. The ventures never got off
the ground, but the very rich farmlands began attracting white
migration. These settlers soon annexed much of the land. By 1923 they
had freed themselves from the rule of the British South Africa Company
and persuaded the British government to grant them self-government. What
then occurred is very similar to what had happened in South Africa a
decade or so previously. The 1913 Natives Land Act (this page–this page)
created a dual economy in South Africa. Rhodesia passed very similar
laws, and inspired by the South African model, a white-only apartheid
state was constructed soon after 1923. As the European colonial empires
collapsed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the white elite in
Rhodesia, led by Ian Smith, comprising possibly 5 percent of the
population, declared independence from Britain in 1965. Few
international governments recognized Rhodesia’s independence, and the
United Nations levied economic and political sanctions against it. The
black citizens organized a guerrilla war from bases in the neighboring
countries of Mozambique and Zambia. International pressure and the
rebellion waged by the two main groups, Mugabe’s ZANU (the Zimbabwe
African National Union) and ZAPU (the Zimbabwe African People’s Union),
led by Joshua Nkomo, resulted in a negotiated end to white rule. The
state of Zimbabwe was created in 1980. After independence, Mugabe
quickly established his personal control. He either violently eliminated
his opponents or co-opted them. The most egregious acts of violence
happened in Matabeleland, the heartland of support for ZAPU, where as
many as twenty thousand people were killed in the early 1980s. By 1987
ZAPU had merged with ZANU to create ZANU-PF, and Joshua Nkomo was
sidelined politically. Mugabe was able to rewrite the constitution he
had inherited as a part of the independence negotiation, making himself
president (he had started as prime minister), abolishing white voter
rolls that were part of the independence agreement, and eventually, in
1990, getting rid of the Senate altogether and introducing positions in
the legislature that he could nominate. A de facto one-party state
headed by Mugabe was the result. Upon independence, Mugabe took over a
set of extractive economic institutions created by the white regime.
These included a host of regulations on prices and international trade,
state-run industries, and the obligatory agricultural marketing boards.
State employment expanded rapidly, with jobs given to supporters of
ZANU-PF. The tight government regulation of the economy suited the
ZANU-PF elites because it made it difficult for an independent class of
African businessmen, who might then have challenged the former’s
political monopoly, to emerge. This was very similar to the situation we
saw in Ghana in the 1960s in chapter 2 (this page–this page).
Ironically, of course, this left whites as the main business class.
During this period the main strengths of the white economy, particularly
the highly productive agricultural export sector, was left untouched.
But this would last only until Mugabe became unpopular. The model of
regulation and market intervention gradually became unsustainable, and a
process of institutional change, with the support of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, began in 1991 after a severe fiscal
crisis. The deteriorating economic performance finally led to the
emergence of a serious political opposition to ZANU-PF’s one-party rule:
the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The 1995 parliamentary
elections were far from competitive. ZANU-PF won 81 percent of the vote
and 118 out of the 120 seats. Fifty-five of these members of Parliament
were elected unopposed. The presidential election the following year
showed even more signs of irregularities and fraud. Mugabe won 93
percent of the vote, but his two opponents, Abel Muzorewa and Ndabaningi
Sithole, had already withdrawn their candidacy prior to the election,
accusing the government of coercion and fraud. After 2000, despite all
the corruption, ZANU-PF’s grip was weakening. It took only 49 percent of
the popular vote, and only 63 seats. All were contested by the MDC, who
took every seat in the capital, Harare. In the presidential election of
2002, Mugabe scraped home with only 56 percent of the vote. Both sets of
elections went ZANU-PF’s way only because of violence and intimidation,
coupled with electoral fraud. The response of Mugabe to the breakdown of
his political control was to intensify both the repression and the use
of government policies to buy support. He unleashed a full-scale assault
on white landowners. Starting in 2000, he encouraged and supported an
extensive series of land occupations and expropriations. They were often
led by war veterans’ associations, groups supposedly comprised of former
combatants in the war of independence. Some of the expropriated land was
given to these groups, but much of it also went to the ZANU-PF elites.
The insecurity of property rights wrought by Mugabe and ZANU-PF led to a
collapse of agricultural output and productivity. As the economy
crumbled, the only thing left was to print money to buy support, which
led to enormous hyperinflation. In January 2009, it became legal to use
other currencies, such as the South African rand, and the Zimbabwean
dollar vanished from circulation, a worthless piece of paper. What
happened in Zimbabwe after 1980 was commonplace in sub-Saharan Africa
since independence. Zimbabwe inherited a set of highly extractive
political and economic institutions in 1980. For the first decade and a
half, these were maintained relatively untouched. While elections took
place, political institutions were anything but inclusive. Economic
institutions changed somewhat; for example, there was no longer explicit
discrimination against blacks. But on the whole the institutions
remained extractive, with the only difference being that instead of Ian
Smith and the whites doing the extracting, it was Robert Mugabe and the
ZANU-PF elites filling their pockets. Over time the institutions became
even more extractive, and incomes in Zimbabwe collapsed. The economic
and political failure in Zimbabwe is yet another manifestation of the
iron law of oligarchy—in this instance, with the extractive and
repressive regime of Ian Smith being replaced by the extractive,
corrupt, and repressive regime of Robert Mugabe. Mugabe’s fake lottery
win in 2000 was then simply the tip of a very corrupt and historically
shaped iceberg.</p>
<p>NATIONS FAIL TODAY because their extractive economic institutions do
not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and
innovate. Extractive political institutions support these economic
institutions by cementing the power of those who benefit from the
extraction. Extractive economic and political institutions, though their
details vary under different circumstances, are always at the root of
this failure. In many cases, for example, as we will see in Argentina,
Colombia, and Egypt, this failure takes the form of lack of sufficient
economic activity, because the politicians are just too happy to extract
resources or quash any type of independent economic activity that
threatens themselves and the economic elites. In some extreme cases, as
in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone, which we discuss next, extractive
institutions pave the way for complete state failure, destroying not
only law and order but also even the most basic economic incentives. The
result is economic stagnation and—as the recent history of Angola,
Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal,
Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Zimbabwe illustrates—civil wars, mass
displacements, famines, and epidemics, making many of these countries
poorer today than they were in the 1960s.</p>
<p>A CHILDREN’S CRUSADE?</p>
<p>On March 23, 1991, a group of armed men under the leadership of Foday
Sankoh crossed the border from Liberia into Sierra Leone and attacked
the southern frontier town of Kailahun. Sankoh, formerly a corporal in
the Sierra Leonean army, had been imprisoned after taking part in an
abortive coup against Siaka Stevens’s government in 1971. After being
released, he eventually ended up in Libya, where he entered a training
camp that the Libyan dictator Colonel Qaddafi ran for African
revolutionaries. There he met Charles Taylor, who was plotting to
overthrow the government in Liberia. When Taylor invaded Liberia on
Christmas Eve 1989, Sankoh was with him, and it was with a group of
Taylor’s men, mostly Liberians and Burkinabes (citizens of Burkina
Faso), that Sankoh invaded Sierra Leone. They called themselves the RUF,
the Revolutionary United Front, and they announced that they were there
to overthrow the corrupt and tyrannical government of the APC. As we saw
in the previous chapter, Siaka Stevens and his All People’s Congress,
the APC, took over and intensified the extractive institutions of
colonial rule in Sierra Leone, just as Mugabe and ZANU-PF did in
Zimbabwe. By 1985, when Stevens, ill with cancer, brought in Joseph
Momoh to replace him, the economy was collapsing. Stevens, apparently
without irony, used to enjoy quoting the aphorism “The cow eats where it
is tethered.” And where Stevens had once eaten, Momoh now gorged. The
roads fell to pieces, and schools disintegrated. National television
broadcasts stopped in 1987, when the transmitter was sold by the
minister of information, and in 1989 a radio tower that relayed radio
signals outside Freetown fell down, ending transmissions outside the
capital. An analysis published in a newspaper in the capital city of
Freetown in 1995 rings very true:</p>
<p>by the end of Momoh’s rule he had stopped paying civil servants,
teachers and even Paramount Chiefs. Central government had collapsed,
and then of course we had border incursions, “rebels” and all the
automatic weapons pouring over the border from Liberia. The NPRC, the
“rebels” and the “sobels” 〔soldiers turned rebels〕 all amount to the
chaos one expects when government disappears. None of them are the
causes of our problems, but they are symptoms.</p>
<p>The collapse of the state under Momoh, once again a consequence of
the vicious circle unleashed by the extreme extractive institutions
under Stevens, meant that there was nothing to stop the RUF from coming
across the border in 1991. The state had no capacity to oppose it.
Stevens had already emasculated the military, because he worried they
might overthrow him. It was then easy for a relatively small number of
armed men to create chaos in most of the country. They even had a
manifesto called “Footpaths to Democracy,” which started with a quote
from the black intellectual Frantz Fanon: “Each generation must, out of
relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it.” The
section “What Are We Fighting For?” begins:</p>
<p>We continue to fight because we are tired of being perpetual victims
of state sponsored poverty and human degradation visited on us by years
of autocratic rule and militarism. But, we shall exercise restraint and
continue to wait patiently at the rendezvous of peace—where we shall all
be winners. We are committed to peace, by any means necessary, but what
we are not committed to is becoming victims of peace. We know our cause
to be just and God/Allah will never abandon us in our struggle to
reconstruct a new Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Though Sankoh and other RUF leaders may have started with political
grievances, and the grievances of the people suffering under the APC’s
extractive institutions may have encouraged them to join the movement
early on, the situation quickly changed and spun out of control. The
“mission” of the RUF plunged the country into agony, as in the testimony
of a teenager from Geoma, in the south of Sierra Leone:</p>
<p>They gathered some of us … They chose some of our friends and killed
them, two of them. These were people whose fathers were the chiefs, and
they had soldiers’ boots and property in their houses. They were shot,
for no other reason than that they were accused of harbouring soldiers.
The chiefs were also killed—as part of the government. They chose
someone to be the new chief. They were still saying they had come to
free us from the APC. After a point, they were not choosing people to
kill, just shooting people.</p>
<p>In the first year of the invasion, any intellectual roots that the
RUF may have had were completely extinguished. Sankoh executed those who
criticized the mounting stream of atrocities. Soon, few voluntarily
joined the RUF. Instead they turned to forcible recruitment,
particularly of children. Indeed, all sides did this, including the
army. If the Sierra Leonean civil war was a crusade to build a better
society, in the end it was a children’s crusade. The conflict
intensified with massacres and massive human rights abuses, including
mass rapes and the amputation of hands and ears. When the RUF took over
areas, they also engaged in economic exploitation. It was most obvious
in the diamond mining areas, where they press-ganged people into diamond
mining, but was widespread elsewhere as well. The RUF wasn’t alone in
committing atrocities, massacres, and organized forced labor. The
government did so as well. Such was the collapse of law and order that
it became difficult for people to tell who was a soldier and who was a
rebel. Military discipline completely vanished. By the time the war
ended in 2001, probably eighty thousand people had died and the whole
country had been devastated. Roads, houses, and buildings were entirely
destroyed. Today, if you go to Koidu, a major diamond-producing area in
the east, you’ll still see rows of burned-out houses scarred with bullet
holes. By 1991 the state in Sierra Leone had totally failed. Think of
what King Shyaam started with the Bushong (this page–this page): he set
up extractive institutions to cement his power and extract the output
the rest of society would produce. But even extractive institutions with
central authority concentrated in his hands were an improvement over the
situation without any law and order, central authority, or property
rights that characterized the Lele society on the other side of the
river Kasai. Such lack of order and central authority has been the fate
of many African nations in recent decades, partly because the process of
political centralization was historically delayed in much of sub-Saharan
Africa, but also because the vicious circle of extractive institutions
reversed any state centralization that existed, paving the way for state
failure. Sierra Leone during her bloody civil war of ten years, from
1991 to 2001, was a typical case of a failed state. It started out as
just another country marred by extractive institutions, albeit of a
particularly vicious and inefficient type. Countries become failed
states not because of their geography or their culture, but because of
the legacy of extractive institutions, which concentrate power and
wealth in the hands of those controlling the state, opening the way for
unrest, strife, and civil war. Extractive institutions also directly
contribute to the gradual failing of the state by neglecting investment
in the most basic public services, exactly what happened in Sierra
Leone. Extractive institutions that expropriate and impoverish the
people and block economic development are quite common in Africa, Asia,
and South America. Charles Taylor helped to start the civil war in
Sierra Leone while at the same time initiating a savage conflict in
Liberia, which led to state failure there, too. The pattern of
extractive institutions collapsing into civil war and state failure has
happened elsewhere in Africa; for example, in Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Republic of Congo, Somalia,
Sudan, and Uganda. Extraction paves the way for conflict, not unlike the
conflict that the highly extractive institutions of the Maya city-states
generated almost a thousand years ago. Conflict precipitates state
failure. So another reason why nations fail today is that their states
fail. This, in turn, is a consequence of decades of rule under
extractive economic and political institutions.</p>
<p>WHO IS THE STATE?</p>
<p>The cases of Zimbabwe, Somalia, and Sierra Leone, even if typical of
poor countries in Africa, and perhaps even some in Asia, seem rather
extreme. Surely Latin American countries do not have failed states?
Surely their presidents are not brazen enough to win the lottery?</p>
<p>In Colombia, the Andean Mountains gradually merge to the north with a
large coastal plain that borders the Caribbean Ocean. Colombians call
this the tierra caliente, the “hot country,” as distinct from the Andean
world of the tierra fria, the “cold country.” For the last fifty years,
Colombia has been regarded by most political scientists and governments
as a democracy. The United States feels happy to negotiate a potential
free trade agreement with the country and pours all kinds of aid into
it, particularly military aid. After a short-lived military government,
which ended in 1958, elections have been regularly held, even though
until 1974 a pact rotated political power and the presidency between the
two traditional political parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals.
Still, this pact, the National Front, was itself ratified by the
Colombian people via a plebiscite, and this all seems democratic enough.
Yet while Colombia has a long history of democratic elections, it does
not have inclusive institutions. Instead, its history has been marred by
violations of civil liberties, extrajudicial executions, violence
against civilians, and civil war. Not the sort of outcomes we expect
from a democracy. The civil war in Colombia is different from that in
Sierra Leone, where the state and society collapsed and chaos reigned.
But it is a civil war nonetheless and one that has caused far more
casualties. The military rule of the 1950s was itself partially in
response to a civil war known in Spanish simply as La Violencia, or “The
Violence.” Since that time quite a range of insurgent groups, mostly
communist revolutionaries, have plagued the countryside, kidnapping and
murdering. To avoid either of these unpleasant options in rural
Colombia, you have to pay the vacuna, literally “the vaccination,”
meaning that you have to vaccinate yourself against being murdered or
kidnapped by paying off some group of armed thugs each month. Not all
armed groups in Colombia are communists. In 1981 members of the main
communist guerrilla group in Colombia, the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia (the FARC—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia) kidnapped a dairy farmer, Jesus Castaño, who lived in a small
town called Amalfi in the hot country in the northeastern part of the
department of Antioquia. The FARC demanded a ransom amounting to ,500, a
small fortune in rural Colombia. The family raised it by mortgaging the
farm, but their father’s corpse was found anyway, chained to a tree.
Enough was enough for three of Castaño’s sons, Carlos, Fidel, and
Vicente. They founded a paramilitary group, Los Tangueros, to hunt down
members of the FARC and avenge this act. The brothers were good at
organizing, and soon their group grew and began to find a common
interest with other similar paramilitary groups that had developed from
similar causes. Colombians in many areas were suffering at the hands of
left-wing guerrillas, and right-wing paramilitaries formed in
opposition. Paramilitaries were being used by landowners to defend
themselves against the guerrillas, but they were also involved in drug
trafficking, extortion, and the kidnapping and murder of citizens. By
1997 the paramilitaries, under the leadership of the Castaño brothers,
had managed to form a national organization for paramilitaries called
the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (the AUC—United Self-Defense Forces
of Colombia). The AUC expanded into large parts of the country,
particularly into the hot country, in the departments of Córdoba, Sucre,
Magdalena, and César. By 2001 the AUC may have had as many as thirty
thousand armed men at its disposal and was organized into different
blocks. In Córdoba, the paramilitary Bloque Catatumbo was led by
Salvatore Mancuso. As its power continued to grow, the AUC made a
strategic decision to get involved in politics. Paramilitaries and
politicians courted each other. Several of the leaders of the AUC
organized a meeting with prominent politicians in the town of Santa Fé
de Ralito in Córdoba. A joint document, a pact, calling for the
“refounding of the country” was issued and signed by leading members of
the AUC, such as “Jorge 40” (the nickname for Rodrigo Tovar Pupo),
Adolfo Paz (a nom de guerre for Diego Fernando “Don Berna” Murillo), and
Diego Vecino (real name: Edwar Cobo Téllez), along with politicians,
including national senators William Montes and Miguel de la Espriella.
By this point the AUC was running large tracts of Colombia, and it was
easy for them to fix who got elected in the 2002 elections for the
Congress and Senate. For example, in the municipality of San Onofre, in
Sucre, the election was arranged by the paramilitary leader Cadena
(“chain”). One eyewitness described what happened as follows:</p>
<p>The trucks sent by Cadena went around the neighborhoods,
corregimientos and rural areas of San Onofre picking people up.
According to some inhabitants … for the 2002 elections hundreds of
peasants were taken to the corregimiento Plan Parejo so they could see
the faces of the candidates they had to vote for in the parliamentarian
elections: Jairo Merlano for Senate and Muriel Benito Rebollo for
Congress.</p>
<p>Cadena put in a bag the names of the members of the municipal
council, took out two and said that he would kill them and other people
chosen randomly if Muriel did not win.</p>
<p>The threat seems to have worked: each candidate obtained forty
thousand votes in the whole of Sucre. It is no surprise that the mayor
of San Onofre signed the pact of Santa Fé de Ralito. Probably one-third
of the congressmen and senators owed their election in 2002 to
paramilitary support, and Map 20, which depicts the areas of Colombia
under paramilitary control, shows how widespread their hold was.
Salvatore Mancuso himself put it in an interview in the following
way:</p>
<p>35 percent of the Congress was elected in areas where there were
states of the Self-Defense groups, in those states we were the ones
collecting taxes, we delivered justice, and we had the military and
territorial control of the region and all the people who wanted to go
into politics had to come and deal with the political representatives we
had there.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine the effect of this extent of
paramilitary control of politics and society on economic institutions
and public policy. The expansion of the AUC was not a peaceful affair.
The group not only fought against the FARC, but also murdered innocent
civilians and terrorized and displaced hundreds of thousands of people
from their homes. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring
Centre (IDMC) of the Norwegian Refugee Council, in early 2010 around 10
percent of Colombia’s population, nearly 4.5 million people, was
internally displaced. The paramilitaries also, as Mancuso suggested,
took over the government and all its functions, except that the taxes
they collected were just expropriation for their own pockets. An
extraordinary pact between the paramilitary leader Martín Llanos (real
name: Héctor Germán Buitrago) and the mayors of the municipalities of
Tauramena, Aguazul, Maní, Villanueva, Monterrey, and Sabanalarga, in the
department of Casanare in eastern Colombia, lists the following rules to
which the mayors had to adhere by order of the “Paramilitary Peasants of
Casanare”:</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Give 50 percent of the municipality budget to be managed by the
Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare. 10) 10 percent of each and every
contract of the municipality 〔to be given to the Paramilitary Peasants
of Casanare〕. 11) Mandatory assistance to all the meetings called by
the Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare. 12) Inclusion of the Paramilitary
Peasants of Casanare in every infrastructure project. 13) Affiliation to
the new political party formed by the Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare.
14) Accomplishment of his/hers governance program. Casanare is not a
poor department. On the contrary, it has the highest level of per capita
income of any Colombian department, because it has significant oil
deposits, just the kind of resources that attract paramilitaries. In
fact, once they gained power, the paramilitaries intensified their
systematic expropriation of property. Mancuso himself reputedly
accumulated 5 million worth of urban and rural property. Estimates of
land expropriated in Colombia by paramilitaries are as high as 10
percent of all rural land. Colombia is not a case of a failed state
about to collapse. But it is a state without sufficient centralization
and with far-from-complete authority over all its territory. Though the
state is able to provide security and public services in large urban
areas such as Bogotá and Barranquilla, there are significant parts of
the country where it provides few public services and almost no law and
order. Instead, alternative groups and people, such as Mancuso, control
politics and resources. In parts of the country, economic institutions
function quite well, and there are high levels of human capital and
entrepreneurial skill; in other parts the institutions are highly
extractive, even failing to provide a minimal degree of state authority.
It might be hard to understand how a situation like this can sustain
itself for decades, even centuries. But in fact, the situation has a
logic of its own, as a type of vicious circle. Violence and the absence
of centralized state institutions of this type enter into a symbiotic
relationship with politicians running the functional parts of the
society. The symbiotic relationship arises because national politicians
exploit the lawlessness in peripheral parts of the country, while
paramilitary groups are left to their own devices by the national
government. This pattern became particularly apparent in the 2000s. In
2002 the presidential election was won by Álvaro Uribe. Uribe had
something in common with the Castaño brothers: his father had been
killed by the FARC. Uribe ran a campaign repudiating the attempts of the
previous administration to try to make peace with the FARC. In 2002 his
vote share was 3 percentage points higher in areas with paramilitaries
than without them. In 2006, when he was reelected, his vote share was 11
percentage points higher in such areas. If Mancuso and his partners
could deliver the vote for Congress and the Senate, they could do so in
presidential elections as well, particularly for a president strongly
aligned with their worldview and likely to be lenient on them. As Jairo
Angarita, Salvatore Mancuso’s deputy and the former leader of the AUC’s
Sinú and San Jorge blocs, declared in September 2005, he was proud to
work for the “reelection of the best president we have ever had.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once elected, the paramilitary senators and congressmen voted for
what Uribe wanted, in particular changing the constitution so that he
could be reelected in 2006, which had not been allowed at the time of
his first election, in 2002. In exchange, President Uribe delivered a
highly lenient law that allowed the paramilitaries to demobilize.
Demobilization did not mean the end of paramilitarism, simply its
institutionalization in large parts of Colombia and the Colombian state,
which the paramilitaries had taken over and were allowed to keep. In
Colombia many aspects of economic and political institutions have become
more inclusive over time. But certain major extractive elements remain.
Lawlessness and insecure property rights are endemic in large swaths of
the country, and this is a consequence of the lack of control by the
national state in many parts of the country, and the particular form of
lack of state centralization in Colombia. But this state of affairs is
not an inevitable outcome. It is itself a consequence of dynamics
mirroring the vicious circle: political institutions in Colombia do not
generate incentives for politicians to provide public services and law
and order in much of the country and do not put enough constraints on
them to prevent them from entering into implicit or explicit deals with
paramilitaries and thugs.</p>
<p>EL CORRALITO</p>
<p>Argentina was in the grip of an economic crisis in late 2001. For
three years, income had been falling, unemployment had been rising, and
the country had accumulated a massive international debt. The policies
leading to this situation were adopted after 1989 by the government of
Carlos Menem, to stop hyperinflation and stabilize the economy. For a
time they were successful. In 1991 Menem tied the Argentine peso to the
U.S. dollar. One peso was equal to one dollar by law. There was to be no
change in the exchange rate. End of story. Well, almost. To convince
people that the government really meant to stick to the law, it
persuaded people to open bank accounts in U.S. dollars. Dollars could be
used in the shops of the capital city of Buenos Aires and withdrawn from
cash machines all over the city. This policy may have helped stabilize
the economy, but it had one big drawback. It made Argentine exports very
expensive and foreign imports very cheap. Exports dribbled to a halt;
imports gushed in. The only way to pay for them was to borrow. It was an
unsustainable situation. As more people began worrying about the
sustainability of the peso, they put more of their wealth into dollar
accounts at banks. After all, if the government ripped up the law and
devalued the peso, they would be safe with dollar accounts, right? They
were right to be worried about the peso. But they were too optimistic
about their dollars. On December 1, 2001, the government froze all bank
accounts, initially for ninety days. Only a small amount of cash was
allowed for withdrawal on a weekly basis. First it was 250 pesos, still
worth 50; then 300 pesos. But this was allowed to be withdrawn only from
peso accounts. Nobody was allowed to withdraw money from their dollar
accounts, unless they agreed to convert the dollars into pesos. Nobody
wanted to do so. Argentines dubbed this situation El Corralito, “the
Little Corral”: depositors were hemmed into a corral like cows, with
nowhere to go. In January the devaluation was finally enacted, and
instead of there being one peso for one dollar, there were soon four
pesos for one dollar. This should have been a vindication of those who
thought that they should put their savings in dollars. But it wasn’t,
because the government then forcibly converted all the dollar bank
accounts into pesos, but at the old one-for-one exchange rate. Someone
who had had ,000 saved suddenly found himself with only 50. The
government had expropriated three-quarters of people’s savings. For
economists, Argentina is a perplexing country. To illustrate how
difficult it was to understand Argentina, the Nobel Prize–winning
economist Simon Kuznets once famously remarked that there were four
sorts of countries: developed, underdeveloped, Japan, and Argentina.
Kuznets thought so because, around the time of the First World War,
Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world. It then began a
steady decline relative to the other rich countries in Western Europe
and North America, which turned, in the 1970s and ’80s, into an absolute
decline. On the surface of it, Argentina’s economic performance is
puzzling, but the reasons for its decline become clearer when looked at
through the lens of inclusive and extractive institutions. It is true
that before 1914, Argentina experienced around fifty years of economic
growth, but this was a classic case of growth under extractive
institutions. Argentina was then ruled by a narrow elite heavily
invested in the agricultural export economy. The economy grew by
exporting beef, hides, and grain in the middle of a boom in the world
prices of these commodities. Like all such experiences of growth under
extractive institutions, it involved no creative destruction and no
innovation. And it was not sustainable. Around the time of the First
World War, mounting political instability and armed revolts induced the
Argentine elites to try to broaden the political system, but this led to
the mobilization of forces they could not control, and in 1930 came the
first military coup. Between then and 1983, Argentina oscillated
backward and forward between dictatorship and democracy and between
various extractive institutions. There was mass repression under
military rule, which peaked in the 1970s with at least nine thousand
people and probably far more being illegally executed. Hundreds of
thousands were imprisoned and tortured. During the periods of civilian
rule there were elections—a democracy of sorts. But the political system
was far from inclusive. Since the rise of Perón in the 1940s, democratic
Argentina has been dominated by the political party he created, the
Partido Justicialista, usually just called the Perónist Party. The
Perónists won elections thanks to a huge political machine, which
succeeded by buying votes, dispensing patronage, and engaging in
corruption, including government contracts and jobs in exchange for
political support. In a sense this was a democracy, but it was not
pluralistic. Power was highly concentrated in the Perónist Party, which
faced few constraints on what it could do, at least in the period when
the military restrained from throwing it from power. As we saw earlier
(this page–this page), if the Supreme Court challenged a policy, so much
the worse for the Supreme Court. In the 1940s, Perón had cultivated the
labor movement as a political base. When it was weakened by military
repression in the 1970s and ’80s, his party simply switched to buying
votes from others instead. Economic policies and institutions were
designed to deliver income to their supporters, not to create a level
playing field. When President Menem faced a term limit that kept him
from being reelected in the 1990s, it was just more of the same; he
could simply rewrite the constitution and get rid of the term limit. As
El Corralito shows, even if Argentina has elections and popularly
elected governments, the government is quite able to override property
rights and expropriate its own citizens with impunity. There is little
check on Argentine presidents and political elites, and certainly no
pluralism. What puzzled Kuznets, and no doubt many others who visit
Buenos Aires, is that the city seems so different from Lima, Guatemala
City, or even Mexico City. You do not see indigenous people, and you do
not see the descendants of former slaves. Mostly you see the glorious
architecture and buildings put up during the Belle Epoch, the years of
growth under extractive institutions. But in Buenos Aires you see only
part of Argentina. Menem, for example, was not from Buenos Aires. He was
born in Anillaco, in the province of La Rioja, in the mountains far to
the northwest of Buenos Aires, and he served three terms as governor of
the province. At the time of the conquest of the Americas by the
Spanish, this area of Argentina was an outlying part of the Inca Empire
and had a dense population of indigenous people (see Map 1 on this
page). The Spanish created encomiendas here, and a highly extractive
economy developed growing food and breeding mules for the miners in
Potosí to the north. In fact, La Rioja was much more like the area of
Potosí in Peru and Bolivia than it was like Buenos Aires. In the
nineteenth century, La Rioja produced the famous warlord Facundo
Quiroga, who ruled the area lawlessly and marched his army on Buenos
Aires. The story about the development of Argentine political
institutions is a story about how the interior provinces, such as La
Rioja, reached agreements with Buenos Aires. These agreements were a
truce: the warlords of La Rioja agreed to leave Buenos Aires alone so
that it could make money. In return, the Buenos Aires elites gave up on
reforming the institutions of “the interior.” So Argentina at first
appears a world apart from Peru or Bolivia, but it is really not so
different once you leave the elegant boulevards of Buenos Aires. That
the preferences and the politics of the interior got embedded into
Argentine institutions is the reason why the country has experienced a
very similar institutional path to those of other extractive Latin
American countries. That elections have not brought either inclusive
political or economic institutions is the typical case in Latin America.
In Colombia, paramilitaries can fix one-third of national elections. In
Venezuela today, as in Argentina, the democratically elected government
of Hugo Chávez attacks its opponents, fires them from public-sector
jobs, closes down newspapers whose editorials it doesn’t like, and
expropriates property. In whatever he does, Chávez is much more powerful
and less constrained than Sir Robert Walpole was in Britain in the
1720s, when he was unable to condemn John Huntridge under the Black Act
(this page–this page). Huntridge would have fared much less well in
present-day Venezuela or Argentina. While the democracy emerging in
Latin America is in principle diametrically opposed to elite rule, and
in rhetoric and action it tries to redistribute rights and opportunities
away from at least a segment of the elite, its roots are firmly based in
extractive regimes in two senses. First, inequities persisting for
centuries under extractive regimes make voters in newly emerging
democracies vote in favor of politicians with extreme policies. It is
not that Argentinians are just naïve and think that Juan Perón or the
more recent Perónist politicians such as Menem or the Kirchners are
selfless and looking out for their interests, or that Venezuelans see
their salvation in Chávez. Instead, many Argentinians and Venezuelans
recognize that all other politicians and parties have for so long failed
to give them voice, to provide them with the most basic public services,
such as roads and education, and to protect them from exploitation by
local elites. So many Venezuelans today support the policies that Chávez
is adopting even if these come with corruption and waste in the same way
that many Argentinians supported Perón’s policies in the 1940s and
1970s. Second, it is again the underlying extractive institutions that
make politics so attractive to, and so biased in favor of, strongmen
such as Perón and Chávez, rather than an effective party system
producing socially desirable alternatives. Perón, Chávez, and dozens of
other strongmen in Latin America are just another facet of the iron law
of oligarchy, and as the name suggests, the roots of this iron law lies
in the underlying elite-controlled regimes.</p>
<p>THE NEW ABSOLUTISM</p>
<p>In November 2009, the government of North Korea implemented what
economists call a currency reform. Severe bouts of inflation are often
the reasons for such reforms. In France in January 1960, a currency
reform introduced a new franc that was equal to 100 of the existing
francs. Old francs continued in circulation and people even quoted
prices in them as the change to the new francs was gradually made.
Finally, old francs ceased to be legal tender in January 2002, when
France introduced the euro. The North Korean reform looked similar on
the face of it. Like the French in 1960, the North Korean government
decided to take two zeros off the currency. One hundred old wons, the
currency of North Korea, were to be worth one new won. Individuals were
allowed to come forward to exchange their old currency for the newly
printed currency, though this had to be done in one week, rather than
forty-two years, as in the French case. Then came the catch: the
government announced that no one could convert more than 100,000 won,
though it later relaxed this to 500,000. One hundred thousand won was
about 0 at the black market exchange rate. In one stroke, the government
had wiped out a huge fraction of North Korean citizens’ private wealth;
we do not know exactly how much, but it is probably greater than that
expropriated by the Argentine government in 2002. The government in
North Korea is a communist dictatorship opposed to private property and
markets. But it is difficult to control black markets, and black markets
make transactions in cash. Of course quite a bit of foreign exchange is
involved, particularly Chinese currency, but many transactions use won.
The currency reform was designed to punish people who used these markets
and, more specifically, to make sure that they did not become too
wealthy or powerful enough to threaten the regime. Keeping them poor was
safer. Black markets are not the whole story. People in North Korea also
keep their savings in wons because there are few banks in Korea, and
they are all owned by the government. In effect, the government used the
currency reform to expropriate much of people’s savings. Though the
government says it regards markets as bad, the North Korean elite rather
like what markets can produce for them. The leader, Kim Jong-Il, has a
seven-story pleasure palace equipped with a bar, a karaoke machine, and
a mini movie theater. The ground floor has an enormous swimming pool
with a wave machine, where Kim likes to use a body board fitted with a
small motor. When in 2006 the United States placed sanctions on North
Korea, it knew how to really hit the regime where it hurt. It made it
illegal to export more than sixty luxury items to North Korea, including
yachts, water scooters, racing cars, motorcycles, DVD players, and
televisions larger than twenty-nine inches. There would be no more silk
scarves, designer fountain pens, furs, or leather luggage. These were
exactly the items collected by Kim and his Communist Party elites. One
scholar used sales figures from the French company Hennessy to estimate
that Kim’s annual cognac budget before the sanctions could have been as
high as 00,000 a year. It is impossible to understand many of the
poorest regions of the world at the end of the twentieth century without
understanding the new absolutism of the twentieth century: communism.
Marx’s vision was a system that would generate prosperity under more
humane conditions and without inequality. Lenin and his Communist Party
were inspired by Marx, but the practice could not have been more
different from the theory. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was a bloody
affair, and there was no humane aspect to it. Equality was not part of
the equation, either, since the first thing Lenin and his entourage did
was to create a new elite, themselves, at the head of the Bolshevik
Party. In doing so, they purged and murdered not only non-communist
elements, but also other communists who could have threatened their
power. But the real tragedies were yet to come: first with the Civil
War, and then under Stalin’s collectivization and his all-too-frequent
purges, which may have killed as many as forty million people. Russian
communism was brutal, repressive, and bloody, but not unique. The
economic consequences and the human suffering were quite typical of what
happened elsewhere—for example, in Cambodia in the 1970s under the Khmer
Rouge, in China, and in North Korea. In all cases communism brought
vicious dictatorships and widespread human rights abuses. Beyond the
human suffering and carnage, the communist regimes all set up various
types of extractive institutions. The economic institutions, with or
without markets, were designed to extract resources from the people, and
by entirely abhorring property rights, they often created poverty
instead of prosperity. In the Soviet case, as we saw in chapter 5, the
Communist system at first generated rapid growth, but then faltered and
led to stagnation. The consequences were much more devastating in China
under Mao, in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and in North Korea, where
the Communist economic institutions led to economic collapse and famine.
The Communist economic institutions were in turn supported by extractive
political institutions, concentrating all power in the hands of
Communist parties and introducing no constraints on the exercise of this
power. Though these were different extractive institutions in form, they
had similar effects on the livelihoods of the people as the extractive
institutions in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>KING COTTON</p>
<p>Cotton accounts for about 45 percent of the exports of Uzbekistan,
making it the most important crop since the country established
independence at the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Under Soviet
communism all farmland in Uzbekistan was under the control of 2,048
state-owned farms. These were broken up and the land distributed after
1991. But that didn’t mean farmers could act independently. Cotton was
too valuable to the new government of Uzbekistan’s first, and so far
only, president, Ismail Karimov. Instead, regulations were introduced
that determined what farmers could plant and exactly how much they could
sell it for. Cotton was a valuable export, and farmers were paid a small
fraction of world market prices for their crop, with the government
taking the rest. Nobody would have grown cotton at the prices paid, so
the government forced them. Every farmer now has to allocate 35 percent
of his land to cotton. This caused many problems, difficulties with
machinery being one. At the time of independence, about 40 percent of
the harvest was picked by combine harvesters. After 1991, not
surprisingly, given the incentives that President Karimov’s regime
created for farmers, they were not willing to buy these or maintain
them. Recognizing the problem, Karimov came up with a solution, in fact,
a cheaper option than combine harvesters: schoolchildren. The cotton
bolls start to ripen and are ready to be picked in early September, at
about the same time that children return to school. Karimov issued
orders to local governors to send cotton delivery quotas to schools. In
early September the schools are emptied of 2.7 million children (2006
figures). Teachers, instead of being instructors, became labor
recruiters. Gulnaz, a mother of two of these children, explained what
happens:</p>
<p>At the beginning of each school year, approximately at the beginning
of September, the classes in school are suspended, and instead of
classes children are sent to the cotton harvest. Nobody asks for the
consent of parents. They don’t have weekend holidays 〔during the
harvesting season〕. If a child is for any reason left at home, his
teacher or class curator comes over and denounces the parents. They
assign a plan to each child, from 20 to 60 kg per day depending on the
child’s age. If a child fails to fulfil this plan then next morning he
is lambasted in front of the whole class.</p>
<p>The harvest lasts for two months. Rural children lucky enough to be
assigned to farms close to home can walk or are bused to work. Children
farther away or from urban areas have to sleep in the sheds or
storehouses with the machinery and animals. There are no toilets or
kitchens. Children have to bring their own food for lunch. The main
beneficiaries from all this forced labor are the political elites, led
by President Karimov, the de facto king of all Uzbeki cotton. The
schoolchildren are supposedly paid for their labor, but only supposedly.
In 2006, when the world price of cotton was around .40 (U.S.) per kilo,
the children were paid about 1.sh.03 for their daily quota of twenty to
sixty kilos. Probably 75 percent of the cotton harvest is now picked by
children. In the spring, school is closed for compulsory hoeing,
weeding, and transplanting. How did it all come to this? Uzbekistan,
like the other Soviet Socialist Republics, was supposed to gain its
independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union and develop a market
economy and democracy. As in many other Soviet Republics, this is not
what happened, however. President Karimov, who began his political
career in the Communist Party of the old Soviet Union, rising to the
post of first secretary for Uzbekistan at the opportune moment of 1989,
just as the Berlin Wall was collapsing, managed to reinvent himself as a
nationalist. With the crucial support of the security forces, in
December 1991 he won Uzbekistan’s first-ever presidential election.
After taking power, he cracked down on the independent political
opposition. Opponents are now in prison or exile. There is no free media
in Uzbekistan, and no nongovernmental organizations are allowed. The
apogee of the intensifying repression came in 2005, when possibly 750,
maybe more, demonstrators were murdered by the police and army in
Andijon. Using this command of the security forces and total control of
the media, Karimov first extended his presidential term for five years,
through a referendum, and then won reelection for a new seven-year term
in 2000, with 91.2 percent of the vote. His only opponent declared that
he had voted for Karimov! In his 2007 reelection, widely regarded as
fraudulent, he won 88 percent of the vote. Elections in Uzbekistan are
similar to those that Joseph Stalin used to organize in the heyday of
the Soviet Union. One in 1937 was famously covered by New York Times
correspondent Harold Denny, who reproduced a translation from Pravda,
the newspaper of the Communist Party, which was meant to convey the
tension and excitement of Soviet elections:</p>
<p>Midnight has struck. The twelfth of December, the day of the first
general, equal and direct elections to the Supreme Soviet, has ended.
The result of the voting is about to be announced.</p>
<p>The commission remains alone in its room. It is quiet, and the lamps
are shining solemnly. Amid the general attentive and intense expectation
the chairman performs all the necessary formalities before counting of
the ballots—checking up by list how many voters there were and how many
have voted—and the result is 100 per cent. 100 per cent! What election
in what country for what candidate has given a 100 per cent
response?</p>
<p>The main business starts now. Excitedly the chairman inspects the
seals on the boxes. Then the members of the commission inspect them. The
seals are intact and are cut off. The boxes are opened.</p>
<p>It is quiet. They sit attentively and seriously, these election
inspectors and executives.</p>
<p>Now it is time to open the envelopes. Three members of the commission
take scissors. The chairman rises. The tellers have their copybooks
ready. The first envelope is slit. All eyes are directed to it. The
chairman takes out two slips—white 〔for a candidate for the Soviet of
the Union〕 and blue 〔for a candidate for the Soviet of
Nationalities〕—and reads loudly and distinctly, “Comrade Stalin.”</p>
<p>Instantly the solemnity is broken. Everybody in the room jumps up and
applauds joyously and stormily for the first ballot of the first general
secret election under the Stalinist Constitution—a ballot with the name
of the Constitution’s creator.</p>
<p>This mood would have captured the suspense surrounding the
reelections of Karimov, who appears an apt pupil of Stalin when it comes
to repression and political control and seems to organize elections that
compete with those of Stalin in their surrealism. Under Karimov,
Uzbekistan is a country with very extractive political and economic
institutions. And it is poor. Probably one-third of the people live in
poverty, and the average annual income is around ,000. Not all the
development indicators are bad. According to World Bank data, school
enrollment is 100 percent … well, except possibly during the cotton
picking season. Literacy is also very high, though apart from
controlling all the media, the regime also bans books and censors the
Internet. While most people are paid only a few cents a day to pick
cotton, the Karimov family and former communist cadres who reinvented
themselves after 1989 as the new economic and political elites of
Uzbekistan have become fabulously wealthy. The family economic interests
are run by Karimov’s daughter Gulnora, who is expected to succeed her
father as president. In a country so untransparent and secretive, nobody
knows exactly what the Karimov family controls or how much money they
earn, but the experience of the U.S. company Interspan is indicative of
what has happened in the Uzbek economy in the last two decades. Cotton
is not the only agricultural crop; parts of the country are ideal for
growing tea, and Interspan decided to invest. By 2005 it had taken over
30 percent of the local market, but then it ran into trouble. Gulnora
decided that the tea industry looked economically promising. Soon
Interspan’s local personnel started to be arrested, beaten up, and
tortured. It became impossible to operate, and by August 2006 the
company had pulled out. Its assets were taken over by the Karimov
families’ rapidly expanding tea interests, at the time representing 67
percent of the market, up from 2 percent a couple of years earlier.
Uzbekistan in many ways looks like a relic from the past, a forgotten
age. It is a country languishing under the absolutism of a single family
and the cronies surrounding them, with an economy based on forced
labor—in fact, the forced labor of children. Except that it isn’t. It’s
part of the current mosaic of societies failing under extractive
institutions, and unfortunately it has many commonalities with other
former Soviet Socialist Republics, ranging from Armenia and Azerbaijan
to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, and reminds us that even in
the twenty-first century, extractive economic and political institutions
can take an unashamed atrociously extractive form.</p>
<p>KEEPING THE PLAYING FIELD AT AN ANGLE</p>
<p>The 1990s were a period of reform in Egypt. Since the military coup
that removed the monarchy in 1954, Egypt had been run as a
quasi-socialist society in which the government played a central role in
the economy. Many sectors of the economy were dominated by state-owned
enterprises. Over the years, the rhetoric of socialism lapsed, markets
opened, and the private sector developed. Yet these were not inclusive
markets, but markets controlled by the state and by a handful of
businessmen allied with the National Democratic Party (NDP), the
political party founded by President Anwar Sadat in 1978. Businessmen
became more and more involved with the party, and the party became more
and more involved with them under the government of Hosni Mubarak.
Mubarak, who became president in 1981 following Anwar Sadat’s
assassination, ruled with the NDP until being forced from power by
popular protests and the military in February 2011, as we discussed in
the Preface (this page). Major businesspeople were appointed to key
government posts in areas closely related to their economic interests.
Rasheed Mohamed Rasheed, former president of Unilever AMET (Africa,
Middle East, and Turkey), became minister of foreign trade and industry;
Mohamed Zoheir Wahid Garana, the owner and managing director of Garana
Travel Company, one of the largest in Egypt, became minister of tourism;
Amin Ahmed Mohamed Osman Abaza, founder of the Nile Cotton Trade
Company, the largest cotton-exporting company in Egypt, became minister
of agriculture. In many sectors of the economy, businessmen persuaded
the government to restrict entry through state regulation. These sectors
included the media, iron and steel, the automotive industry, alcoholic
beverages, and cement. Each sector was very concentrated with high entry
barriers protecting the politically connected businessmen and firms. Big
businessmen close to the regime, such as Ahmed Ezz (iron and steel), the
Sawiris family (multimedia, beverages, and telecommunications), and
Mohamed Nosseir (beverages and telecommunications) received not only
protection from the state but also government contracts and large bank
loans without needing to put up collateral. Ahmed Ezz was both the
chairman of Ezz Steel, the largest company in the country’s steel
industry, producing 70 percent of Egypt’s steel, and also a high-ranking
member of the NDP, the chairman of the People’s Assembly Budget and
Planning Committee, and a close associate of Gamal Mubarak, one of
President Mubarak’s sons. The economic reforms of the 1990s promoted by
international financial institutions and economists were aimed at
freeing up markets and reducing the role of the state in the economy. A
key pillar of such reforms everywhere was the privatization of
state-owned assets. Mexican privatization (this page–this page), instead
of increasing competition, simply turned state-owned monopolies into
privately owned monopolies, in the process enriching politically
connected businessmen such as Carlos Slim. Exactly the same thing took
place in Egypt. The businesspeople connected to the regime were able to
heavily influence implementation of Egypt’s privatization program so
that it favored the wealthy business elite—or the “whales,” as they are
known locally. At the time that privatization began, the economy was
dominated by thirty-two of these whales. One was Ahmed Zayat, at the
helm of the Luxor Group. In 1996 the government decided to privatize Al
Ahram beverages (ABC), which was the monopoly maker of beer in Egypt. A
bid came in from a consortium of the Egyptian Finance Company, led by
real estate developer Farid Saad, along with the first venture capital
company formed in Egypt in 1995. The consortium included Fouad Sultan,
former minister of tourism, Mohamed Nosseir, and Mohamed Ragab, another
elite businessman. The group was well connected, but not well connected
enough. Its bid of 400 million Egyptian pounds was turned down as too
low. Zayat was better connected. He didn’t have the money to purchase
ABC, so he came up with a scheme of Carlos Slim–type ingenuity. ABC
shares were floated for the first time on the London Stock Exchange, and
the Luxor Group acquired 74.9 percent of those shares at 68.5 Egyptian
pounds per share. Three months later the shares were then split in two,
and the Luxor Group was able to sell all of them at 52.5 pounds each,
netting a 36 percent profit, with which Zayat was able to fund the
purchase of ABC for 231 million pounds the next month. At the time, ABC
was making an annual profit of around 41.3 million Egyptian pounds and
had cash reserves of 93 million Egyptian pounds. It was quite a bargain.
In 1999 the newly privatized ABC extended its monopoly from beer into
wine by buying the privatized national wine monopoly Gianaclis.
Gianaclis was a very profitable company, nestling behind a 3,000 percent
tariff imposed on imported wines, and it had a 70 percent profit margin
on what it sold. In 2002 the monopoly changed hands again when Zayat
sold ABC to Heineken for 1.3 billion Egyptian pounds. A 563 percent
profit in five years. Mohamed Nosseir hadn’t always been on the losing
side. In 1993 he purchased the privatized El Nasr Bottling Company,
which had the monopoly rights to bottle and sell Coca-Cola in Egypt.
Nosseir’s relations with the then-minister of the public business
sector, Atef Ebeid, allowed him to make the purchase with little
competition. Nosseir then sold the company after two years for more than
three times the acquisition price. Another example was the move in the
late 1990s to involve the private sector in the state cinema industry.
Again political connections implied that only two families were allowed
to bid for and operate the cinemas—one of whom was the Sawiris family.
Egypt today is a poor nation—not as poor as most countries to the south,
in sub-Saharan Africa, but still one where around 40 percent of the
population is very poor and lives on less than two dollars a day.
Ironically, as we saw earlier (this page–this page), in the nineteenth
century Egypt was the site of an initially successful attempt at
institutional change and economic modernization under Muhammad Ali, who
did generate a period of extractive economic growth before it was
effectively annexed to the British Empire. From the British colonial
period a set of extractive institutions emerged, and were continued by
the military after 1954. There was some economic growth and investment
in education, but the majority of the population had few economic
opportunities, while the new elite could benefit from their connections
to the government. These extractive economic institutions were again
supported by extractive political institutions. President Mubarak
planned to begin a political dynasty, grooming his son Gamal to replace
him. His plan was cut short only by the collapse of his extractive
regime in early 2011 in the face of widespread unrest and demonstrations
during the so-called Arab Spring. During the period when Nasser was
president, there were some inclusive aspects of economic institutions,
and the state did open up the education system and provide some
opportunities that the previous regime of King Farouk had not. But this
was an example of an unstable combination of extractive political
institutions with some inclusivity of economic institutions. The
inevitable outcome, which came during Mubarak’s reign, was that economic
institutions became more extractive, reflecting the distribution of
political power in society. In some sense the Arab Spring was a reaction
to this. This was true not just in Egypt but also in Tunisia. Three
decades of Tunisian growth under extractive political institutions
started to go into reverse as President Ben Ali and his family began to
prey more and more on the economy.</p>
<p>WHY NATIONS FAIL</p>
<p>Nations fail economically because of extractive institutions. These
institutions keep poor countries poor and prevent them from embarking on
a path to economic growth. This is true today in Africa, in places such
as Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone; in South America, in countries such as
Colombia and Argentina; in Asia, in countries such as North Korea and
Uzbekistan; and in the Middle East, in nations such as Egypt. There are
notable differences among these countries. Some are tropical, some are
in temperate latitudes. Some were colonies of Britain; others, of Japan,
Spain, and Russia. They have very different histories, languages, and
cultures. What they all share is extractive institutions. In all these
cases the basis of these institutions is an elite who design economic
institutions in order to enrich themselves and perpetuate their power at
the expense of the vast majority of people in society. The different
histories and social structures of the countries lead to the differences
in the nature of the elites and in the details of the extractive
institutions. But the reason why these extractive institutions persist
is always related to the vicious circle, and the implications of these
institutions in terms of impoverishing their citizens are similar—even
if their intensity differs. In Zimbabwe, for example, the elite comprise
Robert Mugabe and the core of ZANU-PF, who spearheaded the anticolonial
fight in the 1970s. In North Korea, they are the clique around Kim
Jong-Il and the Communist Party. In Uzbekistan it is President Islam
Karimov, his family, and his reinvented Soviet Union–era cronies. These
groups are obviously very different, and these differences, along with
the variegated polities and economies they govern, mean that the
specific form the extractive institutions take differs. For instance,
because North Korea was created by a communist revolution, it takes as
its political model the one-party rule of the Communist Party. Though
Mugabe did invite the North Korean military into Zimbabwe in the 1980s
to massacre his opponents in Matabeleland, such a model for extractive
political institutions is not applicable in Zimbabwe. Instead, because
of the way he came to power in the anticolonial struggle, Mugabe had to
cloak his rule with elections, even if for a while he managed actually
to engineer a constitutionally sanctified one-party state. In contrast,
Colombia has had a long history of elections, which emerged historically
as a method for sharing power between the Liberal and Conservative
parties in the wake of independence from Spain. Not only is the nature
of elites different, but their numbers are. In Uzbekistan, Karimov could
hijack the remnants of the Soviet state, which gave him a strong
apparatus to suppress and murder alternative elites. In Colombia, the
lack of authority of the central state in parts of the country has
naturally led to much more fragmented elites—in fact, so much so that
they sometimes murder one another. Nevertheless, despite these
variegated elites and political institutions, these institutions often
manage to cement and reproduce the power of the elite that created them.
But sometimes the infighting they induce leads to the collapse of the
state, as in Sierra Leone. Just as different histories and structures
mean that the identity of elites and the details of extractive political
institutions differ, so do the details of the extractive economic
institutions that the elites set up. In North Korea, the tools of
extraction were again inherited from the communist toolkit: the
abolition of private property, state-run farms, and industry. In Egypt,
the situation was quite similar under the avowedly socialist military
regime created by Colonel Nasser after 1952. Nasser sided with the
Soviet Union in the cold war, expropriating foreign investments, such as
the British-owned Suez Canal, and took into public ownership much of the
economy. However, the situation in Egypt in the 1950s and ’60s was very
different from that in North Korea in the 1940s. It was much easier for
the North Koreans to create a more radically communist-style economy,
since they could expropriate former Japanese assets and build on the
economic model of the Chinese Revolution. In contrast, the Egyptian
Revolution was more a coup by a group of military officers. When Egypt
changed sides in the cold war and became pro-Western, it was therefore
relatively easy, as well as expedient, for the Egyptian military to
change from central command to crony capitalism as a method of
extraction. Even so, the better economic performance of Egypt compared
with North Korea was a consequence of the more limited extractive nature
of Egyptian institutions. For one thing, lacking the stifling control of
the North Korean Communist Party, the Egyptian regime had to placate its
population in a way that the North Korean regime does not. For another,
even crony capitalism generates some incentives for investment, at least
among those favored by the regime, that are totally absent in North
Korea. Though these details are all important and interesting, the more
critical lessons are in the big picture, which reveals that in each of
these cases, extractive political institutions have created extractive
economic institutions, transferring wealth and power toward the elite.
The intensity of extraction in these different countries obviously
varies and has important consequences for prosperity. In Argentina, for
example, the constitution and democratic elections do not work well to
promote pluralism, but they do function much better than in Colombia. At
least the state can claim the monopoly of violence in Argentina. Partly
as a consequence, income per capita in Argentina is double that of
Colombia. The political institutions of both countries do a much better
job of restraining elites than those in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone, and
as a result, Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone are much poorer than Argentina
and Colombia. The vicious circle also implies that even when extractive
institutions lead to the collapse of the state, as in Sierra Leone and
Zimbabwe, this doesn’t put a conclusive end to the rule of these
institutions. We have already seen that civil wars and revolutions,
while they may occur during critical junctures, do not necessarily lead
to institutional change. The events in Sierra Leone since the civil war
ended in 2002 vividly illustrate this possibility. In 2007 in a
democratic election, the old party of Siaka Stevens, the APC, returned
to power. Though the man who won the presidential election, Ernest Bai
Koroma, had no association with the old APC governments, many of his
cabinet did. Two of Stevens’s sons, Bockarie and Jengo, were even made
ambassadors to the United States and Germany. In a sense this is a more
volatile version of what we saw happen in Colombia. There the lack of
state authority in many parts of the country persists over time because
it is in the interests of part of the national political elite to allow
it to do so, but the core state institutions are also strong enough to
prevent this disorder from turning into complete chaos. In Sierra Leone,
partly because of the more extractive nature of economic institutions
and partly because of the country’s history of highly extractive
political institutions, the society has not only suffered economically
but has also tipped between complete disorder and some sort of order.
Still, the long-run effect is the same: the state all but remains
absent, and institutions are extractive. In all these cases there has
been a long history of extractive institutions since at least the
nineteenth century. Each country is trapped in a vicious circle. In
Colombia and Argentina, they are rooted in the institutions of Spanish
colonial rule (this page–this page). Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone
originated in British colonial regimes set up in the late nineteenth
century. In Sierra Leone, in the absence of white settlers, these
regimes built extensively on precolonial extractive structures of
political power and intensified them. These structures themselves were
the outcome of a long vicious circle that featured lack of political
centralization and the disastrous effects of the slave trade. In
Zimbabwe, there was much more of a construction of a new form of
extractive institutions, because the British South Africa Company
created a dual economy. Uzbekistan could take over the extractive
institutions of the Soviet Union and, like Egypt, modify them into crony
capitalism. The Soviet Union’s extractive institutions themselves were
in many ways a continuation of those of the tsarist regime, again in a
pattern predicated on the iron law of oligarchy. As these various
vicious circles played out in different parts of the world over the past
250 years, world inequality emerged, and persists. The solution to the
economic and political failure of nations today is to transform their
extractive institutions toward inclusive ones. The vicious circle means
that this is not easy. But it is not impossible, and the iron law of
oligarchy is not inevitable. Either some preexisting inclusive elements
in institutions, or the presence of broad coalitions leading the fight
against the existing regime, or just the contingent nature of history,
can break vicious circles. Just like the civil war in Sierra Leone, the
Glorious Revolution in 1688 was a struggle for power. But it was a
struggle of a very different nature than the civil war in Sierra Leone.
Conceivably some in Parliament fighting to remove James II in the wake
of the Glorious Revolution imagined themselves playing the role of the
new absolutist, as Oliver Cromwell did after the English Civil War. But
the fact that Parliament was already powerful and made up of a broad
coalition consisting of different economic interests and different
points of view made the iron law of oligarchy less likely to apply in
1688. And it was helped by the fact that luck was on the side of
Parliament against James II. In the next chapter, we will see other
examples of countries that have managed to break the mold and transform
their institutions for the better, even after a long history of
extractive institutions.</p>
