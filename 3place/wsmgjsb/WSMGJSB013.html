<h4 id="the-vicious-circle">12. THE VICIOUS CIRCLE</h4>
<p>YOU CAN’T TAKE THE TRAIN TO BO ANYMORE</p>
<p>ALL OF THE WEST AFRICAN nation of Sierra Leone became a British
colony in 1896. The capital city, Freetown, had originally been founded
in the late eighteenth century as a home for repatriated and freed
slaves. But when Freetown became a British colony, the interior of
Sierra Leone was still made up of many small African kingdoms.
Gradually, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the British
extended their rule into the interior through a long series of treaties
with African rulers. On August 31, 1896, the British government declared
the colony a protectorate on the basis of these treaties. The British
identified important rulers and gave them a new title, paramount chief.
In eastern Sierra Leone, for example, in the modern diamond-mining
district of Kono, they encountered Suluku, a powerful warrior king. King
Suluku was made Paramount Chief Suluku, and the chieftaincy of Sandor
was created as an administrative unit in the protectorate. Though kings
such as Suluku had signed treaties with a British administrator, they
had not understood that these treaties would be interpreted as carte
blanche to set up a colony. When the British tried to levy a hut tax—a
tax of five shillings to be raised from every house—in January 1898, the
chiefs rose up in a civil war that became known as the Hut Tax
Rebellion. It started in the north, but was strongest and lasted longer
in the south, particularly in Mendeland, dominated by the Mende ethnic
group. The Hut Tax Rebellion was soon defeated, but it warned the
British about the challenges of controlling the Sierra Leonean
hinterland. The British had already started to build a railway from
Freetown into the interior. Work began in March 1896, and the line
reached Songo Town in December 1898, in the midst of the Hut Tax
Rebellion. British parliamentary papers from 1904 recorded that:</p>
<p>In the case of the Sierra Leone Railways the Native Insurrection that
broke out in February 1898 had the effect of completely stopping the
works and disorganizing the staff for some time. The rebels descended
upon the railway, with the result that the entire staff had to be
withdrawn to Freetown … Rotifunk, now situated upon the railways at 55
miles from Freetown, was at that time completely in the hands of the
rebels.</p>
<p>In fact, Rotifunk was not on the planned railway line in 1894. The
route was changed after the start of the rebellion, so that instead of
going to the northeast, it went south, via Rotifunk and on to Bo, into
Mendeland. The British wanted quick access to Mendeland, the heart of
the rebellion, and to other potentially disruptive parts of the
hinterland if other rebellions were to flare up. When Sierra Leone
became independent in 1961, the British handed power to Sir Milton
Margai and his Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP), which attracted
support primarily in the south, particularly Mendeland, and the east.
Sir Milton was followed as prime minister by his brother, Sir Albert
Margai, in 1964. In 1967 the SLPP narrowly lost a hotly contested
election to the opposition, the All People’s Congress Party (APC), led
by Siaka Stevens. Stevens was a Limba, from the north, and the APC got
most of their support from northern ethnic groups, the Limba, the Temne,
and the Loko. Though the railway to the south was initially designed by
the British to rule Sierra Leone, by 1967 its role was economic,
transporting most of the country’s exports: coffee, cocoa, and diamonds.
The farmers who grew coffee and cocoa were Mende, and the railway was
Mendeland’s window to the world. Mendeland had voted hugely for Albert
Margai in the 1967 election. Stevens was much more interested in holding
on to power than promoting Mendeland’s exports. His reasoning was
simple: whatever was good for the Mende was good for the SLPP, and bad
for Stevens. So he pulled up the railway line to Mendeland. He then went
ahead and sold off the track and rolling stock to make the change as
irreversible as possible. Now, as you drive out of Freetown to the east,
you pass the dilapidated railway stations of Hastings and Waterloo.
There are no more trains to Bo. Of course, Stevens’s drastic action
fatally damaged some of the most vibrant sectors of Sierra Leone’s
economy. But like many of Africa’s postindependence leaders, when the
choice was between consolidating power and encouraging economic growth,
Stevens chose consolidating his power, and he never looked back. Today
you can’t take the train to Bo anymore, because like Tsar Nicholas I,
who feared that the railways would bring revolution to Russia, Stevens
believed the railways would strengthen his opponents. Like so many other
rulers in control of extractive institutions, he was afraid of
challenges to his political power and was willing to sacrifice economic
growth to thwart those challenges. Stevens’s strategy at first glance
contrasts with that of the British. But in fact, there was a significant
amount of continuity between British rule and Stevens’s regime that
illustrates the logic of vicious circles. Stevens ruled Sierra Leone by
extracting resources from its people using similar methods. He was still
in power in 1985 not because he had been popularly reelected, but
because after 1967 he set up a violent dictatorship, killing and
harassing his political opponents, particularly the members of the SLPP.
He made himself president in 1971, and after 1978, Sierra Leone had only
one political party, Stevens’s APC. Stevens thus successfully
consolidated his power, even if the cost was impoverishing much of the
hinterland. During the colonial period, the British used a system of
indirect rule to govern Sierra Leone, as they did with most of their
African colonies. At the base of this system were the paramount chiefs,
who collected taxes, distributed justice, and kept order. The British
dealt with the cocoa and coffee farmers not by isolating them, but by
forcing them to sell all their produce to a marketing board developed by
the colonial office purportedly to help the farmers. Prices for
agricultural commodities fluctuated wildly over time. Cocoa prices might
be high one year but low the next. The incomes of farmers fluctuated in
tandem. The justification for marketing boards was that they, not the
farmers, would absorb the price fluctuations. When world prices were
high, the board would pay the farmers in Sierra Leone less than the
world price, but when world prices were low, they would do the opposite.
It seemed a good idea in principle. The reality was very different,
however. The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up in 1949. Of
course the board needed a source of revenues to function. The natural
way to attain these was by paying farmers just a little less than they
should have received either in good or bad years. These funds could then
be used for overhead expenditures and administration. Soon the little
less became a lot less. The colonial state was using the marketing board
as a way of heavily taxing farmers. Many expected the worst practices of
colonial rule in sub-Saharan Africa to stop after independence, and the
use of marketing boards to excessively tax farmers to come to an end.
But neither happened. In fact, the extraction of farmers using marketing
boards got much worse. By the mid-1960s, the farmers of palm kernels
were getting 56 percent of the world price from the marketing board;
cocoa farmers, 48 percent; and coffee farmers, 49 percent. By the time
Stevens left office in 1985, resigning to allow his handpicked
successor, Joseph Momoh, to become president, these numbers were 37, 19,
and 27 percent, respectively. As pitiful as this might sound, it was
better than what the farmers were getting during Stevens’s reign, which
had often been as low as 10 percent—that is, 90 percent of the income of
the farmers was extracted by Stevens’s government, and not to provide
public services, such as roads or education, but to enrich himself and
his cronies and to buy political support. As part of their indirect
rule, the British had also stipulated that the office of the paramount
chief would be held for life. To be eligible to be a chief, one had to
be a member of a recognized “ruling house.” The identity of the ruling
houses in a chieftaincy developed over time, but it was essentially
based on the lineage of the kings in a particular area and of the elite
families who signed treaties with the British in the late nineteenth
century. Chiefs were elected, but not democratically. A body called the
Tribal Authority, whose members were lesser village chiefs or were
appointed by paramount chiefs, village chiefs, or the British
authorities, decided who would become the paramount chief. One might
have imagined that this colonial institution would also have been
abolished or at least reformed after independence. But just like the
marketing board, it was not, and continued unchanged. Today paramount
chiefs are still in charge of collecting taxes. It is no longer a hut
tax, but its close descendant, a poll tax. In 2005 the Tribal Authority
in Sandor elected a new paramount chief. Only candidates from the
Fasuluku ruling house, which is the only ruling house, could stand. The
victor was Sheku Fasuluku, King Suluku’s great-great-grandson. The
behavior of the marketing boards and the traditional systems of land
ownership go a long way to explain why agricultural productivity is so
low in Sierra Leone and much of sub-Saharan Africa. The political
scientist Robert Bates set out in the 1980s to understand why
agriculture was so unproductive in Africa even though according to
textbook economics this ought to have been the most dynamic economic
sector. He realized that this had nothing to do with geography or the
sorts of factors discussed in chapter 2 that have been claimed to make
agricultural productivity intrinsically low. Rather, it was simply
because the pricing policies of the marketing boards removed any
incentives for the farmers to invest, use fertilizers, or preserve the
soil. The reason that the policies of the marketing boards were so
unfavorable to rural interests was that these interests had no political
power. These pricing policies interacted with other fundamental factors
making tenure insecure, further undermining investment incentives. In
Sierra Leone, paramount chiefs not only provide law and order and
judicial services, and raise taxes, but they are also the “custodians of
the land.” Though families, clans, and dynasties have user rights and
traditional rights to land; at the end of the day chiefs have the last
say on who farms where. Your property rights to land are only secure if
you are connected to the chief, perhaps from the same ruling family.
Land cannot be bought or sold or used as collateral for a loan, and if
you are born outside a chieftaincy, you cannot plant any perennial crop
such as coffee, cocoa, or palm for fear that this will allow you to
establish “de facto” property rights. The contrast between the
extractive institutions developed by the British in Sierra Leone and the
inclusive institutions that developed in other colonies, such as
Australia, is illustrated by the way mineral resources were managed.
Diamonds were discovered in Kono in eastern Sierra Leone in January
1930. The diamonds were alluvial, that is, not in deep mines. So the
primary method of mining them was by panning in rivers. Some social
scientists call these “democratic diamonds,” because they allow many
people to become involved in mining, creating a potentially inclusive
opportunity. Not so in Sierra Leone. Happily ignoring the intrinsically
democratic nature of panning for diamonds, the British government set up
a monopoly for the entire protectorate, called it the Sierra Leone
Selection Trust, and granted it to De Beers, the giant South African
diamond mining company. In 1936 De Beers was also given the right to
create the Diamond Protection Force, a private army that would become
larger than that of the colonial government in Sierra Leone. Even so,
the widespread availability of the alluvial diamonds made the situation
difficult to police. By the 1950s, the Diamond Protection Force was
overwhelmed by thousands of illegal diamond miners, a massive source of
conflict and chaos. In 1955 the British government opened up some of the
diamond fields to licensed diggers outside the Sierra Leone Selection
Trust, though the company still kept the richest areas in Yengema and
Koidu and Tongo Fields. Things only got worse after independence. In
1970 Siaka Stevens effectively nationalized the Sierra Leone Selection
Trust, creating the National Diamond Mining Company (Sierra Leone)
Limited, in which the government, effectively meaning Stevens, had a 51
percent stake. This was the opening phase of Stevens’s plan to take over
diamond mining in the country. In nineteenth-century Australia it was
gold, discovered in 1851 in New South Wales and the newly created state
of Victoria, not diamonds, that attracted everyone’s attention. Like
diamonds in Sierra Leone, the gold was alluvial, and a decision had to
be made about how to exploit it. Some, such as James Macarthur, son of
John Macarthur, the prominent leader of the Squatters we discussed
earlier (this page–this page), proposed that fences be placed around the
mining areas and the monopoly rights auctioned off. They wanted an
Australian version of the Sierra Leone Selection Trust. Yet many in
Australia wanted free access to the gold mining areas. The inclusive
model won, and instead of setting up a monopoly, Australian authorities
allowed anyone who paid an annual mining license fee to search and dig
for gold. Soon the diggers, as these adventurers came to be known, were
a powerful force in Australian politics, particularly in Victoria. They
played an important role in pushing forward the agenda of universal
suffrage and the secret ballot. We have already seen two pernicious
effects of European expansion and colonial rule in Africa: the
introduction of the transatlantic slave trade, which encouraged the
development of African political and economic institutions in an
extractive direction, and the use of colonial legislation and
institutions to eliminate the development of African commercial
agriculture that might have competed with Europeans. Slavery was
certainly a force in Sierra Leone. At the time of colonization there was
no strong centralized state in the interior, just many small, mutually
antagonistic kingdoms continually raiding one another and capturing one
another’s men and women. Slavery was endemic, with possibly 50 percent
of the population working as slaves. The disease environment meant that
large-scale white settlement was not possible in Sierra Leone, as it was
in South Africa. Hence there were no whites competing with the Africans.
Moreover, the lack of a mining economy on the scale of Johannesburg
meant that, in addition to the lack of demand for African labor from
white farms, there was no incentive to create the extractive labor
market institutions so characteristic of Apartheid South Africa. But
other mechanisms were also in play. Sierra Leone’s cocoa and coffee
farmers did not compete with whites, though their incomes were still
expropriated via a government monopoly, the marketing board. Sierra
Leone also suffered from indirect rule. In many parts of Africa where
the British authorities wished to use indirect rule, they found peoples
who did not have a system of centralized authority who could be taken
over. For example, in eastern Nigeria the Igbo peoples had no chiefs
when the British encountered them in the nineteenth century. The British
then created chiefs, the warrant chiefs. In Sierra Leone, the British
would base indirect rule on existing indigenous institutions and systems
of authority. Nevertheless, regardless of the historical basis for the
individuals recognized as paramount chiefs in 1896, indirect rule, and
the powers that it invested in paramount chiefs, completely changed the
existing politics of Sierra Leone. For one, it introduced a system of
social stratification—the ruling houses—where none had existed
previously. A hereditary aristocracy replaced a situation that had been
much more fluid and where chiefs had required popular support. Instead
what emerged was a rigid system with chiefs holding office for life,
beholden to their patrons in Freetown or Britain, and far less
accountable to the people they ruled. The British were happy to subvert
the institutions in other ways, too, for example, by replacing
legitimate chiefs with people who were more cooperative. Indeed, the
Margai family, which supplied the first two prime ministers of
independent Sierra Leone, came to power in the Lower Banta chieftaincy
by siding with the British in the Hut Tax Rebellion against the reigning
chief, Nyama. Nyama was deposed, and the Margais became chiefs and held
the position until 2010. What is remarkable is the extent of continuity
between colonial and independent Sierra Leone. The British created the
marketing boards and used them to tax farmers. Postcolonial governments
did the same extracting at even higher rates. The British created the
system of indirect rule through paramount chiefs. Governments that
followed independence didn’t reject this colonial institution; rather,
they used it to govern the countryside as well. The British set up a
diamond monopoly and tried to keep out African miners. Postindependence
governments did the same. It is true that the British thought that
building railways was a good way to rule Mendeland, while Siaka Stevens
thought the opposite. The British could trust their army and knew it
could be sent to Mendeland if a rebellion arose. Stevens, on the other
hand, could not do so. As in many other African nations, a strong army
would have become a threat to Stevens’s rule. It was for this reason
that he emasculated the army, cutting it down and privatizing violence
through specially created paramilitary units loyal only to him, and in
the process, he accelerated the decline of the little state authority
that existed in Sierra Leone. Instead of the army, first came the
Internal Security Unit, the ISU, which Sierra Leone’s long-suffering
people knew as “I Shoot U.” Then came the Special Security Division, the
SSD, which the people knew as “Siaka Stevens’s Dogs.” In the end, the
absence of an army supporting the regime would also be its undoing. It
was a group of only thirty soldiers, led by Captain Valentine Strasser,
that pitched the APC regime from power on April 29, 1992. Sierra Leone’s
development, or lack thereof, could be best understood as the outcome of
the vicious circle. British colonial authorities built extractive
institutions in the first place, and the postindependence African
politicians were only too happy to take up the baton for themselves. The
pattern was eerily similar all over sub-Saharan Africa. There were
similar hopes for postindependence Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, and many other
African countries. Yet in all these cases, extractive institutions were
re-created in a pattern predicted by the vicious circle—only they became
more vicious as time went by. In all these countries, for example, the
British creation of marketing boards and indirect rule were sustained.
There are natural reasons for this vicious circle. Extractive political
institutions lead to extractive economic institutions, which enrich a
few at the expense of many. Those who benefit from extractive
institutions thus have the resources to build their (private) armies and
mercenaries, to buy their judges, and to rig their elections in order to
remain in power. They also have every interest in defending the system.
Therefore, extractive economic institutions create the platform for
extractive political institutions to persist. Power is valuable in
regimes with extractive political institutions, because power is
unchecked and brings economic riches. Extractive political institutions
also provide no checks against abuses of power. Whether power corrupts
is debatable, but Lord Acton was certainly right when he argued that
absolute power corrupts absolutely. We saw in the previous chapter that
even when Franklin Roosevelt wished to use his presidential powers in a
way that he thought would be beneficial for the society, unencumbered by
constraints imposed by the Supreme Court, the inclusive U.S. political
institutions prevented him from setting aside the constraints on his
power. Under extractive political institutions, there is little check
against the exercise of power, however distorted and sociopathic it may
become. In 1980 Sam Bangura, then the governor of the central bank in
Sierra Leone, criticized Siaka Stevens’s policies for being profligate.
He was soon murdered and thrown from the top floor of the central bank
building onto the aptly named Siaka Stevens Street. Extractive political
institutions thus also tend to create a vicious circle because they
provide no line of defense against those who want to further usurp and
misuse the powers of the state. Yet another mechanism for the vicious
circle is that extractive institutions, by creating unconstrained power
and great income inequality, increase the potential stakes of the
political game. Because whoever controls the state becomes the
beneficiary of this excessive power and the wealth that it generates,
extractive institutions create incentives for infighting in order to
control power and its benefits, a dynamic that we saw played out in Maya
city-states and in Ancient Rome. In this light, it is no surprise that
the extractive institutions that many African countries inherited from
the colonial powers sowed the seeds of power struggles and civil wars.
These struggles would be very different conflicts from the English Civil
War and the Glorious Revolution. They would not be fought to change
political institutions, introduce constraints on the exercise of power,
or create pluralism, but to capture power and enrich one group at the
expense of the rest. In Angola, Burundi, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria,
Republic of Congo Brazzaville, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda, and
of course in Sierra Leone, as we will see in more detail in the next
chapter, these conflicts would turn into bloody civil wars and would
create economic ruin and unparalleled human suffering—as well as cause
state failure.</p>
<p>FROM ENCOMIENDA TO LAND GRAB</p>
<p>On January 14, 1993, Ramiro De León Carpio was sworn in as the
president of Guatemala. He named Richard Aitkenhead Castillo as his
minister of finance, and Ricardo Castillo Sinibaldi as his minister of
development. These three men all had something in common: all were
direct descendants of Spanish conquistadors who had come to Guatemala in
the early sixteenth century. De León’s illustrious ancestor was Juan De
León Cardona, while the Castillos were related to Bernal Díaz del
Castillo, a man who wrote one of the most famous eyewitness accounts of
the conquest of Mexico. In reward for his service to Hernán Cortés, Díaz
del Castillo was appointed governor of Santiago de los Caballeros, which
is today the city of Antigua in Guatemala. Both Castillo and De León
founded dynasties along with other conquistadors, such as Pedro de
Alvarado. The Guatemalan sociologist Marta Casaús Arzú identified a core
group of twenty-two families in Guatemala that had ties through marriage
to another twenty-six families just outside the core. Her genealogical
and political study suggested that these families have controlled
economic and political power in Guatemala since 1531. An even broader
definition of which families were part of this elite suggested that they
accounted for just over 1 percent of the population in the 1990s. In
Sierra Leone and in much of sub-Saharan Africa, the vicious circle took
the form of the extractive institutions set up by colonial powers being
taken over by postindependence leaders. In Guatemala, as in much of
Central America, we see a simpler, more naked form of the vicious
circle: those who have economic and political power structure
institutions to ensure the continuity of their power, and succeed in
doing so. This type of vicious circle leads to the persistence of
extractive institutions and the persistence of the same elites in power
together with the persistence of underdevelopment. At the time of the
conquest, Guatemala was densely settled, probably with a population of
around two million Mayas. Disease and exploitation took a heavy toll as
everywhere else in the Americas. It was not until the 1920s that its
total population returned to this level. As elsewhere in the Spanish
Empire, the indigenous people were allocated to conquistadors in grants
of encomienda. As we saw in the context of the colonization of Mexico
and Peru, the encomienda was a system of forced labor, which
subsequently gave way to other similar coercive institutions,
particularly to the repartimiento, also called the mandamiento in
Guatemala. The elite, made up of the descendants of the conquistadors
and some indigenous elements, not only benefited from the various forced
labor systems but also controlled and monopolized trade through a
merchant guild called the Consulado de Comercio. Most of the population
in Guatemala was high in the mountains and far from the coast. The high
transportation costs reduced the extent of the export economy, and
initially land was not very valuable. Much of it was still in the hands
of indigenous peoples, who had large communal landholdings called
ejidos. The remainder was largely unoccupied and notionally owned by the
government. There was more money in controlling and taxing trade, such
as it was, than in controlling the land. Just as in Mexico, the
Guatemalan elite viewed the Cadiz Constitution (this page–this page)
with hostility, which encouraged them to declare independence just as
the Mexican elites did. Following a brief union with Mexico and the
Central American Federation, the colonial elite ruled Guatemala under
the dictatorship of Rafael Carrera from 1839 to 1871. During this period
the descendants of the conquistadors and the indigenous elite maintained
the extractive economic institutions of the colonial era largely
unchanged. Even the organization of the Consulado did not alter with
independence. Though this was a royal institution, it happily continued
under a republican government. Independence then was simply a coup by
the preexisting local elite, just as in Mexico; they carried on as usual
with the extractive economic institutions from which they had benefited
so much. Ironically enough, during this period the Consulado remained in
charge of the economic development of the country. But as had been the
case pre-independence, the Consulado had its own interests at heart, not
those of the country. Part of its responsibility was for the development
of infrastructure, such as ports and roads, but as in Austria-Hungary,
Russia, and Sierra Leone, this often threatened creative destruction and
could have destabilized the system. Therefore, the development of
infrastructure, rather than being implemented, was often resisted. For
example, the development of a port on the Suchitepéquez coast, bordering
the Pacific Ocean, was one of the proposed projects. At the time the
only proper ports were on the Caribbean coast, and these were controlled
by the Consulado. The Consulado did nothing on the Pacific side because
a port in that region would have provided a much easier outlet for goods
from the highland towns of Mazatenango and Quezaltenango, and access to
a different market for these goods would have undermined the Consulado’s
monopoly on foreign trade. The same logic applied to roads, where,
again, the Consulado had the responsibility for the entire country.
Predictably it also refused to build roads that would have strengthened
competing groups or would have potentially undone its monopoly. Pressure
to do so again came from western Guatemala and Quezaltenango, in the Los
Altos region. But if the road between Los Altos and the Suchitepéquez
coast had been improved, this could have created a merchant class, which
would have been a competitor to the Consulado merchants in the capital.
The road did not get improved. As a result of this elite dominance,
Guatemala was caught in a time warp in the middle of the nineteenth
century, as the rest of the world was changing rapidly. But these
changes would ultimately affect Guatemala. Transportation costs were
falling due to technological innovations such as the steam train, the
railways, and new, much faster types of ships. Moreover, the rising
incomes of people in Western Europe and North America were creating a
mass demand for many products that a country such as Guatemala could
potentially produce. Early in the century, some indigo and then
cochineal, both natural dyes, had been produced for export, but the more
profitable opportunity would become coffee production. Guatemala had a
lot of land suitable for coffee, and cultivation began to spread—without
any assistance from the Consulado. As the world price of coffee rose and
international trade expanded, there were huge profits to be made, and
the Guatemalan elite became interested in coffee. In 1871 the
long-lasting regime of the dictator Carrera was finally overthrown by a
group of people calling themselves Liberals, after the worldwide
movement of that name. What liberalism means has changed over time. But
in the nineteenth century in the United States and Europe, it was
similar to what is today called libertarianism, and it stood for freedom
of individuals, limited government, and free trade. Things worked a
little differently in Guatemala. Led initially by Miguel García
Granados, and after 1873 by Justo Rufino Barrios, the Guatemalan
Liberals were, for the most part, not new men with liberal ideals. By
and large, the same families remained in charge. They maintained
extractive political institutions and implemented a huge reorganization
of the economy to exploit coffee. They did abolish the Consulado in
1871, but economic circumstances had changed. The focus of extractive
economic institutions would now be the production and export of coffee.
Coffee production needed land and labor. To create land for coffee
farms, the Liberals pushed through land privatization, in fact really a
land grab in which they would be able to capture land previously held
communally or by the government. Though their attempt was bitterly
contested, given the highly extractive political institutions and the
concentration of political power in Guatemala, the elite were ultimately
victorious. Between 1871 and 1883 nearly one million acres of land,
mostly indigenous communal land and frontier lands, passed into the
hands of the elite, and it was only then that coffee developed rapidly.
The aim was the formation of large estates. The privatized lands were
auctioned off typically to members of the traditional elite or those
connected with them. The coercive power of the Liberal state was then
used to help large landowners gain access to labor by adapting and
intensifying various systems of forced labor. In November 1876,
President Barrios wrote to all the governors of Guatemala noting
that</p>
<p>because the country has extensive areas of land that it needs to
exploit by cultivation using the multitude of workers who today remain
outside the movement of development of the nation’s productive elements,
you are to give all help to export agriculture:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the Indian towns of your jurisdiction provide to the owners of
fincas 〔farms〕 of that department who ask for labor the number of
workers they need, be it fifty or one hundred.</li>
</ol>
<p>The repartimiento, the forced labor draft, had never been abolished
after independence, but now it was increased in scope and duration. It
was institutionalized in 1877 by Decree 177, which specified that
employers could request and receive from the government up to sixty
workers for fifteen days of work if the property was in the same
department, and for thirty days if it was outside it. The request could
be renewed if the employer so desired. These workers could be forcibly
recruited unless they could demonstrate from their personal workbook
that such service had recently been performed satisfactorily. All rural
workers were also forced to carry a workbook, called a libreta, which
included details of whom they were working for and a record of any
debts. Many rural workers were indebted to their employers, and an
indebted worker could not leave his current employer without permission.
Decree 177 further stipulated that the only way to avoid being drafted
into the repartimiento was to show you were currently in debt to an
employer. Workers were trapped. In addition to these laws, numerous
vagrancy laws were passed so that anyone who could not prove he had a
job would be immediately recruited for the repartimiento or other types
of forced labor on the roads, or would be forced to accept employment on
a farm. As in nineteenth- and twentieth-century South Africa, land
policies after 1871 were also designed to undermine the subsistence
economy of the indigenous peoples, to force them to work for low wages.
The repartimiento lasted until the 1920s; the libreta system and the
full gamut of vagrancy laws were in effect until 1945, when Guatemala
experienced its first brief flowering of democracy. Just as before 1871,
the Guatemalan elite ruled via military strongmen. They continued to do
so after the coffee boom took off. Jorge Ubico, president between 1931
and 1944, ruled longest. Ubico won the presidential election in 1931
unopposed, since nobody was foolish enough to run against him. Like the
Consulado, he didn’t approve of doing things that would have induced
creative destruction and threatened both his political power and his and
the elite’s profits. He therefore opposed industry for the same reason
that Francis I in Austria-Hungary and Nicholas I in Russia did:
industrial workers would have caused trouble. In a legislation
unparalleled in its paranoid repressiveness, Ubico banned the use of
words such as obreros (workers), sindicatos (labor unions), and huelgas
(strikes). You could be jailed for using any one of them. Even though
Ubico was powerful, the elite pulled the strings. Opposition to his
regime mounted in 1944, headed by disaffected university students who
began to organize demonstrations. Popular discontent increased, and on
June 24, 311 people, many of them from the elite, signed the Memorial de
los 311, an open letter denouncing the regime. Ubico resigned on July 1.
Though he was followed by a democratic regime in 1945, this was
overthrown by a coup in 1954, leading to a murderous civil war.
Guatemala democratized again after only 1986. The Spanish conquistadors
had no compunction about setting up an extractive political and economic
system. That was why they had come all the way to the New World. But
most of the institutions they set up were meant to be temporary. The
encomienda, for example, was a temporary grant of rights over labor.
They did not have a fully worked-out plan of how they would set up a
system that would persist for another four hundred years. In fact, the
institutions they set up changed significantly along the way, but one
thing did not: the extractive nature of the institutions, the result of
the vicious circle. The form of extraction changed, but neither the
extractive nature of the institutions nor the identity of the elite did.
In Guatemala the encomienda, the repartimiento, and the monopolization
of trade gave way to the libreta and the land grab. But the majority of
the indigenous Maya continued to work as low-wage laborers with little
education, no rights, and no public services. In Guatemala, as in much
of Central America, in a typical pattern of the vicious circle,
extractive political institutions supported extractive economic
institutions, which in turn provided the basis for extractive political
institutions and the continuation of the power of the same elite.</p>
<p>FROM SLAVERY TO JIM CROW</p>
<p>In Guatemala, extractive institutions persisted from colonial to
modern times with the same elite firmly in control. Any change in
institutions resulted from adaptations to changing environments, as was
the case with the land grab by the elite motivated by the coffee boom.
The institutions in the U.S. South were similarly extractive until the
Civil War. Economics and politics were dominated by the southern elite,
plantation owners with large land and slave holdings. Slaves had neither
political nor economic rights; indeed, they had few rights of any kind.
The South’s extractive economic and political institutions made it
considerably poorer than the North by the middle of the nineteenth
century. The South lacked industry and made relatively little investment
in infrastructure. In 1860 its total manufacturing output was less than
that of Pennsylvania, New York, or Massachusetts. Only 9 percent of the
southern population lived in urban areas, compared with 35 percent in
the Northeast. The density of railroads (i.e., miles of track divided by
land area) was three times higher in the North than in southern states.
The ratio of canal mileage was similar. Map 18 (this page) shows the
extent of slavery by plotting the percentage of the population that were
slaves across U.S. counties in 1840. It is apparent that slavery was
dominant in the South with some counties, for example, along the
Mississippi River having as much as 95 percent of the population slaves.
Map 19 (this page) then shows one of the consequences of this, the
proportion of the labor force working in manufacturing in 1880. Though
this was not high anywhere by twentieth-century standards, there are
marked differences between the North and the South. In much of the
Northeast, more than 10 percent of the labor force worked in
manufacturing. In contrast in much of the South, particularly the areas
with heavy concentrations of slaves, the proportion was basically zero.
The South was not even innovative in the sectors in which it
specialized: from 1837 to 1859, the numbers of patents issued per year
for innovations related to corn and wheat were on average twelve and
ten, respectively; there was just one per year for the most important
crop of the South, cotton. There was no indication that
industrialization and economic growth would commence anytime soon. But
defeat in the Civil War was followed by fundamental economic and
political reform at bayonet point. Slavery was abolished, and black men
were allowed to vote. These major changes should have opened the way for
a radical transformation of southern extractive institutions into
inclusive ones, and launched the South onto a path to economic
prosperity. But in yet another manifestation of the vicious circle,
nothing of the sort happened. A continuation of extractive institutions,
this time of the Jim Crow kind rather than of slavery, emerged in the
South. The phrase Jim Crow, which supposedly originated from “Jump Jim
Crow,” an early-nineteenth-century satire of black people performed by
white performers in “blackface,” came to refer to the whole gamut of
segregationist legislation that was enacted in the South after 1865.
These persisted for almost another century, until yet another major
upheaval, the civil rights movement. In the meantime, blacks continued
to be excluded from power and repressed. Plantation-type agriculture
based on low-wage, poorly educated labor persisted, and southern incomes
fell further relative to the U.S. average. The vicious circle of
extractive institutions was stronger than many had expected at the time.
The reason that the economic and political trajectory of the South never
changed, even though slavery was abolished and black men were given the
right to vote, was because blacks’ political power and economic
independence were tenuous. The southern planters lost the war, but would
win the peace. They were still organized and they still owned the land.
During the war, freed slaves had been offered the promise of forty acres
and a mule when slavery was abolished, and some even got it during the
famous campaigns of General William T. Sherman. But in 1865, President
Andrew Johnson revoked Sherman’s orders, and the hoped-for land
redistribution never took place. In a debate on this issue in Congress,
Congressman George Washington Julian presciently noted, “Of what avail
would be an act of congress totally abolishing slavery … if the old
agricultural basis of aristocratic power shall remain?” This was the
beginning of the “redemption” of the old South and the persistence of
the old southern landed elite. The sociologist Jonathan Wiener studied
the persistence of the planter elite in five counties of the Black Belt,
prime cotton country, of southern Alabama. Tracking families from the
U.S. census and considering those with at least 0,000 of real estate, he
found that of the 236 members of the planter elite in 1850, 101
maintained their position in 1870. Interestingly, this rate of
persistence was very similar to that experienced in the pre–Civil War
period; of the 236 wealthiest planter families of 1850, only 110
remained so a decade later. Nevertheless, of the 25 planters with the
largest landholdings in 1870, 18 (72 percent) had been in the elite
families in 1860; 16 had been in the 1850 elite group. While more than
600,000 were killed in the Civil War, the planter elites suffered few
casualties. The law, designed by the planters and for the planters,
exempted one slaveholder from military service for every twenty slaves
held. As hundreds of thousands of men died to preserve the southern
plantation economy, many big slaveholders and their sons sat out the war
on their porches and thus were able to ensure the persistence of the
plantation economy. After the end of the war, the elite planters
controlling the land were able to reexert their control over the labor
force. Though the economic institution of slavery was abolished, the
evidence shows a clear line of persistence in the economic system of the
South based on plantation-type agriculture with cheap labor. This
economic system was maintained through a variety of channels, including
both control of local politics and exercise of violence. As a
consequence, in the words of the African American scholar W.E.B. Du
Bois, the South became “simply an armed camp for intimidating black
folk.”</p>
<p>In 1865 the state legislature of Alabama passed the Black Code, an
important landmark toward the repression of black labor. Similar to
Decree 177 in Guatemala, the Black Code of Alabama consisted of a
vagrancy law and a law against the “enticement” of laborers. It was
designed to impede labor mobility and reduce competition in the labor
market, and it ensured that southern planters would still have a
reliable low-cost labor pool. Following the Civil War, the period called
Reconstruction lasted from 1865 until 1877. Northern politicians, with
the help of the Union Army, engineered some social changes in the South.
But a systematic backlash from the southern elite in the guise of
support for the so-called Redeemers, seeking the South’s redemption,
re-created the old system. In the 1877 presidential election, Rutherford
Hayes needed southern support in the electoral college. This college,
still used today, was at the heart of the indirect election for
president created by the U.S. Constitution. Citizens’ votes do not
directly elect the president but instead elect electors who then choose
the president in the electoral college. In exchange for their support in
the electoral college, the southerners demanded that Union soldiers be
withdrawn from the South and the region left to its own devices. Hayes
agreed. With southern support, Hayes became president and pulled out the
troops. The period after 1877 then marked the real reemergence of the
pre–Civil War planter elite. The redemption of the South involved the
introduction of new poll taxes and literacy tests for voting, which
systematically disenfranchised blacks, and often also the poor white
population. These attempts succeeded and created a one-party regime
under the Democratic Party, with much of the political power vested in
the hands of the planter elite. The Jim Crow laws created separate, and
predictably inferior, schools. Alabama, for example, rewrote its
constitution in 1901 to achieve this. Shockingly, even today Section 256
of Alabama’s constitution, though no longer enforced, still states:</p>
<p>Duty of legislature to establish and maintain public school system;
apportionment of public school fund; separate schools for white and
colored children.</p>
<p>The legislature shall establish, organize, and maintain a liberal
system of public schools throughout the state for the benefit of the
children thereof between the ages of seven and twenty-one years. The
public school fund shall be apportioned to the several counties in
proportion to the number of school children of school age therein, and
shall be so apportioned to the schools in the districts or townships in
the counties as to provide, as nearly as practicable, school terms of
equal duration in such school districts or townships. Separate schools
shall be provided for white and colored children, and no child of either
race shall be permitted to attend a school of the other race.</p>
<p>An amendment to strike Section 256 from the constitution was narrowly
defeated in the state legislature in 2004. Disenfranchisement, the
vagrancy laws such as the Black Code of Alabama, various Jim Crow laws,
and the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, often financed and supported by the
elite, turned the post–Civil War South into an effective apartheid
society, where blacks and whites lived different lives. As in South
Africa, these laws and practices were aimed at controlling the black
population and its labor. Southern politicians in Washington also worked
to make sure that the extractive institutions of the South could
persist. For instance, they ensured that no federal projects or public
works that would have jeopardized southern elite control over the black
workforce ever got approved. Consequently, the South entered the
twentieth century as a largely rural society with low levels of
education and backward technology, still employing hand labor and mule
power virtually unassisted by mechanical implements. Though the
proportion of people in urban areas increased, it was far less than in
the North. In 1900, for example, 13.5 percent of the population of the
South was urbanized, as compared with 60 percent in the Northeast. All
in all, the extractive institutions in the southern United States, based
on the power of the landed elite, plantation agriculture, and low-wage,
low-education labor, persisted well into the twentieth century. These
institutions started to crumble only after the Second World War and then
truly after the civil rights movement destroyed the political basis of
the system. And it was only after the demise of these institutions in
the 1950s and ’60s that the South began its process of rapid convergence
to the North. The U.S. South shows another, more resilient side of the
vicious circle: as in Guatemala, the southern planter elite remained in
power and structured economic and political institutions in order to
ensure the continuity of its power. But differently from Guatemala, it
was faced with significant challenges after its defeat in the Civil War,
which abolished slavery and reversed the total, constitutional exclusion
of blacks from political participation. But there is more than one way
of skinning a cat: as long as the planter elite was in control of its
huge landholdings and remained organized, it could structure a new set
of institutions, Jim Crow instead of slavery, to achieve the same
objective. The vicious circle turned out to be stronger than many,
including Abraham Lincoln, had thought. The vicious circle is based on
extractive political institutions creating extractive economic
institutions, which in turn support the extractive political
institutions, because economic wealth and power buy political power.
When forty acres and a mule was off the table, the southern planter
elite’s economic power remained untarnished. And, unsurprisingly and
unfortunately, the implications for the black population of the South,
and the South’s economic development, were the same.</p>
<p>THE IRON LAW OF OLIGARCHY</p>
<p>The Solomonic dynasty in Ethiopia lasted until it was overthrown by a
military coup in 1974. The coup was led by the Derg, a group of Marxist
army officers. The regime that the Derg pitched from power looked like
it was frozen in some earlier century, a historical anachronism. The
emperor Haile Selassie would start his day by arriving in the courtyard
at the Grand Palace, which had been built by Emperor Menelik II in the
late nineteenth century. Outside the palace would be a crowd of
dignitaries anticipating his arrival, bowing and desperately trying to
get his attention. The emperor would hold court in the Audience Hall,
sitting on the imperial throne. (Selassie was a small man; so that his
legs were not left swinging in the air, it was the job of a special
pillow bearer to accompany him wherever he went to make sure there was a
suitable pillow to put under his feet. The bearer kept a stock of
fifty-two pillows to cope with any situation.) Selassie presided over an
extreme set of extractive institutions and ran the country as his own
private property, handing out favors and patronage and ruthlessly
punishing lack of loyalty. There was no economic development to speak of
in Ethiopia under the Solomonic dynasty. The Derg initially formed out
of 108 representatives of different military units from all over the
country. The representative of the Third Division in Harar province was
a major named Mengistu Haile Mariam. Though in their initial declaration
of July 4, 1974, the Derg officers declared their loyalty to the
emperor, they soon started to arrest members of the government, testing
how much opposition it would create. As they became more confident that
the support for Selassie’s regime was hollow, they moved on the emperor
himself, arresting him on September 12. Then the executions began. Many
politicians at the core of the old regime were swiftly killed. By
December, the Derg had declared that Ethiopia was a socialist state.
Selassie died, probably murdered, on August 27, 1975. In 1975 the Derg
started nationalizing property, including all urban and rural land and
most kinds of private property. The increasingly authoritarian behavior
of the regime sparked opposition around the country. Large parts of
Ethiopia were put together during the European colonial expansion in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by the policies of Emperor
Menelik II, the victor of the battle of Adowa, which we encountered
before (this page). These included Eritrea and Tigray in the north and
the Ogaden in the east. Independence movements in response to the Derg’s
ruthless regime emerged in Eritrea and Tigray, while the Somali army
invaded the Somali-speaking Ogaden. The Derg itself started to
disintegrate and split into factions. Major Mengistu turned out to be
the most ruthless and clever of them. By mid-1977 he had eliminated his
major opponents and effectively taken charge of the regime, which was
saved from collapse only by a huge influx of weapons and troops from the
Soviet Union and Cuba later in November of that year. In 1978 the regime
organized a national celebration marking the fourth anniversary of the
overthrow of Haile Selassie. By this time Mengistu was the unchallenged
leader of the Derg. As his residence, the place from where he would rule
Ethiopia, he had chosen Selassie’s Grand Palace, left unoccupied since
the monarchy was abolished. At the celebration, he sat on a gilded
armchair, just like the emperors of old, watching the parade. Official
functions were now held once again at the Grand Palace, with Mengistu
sitting on Haile Selassie’s old throne. Mengistu started to compare
himself to Emperor Tewodros, who had refounded the Solomonic Dynasty in
the mid-nineteenth century after a period of decline. One of his
ministers, Dawit Wolde Giorgis, recalled in his memoir:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Revolution all of us had utterly rejected
anything to do with the past. We would no longer drive cars, or wear
suits; neckties were considered criminal. Anything that made you look
well-off or bourgeois, anything that smacked of affluence or
sophistication, was scorned as part of the old order. Then, around 1978,
all that began to change. Gradually materialism became accepted, then
required. Designer clothes from the best European tailors were the
uniform of all senior government officials and members of the Military
Council. We had the best of everything: the best homes, the best cars,
the best whiskey, champagne, food. It was a complete reversal of the
ideals of the Revolution.</p>
<p>Giorgis also vividly recorded how Mengistu changed once he became
sole ruler:</p>
<p>The real Mengistu emerged: vengeful, cruel and authoritarian … Many
of us who used to talk to him with hands in our pockets, as if he were
one of us, found ourselves standing stiffly to attention, cautiously
respectful in his presence. In addressing him we had always used the
familiar form of “you,” ante; now we found ourselves switching to the
more formal “you,” ersiwo. He moved into a bigger, more lavish office in
the Palace of Menelik … He began using the Emperor’s cars … We were
supposed to have a revolution of equality; now he had become the new
Emperor.</p>
<p>The pattern of vicious circle depicted by the transition between
Haile Selassie and Mengistu, or between the British colonial governors
of Sierra Leone and Siaka Stevens, is so extreme and at some level so
strange that it deserves a special name. As we already mentioned in
chapter 4, the German sociologist Robert Michels called it the iron law
of oligarchy. The internal logic of oligarchies, and in fact of all
hierarchical organizations, is that, argued Michels, they will reproduce
themselves not only when the same group is in power, but even when an
entirely new group takes control. What Michels did not anticipate
perhaps was an echo of Karl Marx’s remark that history repeats
itself—the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. It is not
only that many of the postindependence leaders of Africa moved into the
same residences, made use of the same patronage networks, and employed
the same ways of manipulating markets and extracting resources as had
the colonial regimes and the emperors they replaced; but they also made
things worse. It was indeed a farce that the staunchly anticolonial
Stevens would be concerned with controlling the same people, the Mende,
whom the British had sought to control; that he would rely on the same
chiefs whom the British had empowered and then used to control the
hinterland; that he would run the economy in the same way, expropriating
the farmers with the same marketing boards and controlling the diamonds
under a similar monopoly. It was indeed a farce, a very sad farce
indeed, that Laurent Kabila, who mobilized an army against Mobutu’s
dictatorship with the promise of freeing the people and ending the
stifling and impoverishing corruption and repression of Mobutu’s Zaire,
would then set up a regime just as corrupt and perhaps even more
disastrous. It was certainly farcical that he tried to start a
Mobutuesque personality cult aided and abetted by Dominique Sakombi
Inongo, previously Mobutu’s minister of information, and that Mobutu’s
regime was itself fashioned on patterns of exploitation of the masses
that had started more than a century previously with King Leopold’s
Congo Free State. It was indeed a farce that the Marxist officer
Mengistu would start living in a palace, viewing himself as an emperor,
and enriching himself and his entourage just like Haile Selassie and
other emperors before him had done. It was all a farce, but also more
tragic than the original tragedy, and not only for the hopes that were
dashed. Stevens and Kabila, like many other rulers in Africa, would
start murdering their opponents and then innocent citizens. Mengistu and
the Derg’s policies would bring recurring famine to Ethiopia’s fertile
lands. History was repeating itself, but in a very distorted form. It
was a famine in Wollo province in 1973 to which Haile Selassie was
apparently indifferent that did so much finally to solidify opposition
to his regime. Selassie had at least been only indifferent. Mengistu
instead saw famine as a political tool to undermine the strength of his
opponents. History was not only farcical and tragic, but also cruel to
the citizens of Ethiopia and much of sub-Saharan Africa. The essence of
the iron law of oligarchy, this particular facet of the vicious circle,
is that new leaders overthrowing old ones with promises of radical
change bring nothing but more of the same. At some level, the iron law
of oligarchy is harder to understand than other forms of the vicious
circle. There is a clear logic to the persistence of the extractive
institutions in the U.S. South and in Guatemala. The same groups
continued to dominate the economy and the politics for centuries. Even
when challenged, as the U.S. southern planters were after the Civil War,
their power remained intact and they were able to keep and re-create a
similar set of extractive institutions from which they would again
benefit. But how can we understand those who come to power in the name
of radical change re-creating the same system? The answer to this
question reveals, once again, that the vicious circle is stronger than
it first appears. Not all radical changes are doomed to failure. The
Glorious Revolution was a radical change, and it led to what perhaps
turned out to be the most important political revolution of the past two
millennia. The French Revolution was even more radical, with its chaos
and excessive violence and the ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte, but it did
not re-create the ancien régime. Three factors greatly facilitated the
emergence of more inclusive political institutions following the
Glorious Revolution and the French Revolution. The first was new
merchants and businessmen wishing to unleash the power of creative
destruction from which they themselves would benefit; these new men were
among the key members of the revolutionary coalitions and did not wish
to see the development of yet another set of extractive institutions
that would again prey on them. The second was the nature of the broad
coalition that had formed in both cases. For example, the Glorious
Revolution wasn’t a coup by a narrow group or a specific narrow
interest, but a movement backed by merchants, industrialists, the
gentry, and diverse political groupings. The same was largely true for
the French Revolution. The third factor relates to the history of
English and French political institutions. They created a background
against which new, more inclusive regimes could develop. In both
countries there was a tradition of parliaments and power sharing going
back to the Magna Carta in England and to the Assembly of Notables in
France. Moreover, both revolutions happened in the midst of a process
that had already weakened the grasp of the absolutist, or aspiring
absolutist, regimes. In neither case would these political institutions
make it easy for a new set of rulers or a narrow group to take control
of the state and usurp existing economic wealth and build unchecked and
durable political power. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, a
narrow group under the leadership of Robespierre and Saint-Just did take
control, with disastrous consequences, but this was temporary and did
not derail the path toward more inclusive institutions. All this
contrasts with the situation of societies with long histories of extreme
extractive economic and political institutions, and no checks on the
power of rulers. In these societies, there would be no new strong
merchants or businessmen supporting and bankrolling the resistance
against the existing regime in part to secure more inclusive economic
institutions; no broad coalitions introducing constraints against the
power of each of their members; no political institutions inhibiting new
rulers intent on usurping and exploiting power. In consequence, in
Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and the Congo, the vicious circle would be far
harder to resist, and moves toward inclusive institutions far more
unlikely to get under way. There were also no traditional or historical
institutions that could check the power of those who would take control
of the state. Such institutions had existed in some parts of Africa, and
some, as in Botswana, even survived the colonial era. But they were much
less prominent throughout Sierra Leone’s history, and to the extent that
they existed, they were warped by indirect rule. The same was true in
other British colonies in Africa, such as Kenya and Nigeria. They never
existed in the absolutist kingdom of Ethiopia. In the Congo, indigenous
institutions were emasculated by Belgian colonial rule and the
autocratic policies of Mobutu. In all these societies, there were also
no new merchants, businessmen, or entrepreneurs supporting the new
regimes and demanding secure property rights and an end to previous
extractive institutions. In fact, the extractive economic institutions
of the colonial period meant that there was not much entrepreneurship or
business left at all. The international community thought that
postcolonial African independence would lead to economic growth through
a process of state planning and cultivation of the private sector. But
the private sector was not there—except in rural areas, which had no
representation in the new governments and would thus be their first
prey. Most important perhaps, in most of these cases there were enormous
benefits from holding power. These benefits both attracted the most
unscrupulous men, such as Stevens, who wished to monopolize this power,
and brought the worst out of them once they were in power. There was
nothing to break the vicious circle.</p>
<p>NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND VICIOUS CIRCLES</p>
<p>Rich nations are rich largely because they managed to develop
inclusive institutions at some point during the past three hundred
years. These institutions have persisted through a process of virtuous
circles. Even if inclusive only in a limited sense to begin with, and
sometimes fragile, they generated dynamics that would create a process
of positive feedback, gradually increasing their inclusiveness. England
did not become a democracy after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Far
from it. Only a small fraction of the population had formal
representation, but crucially, she was pluralistic. Once pluralism was
enshrined, there was a tendency for the institutions to become more
inclusive over time, even if this was a rocky and uncertain process. In
this, England was typical of virtuous circles: inclusive political
institutions create constraints against the exercise and usurpation of
power. They also tend to create inclusive economic institutions, which
in turn make the continuation of inclusive political institutions more
likely. Under inclusive economic institutions, wealth is not
concentrated in the hands of a small group that could then use its
economic might to increase its political power disproportionately.
Furthermore, under inclusive economic institutions there are more
limited gains from holding political power, thus weaker incentives for
every group and every ambitious, upstart individual to try to take
control of the state. A confluence of factors at a critical juncture,
including interplay between existing institutions and the opportunities
and challenges brought by the critical juncture, is generally
responsible for the onset of inclusive institutions, as the English case
demonstrates. But once these inclusive institutions are in place, we do
not need the same confluence of factors for them to survive. Virtuous
circles, though still subject to significant contingency, enable the
institutions’ continuity and often even unleash dynamics taking society
toward greater inclusiveness. As virtuous circles make inclusive
institutions persist, vicious circles create powerful forces toward the
persistence of extractive institutions. History is not destiny, and
vicious circles are not unbreakable, as we will see further in chapter
14. But they are resilient. They create a powerful process of negative
feedback, with extractive political institutions forging extractive
economic institutions, which in turn create the basis for the
persistence of extractive political institutions. We saw this most
clearly in the case of Guatemala, where the same elite held power, first
under colonial rule, then in independent Guatemala, for more than four
centuries; extractive institutions enrich the elite, and their wealth
forms the basis for the continuation of their domination. The same
process of the vicious circle is also apparent in the persistence of the
plantation economy in the U.S. South, except that it also showcases the
vicious circle’s great resilience in the face of challenges. U.S.
southern planters lost their formal control of economic and political
institutions after their defeat in the Civil War. Slavery, which was the
basis of the plantation economy, was abolished, and blacks were given
equal political and economic rights. Yet the Civil War did not destroy
the political power of the planter elite or its economic basis, and they
were able to restructure the system, under a different guise but still
under their own local political control, and to achieve the same
objective: abundance of low-cost labor for the plantations. This form of
the vicious circle, where extractive institutions persist because the
elite controlling them and benefiting from them persists, is not its
only form. At first a more puzzling, but no less real and no less
vicious, form of negative feedback shaped the political and economic
development of many nations, and is exemplified by the experiences of
much of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Sierra Leone and Ethiopia. In
a form that the sociologist Robert Michels would recognize as the iron
law of oligarchy, the overthrow of a regime presiding over extractive
institutions heralds the arrival of a new set of masters to exploit the
same set of pernicious extractive institutions. The logic of this type
of vicious circle is also simple to understand in hindsight: extractive
political institutions create few constraints on the exercise of power,
so there are essentially no institutions to restrain the use and abuse
of power by those overthrowing previous dictators and assuming control
of the state; and extractive economic institutions imply that there are
great profits and wealth to be made merely by controlling power,
expropriating the assets of others, and setting up monopolies. Of
course, the iron law of oligarchy is not a true law, in the sense that
the laws of physics are. It does not chart an inevitable path, as the
Glorious Revolution in England or the Meiji Restoration in Japan
illustrate. A key factor in these episodes, which saw a major turn
toward inclusive institutions, was the empowerment of a broad coalition
that could stand up against absolutism and would replace the absolutist
institutions by more inclusive, pluralistic ones. A revolution by a
broad coalition makes the emergence of pluralistic political
institutions much more likely. In Sierra Leone and Ethiopia, the iron
law of oligarchy was made more likely not only because existing
institutions were highly extractive but also because neither the
independence movement in the former nor the Derg coup in the latter were
revolutions led by such broad coalitions, but rather by individuals and
groups seeking power so that they could do the extracting. There is yet
another, even more destructive facet of the vicious circle, anticipated
by our discussion of the Maya city-states in chapter 5. When extractive
institutions create huge inequalities in society and great wealth and
unchecked power for those in control, there will be many wishing to
fight to take control of the state and institutions. Extractive
institutions then not only pave the way for the next regime, which will
be even more extractive, but they also engender continuous infighting
and civil wars. These civil wars then cause more human suffering and
also destroy even what little state centralization these societies have
achieved. This also often starts a process of descent into lawlessness,
state failure, and political chaos, crushing all hopes of economic
prosperity, as the next chapter will illustrate.</p>
