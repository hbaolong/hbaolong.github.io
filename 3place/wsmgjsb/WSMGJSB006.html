“I’VE SEEN THE FUTURE, AND IT WORKS”: GROWTH UNDER EXTRACTIVE
INSTITUTIONS</h4>
<p>I’VE SEEN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES PLAY the critical role in explaining
economic growth throughout the ages. But if most societies in history
are based on extractive political and economic institutions, does this
imply that growth never takes place? Obviously not. Extractive
institutions, by their very logic, must create wealth so that it can be
extracted. A ruler monopolizing political power and in control of a
centralized state can introduce some degree of law and order and a
system of rules, and stimulate economic activity. But growth under
extractive institutions differs in nature from growth brought forth by
inclusive institutions. Most important, it will be not sustained growth
that requires technological change, but rather growth based on existing
technologies. The economic trajectory of the Soviet Union provides a
vivid illustration of how the authority and incentives provided by the
state can spearhead rapid economic growth under extractive institutions
and how this type of growth ultimately comes to an end and
collapses.</p>
<p>THE FIRST WORLD WAR had ended and the victorious and the vanquished
powers met in the great palace of Versailles, outside Paris, to decide
on the parameters of the peace. Prominent among the attendees was
Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States. Noticeable by its
absence was any representation from Russia. The old tsarist regime had
been overthrown by the Bolsheviks in October 1917. A civil war then
raged between the Reds (the Bolsheviks) and the Whites. The English,
French, and Americans sent an expeditionary force to fight against the
Bolsheviks. A mission led by a young diplomat, William Bullitt, and the
veteran intellectual and journalist Lincoln Steffens was sent to Moscow
to meet with Lenin to try to understand the intentions of the Bolsheviks
and how to come to terms with them. Steffens had made his name as an
iconoclast, a muckraker journalist who had persistently denounced the
evils of capitalism in the United States. He had been in Russia at the
time of the revolution. His presence was intended to make the mission
look credible and not too hostile. The mission returned with the
outlines of an offer from Lenin about what it would take for peace with
the newly created Soviet Union. Steffens was bowled over by what he saw
as the great potential of the Soviet regime. “Soviet Russia,” he
recalled in his 1931 autobiography, “was a revolutionary government with
an evolutionary plan. Their plan was not to end evils such as poverty
and riches, graft, privilege, tyranny, and war by direct action, but to
seek out and remove their causes. They had set up a dictatorship,
supported by a small, trained minority, to make and maintain for a few
generations a scientific rearrangement of economic forces which would
result in economic democracy first and political democracy last.”</p>
<p>When Steffens returned from his diplomatic mission he went to see his
old friend the sculptor Jo Davidson and found him making a portrait bust
of the wealthy financier Bernard Baruch. “So you’ve been over in
Russia,” Baruch remarked. Steffens answered, “I have been over into the
future, and it works.” He would perfect this adage into a form that went
down in history: “I’ve seen the future, and it works.”</p>
<p>Right up until the early 1980s, many Westerners were still seeing the
future in the Soviet Union, and they kept on believing that it was
working. In a sense it was, or at least it did for a time. Lenin had
died in 1924, and by 1927 Joseph Stalin had consolidated his grip on the
country. He purged his opponents and launched a drive to rapidly
industrialize the country. He did it via energizing the State Planning
Committee, Gosplan, which had been founded in 1921. Gosplan wrote the
first Five-Year Plan, which ran between 1928 and 1933. Economic growth
Stalin style was simple: develop industry by government command and
obtain the necessary resources for this by taxing agriculture at very
high rates. The communist state did not have an effective tax system, so
instead Stalin “collectivized” agriculture. This process entailed the
abolition of private property rights to land and the herding of all
people in the countryside into giant collective farms run by the
Communist Party. This made it much easier for Stalin to grab
agricultural output and use it to feed all the people who were building
and manning the new factories. The consequences of this for the rural
folk were calamitous. The collective farms completely lacked incentives
for people to work hard, so production fell sharply. So much of what was
produced was extracted that there was not enough to eat. People began to
starve to death. In the end, probably six million people died of famine,
while hundreds of thousands of others were murdered or banished to
Siberia during the forcible collectivization. Neither the newly created
industry nor the collectivized farms were economically efficient in the
sense that they made the best use of what resources the Soviet Union
possessed. It sounds like a recipe for economic disaster and stagnation,
if not outright collapse. But the Soviet Union grew rapidly. The reason
for this is not difficult to understand. Allowing people to make their
own decisions via markets is the best way for a society to efficiently
use its resources. When the state or a narrow elite controls all these
resources instead, neither the right incentives will be created nor will
there be an efficient allocation of the skills and talents of people.
But in some instances the productivity of labor and capital may be so
much higher in one sector or activity, such as heavy industry in the
Soviet Union, that even a top-down process under extractive institutions
that allocates resources toward that sector can generate growth. As we
saw in chapter 3, extractive institutions in Caribbean islands such as
Barbados, Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica could generate relatively high levels
of incomes because they allocated resources to the production of sugar,
a commodity coveted worldwide. The production of sugar based on gangs of
slaves was certainly not “efficient,” and there was no technological
change or creative destruction in these societies, but this did not
prevent them from achieving some amount of growth under extractive
institutions. The situation was similar in the Soviet Union, with
industry playing the role of sugar in the Caribbean. Industrial growth
in the Soviet Union was further facilitated because its technology was
so backward relative to what was available in Europe and the United
States, so large gains could be reaped by reallocating resources to the
industrial sector, even if all this was done inefficiently and by force.
Before 1928 most Russians lived in the countryside. The technology used
by peasants was primitive, and there were few incentives to be
productive. Indeed, the last vestiges of Russian feudalism were
eradicated only shortly before the First World War. There was thus huge
unrealized economic potential from reallocating this labor from
agriculture to industry. Stalinist industrialization was one brutal way
of unlocking this potential. By fiat, Stalin moved these very poorly
used resources into industry, where they could be employed more
productively, even if industry itself was very inefficiently organized
relative to what could have been achieved. In fact, between 1928 and
1960 national income grew at 6 percent a year, probably the most rapid
spurt of economic growth in history up until then. This quick economic
growth was not created by technological change, but by reallocating
labor and by capital accumulation through the creation of new tools and
factories. Growth was so rapid that it took in generations of
Westerners, not just Lincoln Steffens. It took in the Central
Intelligence Agency of the United States. It even took in the Soviet
Union’s own leaders, such as Nikita Khrushchev, who famously boasted in
a speech to Western diplomats in 1956 that “we will bury you 〔the
West〕.” As late as 1977, a leading academic textbook by an English
economist argued that Soviet-style economies were superior to capitalist
ones in terms of economic growth, providing full employment and price
stability and even in producing people with altruistic motivation. Poor
old Western capitalism did better only at providing political freedom.
Indeed, the most widely used university textbook in economics, written
by Nobel Prize–winner Paul Samuelson, repeatedly predicted the coming
economic dominance of the Soviet Union. In the 1961 edition, Samuelson
predicted that Soviet national income would overtake that of the United
States possibly by 1984, but probably by 1997. In the 1980 edition there
was little change in the analysis, though the two dates were delayed to
2002 and 2012. Though the policies of Stalin and subsequent Soviet
leaders could produce rapid economic growth, they could not do so in a
sustained way. By the 1970s, economic growth had all but stopped. The
most important lesson is that extractive institutions cannot generate
sustained technological change for two reasons: the lack of economic
incentives and resistance by the elites. In addition, once all the very
inefficiently used resources had been reallocated to industry, there
were few economic gains to be had by fiat. Then the Soviet system hit a
roadblock, with lack of innovation and poor economic incentives
preventing any further progress. The only area in which the Soviets did
manage to sustain some innovation was through enormous efforts in
military and aerospace technology. As a result they managed to put the
first dog, Leika, and the first man, Yuri Gagarin, in space. They also
left the world the AK-47 as one of their legacies. Gosplan was the
supposedly all-powerful planning agency in charge of the central
planning of the Soviet economy. One of the benefits of the sequence of
five-year plans written and administered by Gosplan was supposed to have
been the long time horizon necessary for rational investment and
innovation. In reality, what got implemented in Soviet industry had
little to do with the five-year plans, which were frequently revised and
rewritten or simply ignored. The development of industry took place on
the basis of commands by Stalin and the Politburo, who changed their
minds frequently and often completely revised their previous decisions.
All plans were labeled “draft” or “preliminary.” Only one copy of a plan
labeled “final”—that for light industry in 1939—has ever come to light.
Stalin himself said in 1937 that “only bureaucrats can think that
planning work ends with the creation of the plan. The creation of the
plan is just the beginning. The real direction of the plan develops only
after the putting together of the plan.” Stalin wanted to maximize his
discretion to reward people or groups who were politically loyal, and
punish those who were not. As for Gosplan, its main role was to provide
Stalin with information so he could better monitor his friends and
enemies. It actually tried to avoid making decisions. If you made a
decision that turned out badly, you might get shot. Better to avoid all
responsibility. An example of what could happen if you took your job too
seriously, rather than successfully second-guessing what the Communist
Party wanted, is provided by the Soviet census of 1937. As the returns
came in, it became clear that they would show a population of about 162
million, far less than the 180 million Stalin had anticipated and indeed
below the figure of 168 million that Stalin himself announced in 1934.
The 1937 census was the first conducted since 1926, and therefore the
first one that followed the mass famines and purges of the early 1930s.
The accurate population numbers reflected this. Stalin’s response was to
have those who organized the census arrested and sent to Siberia or
shot. He ordered another census, which took place in 1939. This time the
organizers got it right; they found that the population was actually 171
million. Stalin understood that in the Soviet economy, people had few
incentives to work hard. A natural response would have been to introduce
such incentives, and sometimes he did—for example, by directing food
supplies to areas where productivity had fallen—to reward improvements.
Moreover, as early as 1931 he gave up on the idea of creating “socialist
men and women” who would work without monetary incentives. In a famous
speech he criticized “equality mongering,” and thereafter not only did
different jobs get paid different wages but also a bonus system was
introduced. It is instructive to understand how this worked. Typically a
firm under central planning had to meet an output target set under the
plan, though such plans were often renegotiated and changed. From the
1930s, workers were paid bonuses if the output levels were attained.
These could be quite high—for instance, as much as 37 percent of the
wage for management or senior engineers. But paying such bonuses created
all sorts of disincentives to technological change. For one thing,
innovation, which took resources away from current production, risked
the output targets not being met and the bonuses not being paid. For
another, output targets were usually based on previous production
levels. This created a huge incentive never to expand output, since this
only meant having to produce more in the future, since future targets
would be “ratcheted up.” Underachievement was always the best way to
meet targets and get the bonus. The fact that bonuses were paid monthly
also kept everyone focused on the present, while innovation is about
making sacrifices today in order to have more tomorrow. Even when
bonuses and incentives were effective in changing behavior, they often
created other problems. Central planning was just not good at replacing
what the great eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith called the
“invisible hand” of the market. When the plan was formulated in tons of
steel sheet, the sheet was made too heavy. When it was formulated in
terms of area of steel sheet, the sheet was made too thin. When the plan
for chandeliers was made in tons, they were so heavy, they could hardly
hang from ceilings. By the 1940s, the leaders of the Soviet Union, even
if not their admirers in the West, were well aware of these perverse
incentives. The Soviet leaders acted as if they were due to technical
problems, which could be fixed. For example, they moved away from paying
bonuses based on output targets to allowing firms to set aside portions
of profits to pay bonuses. But a “profit motive” was no more encouraging
to innovation than one based on output targets. The system of prices
used to calculate profits was almost completely unconnected to the value
of new innovations or technology. Unlike in a market economy, prices in
the Soviet Union were set by the government, and thus bore little
relation to value. To more specifically create incentives for
innovation, the Soviet Union introduced explicit innovation bonuses in
1946. As early as 1918, the principle had been recognized that an
innovator should receive monetary rewards for his innovation, but the
rewards set were small and unrelated to the value of the new technology.
This changed only in 1956, when it was stipulated that the bonus should
be proportional to the productivity of the innovation. However, since
productivity was calculated in terms of economic benefits measured using
the existing system of prices, this was again not much of an incentive
to innovate. One could fill many pages with examples of the perverse
incentives these schemes generated. For example, because the size of the
innovation bonus fund was limited by the wage bill of a firm, this
immediately reduced the incentive to produce or adopt any innovation
that might have economized on labor. Focusing on the different rules and
bonus schemes tends to mask the inherent problems of the system. As long
as political authority and power rested with the Communist Party, it was
impossible to fundamentally change the basic incentives that people
faced, bonuses or no bonuses. Since its inception, the Communist Party
had used not just carrots but also sticks, big sticks, to get its way.
Productivity in the economy was no different. A whole set of laws
created criminal offenses for workers who were perceived to be shirking.
In June 1940, for example, a law made absenteeism, defined as any twenty
minutes unauthorized absence or even idling on the job, a criminal
offense that could be punished by six months’ hard labor and a 25
percent cut in pay. All sorts of similar punishments were introduced,
and were implemented with astonishing frequency. Between 1940 and 1955,
36 million people, about one-third of the adult population, were found
guilty of such offenses. Of these, 15 million were sent to prison and
250,000 were shot. In any year, there would be 1 million adults in
prison for labor violations; this is not to mention the 2.5 million
people Stalin exiled to the gulags of Siberia. Still, it didn’t work.
Though you can move someone to a factory, you cannot force people to
think and have good ideas by threatening to shoot them. Coercion like
this might have generated a high output of sugar in Barbados or Jamaica,
but it could not compensate for the lack of incentives in a modern
industrial economy. The fact that truly effective incentives could not
be introduced in the centrally planned economy was not due to technical
mistakes in the design of the bonus schemes. It was intrinsic to the
whole method by which extractive growth had been achieved. It had been
done by government command, which could solve some basic economic
problems. But stimulating sustained economic growth required that
individuals use their talent and ideas, and this could never be done
with a Soviet-style economic system. The rulers of the Soviet Union
would have had to abandon extractive economic institutions, but such a
move would have jeopardized their political power. Indeed, when Mikhail
Gorbachev started to move away from extractive economic institutions
after 1987, the power of the Communist Party crumbled, and with it, the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>THE SOVIET UNION was able to generate rapid growth even under
extractive institutions because the Bolsheviks built a powerful
centralized state and used it to allocate resources toward industry. But
as in all instances of growth under extractive institutions, this
experience did not feature technological change and was not sustained.
Growth first slowed down and then totally collapsed. Though ephemeral,
this type of growth still illustrates how extractive institutions can
stimulate economic activity. Throughout history most societies have been
ruled by extractive institutions, and those that have managed to impose
some extent of order over the countries have been able to generate some
limited growth—even if none of these extractive societies have managed
to achieve sustained growth. In fact, some of the major turning points
in history are characterized by institutional innovations that cemented
extractive institutions and increased the authority of one group to
impose law and order and benefit from extraction. In the rest of this
chapter, we will first discuss the nature of institutional innovations
that establish some degree of state centralization and enable growth
under extractive institutions. We shall then show how these ideas help
us understand the Neolithic Revolution, the momentous transition to
agriculture, which underpins many aspects of our current civilization.
We will conclude by illustrating, with the example of the Maya
city-states, how growth under extractive institutions is limited not
only because of lack of technological progress but also because it will
encourage infighting from rival groups wishing to take control of the
state and the extraction it generates.</p>
<p>ON THE BANKS OF THE KASAI</p>
<p>One of the great tributaries of the River Congo is the Kasai. Rising
in Angola, it heads north and merges with the Congo northeast of
Kinshasa, the capital of the modern Democratic Republic of Congo. Though
the Democratic Republic of Congo is poor compared with the rest of the
world, there have always been significant differences in the prosperity
of various groups within Congo. The Kasai is the boundary between two of
these. Soon after passing into Congo along the western bank, you’ll find
the Lele people; on the eastern bank are the Bushong (Map 6, this page).
On the face of it there ought to be few differences between these two
groups with regard to their prosperity. They are separated only by a
river, which either can cross by boat. The two different tribes have a
common origin and related languages. In addition, many of the things
they build are similar in style, including their houses, clothes, and
crafts. Yet when the anthropologist Mary Douglas and the historian Jan
Vansina studied these groups in the 1950s, they discovered some
startling differences between them. As Douglas put it: “The Lele are
poor, while the Bushong are rich … Everything that the Lele have or can
do, the Bushong have more and can do better.” Simple explanations for
this inequality are easy to come by. One difference, reminiscent of that
between places in Peru that were or were not subject to the Potosí mita,
is that the Lele produced for subsistence while the Bushong produced for
exchange in the market. Douglas and Vansina also noted that the Lele
used inferior technology. For instance, they did not use nets for
hunting, even though these greatly improve productivity. Douglas argued,
“〔T〕he absence of nets is consistent with a general Lele tendency not
to invest time and labor in long-term equipment.”</p>
<p>There were also important distinctions in agricultural technologies
and organization. The Bushong practiced a sophisticated form of mixed
farming where five crops were planted in succession in a two-year system
of rotation. They grew yams, sweet potatoes, manioc (cassava), and beans
and gathered two and sometimes three maize harvests a year. The Lele had
no such system and managed to reap only one annual harvest of maize.
There were also striking differences in law and order. The Lele were
dispersed into fortified villages, which were constantly in conflict.
Anyone traveling between two or even venturing into the forest to
collect food was liable to be attacked or kidnapped. In the Bushong
country, this rarely, if ever, happened. What lay behind these
differences in the patterns of production, agricultural technology, and
prevalence of order? Obviously it was not geography that induced the
Lele to use inferior hunting and agricultural technology. It was
certainly not ignorance, because they knew about the tools used by the
Bushong. An alternative explanation might be culture; could it be that
the Lele had a culture that did not encourage them to invest in hunting
nets and sturdier and better-built houses? But this does not seem to
have been true, either. As with the people of Kongo, the Lele were very
interested in purchasing guns, and Douglas even remarked that “their
eager purchase of firearms … shows their culture does not restrict them
to inferior techniques when these do not require long-term collaboration
and effort.” So neither a cultural aversion to technology nor ignorance
nor geography does a good job of explaining the greater prosperity of
the Bushong relative to the Lele. The reason for differences between
these two peoples lies in the different political institutions that
emerged in the lands of the Bushong and the Lele. We noted earlier that
the Lele lived in fortified villages that were not part of a unified
political structure. It was different on the other side of the Kasai.
Around 1620 a political revolution took place led by a man called
Shyaam, who forged the Kuba Kingdom, which we saw on Map 6, with the
Bushong at its heart and with himself as king. Prior to this period,
there were probably few differences between the Bushong and the Lele;
the differences emerged as a consequence of the way Shyaam reorganized
society to the east of the river. He built a state and a pyramid of
political institutions. These were not just significantly more
centralized than what came before but also involved highly elaborate
structures. Shyaam and his successors created a bureaucracy to raise
taxes and a legal system and police force to administer the law. Leaders
were checked by councils, which they had to consult with before making
decisions. There was even trial by jury, an apparently unique event in
sub-Saharan Africa prior to European colonialism. Nevertheless, the
centralized state that Shyaam constructed was a tool of extraction and
highly absolutist. Nobody voted for him, and state policy was dictated
from the top, not by popular participation. This political revolution
introducing state centralization and law and order in the Kuba country
in turn led to an economic revolution. Agriculture was reorganized and
new technologies were adopted to increase productivity. The crops that
had previously been the staples were replaced by new, higher-yield ones
from the Americas (in particular, maize, cassava, and chili peppers).
The intense mixed-farming cycle was introduced at this time, and the
amount of food produced per capita doubled. To adopt these crops and
reorganize the agricultural cycle, more hands were needed in the fields.
So the age of marriage was lowered to twenty, which brought men into the
agricultural labor force at a younger age. The contrast with the Lele is
stark. Their men tended to marry at thirty-five and only then worked in
the fields. Until then, they dedicated their lives to fighting and
raiding. The connection between the political and economic revolution
was simple. King Shyaam and those who supported him wanted to extract
taxes and wealth from the Kuba, who had to produce a surplus above what
they consumed themselves. While Shyaam and his men did not introduce
inclusive institutions to the eastern bank of the Kasai, some amount of
economic prosperity is intrinsic to extractive institutions that achieve
some degree of state centralization and impose law and order.
Encouraging economic activity was of course in the interest of Shyaam
and his men, as otherwise there would have been nothing to extract. Just
like Stalin, Shyaam created by command a set of institutions that would
generate the wealth necessary to support this system. Compared to the
utter absence of law and order that reigned on the other bank of the
Kasai, this generated significant economic prosperity—even if much of it
was likely extracted by Shyaam and his elites. But it was necessarily
limited. Just as in the Soviet Union, there was no creative destruction
in the Kuba Kingdom and no technological innovation after this initial
change. This situation was more or less unaltered by the time the
kingdom was first encountered by Belgian colonial officials in the late
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>KING SHYAAM’S ACHIEVEMENT illustrates how some limited degree of
economic success can be achieved through extractive institutions.
Creating such growth requires a centralized state. To centralize the
state, a political revolution is often necessary. Once Shyaam created
this state, he could use its power to reorganize the economy and boost
agricultural productivity, which he could then tax. Why was it that the
Bushong, and not the Lele, had a political revolution? Couldn’t the Lele
have had their own King Shyaam? What Shyaam accomplished was an
institutional innovation not tied in any deterministic way to geography,
culture, or ignorance. The Lele could have had such a revolution and
similarly transformed their institutions, but they didn’t. Perhaps this
is for reasons that we do not understand, because of our limited
knowledge of their society today. Most likely it is because of the
contingent nature of history. The same contingency was probably at work
when some of the societies in the Middle East twelve thousand years ago
embarked upon an even more radical set of institutional innovations
leading to settled societies and then to the domestication of plants and
animals, as we discuss next.</p>
<p>THE LONG SUMMER</p>
<p>About 15,000 BC, the Ice Age came to an end as the Earth’s climate
warmed up. Evidence from the Greenland ice cores suggests that average
temperatures rose by as much as fifteen degrees Celsius in a short span
of time. This warming seems to have coincided with rapid increases in
human populations as the global warming led to expanding animal
populations and much greater availability of wild plants and foods. This
process was put into rapid reverse at about 14,000 BC, by a period of
cooling known as the Younger Dryas, but after 9600 BC, global
temperatures rose again, by seven degrees Celsius in less than a decade,
and have since stayed high. Archaeologist Brian Fagan calls it the Long
Summer. The warming-up of the climate was a huge critical juncture that
formed the background to the Neolithic Revolution, where human societies
made the transition to sedentary life, farming, and herding. This and
the rest of subsequent human history have played out basking in this
Long Summer. There is a fundamental difference between farming and
herding and hunting-gathering. The former is based on the domestication
of plant and animal species, with active intervention in their life
cycles to change genetics to make those species more useful to humans.
Domestication is a technological change that enables humans to produce a
lot more food from the available plants and animals. The domestication
of maize, for example, began when humans gathered teosinte, the wild
crop that was maize’s ancestor. Teosinte cobs are very small, barely a
few centimeters long. They are dwarfed by a cob of modern maize. Yet
gradually, by selecting the larger ears of teosinte, and plants whose
ears did not break but stayed on the stalk to be harvested, humans
created modern maize, a crop that provides far more nourishment from the
same piece of land. The earliest evidence of farming, herding, and the
domestication of plants and animals comes from the Middle East, in
particular from the area known as the Hilly Flanks, which stretches from
the south of modern-day Israel, up through Palestine and the west bank
of the River Jordan, via Syria and into southeastern Turkey, northern
Iraq, and western Iran. Around 9500 BC the first domestic plants, emmer
and two-row barley, were found in Jericho on the west bank of the River
Jordan in Palestine; and emmer, peas, and lentils, at Tell Aswad,
farther north in Syria. Both were sites of the so-called Natufian
culture and both supported large villages; the village of Jericho had a
population of possibly five hundred people by this time. Why did the
first farming villages happen here and not elsewhere? Why was it the
Natufians, and not other peoples, who domesticated peas and lentils?
Were they lucky and just happened to be living where there were many
potential candidates for domestication? While this is true, many other
people were living among these species, but they did not domesticate
them. As we saw in chapter 2 in Maps 4 and 5, research by geneticists
and archaeologists to pin down the distribution of the wild ancestors of
modern domesticated animals and plants reveals that many of these
ancestors were spread over very large areas, millions of square
kilometers. The wild ancestors of domesticated animal species were
spread throughout Eurasia. Though the Hilly Flanks were particularly
well endowed in terms of wild crop species, even they were very far from
unique. It was not that the Natufians lived in an area uniquely endowed
with wild species that made them special. It was that they were
sedentary before they started domesticating plants or animals. One piece
of evidence comes from gazelle teeth, which are composed of cementum, a
bony connective tissue that grows in layers. During the spring and
summer, when cementum’s growth is most rapid, the layers are a different
color from the layers that form in the winter. By taking a slice through
a tooth you can see the color of the last layer created before the
gazelle died. Using this technique, you can determine if the gazelle was
killed in summer or winter. At Natufian sites, one finds gazelles killed
in all seasons, suggesting year-round residence. The village of Abu
Hureyra, on the river Euphrates, is one of the most intensively
researched Natufian settlements. For almost forty years archaeologists
have examined the layers of the village, which provides one of the best
documented examples of sedentary life before and after the transition to
farming. The settlement probably began around 9500 BC, and the
inhabitants continued their hunter-gatherer lifestyle for another five
hundred years before switching to agriculture. Archaeologists estimate
that the population of the village prior to farming was between one
hundred and three hundred. You can think of all sorts of reasons why a
society might find it advantageous to become sedentary. Moving about is
costly; children and old people have to be carried, and it is impossible
to store food for lean times when you are on the move. Moreover, tools
such as grinding stones and sickles were useful for processing wild
foods, but are heavy to carry. There is evidence that even mobile
hunter-gatherers stored food in select locations such as caves. One
attraction of maize is that it stores very well, and this is a key
reason why it became so intensively cultivated throughout the Americas.
The ability to deal more effectively with storage and accumulate food
stocks must have been a key incentive for adopting a sedentary way of
life. While it might be collectively desirable to become sedentary, this
doesn’t mean that it will necessarily happen. A mobile group of
hunter-gatherers would have to agree to do this, or someone would have
to force them. Some archaeologists have suggested that increasing
population density and declining living standards were key factors in
the emergence of sedentary life, forcing mobile people to stay in one
place. Yet the density of Natufian sites is no greater than that of
previous groups, so there does not appear to be evidence of increasing
population density. Skeletal and dental evidence does not suggest
deteriorating health, either. For instance, food shortage tends to
create thin lines in people’s tooth enamel, a condition called
hypoplasia. These lines are in fact less prevalent in Natufian people
than in later farming people. More important is that while sedentary
life had pluses, it also had minuses. Conflict resolution was probably
much harder for sedentary groups, since disagreements could be resolved
less easily by people or groups merely moving away. Once people had
built permanent buildings and had more assets than they could carry,
moving away was a much less attractive option. So villages needed more
effective ways of resolving conflict and more elaborate notions of
property. Decisions would have to be made about who had access to which
piece of land close to the village, or who got to pick fruit from which
stand of trees and fish in which part of the stream. Rules had to be
developed, and the institutions that made and enforced rules had to be
elaborated. In order for sedentary life to emerge, it therefore seems
plausible that hunter-gatherers would have had to be forced to settle
down, and this would have to have been preceded by an institutional
innovation concentrating power in the hands of a group that would become
the political elite, enforce property rights, maintain order, and also
benefit from their status by extracting resources from the rest of
society. In fact, a political revolution similar to that initiated by
King Shyaam, even if on a smaller scale, is likely to have been the
breakthrough that led to sedentary life. The archaeological evidence
indeed suggests that the Natufians developed a complex society
characterized by hierarchy, order, and inequality—beginnings of what we
would recognize as extractive institutions—a long time before they
became farmers. One compelling piece of evidence for such hierarchy and
inequality comes from Natufian graves. Some people were buried with
large amounts of obsidian and dentalium shells, which came from the
Mediterranean coast near Mount Carmel. Other types of ornamentation
include necklaces, garters, and bracelets, which were made out of canine
teeth and deer phalanges as well as shells. Other people were buried
without any of these things. Shells and also obsidian were traded, and
control of this trade was quite likely a source of power accumulation
and inequality. Further evidence of economic and political inequality
comes from the Natufian site of Ain Mallaha, just north of the Sea of
Galilee. Amid a group of about fifty round huts and many pits, clearly
used for storage, there is a large, intensively plastered building close
to a cleared central place. This building was almost certainly the house
of a chief. Among the burials at the site, some are much more elaborate,
and there is also evidence of a skull cult, possibly indicating ancestor
worship. Such cults are widespread in Natufian sites, particularly
Jericho. The preponderance of evidence from Natufian sites suggests that
these were probably already societies with elaborate institutions
determining inheritance of elite status. They engaged in trade with
distant places and had nascent forms of religion and political
hierarchies. The emergence of political elites most likely created the
transition first to sedentary life and then to farming. As the Natufian
sites show, sedentary life did not necessarily mean farming and herding.
People could settle down but still make their living by hunting and
gathering. After all, the Long Summer made wild crops more bountiful,
and hunting and gathering was likely to have been more attractive. Most
people may have been quite satisfied with a subsistence life based on
hunting and gathering that did not require a lot of effort. Even
technological innovation doesn’t necessarily lead to increased
agricultural production. In fact, it is known that a major technological
innovation, the introduction of the steel axe among the group of
Australian Aboriginal peoples known as Yir Yoront, led not to more
intense production but to more sleeping, because it allowed subsistence
requirements to be met more easily, with little incentive to work for
more. The traditional, geography-based explanation for the Neolithic
Revolution—the centerpiece of Jared Diamond’s argument, which we
discussed in chapter 2—is that it was driven by the fortuitous
availability of many plant and animal species that could easily be
domesticated. This made farming and herding attractive and induced
sedentary life. After societies became sedentary and started farming,
they began to develop political hierarchy, religion, and significantly
more complex institutions. Though widely accepted, the evidence from the
Natufians suggests that this traditional explanation puts the cart
before the horse. Institutional changes occurred in societies quite a
while before they made the transition to farming and were probably the
cause both of the move to sedentarism, which reinforced the
institutional changes, and subsequently of the Neolithic Revolution.
This pattern is suggested not only by the evidence from the Hilly
Flanks, which is the area most intensively studied, but also by the
preponderance of evidence from the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and
East Asia. Certainly the transition to farming led to greater
agricultural productivity and enabled a significant expansion of
population. For instance, in sites such as Jericho and Abu Hureyra, one
sees that the early farming village was much larger than the prefarming
one. In general, villages grew by between two and six times when the
transition took place. Moreover, many of the consequences that people
have traditionally argued as having flowed from this transition
undoubtedly happened. There was greater occupational specialization and
more rapid technological progress, and probably the development of more
complex and possibly less egalitarian political institutions. But
whether this happened in a particular place was not determined by the
availability of plant and animal species. Instead, it was a consequence
of the society’s having experienced the types of institutional, social,
and political innovations that would have allowed sedentary life and
then farming to emerge. Though the Long Summer and the presence of crop
and animal species allowed this to happen, it did not determine where or
when exactly, after the climate had warmed up, it would happen. Rather,
this was determined by the interaction of a critical juncture, the Long
Summer, with small but important institutional differences that
mattered. As the climate warmed up, some societies, such as the
Natufians, developed elements of centralized institutions and hierarchy,
though these were on a very small scale relative to those of modern
nation-states. Like the Bushong under Shyaam, societies reorganized to
take advantage of the greater opportunities created by the glut of wild
plants and animals, and it was no doubt the political elites who were
the main beneficiaries of these new opportunities and of the political
centralization process. Other places that had only slightly different
institutions did not permit their political elites to take similar
advantage of this juncture and lagged behind the process of political
centralization and the creation of settled, agricultural, and more
complex societies. This paved the way to a subsequent divergence of
exactly the type we have seen before. Once these differences emerged,
they spread to some places but not to others. For example, farming
spread into Europe from the Middle East starting around 6500 BC, mostly
as a consequence of the migration of farmers. In Europe, institutions
drifted away from parts of the world, such as Africa, where initial
institutions had been different and where the innovations set in motion
by the Long Summer in the Middle East happened only much later, and even
then in a different form.</p>
<p>THE INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS of the Natufians, though they did most
likely underpin the Neolithic Revolution, did not leave a simple legacy
in world history and did not lead inexorably to the long-run prosperity
of their homelands in modern Israel, Palestine, and Syria. Syria and
Palestine are relatively poor parts of the modern world, and the
prosperity of Israel was largely imported by the settlement of Jewish
people after the Second World War and their high levels of education and
easy access to advanced technologies. The early growth of the Natufians
did not become sustained for the same reason that Soviet growth fizzled
out. Though highly significant, even revolutionary for its time, this
was growth under extractive institutions. For the Natufian society it
was also likely that this type of growth created deep conflicts over who
would control institutions and the extraction they enabled. For every
elite benefiting from extraction there is a non-elite who would love to
replace him. Sometimes infighting simply replaces one elite with
another. Sometimes it destroys the whole extractive society, unleashing
a process of state and societal collapse, as the spectacular
civilization that Maya city-states built more than one thousand years
ago experienced.</p>
<p>THE UNSTABLE EXTRACTION</p>
<p>Farming emerged independently in several places around the world. In
what is now modern Mexico, societies formed that established states and
settlements, and transitioned to agriculture. As with the Natufians in
the Middle East, they also achieved some degree of economic growth. The
Maya city-states in the area of southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and
Western Honduras in fact built a fairly sophisticated civilization under
their own brand of extractive institutions. The Maya experience
illustrates not only the possibility of growth under extractive
institutions but also another fundamental limit to this type of growth:
the political instability that emerges and ultimately leads to collapse
of both society and state as different groups and people fight to become
the extractors. Maya cities first began to develop around 500 BC. These
early cities eventually failed, sometime in the first century AD. A new
political model then emerged, creating the foundation for the Classic
Era, between AD 250 and 900. This period marked the full flowering of
Maya culture and civilization. But this more sophisticated civilization
would also collapse in the course of the next six hundred years. By the
time the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the early sixteenth century,
the great temples and palaces of such Maya sites as Tikal, Palenque, and
Calakmul had receded into the forest, not to be rediscovered until the
nineteenth century. The Maya cities never unified into an empire, though
some cities were subservient to others, and they often appear to have
cooperated, particularly in warfare. The main connection between the
region’s city-states, fifty of which we can recognize by their own
glyphs, is that their people spoke around thirty-one different but
closely related Mayan languages. The Mayas developed a writing system,
and there are at least fifteen thousand remaining inscriptions
describing many aspects of elite life, culture, and religion. They also
had a sophisticated calendar for recording dates known as the Long
Count. It was very much like our own calendar in that it counted the
unfolding of years from a fixed date and was used by all Maya cities.
The Long Count began in 3114 BC, though we do not know what significance
the Mayas attached to this date, which long precedes the emergence of
anything resembling Maya society. The Mayas were skilled builders who
independently invented cement. Their buildings and their inscriptions
provide vital information on the trajectories of the Maya cities, as
they often recorded events dated according to the Long Count. Looking
across all the Maya cities, archaeologists can thus count how many
buildings were finished in particular years. Around AD 500 there are few
dated monuments. For example, the Long Count date corresponding to AD
514 recorded just ten. There was then a steady increase, reaching twenty
by AD 672 and forty by the middle of the eighth century. After this the
number of dated monuments collapses. By the ninth century, it is down to
ten per year, and by the tenth century, to zero. These dated
inscriptions give us a clear picture of the expansion of Maya cities and
their subsequent contraction from the late eighth century. This analysis
of dates can be complemented by examining the lists of kings the Mayas
recorded. At the Maya city of Copán, now in western Honduras, there is a
famous monument known as Altar Q. Altar Q records the names of all the
kings, starting from the founder of the dynasty K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’,
or “King Green-Sun First Quetzal Macaw,” named after not just the sun
but also two of the exotic birds of the Central American forest whose
feathers were greatly valued by the Mayas. K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’ came to
power in Copán in AD 426, which we know from the Long Count date on
Altar Q. He founded a dynasty that would reign for four hundred years.
Some of K’inich Yax’s successors had equally graphic names. The
thirteenth ruler’s glyph translates as “18 Rabbit,” who was followed by
“Smoke Monkey” and then “Smoke Shell,” who died in AD 763. The last name
on the altar is King Yax Pasaj Chan Yoaat, or “First Dawned Sky
Lightening God,” who was the sixteenth ruler of this line and assumed
the throne at the death of Smoke Shell. After him we know of only one
more king, Ukit Took (“Patron of Flint”), from a fragment of an altar.
After Yax Pasaj, the buildings and inscriptions stopped, and it seems
that the dynasty was shortly overthrown. Ukit Took was probably not even
the real claimant to the throne but a pretender. There is a final way of
looking at this evidence at Copán, one developed by the archaeologists
AnnCorinne Freter, Nancy Gonlin, and David Webster. These researchers
mapped the rise and fall of Copán by examining the spread of the
settlement in the Copán Valley over a period of 850 years, from AD 400
to AD 1250, using a technique called obsidian hydration, which
calculates the water content of obsidian on the date it was mined. Once
mined, the water content falls at a known rate, allowing archaeologists
to calculate the date a piece of obsidian was mined. Freter, Gonlin, and
Webster were then able to map where pieces of dated obsidian were found
in the Copán Valley and trace how the city expanded and then contracted.
Since it is possible to make a reasonable guess about the number of
houses and buildings in a particular area, the total population of the
city can be estimated. In the period AD 400–449, the population was
negligible, estimated at about six hundred people. It rose steadily to a
peak of twenty-eight thousand in AD 750–799. Though this does not appear
large by contemporary urban standards, it was massive for that period;
these numbers imply that in this period, Copán had a larger population
than London or Paris. Other Maya cities, such as Tikal and Calakmul,
were undoubtedly much larger. In line with the evidence from the Long
Count dates, AD 800 was the population peak for Copán. After this it
began to decline, and by AD 900 it had fallen to around fifteen thousand
people. From there the fall continued, and by AD 1200 the population had
returned to what it was eight hundred years previously. The basis for
the economic development of the Maya Classical Era was the same as that
for the Bushong and the Natufians: the creation of extractive
institutions with some degree of state centralization. These
institutions had several key elements. Around AD 100, in the city of
Tikal in Guatemala, there emerged a new type of dynastic kingdom. A
ruling class based on the ajaw (lord or ruler) took root with a king
called the k’uhul ajaw (divine lord) and, underneath him, a hierarchy of
aristocrats. The divine lord organized the society with the cooperation
of these elites and also communicated with the gods. As far as we know,
this new set of political institutions did not allow for any sort of
popular participation, but it did bring stability. The k’uhul ajaw
raised tribute from farmers and organized labor to build the great
monuments, and the coalescence of these institutions created the basis
for an impressive economic expansion. The Maya’s economy was based on
extensive occupational specialization, with skilled potters, weavers,
woodworkers, and tool and ornament makers. They also traded obsidian,
jaguar pelts, marine shells, cacao, salt, and feathers among themselves
and other polities over long distances in Mexico. They probably had
money, too, and like the Aztecs, used cacao beans for currency. The way
in which the Maya Classical Era was founded on the creation of
extractive political institutions was very similar to the situation
among the Bushong, with Yax Ehb’ Xook at Tikal playing a role similar to
that of King Shyaam. The new political institutions led to a significant
increase in economic prosperity, much of which was then extracted by the
new elite based around the k’uhul ajaw. Once this system had
consolidated, by around AD 300, there was little further technological
change, however. Though there is some evidence of improved irrigation
and water management techniques, agricultural technology was rudimentary
and appears not to have changed. Building and artistic techniques became
much more sophisticated over time, but in total there was little
innovation. There was no creative destruction. But there were other
forms of destruction as the wealth that the extractive institutions
created for the k’uhul ajaw and the Maya elite led to constant warfare,
which worsened over time. The sequence of conflicts is recorded in the
Maya inscriptions, with special glyphs indicating that a war took place
at a particular date in the Long Count. The planet Venus was the
celestial patron of war, and the Mayas regarded some phases of the
planet’s orbit as particularly auspicious for waging war. The glyph that
indicated warfare, known as “star wars” by archaeologists, shows a star
showering the earth with a liquid that could be water or blood. The
inscriptions also reveal patterns of alliance and competition. There
were long contests for power between the larger states, such as Tikal,
Calakmul, Copán, and Palenque, and these subjugated smaller states into
a vassal status. Evidence for this comes from glyphs marking royal
accessions. During this period, they start indicating that the smaller
states were now being dominated by another, outside ruler. Map 10 (this
page) shows the main Maya cities and the various patterns of contact
between them as reconstructed by the archaeologists Nikolai Grube and
Simon Martin. These patterns indicate that though the large cities such
as Calakmul, Dos Pilas, Piedras Negras, and Yaxchilan had extensive
diplomatic contacts, some were often dominated by others and they also
fought each other. The overwhelming fact about the Maya collapse is that
it coincides with the overthrow of the political model based on the
k’uhul ajaw. We saw in Copán that after Yax Pasaj’s death in AD 810
there were no more kings. At around this time the royal palaces were
abandoned. Twenty miles to the north of Copán, in the city of Quiriguá,
the last king, Jade Sky, ascended to the throne between AD 795 and 800.
The last dated monument is from AD 810 by the Long Count, the same year
that Yax Pasaj died. The city was abandoned soon after. Throughout the
Maya area the story is the same; the political institutions that had
provided the context for the expansion of trade, agriculture, and
population vanished. Royal courts did not function, monuments and
temples were not carved, and palaces were emptied. As political and
social institutions unraveled, reversing the process of state
centralization, the economy contracted and the population fell. In some
cases the major centers collapsed from widespread violence. The
Petexbatun region of Guatemala—where the great temples were subsequently
pulled down and the stone used to build extensive defensive
walls—provides one vivid example. As we’ll see in the next chapter, it
was very similar to what happened in the later Roman Empire. Later, even
in places such as Copán, where there are fewer signs of violence at the
time of the collapse, many monuments were defaced or destroyed. In some
places the elite remained even after the initial overthrow of the k’uhul
ajaw. In Copán there is evidence of the elite continuing to erect new
buildings for at least another two hundred years before they also
disappeared. Elsewhere elites seem to have gone at the same time as the
divine lord. Existing archaeological evidence does not allow us to reach
a definitive conclusion about why the k’uhul ajaw and elites surrounding
him were overthrown and the institutions that had created the Maya
Classical Era collapsed. We know this took place in the context of
intensified inter-city warfare, and it seems likely that opposition and
rebellion within the cities, perhaps led by different factions of the
elite, overthrew the institution. Though the extractive institutions
that the Mayas created produced sufficient wealth for the cities to
flourish and the elite to become wealthy and generate great art and
monumental buildings, the system was not stable. The extractive
institutions upon which this narrow elite ruled created extensive
inequality, and thus the potential for infighting between those who
could benefit from the wealth extracted from the people. This conflict
ultimately led to the undoing of the Maya civilization.</p>
<p>WHAT GOES WRONG?</p>
<p>Extractive institutions are so common in history because they have a
powerful logic: they can generate some limited prosperity while at the
same time distributing it into the hands of a small elite. For this
growth to happen, there must be political centralization. Once this is
in place, the state—or the elite controlling the state—typically has
incentives to invest and generate wealth, encourage others to invest so
that the state can extract resources from them, and even mimic some of
the processes that would normally be set in motion by inclusive economic
institutions and markets. In the Caribbean plantation economies,
extractive institutions took the form of the elite using coercion to
force slaves to produce sugar. In the Soviet Union, they took the form
of the Communist Party reallocating resources from agriculture to
industry and structuring some sort of incentives for managers and
workers. As we have seen, such incentives were undermined by the nature
of the system. The potential for creating extractive growth gives an
impetus to political centralization and is the reason why King Shyaam
wished to create the Kuba Kingdom, and likely accounts for why the
Natufians in the Middle East set up a primitive form of law and order,
hierarchy, and extractive institutions that would ultimately lead to the
Neolithic Revolution. Similar processes also likely underpinned the
emergence of settled societies and the transition to agriculture in the
Americas, and can be seen in the sophisticated civilization that the
Mayas built on foundations laid by highly extractive institutions
coercing many for the benefit of their narrow elites. The growth
generated by extractive institutions is very different in nature from
growth created under inclusive institutions, however. Most important, it
is not sustainable. By their very nature, extractive institutions do not
foster creative destruction and generate at best only a limited amount
of technological progress. The growth they engender thus lasts for only
so long. The Soviet experience gives a vivid illustration of this limit.
Soviet Russia generated rapid growth as it caught up rapidly with some
of the advanced technologies in the world, and resources were allocated
out of the highly inefficient agricultural sector and into industry. But
ultimately the incentives faced in every sector, from agriculture to
industry, could not stimulate technological progress. This took place in
only a few pockets where resources were being poured and where
innovation was strongly rewarded because of its role in the competition
with the West. Soviet growth, however rapid it was, was bound to be
relatively short lived, and it was already running out of steam by the
1970s. Lack of creative destruction and innovation is not the only
reason why there are severe limits to growth under extractive
institutions. The history of the Maya city-states illustrates a more
ominous and, alas, more common end, again implied by the internal logic
of extractive institutions. As these institutions create significant
gains for the elite, there will be strong incentives for others to fight
to replace the current elite. Infighting and instability are thus
inherent features of extractive institutions, and they not only create
further inefficiencies but also often reverse any political
centralization, sometimes even leading to the total breakdown of law and
order and descent into chaos, as the Maya city-states experienced
following their relative success during their Classical Era. Though
inherently limited, growth under extractive institutions may nonetheless
appear spectacular when it’s in motion. Many in the Soviet Union and
many more in the Western world were awestruck by Soviet growth in the
1920s, ’30s, ’40s, ’50s, ’60s, and even as late as the ’70s, in the same
way that they are mesmerized by the breakneck pace of economic growth in
China today. But as we will discuss in greater detail in chapter 15,
China under the rule of the Communist Party is another example of
society experiencing growth under extractive institutions and is
similarly unlikely to generate sustained growth unless it undergoes a
fundamental political transformation toward inclusive political
institutions.</p>
