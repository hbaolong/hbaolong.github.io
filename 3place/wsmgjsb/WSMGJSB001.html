<p>PRAISE FOR Why Nations Fail</p>
<p>“Acemoglu and Robinson have made an important contribution to the
debate as to why similar-looking nations differ so greatly in their
economic and political development. Through a broad multiplicity of
historical examples, they show how institutional developments, sometimes
based on very accidental circumstances, have had enormous consequences.
The openness of a society, its willingness to permit creative
destruction, and the rule of law appear to be decisive for economic
development.”</p>
<p>—Kenneth J. Arrow, Nobel laureate in economics, 1972</p>
<p>“The authors convincingly show that countries escape poverty only
when they have appropriate economic institutions, especially private
property and competition. More originally, they argue countries are more
likely to develop the right institutions when they have an open
pluralistic political system with competition for political office, a
widespread electorate, and openness to new political leaders. This
intimate connection between political and economic institutions is the
heart of their major contribution, and has resulted in a study of great
vitality on one of the crucial questions in economics and political
economy.”</p>
<p>—Gary S. Becker, Nobel laureate in economics, 1992</p>
<p>“This important and insightful book, packed with historical examples,
makes the case that inclusive political institutions in support of
inclusive economic institutions is key to sustained prosperity. The book
reviews how some good regimes got launched and then had a virtuous
spiral, while bad regimes remain in a vicious spiral. This is important
analysis not to be missed.”</p>
<p>—Peter Diamond, Nobel laureate in economics, 2010</p>
<p>“For those who think that a nation’s economic fate is determined by
geography or culture, Daron Acemoglu and Jim Robinson have bad news.
It’s manmade institutions, not the lay of the land or the faith of our
forefathers, that determine whether a country is rich or poor.
Synthesizing brilliantly the work of theorists from Adam Smith to
Douglass North with more recent empirical research by economic
historians, Acemoglu and Robinson have produced a compelling and highly
readable book.”</p>
<p>—Niall Ferguson, author of The Ascent of Money</p>
<p>“Acemoglu and Robinson—two of the world’s leading experts on
development—reveal why it is not geography, disease, or culture that
explain why some nations are rich and some poor, but rather a matter of
institutions and politics. This highly accessible book provides welcome
insight to specialists and general readers alike.”</p>
<p>—Francis Fukuyama, author of The End of History and the Last Man and
The Origins of Political Order</p>
<p>“A brilliant and uplifting book—yet also a deeply disturbing wake-up
call. Acemoglu and Robinson lay out a convincing theory of almost
everything to do with economic development. Countries rise when they put
in place the right pro-growth political institutions and they fail—often
spectacularly—when those institutions ossify or fail to adapt. Powerful
people always and everywhere seek to grab complete control over
government, undermining broader social progress for their own greed.
Keep those people in check with effective democracy or watch your nation
fail.”</p>
<p>—Simon Johnson, coauthor of 13 Bankers and professor at MIT Sloan</p>
<p>“Two of the world’s best and most erudite economists turn to the
hardest issue of all: why are some nations poor and others rich? Written
with a deep knowledge of economics and political history, this is
perhaps the most powerful statement made to date that ‘institutions
matter.’ A provocative, instructive, yet thoroughly enthralling
book.”</p>
<p>—Joel Mokyr, Robert H. Strotz Professor of Arts and Sciences and
Professor of Economics and History, Northwestern University</p>
<p>“In this delightfully readable romp through four hundred years of
history, two of the giants of contemporary social science bring us an
inspiring and important message: it is freedom that makes the world
rich. Let tyrants everywhere tremble!”</p>
<p>—Ian Morris, Stanford University, author of Why the West Rules—for
Now</p>
<p>“Imagine sitting around a table listening to Jared Diamond, Joseph
Schumpeter, and James Madison reflect on more than two thousand years of
political and economic history. Imagine that they weave their ideas into
a coherent theoretical framework based on limiting extraction, promoting
creative destruction, and creating strong political institutions that
share power, and you begin to see the contribution of this brilliant and
engagingly written book.”</p>
<p>—Scott E. Page, University of Michigan and Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p>“In this stunningly wide-ranging book, Acemoglu and Robinson ask a
simple but vital question, why do some nations become rich and others
remain poor? Their answer is also simple—because some polities develop
more inclusive political institutions. What is remarkable about the book
is the crispness and clarity of the writing, the elegance of the
argument, and the remarkable richness of historical detail. This book is
a must-read at a moment when governments across the Western world must
come up with the political will to deal with a debt crisis of unusual
proportions.”</p>
<p>—Steven Pincus, Bradford Durfee Professor of History and
International and Area Studies, Yale University</p>
<p>“It’s the politics, stupid! That is Acemoglu and Robinson’s simple
yet compelling explanation for why so many countries fail to develop.
From the absolutism of the Stuarts to the antebellum South, from Sierra
Leone to Colombia, this magisterial work shows how powerful elites rig
the rules to benefit themselves at the expense of the many. Charting a
careful course between the pessimists and optimists, the authors
demonstrate history and geography need not be destiny. But they also
document how sensible economic ideas and policies often achieve little
in the absence of fundamental political change.”</p>
<p>—Dani Rodrik, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University</p>
<p>“This is not only a fascinating and interesting book: it is a really
important one. The highly original research that Professors Acemoglu and
Robinson have done, and continue to do, on how economic forces,
politics, and policy choices evolve together and constrain each other,
and how institutions affect that evolution, is essential to
understanding the successes and failures of societies and nations. And
here, in this book, these insights come in a highly accessible, indeed
riveting form. Those who pick this book up and start reading will have
trouble putting it down.”</p>
<p>—Michael Spence, Nobel laureate in economics, 2001</p>
<p>“This fascinating and readable book centers on the complex joint
evolution of political and economic institutions, in good directions and
bad. It strikes a delicate balance between the logic of political and
economic behavior and the shifts in direction created by contingent
historical events, large and small, at ‘critical junctures.’ Acemoglu
and Robinson provide an enormous range of historical examples to show
how such shifts can tilt toward favorable institutions, progressive
innovation, and economic success or toward repressive institutions and
eventual decay or stagnation. Somehow they can generate both excitement
and reflection.”</p>

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>THIS BOOK IS about the huge differences in incomes and standards of
living that separate the rich countries of the world, such as the United
States, Great Britain, and Germany, from the poor, such as those in
sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and South Asia. As we write this
preface, North Africa and the Middle East have been shaken by the “Arab
Spring” started by the so-called Jasmine Revolution, which was initially
ignited by public outrage over the self-immolation of a street vendor,
Mohamed Bouazizi, on December 17, 2010. By January 14, 2011, President
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who had ruled Tunisia since 1987, had stepped
down, but far from abating, the revolutionary fervor against the rule of
privileged elites in Tunisia was getting stronger and had already spread
to the rest of the Middle East. Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt with
a tight grip for almost thirty years, was ousted on February 11, 2011.
The fates of the regimes in Bahrain, Libya, Syria, and Yemen are unknown
as we complete this preface. The roots of discontent in these countries
lie in their poverty. The average Egyptian has an income level of around
12 percent of the average citizen of the United States and can expect to
live ten fewer years; 20 percent of the population is in dire poverty.
Though these differences are significant, they are actually quite small
compared with those between the United States and the poorest countries
in the world, such as North Korea, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe, where
well over half the population lives in poverty. Why is Egypt so much
poorer than the United States? What are the constraints that keep
Egyptians from becoming more prosperous? Is the poverty of Egypt
immutable, or can it be eradicated? A natural way to start thinking
about this is to look at what the Egyptians themselves are saying about
the problems they face and why they rose up against the Mubarak regime.
Noha Hamed, twenty-four, a worker at an advertising agency in Cairo,
made her views clear as she demonstrated in Tahrir Square: “We are
suffering from corruption, oppression and bad education. We are living
amid a corrupt system which has to change.” Another in the square,
Mosaab El Shami, twenty, a pharmacy student, concurred: “I hope that by
the end of this year we will have an elected government and that
universal freedoms are applied and that we put an end to the corruption
that has taken over this country.” The protestors in Tahrir Square spoke
with one voice about the corruption of the government, its inability to
deliver public services, and the lack of equality of opportunity in
their country. They particularly complained about repression and the
absence of political rights. As Mohamed ElBaradei, former director of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote on Twitter on January 13,
2011, “Tunisia: repression + absence of social justice + denial of
channels for peaceful change = a ticking bomb.” Egyptians and Tunisians
both saw their economic problems as being fundamentally caused by their
lack of political rights. When the protestors started to formulate their
demands more systematically, the first twelve immediate demands posted
by Wael Khalil, the software engineer and blogger who emerged as one of
the leaders of the Egyptian protest movement, were all focused on
political change. Issues such as raising the minimum wage appeared only
among the transitional demands that were to be implemented later. To
Egyptians, the things that have held them back include an ineffective
and corrupt state and a society where they cannot use their talent,
ambition, ingenuity, and what education they can get. But they also
recognize that the roots of these problems are political. All the
economic impediments they face stem from the way political power in
Egypt is exercised and monopolized by a narrow elite. This, they
understand, is the first thing that has to change. Yet, in believing
this, the protestors of Tahrir Square have sharply diverged from the
conventional wisdom on this topic. When they reason about why a country
such as Egypt is poor, most academics and commentators emphasize
completely different factors. Some stress that Egypt’s poverty is
determined primarily by its geography, by the fact that the country is
mostly a desert and lacks adequate rainfall, and that its soils and
climate do not allow productive agriculture. Others instead point to
cultural attributes of Egyptians that are supposedly inimical to
economic development and prosperity. Egyptians, they argue, lack the
same sort of work ethic and cultural traits that have allowed others to
prosper, and instead have accepted Islamic beliefs that are inconsistent
with economic success. A third approach, the one dominant among
economists and policy pundits, is based on the notion that the rulers of
Egypt simply don’t know what is needed to make their country prosperous,
and have followed incorrect policies and strategies in the past. If
these rulers would only get the right advice from the right advisers,
the thinking goes, prosperity would follow. To these academics and
pundits, the fact that Egypt has been ruled by narrow elites feathering
their nests at the expense of society seems irrelevant to understanding
the country’s economic problems. In this book we’ll argue that the
Egyptians in Tahrir Square, not most academics and commentators, have
the right idea. In fact, Egypt is poor precisely because it has been
ruled by a narrow elite that have organized society for their own
benefit at the expense of the vast mass of people. Political power has
been narrowly concentrated, and has been used to create great wealth for
those who possess it, such as the 0 billion fortune apparently
accumulated by ex-president Mubarak. The losers have been the Egyptian
people, as they only too well understand. We’ll show that this
interpretation of Egyptian poverty, the people’s interpretation, turns
out to provide a general explanation for why poor countries are poor.
Whether it is North Korea, Sierra Leone, or Zimbabwe, we’ll show that
poor countries are poor for the same reason that Egypt is poor.
Countries such as Great Britain and the United States became rich
because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and
created a society where political rights were much more broadly
distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to
citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of
economic opportunities. We’ll show that to understand why there is such
inequality in the world today we have to delve into the past and study
the historical dynamics of societies. We’ll see that the reason that
Britain is richer than Egypt is because in 1688, Britain (or England, to
be exact) had a revolution that transformed the politics and thus the
economics of the nation. People fought for and won more political
rights, and they used them to expand their economic opportunities. The
result was a fundamentally different political and economic trajectory,
culminating in the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution and
the technologies it unleashed didn’t spread to Egypt, as that country
was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, which treated Egypt in
rather the same way as the Mubarak family later did. Ottoman rule in
Egypt was overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798, but the country then
fell under the control of British colonialism, which had as little
interest as the Ottomans in promoting Egypt’s prosperity. Though the
Egyptians shook off the Ottoman and British empires and, in 1952,
overthrew their monarchy, these were not revolutions like that of 1688
in England, and rather than fundamentally transforming politics in
Egypt, they brought to power another elite as disinterested in achieving
prosperity for ordinary Egyptians as the Ottoman and British had been.
In consequence, the basic structure of society did not change, and Egypt
stayed poor. In this book we’ll study how these patterns reproduce
themselves over time and why sometimes they are altered, as they were in
England in 1688 and in France with the revolution of 1789. This will
help us to understand if the situation in Egypt has changed today and
whether the revolution that overthrew Mubarak will lead to a new set of
institutions capable of bringing prosperity to ordinary Egyptians. Egypt
has had revolutions in the past that did not change things, because
those who mounted the revolutions simply took over the reins from those
they’d deposed and re-created a similar system. It is indeed difficult
for ordinary citizens to acquire real political power and change the way
their society works. But it is possible, and we’ll see how this happened
in England, France, and the United States, and also in Japan, Botswana,
and Brazil. Fundamentally it is a political transformation of this sort
that is required for a poor society to become rich. There is evidence
that this may be happening in Egypt. Reda Metwaly, another protestor in
Tahrir Square, argued, “Now you see Muslims and Christians together, now
you see old and young together, all wanting the same thing.” We’ll see
that such a broad movement in society was a key part of what happened in
these other political transformations. If we understand when and why
such transitions occur, we will be in a better position to evaluate when
we expect such movements to fail as they have often done in the past and
when we may hope that they will succeed and improve the lives of
millions.</p>
