<h4 id="chapter-three">CHAPTER THREE</h4>
<p>THE ADVANCE GUARD</p>
<p>I’ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from
Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get out
of here.</p>
<p>Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment the
moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed the first
to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His owl,
Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced
the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain
too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness.
His back ached from carrying Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head
where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully.</p>
<p>Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding
his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty,
star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get
him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then
suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and
still no one was telling him what was going on.</p>
<p>And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had echoed so
horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?</p>
<p>Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was everyone
treating him like some naughty kid? Don’t do any more magic, stay in the
house. . . .</p>
<p>He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving
his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal
with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.</p>
<p>Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a
soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.</p>
<p>“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her
cage. “You can put that down, I’ve got work for you!”</p>
<p>Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over the
dead frog clamped in her beak.</p>
<p>“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of
parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg.
“Take these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back
here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve written
decent-length answers if you’ve got to. Understand?”</p>
<p>Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog.</p>
<p>“Get going, then,” said Harry.</p>
<p>She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, Harry threw himself
down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In
addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he’d
been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number
four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came back with
Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers.</p>
<p>They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ignore
a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters
full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the Burrow. And
with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further
thought.</p>
<p>But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his
bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon
had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching
he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have
interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise the
Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t see the point of
forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except
perhaps making him so angry he’d perform more illegal magic.</p>
<p>So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with
restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which
he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving
him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that he could
lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching
with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.</p>
<p>What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand
was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not
return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that he knew the
other world, the one to which he really belonged. . . . Was it possible
that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house, as Sirius had
suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the
Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone, given that he
was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided
for him; had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been
severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought
occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.</p>
<p>On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry was lying in one
of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind
quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly
around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression
of enormous smugness.</p>
<p>“We’re going out,” he said.</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our
possessions.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“You are not to steal food from the fridge.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“I am going to lock your door.”</p>
<p>“You do that.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of
argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him.
Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s footsteps
walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the
slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable
sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.</p>
<p>Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made
no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could not
even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. The room
grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds
through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed
moment when Hedwig returned.</p>
<p>The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry lay
there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.</p>
<p>And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen
below.</p>
<p>He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be
back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their
car.</p>
<p>There was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.</p>
<p>Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split
second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices
down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not
troubling to do so.</p>
<p>He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing his
bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he jumped as the
lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.</p>
<p>Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark
upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came.
He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of his
room to the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing in
the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing
through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could
see, looking up at him.</p>
<p>“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a
low, growling voice.</p>
<p>Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he
did not lower his wand.</p>
<p>“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’” growled the voice, “never
got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you
properly.”</p>
<p>Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor
did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had recently
spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody’s company
only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an impostor; an
impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked.
But before he could make a decision about what to do next, a second,
slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t heard
it for more than a year.</p>
<p>“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?”</p>
<p>“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one
completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “Lumos.”</p>
<p>A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry
blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs,
gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better
look.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin
looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry had
said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than
ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile
back through his shock.</p>
<p>“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the witch who was
holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had a
pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that
was a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard standing
farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in
his ear. “He looks exactly like James.”</p>
<p>“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the
back. “Lily’s eyes.”</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk
missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his
mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the other
large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that could see through
walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.</p>
<p>“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice
lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to
ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought
any Veritaserum?”</p>
<p>“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin.</p>
<p>“A stag,” said Harry nervously.</p>
<p>“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.</p>
<p>Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring
at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he
came.</p>
<p>“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What if it ignited?
Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!”</p>
<p>“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet-haired woman asked
Mad-Eye interestedly.</p>
<p>“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!”
growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers about it
anymore . . .” He stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw that,” he
added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s.</p>
<p>“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely.</p>
<p>“F-fine . . .”</p>
<p>Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing,
not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and
suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the
house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He glanced at the
people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him. He felt
very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four
days.</p>
<p>“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .” he
mumbled.</p>
<p>“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me that lured them
out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d been
short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
They’re heading off to the prize-giving right now. . . . Or they think
they are.”</p>
<p>Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face when he realized
there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.</p>
<p>“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?”</p>
<p>“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for the
all-clear.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked hopefully.</p>
<p>“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the kitchen;
the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously.
“Too risky. We’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable. It’s taken
a while . . .”</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a
hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the
Dursleys’ many labor-saving appliances.</p>
<p>“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, pointing toward
Moody.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be
introduced to somebody he’d thought he’d known for a year.</p>
<p>“And this is Nymphadora —”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a
shudder. “It’s Tonks.”</p>
<p>“— Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,”
finished Lupin.</p>
<p>“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nymphadora,’”
muttered Tonks.</p>
<p>“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the tall black
wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the wheezy-voiced wizard nodded —
“Dedalus Diggle —”</p>
<p>“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his top
hat.</p>
<p>“— Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an emerald-green
shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis Podmore” — a square-jawed wizard with
thick, straw-colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A pink-cheeked,
black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.</p>
<p>Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were
introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it
was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also wondered why
so many of them were there.</p>
<p>“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” said
Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his mouth
twitched slightly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. “We’re your
guard, Potter.”</p>
<p>“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,”
said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. “We’ve got about fifteen
minutes.”</p>
<p>“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the witch called
Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. “My dad’s
Muggle-born and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just like
with wizards?”</p>
<p>“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to Lupin — “what’s
going on, I haven’t heard anything from anyone, what’s Vol — ?”</p>
<p>Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus
Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, “Shut up!”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” said Moody,
turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing up at
the ceiling. “Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to the
magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it —”</p>
<p>And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled
from a sink, he popped out his eye.</p>
<p>“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks
conversationally.</p>
<p>“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked Moody.</p>
<p>Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled
it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards.
Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.</p>
<p>“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He dropped the
magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye
whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. “I want
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.”</p>
<p>“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to Apparate,
they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and it’s more than our life’s
worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.”</p>
<p>“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his
deep voice.</p>
<p>“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his watch. “Anyway,
you’d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when
the signal comes.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly.</p>
<p>She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking
around with much curiosity and interest.</p>
<p>“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you know what I
mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered
Harry’s bedroom and he turned on the light.</p>
<p>His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house.
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered
tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over
the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and
thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to
smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle
clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around
it.</p>
<p>Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his
trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her
reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.</p>
<p>“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said
pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you think it makes me
look a bit peaky?”</p>
<p>“Er —” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams
of Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a
strained expression as though she were struggling to remember something.
A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.</p>
<p>“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her
eyes again.</p>
<p>“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at her reflection and
turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. “It
means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting Harry’s
puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. “I was born one. I got top
marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any
study at all, it was great.”</p>
<p>“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard catcher
was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit
higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed
on Stealth and Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that
plate when we arrived downstairs?”</p>
<p>“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her,
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.</p>
<p>Tonks chuckled.</p>
<p>“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?”</p>
<p>Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.</p>
<p>“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like
people staring at his scar.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” said Tonks.
“Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re born, not made. Most wizards
need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . . But
we’ve got to get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she added
guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.</p>
<p>“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more books.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack!” cried Tonks,
waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.</p>
<p>Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and
flew pell-mell into the trunk.</p>
<p>“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and
looking down at the jumble inside. “My mum’s got this knack of getting
stuff to fit itself in neatly — she even gets the socks to fold
themselves — but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind of
flick —”</p>
<p>She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks gave a feeble
sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within.</p>
<p>“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s
all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too — Scourgify —” She
pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings
vanished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite got the hang of
these sort of householdy spells. Right — got everything? Cauldron?
Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right
hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international
standard broomstick.</p>
<p>“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah
well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s
go. Locomotor Trunk.”</p>
<p>Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a
conductor’s baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of the
door ahead of them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her
down the stairs carrying his broomstick.</p>
<p>Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning
so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley Shacklebolt
and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was
laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the
drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys.</p>
<p>“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered.
“We’ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the
garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and
uncle not to worry —”</p>
<p>“They won’t,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“That you’re safe —”</p>
<p>“That’ll just depress them.”</p>
<p>“— and you’ll see them next summer.”</p>
<p>“Do I have to?”</p>
<p>Lupin smiled but made no answer.</p>
<p>“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward him with
his wand. “I need to Disillusion you.”</p>
<p>“You need to what?” said Harry nervously.</p>
<p>“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his wand. “Lupin says
you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won’t stay on while we’re
flying; this’ll disguise you better. Here you go —”</p>
<p>He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious
sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles
seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had
struck.</p>
<p>“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry’s
midriff.</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for
it didn’t look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.</p>
<p>They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept
lawn.</p>
<p>“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens.
“Could’ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,” he barked at
Harry, “we’re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll be right
in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be covering you from
below. I’m going to be behind you. The rest’ll be circling us. We don’t
break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed —”</p>
<p>“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored
him.</p>
<p>“— the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break ranks. If they
take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing
by to take over; keep flying east and they’ll join you.”</p>
<p>“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not taking this
seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage
into a harness hanging from her broom.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. “Our job’s to
deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt —”</p>
<p>“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep,
calming voice.</p>
<p>“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply,
pointing into the sky.</p>
<p>Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung his
right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in
the air once more.</p>
<p>“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green
this time, exploded high above them.</p>
<p>Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed
through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away,
shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every
thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the
rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though his heart
was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away
from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer, he was
going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to
recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.</p>
<p>“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody
from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his
trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height. . . .
Give it another quarter of a mile!”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon’s
car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right
now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition . . . and Harry
laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the
flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the harness holding his
trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped
through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy. .
. .</p>
<p>“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!”</p>
<p>They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the
glittering spiderweb of lights below.</p>
<p>“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead we
can lose ourselves in!” called Moody.</p>
<p>“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks angrily. “We’ll get
soaked, Mad-Eye!”</p>
<p>Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb
on the Firebolt’s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he
was starting to shiver.</p>
<p>They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye’s
instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind
that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember being this
cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against
Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The
guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey.
Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they had been flying; it
felt like an hour at least.</p>
<p>“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid the
motorway!”</p>
<p>Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment of
the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even
more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable
to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames. . .
. Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on his
right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she too
swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . .</p>
<p>“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we’re not being
followed!” Moody shouted.</p>
<p>“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front. “We’re all
frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we’re not going to get
there until next week! We’re nearly there now!”</p>
<p>“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks,
Harry!”</p>
<p>Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest
collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing
mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of
deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see
individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials.
He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that
someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.</p>
<p>“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had
landed.</p>
<p>Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of
unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy
fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had
broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps,
paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay
outside several sets of front steps.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a
minute.”</p>
<p>Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with
cold.</p>
<p>“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette
lighter into the air and clicking it.</p>
<p>The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter
again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every lamp in the
square was extinguished and the only light in the square came from
curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.</p>
<p>“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the
Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window,
see? Now, come on, quick.”</p>
<p>He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across
the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying
Harry’s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with their wands
out, flanking them.</p>
<p>The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in
the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile
of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.</p>
<p>“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward Harry’s
Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to
illuminate the writing. “Read quickly and memorize.”</p>
<p>Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting was
vaguely familiar. It said:</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number
twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.</p>
