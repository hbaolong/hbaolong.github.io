<h4 id="chapter-si">CHAPTER SI</h4>
<p>XTHE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p>The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that
followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back
door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news.
Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt
and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and
destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t do anything about the” — Ron mouthed the word
Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace on you.
And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,” he dropped his
voice to a whisper, “d’you reckon you already know where the
You-Know-Whats are?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry admitted.</p>
<p>“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron. “She
said she was saving it for when you got here.”</p>
<p>They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had
just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and
Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.</p>
<p>“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means I
only need to stay here four days. Then I can —”</p>
<p>“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for the
wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.”</p>
<p>Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.</p>
<p>“Don’t they realize how important — ?”</p>
<p>“’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now you
mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.”</p>
<p>Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley
was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.</p>
<p>“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we’re off
to do. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin’ve both
asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone
except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined.”</p>
<p>Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch,
Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help
identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of his
rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the
kitchen, she started.</p>
<p>“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping
out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.”</p>
<p>The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what
looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.</p>
<p>“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said
Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,” mumbled Harry. “Ron and
Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.”</p>
<p>“What sort of ‘stuff’?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I can’t —”</p>
<p>“Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m
sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had
been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced himself to look
directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely
the same shade of brown as Ginny’s. This did not help.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m sorry.
Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice —”</p>
<p>“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping all
pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense, if
Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command!
Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you
something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you
—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to be me.”</p>
<p>He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying,
which was patterned with golden bulrushes.</p>
<p>“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather
unnerving return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well,
Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the
preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still so
much to do.”</p>
<p>“No — I — of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden
change of subject.</p>
<p>“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left the
scullery.</p>
<p>From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione so
busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to
think. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that
Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and
the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery
cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming
the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapés,
however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive. All the
jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one
another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since
the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing
Ollivander.</p>
<p>“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting
together and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” Ginny told
Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third
night of his stay.</p>
<p>“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry muttered.
“Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here
making vol-au-vents?”</p>
<p>He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten.</p>
<p>“So it’s true?” she said. “That’s what you’re trying to do?”</p>
<p>“I — not — I was joking,” said Harry evasively.</p>
<p>They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in
Ginny’s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first
time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in
secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was
remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and
Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in.</p>
<p>They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because
the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the
headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of
Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore
had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret-Keeper in
turn.</p>
<p>“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power
of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death
Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold
much longer.”</p>
<p>“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by
now?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he
turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him
out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we
can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as
headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.”</p>
<p>The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver
knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid
things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been
separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing
her arm he could barely cut his chicken.</p>
<p>“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” replied Bill.</p>
<p>They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and
Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know
where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the
battle.</p>
<p>“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about
finding the body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean much. It’s
keeping a lot quiet these days.”</p>
<p>“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic
I used escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the table to
Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.</p>
<p>“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want me to
tell the world Voldemort attacked me?”</p>
<p>“The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that
You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass
breakout.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his
knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand
stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.</p>
<p>“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked Ron
angrily.</p>
<p>“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied,
“terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next
to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t
believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn’t
been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his
office all day: I just hope he’s working on a plan.”</p>
<p>There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates
onto the work surface and served apple tart.</p>
<p>“We must decide ’ow you will be disguised, ’Arry,” said Fleur, once
everyone had pudding. “For ze wedding,” she added, when he looked
confused. “Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot
guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad
champagne.”</p>
<p>From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.</p>
<p>“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where
she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense
list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment.
“Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?”</p>
<p>“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his
mother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine
with it the way it is!”</p>
<p>“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time,
young man —”</p>
<p>“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furiously.
“No! So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left —”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “And
do as you’re told.”</p>
<p>Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and
attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.</p>
<p>“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley
cut across him.</p>
<p>“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the
chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the
sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at
eleven tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the
chickens.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told
Harry, blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most
of what was left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s to say,
keeping — it in here. Fantastic stuff: There’s an exhaust gaskin, as I
believe it’s called, the most magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great
opportunity to find out how brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all
back together again when Molly’s not — I mean, when I’ve got time.”</p>
<p>When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen,
so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom.</p>
<p>“I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as
Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had
evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all
week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far
corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books,
some of which Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles.</p>
<p>“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.</p>
<p>“And how did you manage to get away?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the
sheets yesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica
onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other.</p>
<p>“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I reckon he
might have survived.”</p>
<p>“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be sure
what he saw?”</p>
<p>“Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a
thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain
and Ireland in her hand.</p>
<p>“He could have used a Shield Charm —”</p>
<p>“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily,
punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.</p>
<p>“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking
shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!”</p>
<p>For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye’s body, broken as
Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its
socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to
laugh.</p>
<p>“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no
one’s found him,” said Ron wisely.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried
in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed
him —”</p>
<p>“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time
to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed.
“Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset —”</p>
<p>But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the
bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans
pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to
clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it
at the rag and said, “Tergeo.”</p>
<p>The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with
himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.</p>
<p>“Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . .” She blew her nose and
hiccuped. “It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore . .
. I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so
tough!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know what
he’d say to us if he was here?”</p>
<p>“‘C-constant vigilance,’” said Hermione, mopping her eyes.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from what
happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly
little squit, Mundungus.”</p>
<p>Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more
books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her
shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The
book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at
Ron’s ankle.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book
from Ron’s leg and retied it shut.</p>
<p>“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked, limping
back to his bed.</p>
<p>“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione.
“When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot
we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I
wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I
think we’d better take it, to be safe.”</p>
<p>She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked
up Hogwarts: A History.</p>
<p>“Listen,” said Harry.</p>
<p>He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar
mixtures of resignation and defiance.</p>
<p>“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come
with me,” Harry began.</p>
<p>“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You
know, I think I will take Hogwarts: A History. Even if we’re not going
back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with —”</p>
<p>“Listen!” said Harry again.</p>
<p>“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you. That
was decided months ago — years, really.”</p>
<p>“But —”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Ron advised him.</p>
<p>“— are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted.</p>
<p>“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the
discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for days,
so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your information
has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling
Mad-Eye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s
nose.</p>
<p>“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced
they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s
ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to
make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate
them about me — or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a
bit about you.</p>
<p>“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad
and lift the enchantment. If I don’t — well, I think I’ve cast a good
enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins
don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you see.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the
bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though
reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to
say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching
anyone else tact.</p>
<p>“I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t —”</p>
<p>“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen
if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Go on, he needs to know!”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.”</p>
<p>For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and
stumped over to the door.</p>
<p>“C’mon.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny
landing.</p>
<p>“Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A
hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their
feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the
square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.</p>
<p>“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually
met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look
at him.”</p>
<p>Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space.
His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the
creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with
its large mouth wide open.</p>
<p>“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of
pustules.”</p>
<p>Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in
shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became used
to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. He was also
sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than
distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.</p>
<p>“He’s me, see?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said
Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the
ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.</p>
<p>“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my
room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it — well, it’s
hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a
lot when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit.
Good, eh?”</p>
<p>Harry merely looked his confusion.</p>
<p>“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the
brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts
again, everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right?
Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if
they’ve got information on where you are.”</p>
<p>“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot
of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said
Hermione.</p>
<p>“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t
all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story
that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back
to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show
them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit’s really
contagious, so they’re not going to want to go near him. It won’t matter
that he can’t say anything, either, because apparently you can’t once
the fungus has spread to your uvula.”</p>
<p>“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . .
well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till
we’ve gone.”</p>
<p>There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as
Hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat
watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say
anything. The measures they had taken to protect their families made him
realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were
going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that
would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply
could not find words important enough.</p>
<p>Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting
from four floors below.</p>
<p>“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said
Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the
wedding.”</p>
<p>“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the
rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as
she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.</p>
<p>“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said
Ron.</p>
<p>“What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive
Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An
Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re going after we
leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow first,
Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . shouldn’t we make the
Horcruxes our priority?”</p>
<p>“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,”
said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his
desire to return to Godric’s Hollow. His parents’ graves were only part
of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that
the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was
there that he had survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that he was
facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place
where it had happened, wanting to understand.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a
watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect you to go
back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you
like?”</p>
<p>This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a
counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of
thought.</p>
<p>“This R.A.B. person,” he said. “You know, the one who stole the real
locket?”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>“He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux
in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded.</p>
<p>“‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as
I can,’” Harry read out.</p>
<p>“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Or she,” interposed Hermione.</p>
<p>“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!”</p>
<p>“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket,
aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s
destroyed.”</p>
<p>“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked
Ron.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.”</p>
<p>“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes
in the library?”</p>
<p>“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumbledore
removed them all, but he — he didn’t destroy them.”</p>
<p>Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands
on those Horcrux books?”</p>
<p>“It — it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron
with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even if
Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t
want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder
to —”</p>
<p>“Get to the point!” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did
a Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. And — they zoomed out of
Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.”</p>
<p>“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a
mixture of admiration and incredulity.</p>
<p>“Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral,” said Hermione in an even
smaller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look
for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it — it
just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it
would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it
worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I — I packed
them.”</p>
<p>She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dumbledore
would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the
information to make a Horcrux, is it?”</p>
<p>“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these books
anyway?”</p>
<p>Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a
large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little
nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently
dead.</p>
<p>“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a
Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art — it’s a horrible book, really
awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the
library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet
Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.”</p>
<p>“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d
already read that?” asked Ron.</p>
<p>“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you
split your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure Riddle
already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about
them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where
he got the information.”</p>
<p>“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more
horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made
six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul
by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!”</p>
<p>Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving
beyond “usual evil.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be
excruciatingly painful.”</p>
<p>“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve
done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I
can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to
destroy Horcruxes in that book?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining
rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to
make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did
to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying
a Horcrux.”</p>
<p>“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs,
then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with
them.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It
has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself.
Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare —”</p>
<p>“— phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few
substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous
to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve,
though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the
trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.”</p>
<p>“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t
the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”</p>
<p>“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione
hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you
through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”</p>
<p>“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron. Harry
laughed.</p>
<p>“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to
your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s
the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it
depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can’t
exist without it.”</p>
<p>“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remembering
ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the
piece of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished.</p>
<p>“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped
in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before
you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.”</p>
<p>“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was
possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”</p>
<p>“While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside
it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I
don’t mean holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching
it,” she added before Ron could speak. “I mean close emotionally. Ginny
poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly
vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the
Horcrux.”</p>
<p>“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry. “Why didn’t
I ask him? I never really . . .”</p>
<p>His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should
have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it
seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore
had been alive, to find out more . . . to find out everything. . . .</p>
<p>The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a
wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest
Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped
off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked
his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his
wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair
was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her
voice trembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are
wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was
under the impression that you had agreed to help.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet,
sending books flying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re sorry . .
.”</p>
<p>With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the
room after Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone, still
massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without the job
satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find
Horcruxes. . . . It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?”</p>
<p>Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of
wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite
abruptly.</p>
<p>The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. Harry,
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s
family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back
upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his
hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into
the sunny backyard to await the visitors.</p>
<p>Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons
and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back
door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either
side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves
waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had
been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been
pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it
in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without
its usual contingent of capering gnomes.</p>
<p>He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed
upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that
it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into
the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top
of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound
of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out
to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later,
laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long,
leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother.</p>
<p>“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!”</p>
<p>Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was
a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard.
However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on
high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her
flustered.</p>
<p>“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur
tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trouble
at all!”</p>
<p>Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering
out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.</p>
<p>“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s
hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. “We are most honored at
the approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife,
Apolline.”</p>
<p>Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley
too.</p>
<p>“Enchantée,” she said. “Your ’usband ’as been telling us such amusing
stories!”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look,
upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression
appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.</p>
<p>“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said
Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old,
with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a
dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting
her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.</p>
<p>“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the
Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and
“Not at all!”s.</p>
<p>The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests.
They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the
preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything
from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shoes “Charmant!” Madame
Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven
properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around,
trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid
French.</p>
<p>On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many
people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room,
having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and insisted
they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s
old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once
Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together
became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron,
and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape
the overcrowded house.</p>
<p>“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second
attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of
Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.</p>
<p>“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached
them. “We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow .
. . to put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean
against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. “Millamant’s Magic Marquees
. . . they’re very good, Bill’s escorting them. . . . You’d better stay
inside while they’re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate
organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around the
place.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t mean
— well, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve been wanting
to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen,
after all, it’s an important day. . . .”</p>
<p>“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional
strain this would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal
dinner would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wedding. . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall
I? And how about Hagrid?”</p>
<p>“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of
trouble.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . .”</p>
<p>She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little
sadly, straightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her
wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to
hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the
inconvenience and the pain he was giving her.</p>
