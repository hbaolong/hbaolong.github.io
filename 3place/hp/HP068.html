<h4 id="chapter-eleven">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h4>
<p>ABOARD THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS</p>
<p>There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry
awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window
as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into
their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.</p>
<p>He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on
their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of
the stairs, looking harassed.</p>
<p>“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent message from
the Ministry!”</p>
<p>Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came
clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of
sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw
Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a quill here
somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to —</p>
<p>Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they
were working properly.</p>
<p>Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a
large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by
the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.</p>
<p>“. . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and
called those what-d’you-call-’ems — please-men. Arthur, you’ve got to
get over there —”</p>
<p>“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment,
a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley’s hands.</p>
<p>“— it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr. Diggory’s
head. “I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and
I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter
gets hold of this one, Arthur —”</p>
<p>“What does Mad-Eye say happened?” asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the
ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.</p>
<p>Mr. Diggory’s head rolled its eyes. “Says he heard an intruder in his
yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his
dustbins.”</p>
<p>“What did the dustbins do?” asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling
frantically.</p>
<p>“Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I
can tell,” said Mr. Diggory. “Apparently one of them was still rocketing
around when the please-men turned up —”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley groaned.</p>
<p>“And what about the intruder?”</p>
<p>“Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Diggory’s head, rolling its eyes
again. “Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely
there’s a very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in
potato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on
Mad-Eye, he’s had it — think of his record — we’ve got to get him off on
a minor charge, something in your department — what are exploding
dustbins worth?”</p>
<p>“Might be a caution,” said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his
brow furrowed. “Mad-Eye didn’t use his wand? He didn’t actually attack
anyone?”</p>
<p>“I’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could
reach through the window,” said Mr. Diggory, “but they’ll have a job
proving it, there aren’t any casualties.”</p>
<p>“All right, I’m off,” Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment
with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen
again.</p>
<p>Mr. Diggory’s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Sorry about this, Molly,” it said, more calmly, “bothering you so
early and everything . . . but Arthur’s the only one who can get Mad-Eye
off, and Mad-Eye’s supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had
to choose last night . . .”</p>
<p>“Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sure you won’t have a bit of
toast or anything before you go?”</p>
<p>“Oh go on, then,” said Mr. Diggory.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the
kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into
Mr. Diggory’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Fanks,” he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop,
vanished.</p>
<p>Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill,
Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the
kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his
hair.</p>
<p>“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Mr. Weasley to
Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and
preparing to Disapparate. “Molly, are you going to be all right taking
the kids to King’s Cross?”</p>
<p>“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-Eye, we’ll be
fine.”</p>
<p>As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he been up to
now?”</p>
<p>“He says someone tried to break into his house last night,” said
Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his
toast. “Isn’t he that nutter —”</p>
<p>“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,” said Mrs. Weasley
sternly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred quietly as
Mrs. Weasley left the room. “Birds of a feather . . .”</p>
<p>“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.</p>
<p>“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said Charlie.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is he?” said Fred.
“I mean, I know he’s a genius and everything . . .”</p>
<p>“Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said Charlie. “I met
him once when Dad took me in to work with him. He was an Auror — one of
the best . . . a Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank
look. “Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made
himself loads of enemies, though . . . the families of people he caught,
mainly . . . and I heard he’s been getting really paranoid in his old
age. Doesn’t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards everywhere.”</p>
<p>Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s Cross
station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really
needed to get to work.</p>
<p>“I just can’t justify taking more time off at the moment,” he told
them. “Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know what, Percy?” said George seriously. “I reckon he’ll
know your name soon.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to
order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.</p>
<p>“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs. Weasley whispered
to Harry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi
drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. “But there
weren’t any to spare. . . . Oh dear, they don’t look happy, do
they?”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers
rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an
earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster’s
Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred’s
trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright
and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man’s leg.</p>
<p>The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were
jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took
quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they
entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely scratched.
They were very relieved to get out at King’s Cross, even though the rain
was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their
trunks across the busy road and into the station.</p>
<p>Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by
now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently
solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was
doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle
attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the
most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and
Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier,
chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it . . . and as they
did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of
them.</p>
<p>The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already
there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many
Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts.
Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many
owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats,
and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the
train. They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye to
Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.</p>
<p>“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Charlie,
grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.</p>
<p>“Why?” said Fred keenly.</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” said Charlie. “Just don’t tell Percy I mentioned it . .
. it’s ‘classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit
to release it,’ after all.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,” said Bill,
hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.</p>
<p>“Why?” said George impatiently.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have an interesting year,” said Bill, his eyes
twinkling. “I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it. . .
.”</p>
<p>“A bit of what?” said Ron.</p>
<p>But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them
toward the train doors.</p>
<p>“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said Hermione as they
climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk
to her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Oh it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I’d invite you
for Christmas, but . . . well, I expect you’re all going to want to stay
at Hogwarts, what with . . . one thing and another.”</p>
<p>“Mum!” said Ron irritably. “What d’you three know that we don’t?”</p>
<p>“You’ll find out this evening, I expect,” said Mrs. Weasley, smiling.
“It’s going to be very exciting — mind you, I’m very glad they’ve
changed the rules —”</p>
<p>“What rules?” said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave,
won’t you? Won’t you, Fred? And you, George?”</p>
<p>The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.</p>
<p>“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred bellowed out of the
window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. “What
rules are they changing?”</p>
<p>But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded
the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick
rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them.
Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them
over Pigwidgeon’s cage to muffle his hooting.</p>
<p>“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,” he said
grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. “At the World Cup, remember? But
my own mother won’t say. Wonder what —”</p>
<p>“Shh!” Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips
and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron
listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the
open door.</p>
<p>“. . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather
than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you
know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a Mudblood-lover — and
Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn’t like
the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes
a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang
students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . .
.”</p>
<p>Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut,
blocking out Malfoy’s voice.</p>
<p>“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?” she said
angrily. “I wish he had gone, then we wouldn’t have to put up with
him.”</p>
<p>“Durmstrang’s another Wizarding school?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione sniffily, “and it’s got a horrible reputation.
According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, it puts a lot
of emphasis on the Dark Arts.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve heard of it,” said Ron vaguely. “Where is it? What
country?”</p>
<p>“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione, raising her
eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Er — why not?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic
schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so
nobody can steal their secrets,” said Hermione matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“Come off it,” said Ron, starting to laugh. “Durmstrang’s got to be
about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big
castle?”</p>
<p>“But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise. “Everyone knows
that . . . well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts: A History, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on — how d’you hide a place like
Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“It’s bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at it, all they
see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER,
DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.”</p>
<p>“So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have Muggle-repelling
charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards
from finding it, they’ll have made it Unplottable —”</p>
<p>“Come again?”</p>
<p>“Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to plot on a
map, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . if you say so,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,” said
Hermione thoughtfully. “Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur
capes as part of their uniforms.”</p>
<p>“Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily. “It would’ve
been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an
accident. . . . Shame his mother likes him. . . .”</p>
<p>The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north.
The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit
by midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry
bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.</p>
<p>Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon
progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville
Longbottom, a round-faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought
up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus was still wearing
his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it
was still squeaking “Troy — Mullet — Moran!” but in a very feeble and
exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired
of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard
Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning
Charm.</p>
<p>Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they
relived the Cup match.</p>
<p>“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably. “Wouldn’t buy tickets.
It sounded amazing though.”</p>
<p>“It was,” said Ron. “Look at this, Neville. . . .”</p>
<p>He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the
miniature figure of Viktor Krum.</p>
<p>“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy
hand.</p>
<p>“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron. “We were in the Top
Box —”</p>
<p>“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.”</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and
Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have
grown at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard
the conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had
left ajar.</p>
<p>“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said Harry
coolly.</p>
<p>“Weasley . . . what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon’s
cage. A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with
the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.</p>
<p>Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick
for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.</p>
<p>“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and
showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing
these, were you? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he
snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive
laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.</p>
<p>“So . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of
glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know . . .
you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won. . . .”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.</p>
<p>“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated. “I suppose you will,
Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?”</p>
<p>“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said
Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade
4.</p>
<p>A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly. “You’ve got a
father and brother at the Ministry and you don’t even know? My God, my
father told me about it ages ago . . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge.
But then, Father’s always associated with the top people at the
Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too junior to know about it, Weasley
. . . yes . . . they probably don’t talk about important stuff in front
of him. . . .”</p>
<p>Laughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the
three of them disappeared.</p>
<p>Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard
behind them that the glass shattered.</p>
<p>“Ron!” said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand,
muttered “Reparo!” and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and
back into the door.</p>
<p>“Well . . . making it look like he knows everything and we don’t. . .
.” Ron snarled. “‘Father’s always associated with the top people at the
Ministry.’ . . . Dad could’ve got a promotion any time . . . he just
likes it where he is. . . .”</p>
<p>“Of course he does,” said Hermione quietly. “Don’t let Malfoy get to
you, Ron —”</p>
<p>“Him! Get to me!? As if!” said Ron, picking up one of the remaining
Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.</p>
<p>Ron’s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. He didn’t talk
much as they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering
when the Hogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the
pitch-darkness of Hogsmeade station.</p>
<p>As the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead.
Hermione bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress
robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes
narrowed against the downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and
fast that it was as though buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied
repeatedly over their heads.</p>
<p>“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far
end of the platform.</p>

was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts
Castle.</p>
