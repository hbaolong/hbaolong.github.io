<h4 id="chapter-twelve">CHAPTER TWELVE</h4>
<p>THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT</p>
<p>Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was
fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see
Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering
behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as
their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which
stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the
carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the
castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their
carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were
safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its
magnificent marble staircase.</p>
<p>“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere,
“if that keeps up the lake’s going to overflow. I’m soak — ARRGH!”</p>
<p>A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the
ceiling onto Ron’s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron
staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped —
narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry’s feet, sending a wave of
cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them
shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of
the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above
them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and
orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as
he took aim again.</p>
<p>“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at
ONCE!”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor
House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet
floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from
falling.</p>
<p>“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her
throat.</p>
<p>“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall,
straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her
square-rimmed spectacles.</p>
<p>“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several
fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. “Already
wet, aren’t they? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another
bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived.</p>
<p>“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “I’m
warning you, Peeves —”</p>
<p>Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into
the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.</p>
<p>“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to the
bedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall, come on!”</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall
and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under
his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.</p>
<p>The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the
start-of-term feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of
hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair.
The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the
top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing
their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat
down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next
to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and
semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with
a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking
extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his
partially severed neck.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.</p>
<p>“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of
water. “Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.”</p>
<p>The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start
of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances,
Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking
forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down
the table.</p>
<p>“Hiya, Harry!”</p>
<p>It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a
hero.</p>
<p>“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.</p>
<p>“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My
brother Dennis!”</p>
<p>“Er — good,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down
in his seat. “I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed,
eh, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron,
and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same
Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven
of whom had been put into Gryffindor.</p>
<p>“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in
Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together,
wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more
empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his
way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was
presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there
was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn’t think who else was
missing.</p>
<p>“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said
Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers.</p>
<p>They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who
had lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been
Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the
staff table. There was definitely no new face there.</p>
<p>“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.</p>
<p>Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor
Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions
beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over
her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the
Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra’s other side was the
sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape — Harry’s
least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s loathing of Snape was matched
only by Snape’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible,
intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under
Snape’s overlarge nose — Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their
own school days.</p>
<p>On Snape’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was
Professor McGonagall’s. Next to it, and in the very center of the table,
sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and
beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes
embroidered with many stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore’s long,
thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them,
staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though
lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling too. It was enchanted
to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy.
Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another
thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.</p>
<p>“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a
hippogriff.”</p>
<p>The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great
Hall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long
line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and
Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They
appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed. All of them
were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along
the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the
school — all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy
hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s moleskin
overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it looked as though he were
draped in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded from over
the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with
his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a
double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake! He looked positively
delighted about it.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall now placed a four-legged stool on the ground
before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty,
patched wizard’s hat. The first years stared at it. So did everyone
else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the brim
opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:</p>
<p>A thousand years or more ago,</p>
<p>When I was newly sewn,</p>
<p>There lived four wizards of renown,</p>
<p>Whose names are still well known:</p>
<p>Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,</p>
<p>Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,</p>
<p>Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,</p>
<p>Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.</p>
<p>They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,</p>
<p>They hatched a daring plan</p>
<p>To educate young sorcerers</p>
<p>Thus Hogwarts School began.</p>
<p>Now each of these four founders</p>
<p>Formed their own House, for each</p>
<p>Did value different virtues</p>
<p>In the ones they had to teach.</p>
<p>By Gryffindor, the bravest were</p>
<p>Prized far beyond the rest;</p>
<p>For Ravenclaw, the cleverest</p>
<p>Would always be the best;</p>
<p>For Hufflepuff, hard workers were</p>
<p>Most worthy of admission;</p>
<p>And power-hungry Slytherin</p>
<p>Loved those of great ambition.</p>
<p>While still alive they did divide</p>
<p>Their favorites from the throng,</p>
<p>Yet how to pick the worthy ones</p>
<p>When they were dead and gone?</p>
<p>’Twas Gryffindor who found the way,</p>
<p>He whipped me off his head</p>
<p>The founders put some brains in me</p>
<p>So I could choose instead!</p>
<p>Now slip me snug about your ears,</p>
<p>I’ve never yet been wrong,</p>
<p>I’ll have a look inside your mind</p>
<p>And tell where you belong!</p>
<p>The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.</p>
<p>“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping
along with everyone else.</p>
<p>“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a
pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year
making up the next one.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of
parchment.</p>
<p>“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the
stool,” she told the first years. “When the hat announces your House,
you will go and sit at the appropriate table.</p>
<p>“Ackerley, Stewart!”</p>
<p>A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up
the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.</p>
<p>“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.</p>
<p>Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the
Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a
glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he
sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the
Ravenclaw table too.</p>
<p>“Baddock, Malcolm!”</p>
<p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p>
<p>The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry
could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry
wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more
Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm
Baddock as he sat down.</p>
<p>“Branstone, Eleanor!”</p>
<p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p>
<p>“Cauldwell, Owen!”</p>
<p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p>
<p>“Creevey, Dennis!”</p>
<p>Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s
moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door
behind the teachers’ table. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at
least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black
hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for
Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He
winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched
Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened
wide —</p>
<p>“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.</p>
<p>Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming
widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over
to join his brother.</p>
<p>“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty
seat. “It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and
pushed me back in the boat!”</p>
<p>“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably the giant
squid, Dennis!”</p>
<p>“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could
hope for more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake,
and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.</p>
<p>“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair
and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?”</p>
<p>Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting
Emma Dobbs.</p>
<p>The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright
on their faces moving one by one to the four-legged stool, the line
dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.</p>
<p>“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.</p>
<p>“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly
Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>“’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.</p>
<p>“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said
Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the
Gryffindor table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do
we?”</p>
<p>Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three
years in a row.</p>
<p>“Pritchard, Graham!”</p>
<p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p>
<p>“Quirke, Orla!”</p>
<p>“RAVENCLAW!”</p>
<p>And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended.
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them
away.</p>
<p>“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking
expectantly at his golden plate.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at
the students, his arms opened wide in welcome.</p>
<p>“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice
echoing around the Hall. “Tuck in.”</p>
<p>“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled
magically before their eyes.</p>
<p>Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
loaded their own plates.</p>
<p>“Aaah, ’at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed
potato.</p>
<p>“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,” said Nearly
Headless Nick. “There was trouble in the kitchens earlier.”</p>
<p>“Why? Wha’ ’appened?” said Harry, through a sizable chunk of
steak.</p>
<p>“Peeves, of course,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head,
which wobbled dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his
neck. “The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast —
well, it’s quite out of the question, you know what he’s like, utterly
uncivilized, can’t see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a
ghost’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but
most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.”</p>
<p>The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter
covered in silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who
could really control Peeves.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,” said Ron
darkly. “So what did he do in the kitchens?”</p>
<p>“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. “Wreaked havoc
and mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified
the house-elves out of their wits —”</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread
steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen
orange, but Hermione paid no attention.</p>
<p>“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring, horror-struck, at
Nearly Headless Nick. “Here at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her
reaction. “The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe.
Over a hundred.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?” said
Nearly Headless Nick. “They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning .
. . see to the fires and so on. . . . I mean, you’re not supposed to see
them, are you? That’s the mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that you
don’t know it’s there?”</p>
<p>Hermione stared at him.</p>
<p>“But they get paid?” she said. “They get holidays, don’t they? And —
and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?”</p>
<p>Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his
head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle
that still attached it to his neck.</p>
<p>“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his
shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff. “House-elves don’t
want sick leave and pensions!”</p>
<p>Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put
her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.</p>
<p>“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with
bits of Yorkshire pudding. “Oops — sorry, ’Arry —” He swallowed. “You
won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself!”</p>
<p>“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose.
“That’s what made this dinner. Slave labor.”</p>
<p>And she refused to eat another bite.</p>
<p>The rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass.
Another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling
flashed, illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first
course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.</p>
<p>“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell
toward her. “Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!”</p>
<p>But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall
that he gave up.</p>
<p>When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had
faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got
to his feet again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at
once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be
heard.</p>
<p>“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. “Now that we are
all fed and watered,” (“Hmph!” said Hermione) “I must once more ask for
your attention, while I give out a few notices.</p>
<p>“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of
objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to
include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs.
The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I
believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like
to check it.”</p>
<p>The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, “As ever, I
would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is
out-of-bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below
third year.</p>
<p>“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House
Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow
members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at
Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went on, “This
is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing
throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and
energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great
pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts —”</p>
<p>But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the
doors of the Great Hall banged open.</p>
<p>A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a
black traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the
stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that
flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane
of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers’
table.</p>
<p>A dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He
reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily
toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling.
Hermione gasped.</p>
<p>The lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp relief, and it was
a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been
carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of
what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled
with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked
like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it
was the man’s eyes that made him frightening.</p>
<p>One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as
a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly,
without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite
independently of the normal eye — and then it rolled right over,
pointing into the back of the man’s head, so that all they could see was
whiteness.</p>
<p>The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as
badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words
Harry couldn’t hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the
stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone.
Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his
right-hand side.</p>
<p>The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his
face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left
of his nose, and sniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his
pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat. His normal
eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting
restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the
students.</p>
<p>“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said
Dumbledore brightly into the silence. “Professor Moody.”</p>
<p>It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but
none of the staff or students clapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who
both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed
dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone
else seemed too transfixed by Moody’s bizarre appearance to do more than
stare at him.</p>
<p>“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad went
to help this morning?”</p>
<p>“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.</p>
<p>“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What happened to his
face?”</p>
<p>“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.</p>
<p>Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome.
Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into
his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught
from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few
inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches
of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.</p>
<p>Dumbledore cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of students before
him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, “we are
to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming
months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my
very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be
taking place at Hogwarts this year.”</p>
<p>“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.</p>
<p>The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival
suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled
appreciatively.</p>
<p>“I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention
it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag,
and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.</p>
<p>“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore,
“where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you
will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know
will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their
attention to wander freely.</p>
<p>“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred
years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European
schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion
was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed
in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the
tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a
most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and
wizards of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll
mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.”</p>
<p>“Death toll?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety
did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many
of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was
far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying
about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very
successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical
Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe
for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that
this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal
danger.</p>
<p>“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their
shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three
champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide
which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the
glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize
money.”</p>
<p>“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit
with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the
only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts
champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing
raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors.
But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.</p>
<p>“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to
Hogwarts,” he said, “the Heads of the participating schools, along with
the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on
contenders this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say,
seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names
for consideration. This” — Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for
several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the
Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious — “is a measure we feel is
necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and
dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that
students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I
will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our
impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blue eyes
twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I
therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are
under seventeen.</p>
<p>“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in
October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know
that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they
are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts
champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how
important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your
lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There
was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet
and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.</p>
<p>“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined the
crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at
Dumbledore. “We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?”</p>
<p>“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred stubbornly, also
scowling at the top table. “The champions’ll get to do all sorts of
stuff you’d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons
prize money!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a thousand
Galleons . . .”</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left here if you
don’t move.”</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall,
Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those
who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.</p>
<p>“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions
are?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a
couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?”
said Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants
to enter, he’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old
they are. Dumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names.”</p>
<p>“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they
walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up
another, narrower staircase.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn’t it? Anyway,
where’s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how
to get ’round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?”</p>
<p>“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it?
But I s’pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we’ve learned
enough. . . .”</p>
<p>“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from behind Fred
and George.</p>
<p>“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s always going on
about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to —
oops. . . .”</p>
<p>Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the
staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was
second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular
step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized
him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the
top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.</p>
<p>“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.</p>
<p>They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was
concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk
dress.</p>
<p>“Password?” she said as they approached.</p>
<p>“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told me.”</p>
<p>The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which
they all climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room,
which was full of squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the
merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her
mutter “Slave labor,” before bidding them good night and disappearing
through the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until
they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the
tower. Five four-poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against
the walls, each with its owner’s trunk at the foot. Dean and Seamus were
already getting into bed; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his
headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his
bedside table. His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned
right next to it.</p>
<p>“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary
soccer players.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. Someone
— a house-elf, no doubt — had placed warming pans between the sheets. It
was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm
raging outside.</p>
<p>“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the
darkness, “if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . .
you never know, do you?”</p>
<p>“S’pose not. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming
in his mind’s eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into
believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . .
he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of
the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had
just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . . Cho’s face stood out
particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with
admiration. . . .</p>
<p>Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn’t
see what he could.</p>
