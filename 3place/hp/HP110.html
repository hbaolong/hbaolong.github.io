<h4 id="chapter-sixteen">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h4>
<p>IN THE HOG’S HEAD</p>
<p>Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark
Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry’s
detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words
now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had
had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the
last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in
Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens),
before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at
the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the
library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.</p>
<p>“I was wondering,” Hermione said suddenly, “whether you’d thought any
more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.”</p>
<p>“’Course I have,” said Harry grumpily. “Can’t forget it, can we, with
that hag teaching us —”</p>
<p>“I meant the idea Ron and I had” — Ron cast her an alarmed,
threatening kind of look; she frowned at him — “oh, all right, the idea
I had, then — about you teaching us.”</p>
<p>Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of
Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his
mind.</p>
<p>The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought
over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it
had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found
himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his
various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters — found himself,
in fact, subconsciously planning lessons. . . .</p>
<p>“Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic
anti-venoms interesting much longer, “yeah, I — I’ve thought about it a
bit.”</p>
<p>“And?” said Hermione eagerly.</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said Ron, who seemed
keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that Harry was
not going to start shouting again.</p>
<p>Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
<p>“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t
you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Harry,” said Hermione gently, “but all the same, there’s no
point pretending that you’re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts,
because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off
the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do
all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can’t, Viktor always said
—”</p>
<p>Ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck;
rubbing it, he said, “Yeah? What did Vicky say?”</p>
<p>“Ho ho,” said Hermione in a bored voice. “He said Harry knew how to
do stuff even he didn’t, and he was in the final year at
Durmstrang.”</p>
<p>Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.</p>
<p>“You’re not still in contact with him, are you?”</p>
<p>“So what if I am?” said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little
pink. “I can have a pen pal if I —”</p>
<p>“He didn’t only want to be your pen pal,” said Ron accusingly.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was
continuing to watch her, said to Harry, “Well, what do you think? Will
you teach us?”</p>
<p>“Just you and Ron, yeah?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious again. “Well . . .
now, don’t fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really
think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re
talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, don’t be
pathetic, Ron — it doesn’t seem fair if we don’t offer the chance to
other people.”</p>
<p>Harry considered this for a moment, then said, “Yeah, but I doubt
anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I’m a nutter,
remember?”</p>
<p>“Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be
interested in hearing what you’ve got to say,” said Hermione seriously.
“Look,” she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with a
frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, “you know the first
weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell
anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it
over?”</p>
<p>“Why do we have to do it outside school?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Because,” said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese
Chomping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think Umbridge would be very
happy if she found out what we were up to.”</p>
<p>Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade,
but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony
silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September;
Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him
to come — but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw
caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if
the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in
Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,” said
Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. “I mean, he’s
been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know that can’t
have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? And now he’s
just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.”</p>
<p>Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on
Kreacher.</p>
<p>“The trouble is,” she said to Harry, “until V-Voldemort — oh for
heaven’s sake, Ron — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to
stay hidden, isn’t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn’t going to
realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore’s been
telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching
real Death Eaters again it’ll be obvious Sirius isn’t one . . . I mean,
he hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” said Ron
bracingly. “Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to
Dumbledore even if he doesn’t like what he hears.”</p>
<p>When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, “Listen, Ron and
I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some
proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem
interested. We’ve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione said quietly. “You’ve got enough on
your plate without Sirius too.”</p>
<p>She was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping up with his
homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer
spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further
behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch
practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect duties. However, Hermione,
who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished
all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes.
Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always
possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.</p>
<p>The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. After
breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to
the long list of students who had permission from their parents or
guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that
if it hadn’t been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.</p>
<p>When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though
trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt
nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out onto the
stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.</p>
<p>“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, Harry, and
Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.</p>
<p>“I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,” said Harry
with a small laugh. “I forgot to tell you . . .”</p>
<p>And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch
bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight
surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more,
indeed, than he did himself.</p>
<p>“He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who had
tipped him off?”</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging. “Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was a
laugh.”</p>
<p>They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars
and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whipping their
hair into their eyes.</p>
<p>“Malfoy?” said Hermione, very skeptically. “Well . . . yes . . .
maybe . . .”</p>
<p>And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of
Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked. “The Three
Broomsticks?”</p>
<p>“Oh — no,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “no, it’s always
packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us in the Hog’s
Head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main road. I
think it’s a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don’t
normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard.”</p>
<p>They walked down the main street past Zonko’s Joke Shop, where they
were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the post
office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a
side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden
sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of
a wild boar’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it.
The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them
hesitated outside the door.</p>
<p>“Well, come on,” said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the way
inside.</p>
<p>It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an
impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog’s Head bar
comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of
something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted
with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was
lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables.
The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped
onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the
accumulated filth of centuries.</p>
<p>Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: “Yeh
get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” he had said, explaining how
he had won a dragon’s egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time
Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger
kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping
your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s Head. There was
a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages,
though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking,
fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. Two figures shrouded in
hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought
them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents;
in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black
veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose
because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about this, Hermione,” Harry muttered, as they crossed
to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch.
“Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?”</p>
<p>Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure.</p>
<p>“Umbridge is shorter than that woman,” she said quietly. “And anyway,
even if Umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can do to stop
us, Harry, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the school rules.
We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether
students were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head, and he said yes, but he
advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I’ve looked up
everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and
they’re definitely allowed. I just don’t think it’s a good idea if we
parade what we’re doing.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry dryly, “especially as it’s not exactly a homework
group you’re planning, is it?”</p>
<p>The barman sidled toward them out of a back room. He was a
grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and beard. He
was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.</p>
<p>“What?” he grunted.</p>
<p>“Three butterbeers, please,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty,
very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.</p>
<p>“Six Sickles,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The
barman’s eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on
his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient
wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat
down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages rapped
the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from
the barman.</p>
<p>“You know what?” Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with
enthusiasm. “We could order anything we liked in here, I bet that bloke
would sell us anything, he wouldn’t care. I’ve always wanted to try
firewhisky —”</p>
<p>“You — are — a — prefect,” snarled Hermione.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading from his face. “Yeah . . .”</p>
<p>“So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” Harry asked,
wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig.</p>
<p>“Just a couple of people,” Hermione repeated, checking her watch and
then looking anxiously toward the door. “I told them to be here about
now and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this might be them
now —”</p>
<p>The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split
the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming
rush of a crowd of people.</p>
<p>First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed
by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry’s stomach did a back flip) Cho
and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and
looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident) Luna
Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin
and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah
Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name
Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called
Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a
tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized
vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing
up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all
three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s
merchandise.</p>
<p>“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A couple of
people?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said Hermione happily.
“Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?”</p>
<p>The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so
filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly he had
never seen his pub so full.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions
quickly. “Could we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please?”</p>
<p>The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag
irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important,
he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar.</p>
<p>“Cheers,” said Fred, handing them out. “Cough up, everyone, I haven’t
got enough gold for all of these . . .”</p>
<p>Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers
from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not
imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible
thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of
speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.</p>
<p>“What have you been telling people?” he said in a low voice. “What
are they expecting?”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,” said
Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously
that she added quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak
to them first.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Harry,” said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite
Harry.</p>
<p>Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was
exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron’s
right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but
gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that,
given her way, she would not be here at all.</p>
<p>In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood
gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the
chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.</p>
<p>“Er,” said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of
nerves. “Well — er — hi.”</p>
<p>The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued
to dart back regularly to Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here. Erm . . . well,
Harry here had the idea — I mean” — Harry had thrown her a sharp look —
“I had the idea — that it might be good if people who wanted to study
Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really study it, you know,
not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us” — (Hermione’s voice
became suddenly much stronger and more confident) — “because nobody
could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts” — “Hear, hear,” said
Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened — “well, I thought it
would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.”</p>
<p>She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, “And by that I
mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the
real spells —”</p>
<p>“You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too
though, I bet?” said Michael Corner.</p>
<p>“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than that,
I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . .”
She took a great breath and finished, “Because Lord Voldemort’s
back.”</p>
<p>The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho’s friend shrieked and
slopped butterbeer down herself, Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary
twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he
managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even
eagerly, at Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . that’s the plan anyway,” said Hermione. “If you want to
join us, we need to decide how we’re going to —”</p>
<p>“Where’s the proof You-Know-Who’s back?” said the blond Hufflepuff
player in a rather aggressive voice.</p>
<p>“Well, Dumbledore believes it —” Hermione began.</p>
<p>“You mean, Dumbledore believes him,” said the blond boy, nodding at
Harry.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” said Ron rather rudely.</p>
<p>“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to
know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who’s back.”</p>
<p>“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what
this meeting was supposed to be about —”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry.</p>
<p>It had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there. He
felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people —
maybe even most of them — had turned up in the hope of hearing Harry’s
story firsthand.</p>
<p>“What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he asked, looking Zacharias
straight in the face. “I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school
what happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him, you don’t
believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince
anyone.”</p>
<p>The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke.
Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in. He was
wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily
dirtier.</p>
<p>Zacharias said dismissively, “All Dumbledore told us last year was
that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought
Diggory’s body back to Hogwarts. He didn’t give us details, he didn’t
tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we’d all like to know
—”</p>
<p>“If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort
murders someone I can’t help you,” Harry said. His temper, always so
close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his
eyes from Zacharias Smith’s aggressive face, determined not to look at
Cho. “I don’t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that’s
what you’re here for, you might as well clear out.”</p>
<p>He cast an angry look in Hermione’s direction. This was, he felt, all
her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of
course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. . . .
But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he
continued to gaze intently at Harry.</p>
<p>“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. “So . . .
like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need
to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, and
where we’re going to —”</p>
<p>“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back,
looking at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.</p>
<p>“A corporeal Patronus?”</p>
<p>The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.</p>
<p>“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.</p>
<p>The girl smiled.</p>
<p>“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about your
hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew
that!”</p>
<p>“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at Harry.
“She said you got enough attention as it was.”</p>
<p>“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The
veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.</p>
<p>“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?”
demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the wall told
me when I was in there last year . . .”</p>
<p>“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged
awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said “wow” softly. Harry was feeling
slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere
but at Cho.</p>
<p>“And in our first year,” said Neville to the group at large, “he
saved that Sorcerous Stone —”</p>
<p>“Sorcerer’s,” hissed Hermione.</p>
<p>“Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,” finished Neville.</p>
<p>Hannah Abbott’s eyes were as round as Galleons.</p>
<p>“And that’s not to mention,” said Cho (Harry’s eyes snapped onto her,
she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault),
“all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last
year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things .
. .”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry’s
insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did
not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised
him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to
himself he would tell them.</p>
<p>“Look,” he said and everyone fell silent at once, “I . . . I don’t
want to sound like I’m trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had
a lot of help with all that stuff . . .”</p>
<p>“Not with the dragon, you didn’t,” said Michael Corner at once. “That
was a seriously cool bit of flying . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well —” said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to
disagree.</p>
<p>“And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,” said
Susan Bones.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, “no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help,
but the point I’m trying to make is —”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?” said
Zacharias Smith.</p>
<p>“Here’s an idea,” said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, “why
don’t you shut your mouth?”</p>
<p>Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected Ron particularly strongly; in
any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like
nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve all turned up to learn from him, and now he’s telling us
he can’t really do any of it,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s not what he said,” snarled Fred Weasley.</p>
<p>“Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?” inquired George,
pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of
the Zonko’s bags.</p>
<p>“Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick
this,” said Fred.</p>
<p>“Yes, well,” said Hermione hastily, “moving on . . . the point is,
are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms
and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy
keeping an eye on the instrument in George’s hand.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last
been settled. “Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I
really don’t think there’s any point in meeting less than once a week
—”</p>
<p>“Hang on,” said Angelina, “we need to make sure this doesn’t clash
with our Quidditch practice.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Cho, “nor with ours.”</p>
<p>“Nor ours,” added Zacharias Smith.</p>
<p>“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said Hermione,
slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re
talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s Death
Eaters —”</p>
<p>“Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been expecting to
speak long before this. “Personally I think this is really important,
possibly more important than anything else we’ll do this year, even with
our O.W.L.s coming up!”</p>
<p>He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry,
“Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he went on, “I, personally, am at a
loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us
at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial about the return
of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively
prevent us from using defensive spells —”</p>
<p>“We think the reason Umbridge doesn’t want us trained in Defense
Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione, “is that she’s got some . . .
some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a
kind of private army. She thinks he’d mobilize us against the
Ministry.”</p>
<p>Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna
Lovegood, who piped up, “Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius
Fudge has got his own private army.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of
information.</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s got an army of heliopaths,” said Luna solemnly.</p>
<p>“No, he hasn’t,” snapped Hermione.</p>
<p>“Yes, he has,” said Luna.</p>
<p>“What are heliopaths?” asked Neville, looking blank.</p>
<p>“They’re spirits of fire,” said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening
so that she looked madder than ever. “Great tall flaming creatures that
gallop across the ground burning everything in front of —”</p>
<p>“They don’t exist, Neville,” said Hermione tartly.</p>
<p>“Oh yes they do!” said Luna angrily.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but where’s the proof of that?” snapped Hermione.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you’re so
narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before
you —”</p>
<p>“Hem, hem,” said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge
that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. “Weren’t we
trying to decide how often we’re going to meet and get Defense
lessons?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione at once, “yes, we were, you’re right . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, once a week sounds cool,” said Lee Jordan.</p>
<p>“As long as —” began Angelina.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,” said Hermione in a tense
voice. “Well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to meet . .
.”</p>
<p>This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.</p>
<p>“Library?” suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.</p>
<p>“I can’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in
the library,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Maybe an unused classroom?” said Dean.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, “McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when
Harry was practicing for the Triwizard . . .”</p>
<p>But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so
accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and
homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this one
might be considered a lot more rebellious.</p>
<p>“Right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere,” said Hermione. “We’ll
send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place for
the first meeting.”</p>
<p>She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then
hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say
something.</p>
<p>“I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know
who was here. But I also think,” she took a deep breath, “that we all
ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing. So if you sign,
you’re agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what we’re up
to.”</p>
<p>Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his
signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less
than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.</p>
<p>“Er . . .” said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that
George was trying to pass him. “Well . . . I’m sure Ernie will tell me
when the meeting is.”</p>
<p>But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too. Hermione
raised her eyebrows at him.</p>
<p>“I — well, we are prefects,” Ernie burst out. “And if this list was
found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge
finds out . . .”</p>
<p>“You just said this group was the most important thing you’d do this
year,” Harry reminded him.</p>
<p>“I — yes,” said Ernie, “yes, I do believe that, it’s just . . .”</p>
<p>“Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying around?” said
Hermione testily.</p>
<p>“No. No, of course not,” said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious.
“I — yes, of course I’ll sign.”</p>
<p>Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho’s friend
give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name. When the last
person — Zacharias — had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and
slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group
now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.</p>
<p>“Well, time’s ticking on,” said Fred briskly, getting to his feet.
“George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase,
we’ll be seeing you all later.”</p>
<p>In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too. Cho
made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving,
her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face, but her
friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho
had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her
through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, I think that went quite well,” said Hermione happily, as she,
Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight a
few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of
butterbeer.</p>
<p>“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was glowering after
the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance.</p>
<p>“I don’t like him much either,” admitted Hermione, “but he overheard
me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed
really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people
the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn’t have
come if he hadn’t been going out with Ginny —”</p>
<p>Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer
bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front.</p>
<p>“He’s WHAT?” said Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw
beef. “She’s going out with — my sister’s going — what d’you mean,
Michael Corner?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — well, they’re
obviously interested in learning Defense, but if Ginny hadn’t told
Michael what was going on —”</p>
<p>“When did this — when did she — ?”</p>
<p>“They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last
year,” said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street
and she paused outside Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, where there was a
handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window. “Hmm . . . I
could do with a new quill.”</p>
<p>She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.</p>
<p>“Which one was Michael Corner?” Ron demanded furiously.</p>
<p>“The dark one,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“I didn’t like him,” said Ron at once.</p>
<p>“Big surprise,” said Hermione under her breath.</p>
<p>“But,” said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper
pots, “I thought Ginny fancied Harry!”</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not
that she doesn’t like you, of course,” she added kindly to Harry while
she examined a long black-and-gold quill.</p>
<p>Harry, whose head was still full of Cho’s parting wave, did not find
this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering
with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now
he had not really registered.</p>
<p>“So that’s why she talks now?” he asked Hermione. “She never used to
talk in front of me.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Yes, I think I’ll have this one . . .”</p>
<p>She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two
Knuts, Ron still breathing down her neck.</p>
<p>“Ron,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, “this is
exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you she’s seeing Michael, she knew you’d
take it badly. So don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean, who’s taking anything badly? I’m not going to harp
on about anything . . .”</p>
<p>Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the
street. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone,
while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, “And talking
about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.</p>
<p>It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a
burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold — had
he been that obvious?</p>
<p>“Well,” said Hermione, smiling slightly, “she just couldn’t keep her
eyes off you, could she?”</p>
<p>Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of
Hogsmeade was.</p>
