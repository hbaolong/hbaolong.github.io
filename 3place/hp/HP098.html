<h4 id="chapter-four">CHAPTER FOUR</h4>
<p>NUMBER TWELVE, GRIMMAULD PLACE</p>
<p>What’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began.</p>
<p>“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re inside!”</p>
<p>He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire to
it with his wand-tip. As the message curled into flames and floated to
the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were standing
outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the
right, however, was number thirteen.</p>
<p>“But where’s — ?”</p>
<p>“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.</p>
<p>Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number
twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere
between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and
grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing
those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in
number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn’t even felt
anything.</p>
<p>“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.</p>
<p>Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly
materialized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver
door knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole
or letterbox.</p>
<p>Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard many
loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain. The
door creaked open.</p>
<p>“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go far inside and
don’t touch anything.”</p>
<p>Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of
the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the
place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his
shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks
carrying his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was standing on the top step
and releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the
streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the
front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.</p>
<p>“Here —”</p>
<p>He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as
though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that
the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.</p>
<p>“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,”
Moody whispered.</p>
<p>The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of
foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying
person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps
sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering
insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of
a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead
and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard
something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier and the
candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.</p>
<p>There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley, emerged
from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in welcome as
she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she was rather
thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her.</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into
a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining him
critically. “You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll have
to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid . . .”</p>
<p>She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently,
“He’s just arrived, the meeting’s started . . .”</p>
<p>The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement
and began filing past Harry toward the door through which Mrs. Weasley
had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held him
back.</p>
<p>“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and
Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s over
and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,” she
added in an urgent whisper.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to wake anything up.”</p>
<p>“What d’you — ?”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the
meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.”</p>
<p>Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair
of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be
another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as
though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up the
dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on
the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to
house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.</p>
<p>Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth
were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the
Darkest of wizards?</p>
<p>“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”</p>
<p>“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to
dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had reached
the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call you when
it’s over.”</p>
<p>And she hurried off downstairs again.</p>
<p>Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which
was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.</p>
<p>He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded
room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder
shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of
very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a hug that
nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed
excitedly round and round their heads.</p>
<p>“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear you arrive! Oh,
how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you
have, I know our letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell you
anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got so much to
tell you, and you’ve got to tell us — the dementors! When we heard — and
that Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve looked it all up,
they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision in the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in
life-threatening situations —”</p>
<p>“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door
behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during their
month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though
the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.</p>
<p>Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say
another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared
from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s
shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hedwig!”</p>
<p>The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as
Harry stroked her feathers.</p>
<p>“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death
when she brought your last letters, look at this —”</p>
<p>He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a
half-healed but clearly deep cut.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you
know . . .”</p>
<p>“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was going
spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were stuck all
on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us —”</p>
<p>“— swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already
said.”</p>
<p>The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best
friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his
stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid month
— he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.</p>
<p>There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig
automatically, not looking at either of the others.</p>
<p>“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breathlessly.
“Dumbledore, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks of
Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.</p>
<p>“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron
began.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either of you been
attacked by dementors this summer?”</p>
<p>“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the
Phoenix tailing you all the time —”</p>
<p>Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a
step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed
except him.</p>
<p>“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, doing his utmost
to keep his voice even. “Had to look after myself after all, didn’t
I?”</p>
<p>“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice.
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his
shift had ended. He was scary.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he hadn’t, I
wouldn’t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at
Privet Drive all summer.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic
hearing?” said Hermione quietly.</p>
<p>“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking around,
with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not
likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of
canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of
the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone
lurking out of sight snigger.</p>
<p>“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?” Harry
asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. “Did you — er —
bother to ask him at all?”</p>
<p>He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told
him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing to
improve his temper.</p>
<p>“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,” said
Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen him twice
since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us swear
not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be
intercepted —”</p>
<p>“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” Harry said
shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages
without owls.”</p>
<p>Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too. But he
didn’t want you to know anything.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, watching their
expressions.</p>
<p>“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.</p>
<p>“Or that I can’t take care of myself —”</p>
<p>“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione anxiously.</p>
<p>“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to
join in everything that’s going on here?” said Harry, the words tumbling
over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word.
“How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s going on —
?”</p>
<p>“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near the meetings,
she says we’re too young —”</p>
<p>But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.</p>
<p>“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOU’VE STILL BEEN
HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT
THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO’VE EVER
MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? WHO
GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?”</p>
<p>Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past
month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the
hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of
finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and
soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm
and zoomed even faster around their heads.</p>
<p>“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING
LAST YEAR? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!”</p>
<p>Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and
at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge of
tears.</p>
<p>“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO
TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING?”</p>
<p>“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did —” Hermione began.</p>
<p>“CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL,
BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR —”</p>
<p>“Well, he did —”</p>
<p>“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF
BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —”</p>
<p>“We wanted to —”</p>
<p>“I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP
HERE TOGETHER —”</p>
<p>“No, honest —”</p>
<p>“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now
sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious
if it was me!”</p>
<p>Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from
them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the
wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of
the floorboards below Harry’s feet.</p>
<p>“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once.</p>
<p>“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix —
?”</p>
<p>“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. “Dumbledore’s in
charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-Know-Who
last time.”</p>
<p>“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his
pockets.</p>
<p>“Quite a few people —”</p>
<p>“— we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but we think there are
more . . .”</p>
<p>Harry glared at them.</p>
<p>“Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?”</p>
<p>“Voldemort!” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced.
“What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to
stop him?”</p>
<p>“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said
Hermione nervously. “So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a
general idea —” she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face.</p>
<p>“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,” said Ron.
“They’re really useful.”</p>
<p>“Extendable — ?”</p>
<p>“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because Mum
found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them all to stop
Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum
realized what was going on. We know some of the Order are following
known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know —”</p>
<p>“— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order —”
said Hermione.</p>
<p>“— and some of them are standing guard over something,” said Ron.
“They’re always talking about guard duty.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.</p>
<p>Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but
at Ron and Hermione. “So what have you two been doing, if you’re not
allowed in meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d been busy.”</p>
<p>“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been decontaminating this
house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here. We’ve
managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I think
we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!”</p>
<p>With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers, had
materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon
twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of
the wardrobe.</p>
<p>“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as
vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We thought we heard
your dulcet tones.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all
out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There might be a couple of people fifty
miles away who didn’t hear you.”</p>
<p>“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked Harry
grumpily.</p>
<p>“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what looked like a
piece of very long, flesh-colored string.</p>
<p>“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the
stairs,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, Harry, you’re
interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,” he added in response to
Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw was
trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to hear what’s going on
downstairs.”</p>
<p>“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. “If Mum sees
one of them again . . .”</p>
<p>“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having,” said
Fred.</p>
<p>The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.</p>
<p>“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. “I
thought I heard your voice.”</p>
<p>Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with the Extendable
Ears, she’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen
door.”</p>
<p>“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen.</p>
<p>“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just chuck stuff at
the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed. I’ve
been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just
soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to
get under the gap.”</p>
<p>Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied finding out what
old Snape’s been up to.”</p>
<p>“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on
one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. “Giving a report. Top
secret.”</p>
<p>“Git,” said Fred idly.</p>
<p>“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly.</p>
<p>Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us
when he sees us . . .”</p>
<p>“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though that settled
the matter.</p>
<p>Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for
information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank onto
the bed opposite the others.</p>
<p>“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in Egypt.”</p>
<p>“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the
Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the tombs, but,” he smirked,
“there are compensations . . .”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean?”</p>
<p>“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s got a job at
Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish —”</p>
<p>“— and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” sniggered
Fred.</p>
<p>“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in
Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as
possible, so Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he had heard, the
third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International
Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly
significant looks.</p>
<p>“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” Ron
told Harry in a tense voice.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever
he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said.</p>
<p>“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly.</p>
<p>“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an
uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.</p>
<p>“What’s happened?” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row with
anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts . . .”</p>
<p>“It was the first week back after term ended,” said Ron. “We were
about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d been
promoted.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding?” said Harry.</p>
<p>Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious,
Harry’s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his
first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large
oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by
Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into a
load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They
said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed
a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn’t
going to complain . . .”</p>
<p>“So how come they promoted him?”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very keen to
keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. “He
came home really pleased with himself — even more pleased than usual if
you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been offered a position in
Fudge’s own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of
Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad to be all
impressed, I think.”</p>
<p>“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly.</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking
that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” said George.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see,” said
Fred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-Know-Who’s
back.”</p>
<p>“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with
Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” said George.</p>
<p>“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with
Dumbledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of
his Muggle obsession —”</p>
<p>“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, confused.</p>
<p>“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office
because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Harry let out a low whistle.</p>
<p>“Bet Percy loved that.”</p>
<p>Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.</p>
<p>“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of
terrible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy
reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no
ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a lot of
money, I mean —”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry
cat.</p>
<p>“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. He said Dad was
an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for
big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he — Percy —
knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and
Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make
sure everyone knew he didn’t belong to our family anymore. And he packed
his bags the same night and left. He’s living here in London now.”</p>
<p>Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of
Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to
Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — crying and
stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the
door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work — ignores
him, I s’pose.”</p>
<p>“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry slowly. “He’s not
stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without
proof —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shooting
Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the only evidence was your word and .
. . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.”</p>
<p>“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said Hermione tartly, and
the others all nodded.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking around at them
all. They were all regarding him warily.</p>
<p>“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet?” Hermione
asked nervously.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I have!” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” Hermione asked still
more anxiously.</p>
<p>“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they were going to
report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn’t
it!”</p>
<p>The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on,
“Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um
— they mention you a couple of times a week.”</p>
<p>“But I’d have seen —”</p>
<p>“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said
Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not talking about big articles. They
just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke.”</p>
<p>“What d’you — ?”</p>
<p>“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of forced
calm. “They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.”</p>
<p>“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got any choice,”
Hermione added with satisfaction. “But she laid the foundation for what
they’re trying to do now.”</p>
<p>“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently.</p>
<p>“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place
and saying your scar was hurting and all that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter’s
stories about him in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded,
attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or
something,” said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less
unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in
snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say
something like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny
accident or anything it’s ‘let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his
forehead or we’ll be asked to worship him next —’”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anyone to worship —” Harry began hotly.</p>
<p>“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. “I
know, Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you into
someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They
want wizards on the street to think you’re just some stupid boy who’s a
bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being
famous and wants to keep it going.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my parents!” Harry
spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t
kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think I’d rather
it’d never —”</p>
<p>“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly.</p>
<p>“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors
attacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that quiet.
That should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They
haven’t even reported that you broke the International Statute of
Secrecy — we thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image
of you as some stupid show-off — we think they’re biding their time
until you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go to town — I mean,
if you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on hastily, “you really
shouldn’t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there’s no case
against you.”</p>
<p>They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about
it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the
necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the
stairs.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh.”</p>
<p>Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud
crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared
in the bedroom doorway.</p>
<p>“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have dinner now,
everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And who’s left all those Dungbombs
outside the kitchen door?”</p>
<p>“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves playing with
them.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have been Kreacher, he
keeps doing odd things like that. Now don’t forget to keep your voices
down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been
doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please . . .”</p>
<p>Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room,
leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Both of them were
watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he would start
shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of them
looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.</p>
<p>“Look . . .” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said
quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame you, but
you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly.</p>
<p>He cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumbledore —
the very thought of him made Harry’s insides burn with anger again.</p>
<p>“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. Never met one like
him.”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned at Ron.</p>
<p>“He’s not a nutter, Ron —”</p>
<p>“His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a
plaque just like his mother,” said Ron irritably. “Is that normal,
Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault —”</p>
<p>Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.</p>
<p>“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew —”</p>
<p>“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly. “It’s the Society for the
Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, Dumbledore says we
should be kind to Kreacher too —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “C’mon, I’m starving.”</p>
<p>He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before they
could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” Ron breathed, flinging out an arm
to stop Harry and Hermione walking any farther. “They’re still in the
hall, we might be able to hear something —”</p>
<p>The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy
hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of
Harry’s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent
nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry
leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what Snape
was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . .</p>
<p>A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harry’s
eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously
lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people below. A
moment later, however, they began to move toward the front door and out
of sight.</p>
<p>“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear
back up again.</p>
<p>They heard the front door open and then close.</p>
<p>“Snape never eats here,” Ron told Harry quietly. “Thank God.
C’mon.”</p>
<p>“And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,”
Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw Lupin,
Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many
locks and bolts behind those who had just left.</p>
<p>“We’re eating down in the kitchen,” Mrs. Weasley whispered, meeting
them at the bottom of the stairs. “Harry, dear, if you’ll just tiptoe
across the hall, it’s through this door here —”</p>
<p>CRASH.</p>
<p>“Tonks!” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind
her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. “It’s
that stupid umbrella stand, that’s the second time I’ve tripped over
—”</p>
<p>But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting,
bloodcurdling screech.</p>
<p>The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown
apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry
thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which an old
woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being
tortured — then he realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the
most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen in his
life.</p>
<p>The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin
of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall
behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that
Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands
over his ears.</p>
<p>Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains
shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched
louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at
their faces.</p>
<p>“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants,
freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my
fathers —”</p>
<p>Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging the
huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned the
attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning
all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man with long black hair
came charging out of a door facing Harry.</p>
<p>“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the
curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned.</p>
<p>The old woman’s face blanched.</p>
<p>“Yoooou!” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man.
“Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!”</p>
<p>“I said — shut — UP!” roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he
and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again.</p>
<p>The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing silence fell.</p>
<p>Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes,
Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my mother.”</p>
