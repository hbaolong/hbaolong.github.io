<h4 id="chapter-seventeen">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h4>
<p>THE FOUR CHAMPIONS</p>
<p>Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned
to look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He
had not heard correctly.</p>
<p>There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was
starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a
better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.</p>
<p>Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and
swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to
Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning
slightly.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long
Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.</p>
<p>“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly. “You know I
didn’t.”</p>
<p>Both of them stared just as blankly back.</p>
<p>At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding
to Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”</p>
<p>“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.</p>
<p>Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled
slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff
tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem
to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds
of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight. The buzzing grew
louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front
of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him.</p>
<p>“Well . . . through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He wasn’t
smiling.</p>
<p>Harry moved off along the teachers’ table. Hagrid was seated right at
the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual
signs of greeting. He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry
as he passed like everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the
Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of
witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace
opposite him.</p>
<p>The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He
saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the
one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The
wizened witch started whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around
the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the
flames. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the
mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with
his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked
around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery
hair.</p>
<p>“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze Hall?”</p>
<p>She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn’t know how
to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the
three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.</p>
<p>There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman
entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.</p>
<p>“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely
extraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside
and addressing the other three. “May I introduce — incredible though it
may seem — the fourth Triwizard champion?”</p>
<p>Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed
Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back
again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur
Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny
joke, Meester Bagman.”</p>
<p>“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s
name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!”</p>
<p>Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking
politely bewildered. Fleur frowned.</p>
<p>“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously to
Bagman. “’E cannot compete. ’E is too young.”</p>
<p>“Well . . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and
smiling down at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction was only
imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come out
of the goblet . . . I mean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out
at this stage. . . . It’s down in the rules, you’re obliged . . . Harry
will just have to do the best he —”</p>
<p>The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came
in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor
Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape.
Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of
the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.</p>
<p>“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her
headmistress. “Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete
also!”</p>
<p>Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger.
Little boy?</p>
<p>Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable,
height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled
chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled.</p>
<p>“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said imperiously.</p>
<p>“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor
Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like
chips of ice. “Two Hogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone telling
me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the
rules carefully enough?”</p>
<p>He gave a short and nasty laugh.</p>
<p>“C’est impossible,” said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its
many superb opals was resting upon Fleur’s shoulder. “’Ogwarts cannot
’ave two champions. It is most injust.”</p>
<p>“We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out
younger contestants, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, his steely smile still
in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would,
of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our
own schools.”</p>
<p>“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly. His
black eyes were alight with malice. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for
Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever
since he arrived here —”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet,
though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy
black hair.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right
back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the
half-moon spectacles.</p>
<p>“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he asked
calmly.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him
closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the
shadows.</p>
<p>“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for
you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry vehemently.</p>
<p>“Ah, but of course ’e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now
shaking his head, his lip curling.</p>
<p>“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor McGonagall
sharply. “I am sure we are all agreed on that —”</p>
<p>“Dumbly-dorr must ’ave made a mistake wiz ze line,” said Madame
Maxime, shrugging.</p>
<p>“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!”
said Professor McGonagall angrily. “Really, what nonsense! Harry could
not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes
that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure
that should be good enough for everybody else!”</p>
<p>She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.</p>
<p>“Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous
once more, “you are our — er — objective judges. Surely you will agree
that this is most irregular?”</p>
<p>Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked
at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his
face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness
making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance.
When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice.</p>
<p>“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those
people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete
in the tournament.”</p>
<p>“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.</p>
<p>“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,”
said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His
face wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire
once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two
champions. It’s only fair, Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet
of Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next
tournament —”</p>
<p>“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!”
exploded Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and
compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have
half a mind to leave now!”</p>
<p>“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You
can’t leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to
compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient,
eh?”</p>
<p>Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with
every right step he took, there was a loud clunk.</p>
<p>“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you,
Moody.”</p>
<p>Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what
Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him
away; they had balled themselves into fists.</p>
<p>“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff.
Someone put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if
it came out.”</p>
<p>“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze
apple!” said Madame Maxime.</p>
<p>“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I
shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the
International Confederation of Wizards —”</p>
<p>“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,” growled Moody,
“but . . . funny thing . . . I don’t hear him saying a word. . . .”</p>
<p>“Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her
foot. “’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t ’e? We ’ave all been ’oping
to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand
Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for!”</p>
<p>“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,” said Moody,
with the merest trace of a growl.</p>
<p>An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was
looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet
and said, “Moody, old man . . . what a thing to say!”</p>
<p>“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he
hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,” said
Karkaroff loudly. “Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear
assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.”</p>
<p>“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing things, eh? It was a
skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that goblet. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up
her huge hands.</p>
<p>“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody.
“It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to
bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in
the tournament. . . . I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a
fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. . .
.”</p>
<p>“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,” said
Karkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course,
I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday
presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to
pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. So you’ll understand if
we don’t take you entirely seriously. . . .”</p>
<p>“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,”
Moody retorted in a menacing voice. “It’s my job to think the way Dark
wizards do, Karkaroff — as you ought to remember. . . .”</p>
<p>“Alastor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment
whom he was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be
Moody’s real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying
Karkaroff with satisfaction — Karkaroff’s face was burning.</p>
<p>“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking
to everyone gathered in the room. “It seems to me, however, that we have
no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to
compete in the tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . . .”</p>
<p>“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr —”</p>
<p>“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be
delighted to hear it.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely
glared. She wasn’t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff
livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited.</p>
<p>“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his hands together
and smiling around the room. “Got to give our champions their
instructions, haven’t we? Barty, want to do the honors?”</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .”</p>
<p>He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he
looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery
look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch
World Cup.</p>
<p>“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told Harry,
Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, “so we are not going to be telling you what
it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a
wizard . . . very important. . . .</p>
<p>“The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in
front of the other students and the panel of judges.</p>
<p>“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any
kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The
champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands.
They will receive information about the second task when the first is
over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the
tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests.”</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with
mild concern. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts
tonight, Barty?”</p>
<p>“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,” said Mr. Crouch.
“It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment. . . . I’ve left
young Weatherby in charge. . . . Very enthusiastic . . . a little
overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . . .”</p>
<p>“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?” said
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Come on, Barty, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly. “It’s all
happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the
office!”</p>
<p>“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his old
impatience.</p>
<p>“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap?” said
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s shoulders
and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both
talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall.
Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in
silence.</p>
<p>“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said Dumbledore, smiling
at both of them. “I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to
celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this
excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.”</p>
<p>Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.</p>
<p>The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving
the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.</p>
<p>“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing against each
other again!”</p>
<p>“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of anything to say.
The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his
brain had been ransacked.</p>
<p>“So . . . tell me . . .” said Cedric as they reached the entrance
hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of
Fire. “How did you get your name in?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put it in. I was
telling the truth.”</p>
<p>“Ah . . . okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe
him. “Well . . . see you, then.”</p>
<p>Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to
its right. Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps
beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones.</p>
<p>Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would
they all think he’d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could
anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who’d had three years’
more magical education than he had — when he was now facing tasks that
not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front
of hundreds of people? Yes, he’d thought about it . . . he’d fantasized
about it . . . but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream . .
. he’d never really, seriously considered entering. . . .</p>
<p>But someone else had considered it . . . someone else had wanted him
in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a
treat? He didn’t think so, somehow. . . .</p>
<p>To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get
their wish. . . .</p>
<p>But to get him killed?</p>
<p>Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn’t someone have
put Harry’s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone
really want him dead?</p>
<p>Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead,
someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old . . . Lord
Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s name got
into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some
distant country, in hiding, alone . . . feeble and powerless. . . .</p>
<p>Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar
hurting, Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talking to
Wormtail . . . plotting Harry’s murder. . . .</p>
<p>Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had
barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise
to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had
flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions
downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have
dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here
before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the
keenest interest.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told me
everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”</p>
<p>“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.</p>
<p>“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.</p>
<p>“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and
she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.</p>
<p>The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened
almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched
inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing
the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding,
and whistling.</p>
<p>“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half
annoyed, half deeply impressed.</p>
<p>“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared
George.</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how —”</p>
<p>But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh if it couldn’t be me,
at least it’s a Gryffindor —”</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match,
Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.</p>
<p>“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some —”</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast —”</p>
<p>But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to
hear that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person
seemed to have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate. .
. . Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he
insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get
away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the
dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another
butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . .
Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked
Dumbledore’s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet. . .
.</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it
happened.”</p>
<p>But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have
answered at all.</p>
<p>“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. “No,
seriously, George — I’m going to bed —”</p>
<p>He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit
of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room.
Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little
Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the
stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the
dormitory as fast as he could.</p>
<p>To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the
otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry
slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>“Where’ve you been?” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Oh hello,” said Ron.</p>
<p>He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry
suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor
banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it
was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching
Harry struggle to remove it.</p>
<p>“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown
it into a corner. “Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry, staring at Ron. There
was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more
like a grimace.</p>
<p>“Well . . . no one else got across the Age Line,” said Ron. “Not even
Fred and George. What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak?”</p>
<p>“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that line,” said
Harry slowly.</p>
<p>“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me if it was the
Cloak . . . because it would’ve covered both of us, wouldn’t it? But you
found another way, did you?”</p>
<p>“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that goblet. Someone
else must’ve done it.”</p>
<p>Ron raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“What would they do that for?”</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to
say, “To kill me.”</p>
<p>Ron’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing
into his hair.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he said. “If you
don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re
bothering to lie, you didn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That
friend of the Fat Lady’s, that Violet, she’s already told us all
Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And
you don’t have to do end-of-year tests either. . . .”</p>
<p>“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry, starting to feel
angry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same skeptical tone as Cedric.
“Only you said this morning you’d have done it last night, and no one
would’ve seen you. . . . I’m not stupid, you know.”</p>
<p>“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or
otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect
you’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”</p>
<p>He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry
standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now
hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.</p>
