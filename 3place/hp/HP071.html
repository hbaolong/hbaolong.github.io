<h4 id="chapter-fourteen">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h4>
<p>THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES</p>
<p>The next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted
Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who
seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer,
gave Neville detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of
nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned
toads.</p>
<p>“You know why Snape’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said Ron to
Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to
remove the toad guts from under his fingernails.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “Moody.”</p>
<p>It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job,
and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had
disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it — but he
seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody.
Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or
when they passed in the corridors — he had the distinct impression that
Snape was avoiding Moody’s eye, whether magical or normal.</p>
<p>“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,” Harry said
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,” said Ron, his
eyes misting over, “and bounced him all around his dungeon. . . .”</p>
<p>The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody’s first
lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued
up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person
missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.</p>
<p>“Been in the —”</p>
<p>“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her. “C’mon, quick, or we
won’t get decent seats.”</p>
<p>They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher’s desk,
took out their copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection,
and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive
clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room,
looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his
clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.</p>
<p>“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over to his desk and
sitting down, “those books. You won’t need them.”</p>
<p>They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.</p>
<p>Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair
out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his
normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled
around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered.</p>
<p>“Right then,” he said, when the last person had declared themselves
present, “I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems
you’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures —
you’ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and
werewolves, is that right?”</p>
<p>There was a general murmur of assent.</p>
<p>“But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses,” said
Moody. “So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to
each other. I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark —”</p>
<p>“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.</p>
<p>Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely
apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the first time Harry had
seen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look
more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to
know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply
relieved.</p>
<p>“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said. “Your father got me
out of a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I’m staying just
the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back
to my quiet retirement.”</p>
<p>He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands
together.</p>
<p>“So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and
forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed to teach
you countercurses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you
what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in the sixth year.
You’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then. But
Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons
you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up against, the
better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve
never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t
going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice
and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert
and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m
talking.”</p>
<p>Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her
completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could
see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.</p>
<p>“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished
by Wizarding law?”</p>
<p>Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and
Hermione’s. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed
on Lavender.</p>
<p>“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it
called the Imperius Curse, or something?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father would know that
one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius
Curse.”</p>
<p>Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around
inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him — Ron hated
spiders.</p>
<p>Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in
the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his
wand at it and muttered, “Imperio!”</p>
<p>The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and began
to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out
its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing
on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his
wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what
was unmistakably a tap dance.</p>
<p>Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.</p>
<p>“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if
I did it to you?”</p>
<p>The laughter died away almost instantly.</p>
<p>“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up
and began to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the
window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats . . .”</p>
<p>Ron gave an involuntary shudder.</p>
<p>“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled
by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about
the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the
Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was
acting of their own free will.</p>
<p>“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but
it takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better
avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and
everyone jumped.</p>
<p>Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the
jar.</p>
<p>“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight
surprise, did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually
volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best
subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring.</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on
Neville.</p>
<p>“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but
distinct voice.</p>
<p>Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both
eyes.</p>
<p>“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping down to
check the register again.</p>
<p>Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries.
Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next
spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless,
apparently too scared to move.</p>
<p>“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger for you
to get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider.
“Engorgio!”</p>
<p>The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning
all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s
desk as possible.</p>
<p>Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered,
“Crucio!”</p>
<p>At once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and
began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from
it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have
been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to
shudder and jerk more violently —</p>
<p>“Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly.</p>
<p>Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but
at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville’s hands were
clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes
wide and horrified.</p>
<p>Moody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but it continued to
twitch.</p>
<p>“Reducio,” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper
size. He put it back into the jar.</p>
<p>“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to
torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one
was very popular once too.</p>
<p>“Right . . . anyone know any others?”</p>
<p>Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed
they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider.
Hermione’s hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it
into the air.</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her.</p>
<p>“Avada Kedavra,” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth.
“Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra . . . the Killing Curse.”</p>
<p>He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what
was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of
the jar, trying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed
it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden
surface.</p>
<p>Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of
foreboding.</p>
<p>“Avada Kedavra!” Moody roared.</p>
<p>There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as
though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air —
instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but
unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown
himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded
toward him.</p>
<p>Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no
countercurse. There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever
survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me.”</p>
<p>Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into
his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry
stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not
really seeing it at all. . . .</p>
<p>So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider.
Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the
flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life
was wiped from their bodies?</p>
<p>Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for
three years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever
since he’d found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed
his parents’ whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at
their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James
Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take
Harry and run . . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to
move aside so that he could kill Harry . . . how she had begged him to
kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son . . . and so
Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry. . .
.</p>
<p>Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ voices
when he had fought the dementors last year — for that was the terrible
power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst
memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair. . .
.</p>
<p>Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry.
With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and
listened to what Moody was saying.</p>
<p>“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it
— you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the
words, and I doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn’t
matter. I’m not here to teach you how to do it.</p>
<p>“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because
you’ve got to know. You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You
don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you’re facing it.
CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again.</p>
<p>“Now . . . those three curses — Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and
Cruciatus — are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of
them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in
Azkaban. That’s what you’re up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach
you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you
need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills
. . . copy this down. . . .”</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the
Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang — but when Moody
had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk
burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices —
“Did you see it twitch?” “— and when he killed it — just like that!”</p>
<p>They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had
been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn’t found it very
entertaining — and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.</p>
<p>“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.</p>
<p>“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage.
“Neville.”</p>
<p>Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the
stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had
worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.</p>
<p>“Neville?” Hermione said gently.</p>
<p>Neville looked around.</p>
<p>“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual. “Interesting
lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m — I’m starving,
aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high
voice. “Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for
eating?”</p>
<p>Ron gave Harry a startled look.</p>
<p>“Neville, what — ?”</p>
<p>But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see
Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent,
watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower
and gentler growl than they had yet heard.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up
to my office? Come on . . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .”</p>
<p>Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with
Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon
Harry.</p>
<p>“You all right, are you, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly.</p>
<p>Moody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed
Harry. Then he said, “You’ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but
you’ve got to know. No point pretending . . . well . . . come on,
Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.”</p>
<p>Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they
didn’t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be
steered away, one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the
corner.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.</p>
<p>“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they set off for the
Great Hall. “Fred and George were right, weren’t they? He really knows
his stuff, Moody, doesn’t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that
spider just died, just snuffed it right —”</p>
<p>But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s face and didn’t
speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed
they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions
tonight, since they would take hours.</p>
<p>Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s conversation during
dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again.
Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been
thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of
the Unforgivable Curses himself.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if
they knew we’d seen the curses?” Harry asked as they approached the Fat
Lady.</p>
<p>“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always done things his
way, hasn’t he, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon.
Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins.
Balderdash.”</p>
<p>The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they
climbed into the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and
noisy.</p>
<p>“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“I s’pose,” Ron groaned.</p>
<p>They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to
find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good
deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely
normal. His eyes were rather red.</p>
<p>“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book
Professor Moody lent me. . . .”</p>
<p>He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at
Herbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice
that Harry had rarely heard there before. “He thought I’d like
this.”</p>
<p>Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had
been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely
heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor
Lupin would have done.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to
the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for
the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress,
though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and
symbols, and Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled
with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.</p>
<p>“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said,
staring down at a long list of calculations.</p>
<p>“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times
he had run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to
the old Divination standby.”</p>
<p>“What — make it up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the
table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.</p>
<p>“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to develop a
cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.” He looked
up at Harry. “You know her — just put in loads of misery, she’ll lap it
up.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it
over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire. “Okay
. . . on Monday, I will be in danger of — er — burns.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the skrewts again
on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll . . . erm . . .”</p>
<p>“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking through
Unfogging the Future for ideas.</p>
<p>“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of . . . erm . . .
Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought
was a friend?”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . cool . . .” said Harry, scribbling it down, “because . .
. Venus is in the twelfth house.”</p>
<p>“And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a fight.”</p>
<p>“Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a bet.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. . . .”</p>
<p>They continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more
tragic) for another hour, while the common room around them slowly
emptied as people went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them,
leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry,
rather as Hermione might look if she knew they weren’t doing their
homework properly.</p>
<p>Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he
hadn’t yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the
opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of
parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a
corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of
things and the noisy center of attention. There was something secretive
about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was
reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the
Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys’
Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t look like that this time; if it had been,
they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered
whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard
Tournament.</p>
<p>As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out
something with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that
nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room, “No — that sounds
like we’re accusing him. Got to be careful . . .”</p>
<p>Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and
quickly returned to his predictions — he didn’t want George to think he
was eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their
parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.</p>
<p>Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait
hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf
of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked
in the other. Crookshanks arched his back, purring.</p>
<p>“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”</p>
<p>“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty
armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions toward her.</p>
<p>“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she said sardonically
as Crookshanks curled up in her lap.</p>
<p>“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.</p>
<p>“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions. “I’d better
change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said
Hermione.</p>
<p>“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve been working like
house-elves here!”</p>
<p>Hermione raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily.</p>
<p>Harry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his
own death by decapitation.</p>
<p>“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.</p>
<p>“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She
took off the lid and showed them the contents.</p>
<p>Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all
bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.</p>
<p>“‘Spew’?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. “What’s
this about?”</p>
<p>“Not spew,” said Hermione impatiently. “It’s S-P-E-W. Stands for the
Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.”</p>
<p>“Never heard of it,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly, “I’ve only just
started it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise. “How many members have you
got?”</p>
<p>“Well — if you two join — three,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying ‘spew,’
do you?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly. “I was going to put Stop the
Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a
Change in Their Legal Status — but it wouldn’t fit. So that’s the
heading of our manifesto.”</p>
<p>She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.</p>
<p>“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement
goes back centuries. I can’t believe no one’s done anything about it
before now.”</p>
<p>“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It. They
like being enslaved!”</p>
<p>“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than
Ron, and acting as though she hadn’t heard a word, “are to secure
house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims
include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf
into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures,
because they’re shockingly underrepresented.”</p>
<p>“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily. “I thought
two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our
leaflet campaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a collecting tin
upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary, so you might want to write down
everything I’m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.”</p>
<p>There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and
Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the
look on Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case
looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap
on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw,
illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.</p>
<p>“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and
across the room to pull open the window.</p>
<p>Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table
on top of Harry’s predictions.</p>
<p>“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.</p>
<p>“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby
piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.</p>
<p>Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig
fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly.</p>
<p>“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled
in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:</p>
<p>Harry —</p>
<p>I’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest
in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts
again, go straight to Dumbledore — they’re saying he’s got Mad-Eye out
of retirement, which means he’s reading the signs, even if no one else
is.</p>
<p>I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes
open, Harry.</p>
<p>Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.</p>
<p>“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s coming back?”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking perplexed.
“Harry — what’s up?”</p>
<p>For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting
Hedwig out of his lap.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously.</p>
<p>“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise.</p>
<p>“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now slamming
his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair,
hooting indignantly. “Coming back, because he thinks I’m in trouble! And
there’s nothing wrong with me! And I haven’t got anything for you,”
Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, “you’ll
have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.”</p>
<p>Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open
window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she
went.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.</p>
<p>“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the morning.”</p>
<p>Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his
four-poster, but he didn’t feel remotely tired.</p>
<p>If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry’s, fault.
Why hadn’t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds’ pain and he’d had to
blab. . . . If he’d just had the sense to keep it to himself. . . .</p>
<p>He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did
not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark
canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been
less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of
Neville’s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying
awake.</p>
