<h4 id="chapter-thirty">CHAPTER THIRTY</h4>
<p>THE WHITE TOMB</p>
<p>All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students
were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of
days — the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning
following Dumbledore’s death, and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the
castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other
hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a
shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed
that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in
finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and
witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last
respects to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never
seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled
by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the
late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest.
Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned,
black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into
the waiting Hagrid’s arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials,
including the Minister of Magic himself, was being accommodated within
the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he
was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for
Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all of their time
together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine
how it would have been if Dumbledore had not died, and they had had this
time together at the very end of the year, Ginny’s examinations
finished, the pressure of homework lifted . . . and hour by hour, he put
off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew was
right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of
comfort.</p>
<p>They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been
discharged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were
as bad as ever — in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye
Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he
seemed just the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that
he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.</p>
<p>“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily,
plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I
’ave always said this.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going
to marry her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room,
looking out over the twilit grounds.</p>
<p>“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily,
as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”</p>
<p>“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.</p>
<p>Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,” she said
reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape
but no sign . . .”</p>
<p>“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time this
subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and
seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .”</p>
<p>“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that
well since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”</p>
<p>She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two,
and departed for the girls’ dormitories. The moment the door had closed
behind her, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a most
Hermione-ish look on her face.</p>
<p>“Harry, I found something out this morning, in the library.”</p>
<p>“R.A.B.?” said Harry, sitting up straight.</p>
<p>He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited,
curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that
the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be
completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and
winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore
had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to
journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there
somewhere, and each would need to be found and eliminated before there
was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting
their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them
within reach: the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something
of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the
snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s . . .</p>
<p>This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as he fell asleep at
night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious
objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully
offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to
climb. . . .</p>
<p>He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after
Dumbledore’s death, and although she had not immediately recognized the
initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been
reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more
often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to
do.</p>
<p>“No,” she said sadly, “I’ve been trying, Harry, but I haven’t found
anything. . . . There are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with
those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert ‘Axebanger’
Brookstanton . . . but they don’t seem to fit at all. Judging by that
note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find
a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with
him. . . . No, actually, it’s about . . . well, Snape.”</p>
<p>She looked nervous even saying the name again.</p>
<p>“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his
chair.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince
business,” she said tentatively.</p>
<p>“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I feel about that
now?”</p>
<p>“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking
around to check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I
was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she
was Snape’s mother!”</p>
<p>“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored
him.</p>
<p>“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a
tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias
Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a
—”</p>
<p>“— murderer,” spat Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape
must have been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was
a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so
he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just
like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his
parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave
himself an impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince
— how could Dumbledore have missed — ?”</p>
<p>He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself
dwelling upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as
Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken
in just the same. . . . In spite of the increasing nastiness of those
scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been
so clever, who had helped him so much. . . .</p>
<p>Helped him . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.</p>
<p>“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,”
said Ron. “He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”</p>
<p>“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectumsempra. He
didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before
then, with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . .
Shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should
he?”</p>
<p>“But why didn’t he turn you in?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book,” said
Hermione. “I don’t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if
he’d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn
would have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in
Snape’s old classroom, and I’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was
called ‘Prince.’”</p>
<p>“I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “All that
time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at
school, and I had proof Snape was too —”</p>
<p>“‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly.</p>
<p>“You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much blame on
yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor,
but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer. . . .”</p>
<p>“None of us could’ve guessed Snape would . . . you know,” said
Ron.</p>
<p>Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts,
but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the
following morning, when Dumbledore’s body would be laid to rest. He had
never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when
Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried
about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether
Dumbledore’s death would be more real to him once it was over. Though he
had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him,
there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that
nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still
found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone.
Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for
some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back. . . .
He felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he
now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of
what it had cost and what remained still to do.</p>
<p>Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be
leaving an hour after the funeral. Downstairs, he found the mood in the
Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one
seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair
in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid’s chair was deserted too;
Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast, but
Snape’s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry
avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the
uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among
Scrimgeour’s entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed
glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy,
apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.</p>
<p>Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together.
Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the
tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry had
not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he
had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy’s voice on that tower top, nor the
fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived.
Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He
despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now
the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry
wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making him do under
threat of killing him and his parents?</p>
<p>Harry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny.
Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet, and the mournful hum in the
Hall died away at once.</p>
<p>“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads of Houses
out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.”</p>
<p>They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry
glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing
magnificent, long, emerald green robes embroidered with silver. He had
never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean;
there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the
entrance hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a
thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and
tie reeking of mothballs.</p>
<p>They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone
steps from the front doors, toward the lake. The warmth of the sun
caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to
the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle
ran down the center of them: There was a marble table standing at the
front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer’s day.</p>
<p>An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half
of the chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not
recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the
Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair
miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she
seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by
Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black
dragon skin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half
chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London;
Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the
Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight
Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people
whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head
and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle
ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight,
discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the
gleaming air.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row
beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a
breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd
continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them,
Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. Neville and Luna
alone of the D.A. had responded to Hermione’s summons the night that
Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: They were the ones who had
missed the D.A. most . . . probably the ones who had checked their coins
regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting.</p>
<p>Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expression
miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognized
Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in
her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores
Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a
black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls. At the sight of the
centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water’s edge,
she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance
away.</p>
<p>The staff was seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking
grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He
wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really
sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he heard music, strange,
otherworldly music, and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking
around for the source of it. He was not the only one: Many heads were
turning, searching, a little alarmed.</p>
<p>“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear.</p>
<p>And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the
surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi: a chorus of merpeople
singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces
rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made
the hair on Harry’s neck stand up, and yet it was not unpleasant. It
spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the
wild faces of the singers, he had the feeling that they, at least, were
sorry for Dumbledore’s passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he
looked around.</p>
<p>Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was
crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms,
wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew
to be Dumbledore’s body. A sharp pain rose in Harry’s throat at this
sight: For a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that
Dumbledore’s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day.
Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into
both Ginny’s and Hermione’s laps.</p>
<p>They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid
seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he
retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises
that drew scandalized looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores
Umbridge . . . but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He
tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid’s
eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going.
Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized
what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each
the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly
boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to
his half-brother, and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his
chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to
laugh. But then the music stopped, and he turned to face the front
again.</p>
<p>A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet
and stood now in front of Dumbledore’s body. Harry could not hear what
he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of
heads. “Nobility of spirit” . . . “intellectual contribution” . . .
“greatness of heart” . . . It did not mean very much. It had little to
do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered
Dumbledore’s idea of a few words, “nitwit,” “oddment,” “blubber,” and
“tweak,” and again had to suppress a grin. . . . What was the matter
with him?</p>
<p>There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the
merpeople had broken the surface to listen too. He remembered Dumbledore
crouching at the water’s edge two years ago, very close to where Harry
now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry
wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had
never asked him, so much he should have said. . . .</p>
<p>And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth,
more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was
dead, gone. . . . He clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly
that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes:
He looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake,
toward the forest, as the little man in black droned on. . . . There was
movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects
too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them standing quite
still, half hidden in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging
at their sides. And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the
forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then
Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had
discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was
important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep
fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite
eradicated. . . .</p>
<p>And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how
people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his
mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all
determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let
anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever
the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the shelter
of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no
waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was
safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest
of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been
before.</p>
<p>The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his
seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected
speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.</p>
<p>Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around
Dumbledore’s body and the table upon which it lay: Higher and higher
they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiraled into the air and
made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that
he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire
had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing
Dumbledore’s body and the table on which he had rested.</p>
<p>There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared
through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry
knew, the centaurs’ tribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back
into the cool trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank slowly back into the
green water and were lost from view.</p>
<p>Harry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: Ron’s face was screwed up
as though the sunlight were blinding him. Hermione’s face was glazed
with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry’s gaze with
the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him
after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that
moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her
what he was going to do now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t
do it,” but accept his decision, because she would not have expected
anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known
he must say ever since Dumbledore had died.</p>
<p>“Ginny, listen . . .” he said very quietly, as the buzz of
conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their
feet, “I can’t be involved with you anymore. We’ve got to stop seeing
each other. We can’t be together.”</p>
<p>She said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some stupid, noble
reason, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s been like . . . like something out of someone else’s life,
these last few weeks with you,” said Harry. “But I can’t . . . we can’t
. . . I’ve got things to do alone now.”</p>
<p>She did not cry, she simply looked at him.</p>
<p>“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already used
you as bait once, and that was just because you’re my best friend’s
sister. Think how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. He’ll
know, he’ll find out. He’ll try and get to me through you.”</p>
<p>“What if I don’t care?” said Ginny fiercely.</p>
<p>“I care,” said Harry. “How do you think I’d feel if this was your
funeral . . . and it was my fault. . . .”</p>
<p>She looked away from him, over the lake.</p>
<p>“I never really gave up on you,” she said. “Not really. I always
hoped. . . . Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with
some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be
able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you
might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — myself.”</p>
<p>“Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry, trying to smile. “I just
wish I’d asked you sooner. We could’ve had ages . . . months . . . years
maybe. . . .”</p>
<p>“But you’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world,” said Ginny,
half laughing. “Well . . . I can’t say I’m surprised. I knew this would
happen in the end. I knew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting
Voldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so much.”</p>
<p>Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his
resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw,
was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his
shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a
miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on
Dumbledore’s tomb, and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much
more bearable than sitting still, just as setting out as soon as
possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel
better than waiting to do it. . . .</p>
<p>“Harry!”</p>
<p>He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the
bank, leaning on his walking stick.</p>
<p>“I’ve been hoping to have a word . . . do you mind if I walk a little
way with you?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again.</p>
<p>“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour quietly. “I
cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very
great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows
better than I —”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” asked Harry flatly.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily modified his
expression to one of sorrowful understanding.</p>
<p>“You are, of course, devastated,” he said. “I know that you were very
close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever.
The bond between the two of you —”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a halt.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at Harry, his
expression shrewd now.</p>
<p>“The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night
that he died.”</p>
<p>“Whose word?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after
Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry
can add two and two, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it,” said Harry. “Well, where I went with Dumbledore
and what we did is my business. He didn’t want people to know.”</p>
<p>“Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said Scrimgeour, who seemed
to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, “but Dumbledore is
gone, Harry. He’s gone.”</p>
<p>“He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to
him,” said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.</p>
<p>“My dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from the —”</p>
<p>“I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. But I’ve got
nothing to tell you.”</p>
<p>Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently supposed to be
a tone of delicacy, “The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection,
you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at
your service —”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Voldemort wants to kill me himself, and Aurors won’t
stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.”</p>
<p>“So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the request I made of you
at Christmas —”</p>
<p>“What request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the world what a
great job you’re doing in exchange for —”</p>
<p>“— for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped Scrimgeour.</p>
<p>Harry considered him for a moment.</p>
<p>“Released Stan Shunpike yet?”</p>
<p>Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of Uncle
Vernon.</p>
<p>“I see you are —”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’s man through and through,” said Harry. “That’s
right.”</p>
<p>Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped
away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the
Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the
sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and
Hermione were hurrying toward Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the
opposite direction. Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them
to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under
which they had sat in happier times.</p>
<p>“What did Scrimgeour want?” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry. “Wanted me to give
him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry’s new poster
boy.”</p>
<p>Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly
to Hermione, “Look, let me go back and hit Percy!”</p>
<p>“No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm.</p>
<p>“It’ll make me feel better!”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded
as she looked up at the castle.</p>
<p>“I can’t bear the idea that we might never come back,” she said
softly. “How can Hogwarts close?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it won’t,” said Ron. “We’re not in any more danger here than
we are at home, are we? Everywhere’s the same now. I’d even say Hogwarts
is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What d’you
reckon, Harry?”</p>
<p>“I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew you were going to
say that. But then what will you do?”</p>
<p>“I’m going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because Dumbledore wanted
me to,” said Harry. “But it’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone
for good.”</p>
<p>“But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?”</p>
<p>“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry muttered. He
had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledore’s death.
“For me, it started there, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to
go there. And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.”</p>
<p>“And then what?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I?”
said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore’s white tomb, reflected in the
water on the other side of the lake. “That’s what he wanted me to do,
that’s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right — and I’m
sure he was — there are still four of them out there. I’ve got to find
them and destroy them, and then I’ve got to go after the seventh bit of
Voldemort’s soul, the bit that’s still in his body, and I’m the one
who’s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape along the way,” he
added, “so much the better for me, so much the worse for him.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the
stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he
cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the
water.</p>
<p>“We’ll be there, Harry,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“At your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Ron. “And then we’ll go with
you wherever you’re going.”</p>
<p>“No —” said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant
them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey
alone.</p>
<p>“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, “that there was
time to turn back if we wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But mate, you’re going
to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else,
even Godric’s Hollow.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?”</p>
<p>Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a
wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally.</p>
<p>His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite
of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching
ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew
must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart
lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace
left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.</p>

<p>Oh, the torment bred in the race,</p>
<p>the grinding scream of death</p>
<p>and the stroke that hits the vein,</p>
<p>the hemorrhage none can staunch, the grief,</p>
<p>the curse no man can bear.</p>
<p>But there is a cure in the house,</p>
<p>and not outside it, no,</p>
<p>not from others but from them,</p>
<p>their bloody strife. We sing to you,</p>
<p>dark gods beneath the earth.</p>
<p>Now hear, you blissful powers underground —</p>
<p>answer the call, send help.</p>
<p>Bless the children, give them triumph now.</p>
<p>Aeschylus, The Libation Bearers</p>
<p>Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in
one another still. For they must needs be present, that love and live in
that which is omnipresent. In this divine glass, they see face to face;
and their converse is free, as well as pure. This is the comfort of
friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and
society are, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal.</p>
