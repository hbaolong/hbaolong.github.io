<h4 id="chapter-twenty-one">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h4>
<p>THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find
Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he
had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled
Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked
at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they
entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it
all along.</p>
<p>“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy said on the train,
about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew
each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the
World Cup. . . . I’ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was
Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling
really stupid now, isn’t he? Didn’t work, did it? You only got a
scratch! Come here — I’ll do it —”</p>
<p>Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying
around and around Harry’s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched
Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the
letter to his leg.</p>
<p>“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that
dangerous, how could they be?” Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to
the window. “You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament,
Harry, I’m serious.”</p>
<p>Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior
of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione,
however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at
Ron.</p>
<p>“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,”
she said seriously. “If that was the first task, I hate to think what’s
coming next.”</p>
<p>“Right little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” said Ron. “You and
Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.”</p>
<p>He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve
feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached
to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual — Harry hadn’t been
able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he
had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon
disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, “Well, we’d better get
downstairs for your surprise party, Harry — Fred and George should have
nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded
with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons
of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off
some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and
sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some
impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the
Horntail’s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his
head on fire.</p>
<p>Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was
like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He
couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d
gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second
one for three months.</p>
<p>“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg,
which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. “Open it,
Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”</p>
<p>“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said
swiftly. “It’s in the tournament rules. . . .”</p>
<p>“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own
too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned
rather guiltily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.</p>
<p>Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the
groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.</p>
<p>It was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry opened it,
the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room.
The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at
Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the
musical saw.</p>
<p>“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.</p>
<p>“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry
slammed it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee. . . . Maybe you’ve got
to get past one of those next, Harry!”</p>
<p>“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone very
white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. “You’re going to
have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George. “They
wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded
a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s
in the shower, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.</p>
<p>Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred
grinned.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” he said. “I haven’t done anything to them. It’s the
custard creams you’ve got to watch —”</p>
<p>Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it
out. Fred laughed.</p>
<p>“Just my little joke, Neville. . . .”</p>
<p>Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, “Did you get all this from
the kitchens, Fred?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak
and imitated a house-elf. “‘Anything we can get you, sir, anything at
all!’ They’re dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said I was
peckish.”</p>
<p>“How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an innocently casual sort
of voice.</p>
<p>“Easy,” said Fred, “concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of
fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and —” He stopped and looked
suspiciously at her. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly.</p>
<p>“Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?”
said George. “Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir
them up into rebellion?”</p>
<p>Several people chortled. Hermione didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve got to take
clothes and salaries!” said Fred warningly. “You’ll put them off their
cooking!”</p>
<p>Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large
canary.</p>
<p>“Oh — sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the laughter. “I forgot
— it was the custard creams we hexed —”</p>
<p>Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers
had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in
laughing.</p>
<p>“Canary Creams!” Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. “George and I
invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!”</p>
<p>It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the
dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the
curtains of his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model of the
Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled
up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the
hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point . . . they were
all right, really, dragons. . . .</p>
<p>The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty
though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and
thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which
was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the
dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty
chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime’s horses well
provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes
wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to
make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was
unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed
their wits about them.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid told the
shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. “Thought we’d
jus’ try an’ see if they fancied a kip . . . we’ll jus’ settle ’em down
in these boxes. . . .”</p>
<p>There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill
one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now
approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful,
scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their
suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry
had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes
Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.</p>
<p>“We’ll jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the lids on, and
we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not
appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid
was soon yelling, “Don’ panic, now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts
rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering
wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in
the lead — had fled into Hagrid’s cabin through the back door and
barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among
those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed
to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of
numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.</p>
<p>“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their
wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing
menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. “Jus’
try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so he won’ hurt any o’ the
others!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry
backed into the wall of Hagrid’s cabin, still holding the skrewt off
with their sparks.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well . . . this does look like fun.”</p>
<p>Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid’s garden fence, looking in at the
mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar
today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.</p>
<p>Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was
cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of
its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.</p>
<p>“Who’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope
around the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.</p>
<p>“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” Rita replied, beaming at him.
Her gold teeth glinted.</p>
<p>“Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside the school
anymore,” said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly
squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.</p>
<p>Rita acted as though she hadn’t heard what Hagrid had said.</p>
<p>“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she asked, beaming
still more widely.</p>
<p>“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” grunted Hagrid.</p>
<p>“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. “I’ve never
heard of them before . . . where do they come from?”</p>
<p>Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid’s wild black
beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from?
Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly,
“They’re very interesting, aren’t they? Aren’t they, Harry?”</p>
<p>“What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,” said Harry as she
stepped on his foot.</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re here, Harry!” said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. “So
you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite
lessons?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.</p>
<p>“Lovely,” said Rita. “Really lovely. Been teaching long?” she added
to Hagrid.</p>
<p>Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across
one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was
nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where
most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting
to see if the coast was clear.</p>
<p>“This is on’y me second year,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>“Lovely . . . I don’t suppose you’d like to give an interview, would
you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet
does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I’m sure you know. We could
feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.”</p>
<p>“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly. “Er — yeah, why not?”</p>
<p>Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of
communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to
stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements
to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that
week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the
lesson.</p>
<p>“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set
off with Ron and Hermione. “Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!”</p>
<p>“She’ll twist everything he says,” Harry said under his breath.</p>
<p>“Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts illegally or
anything,” said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another — it
was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.</p>
<p>“Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore’s never
sacked him,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll
have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant
best.”</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went
off to lunch.</p>
<p>Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were
still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were
friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor
Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had
been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as
they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which
Pluto could disrupt everyday life.</p>
<p>“I would think,” she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal
her obvious annoyance, “that some of us” — she stared very meaningfully
at Harry — “might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have
seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my
needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I
settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . .
and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?”</p>
<p>“An ugly old bat in outsize specs?” Ron muttered under his
breath.</p>
<p>Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.</p>
<p>“Death, my dears.”</p>
<p>Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking
horrified.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, “it comes,
ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever
lower over the castle. . . .”</p>
<p>She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and
obviously.</p>
<p>“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it about eighty
times before,” Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the
staircase beneath Professor Trelawney’s room. “But if I’d dropped dead
every time she’s told me I’m going to, I’d be a medical miracle.”</p>
<p>“You’d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,” said Ron, chortling,
as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his
wide eyes staring sinisterly. “At least we didn’t get homework. I hope
Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is.
. . .”</p>
<p>But Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they
went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor
Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum,
debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph —
but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next
row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his
enthusiasm for the idea.</p>
<p>“Wonder where she’s got to?” Ron said as he and Harry went back to
Gryffindor Tower.</p>
<p>“Dunno . . . balderdash.”</p>
<p>But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of
racing feet behind them announced Hermione’s arrival.</p>
<p>“Harry!” she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady
stared down at her, eyebrows raised). “Harry, you’ve got to come —
you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened — please —”</p>
<p>She seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him back along the
corridor.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Harry said.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick —”</p>
<p>Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with
Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.</p>
<p>“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after them. “Don’t
apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang here, wide open, until you
get back, shall I?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led them
down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the
entrance hall.</p>
<p>“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.</p>
<p>She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the
door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of
Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been
through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone
steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the
one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone
corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful
paintings that were mainly of food.</p>
<p>“Oh hang on . . .” said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor.
“Wait a minute, Hermione. . . .”</p>
<p>“What?” She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her
face.</p>
<p>“I know what this is about,” said Harry.</p>
<p>He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It
showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.</p>
<p>“Hermione!” said Ron, cottoning on. “You’re trying to rope us into
that spew stuff again!”</p>
<p>“No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily. “And it’s not spew, Ron —”</p>
<p>“Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at her. “What are we
now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I’m not barging into that
kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I’m not doing it —”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to!” Hermione said impatiently. “I came down here
just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come on, Harry, I want
to show you!”</p>
<p>She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the
giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge
green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a
large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and
pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.</p>
<p>He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large
as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and
pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the
other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of
the room, squealing, “Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing
elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his
ribs would break.</p>
<p>“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.</p>
<p>“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around
his navel. “Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir,
and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!”</p>
<p>Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his
enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of
happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the
pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet — all
except the clothes, which were very different.</p>
<p>When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same
filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest
assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse
job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was
wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright
badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of
what looked like children’s soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of these,
Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and
tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The
other was covered in pink and orange stripes.</p>
<p>“Dobby, what’re you doing here?” Harry said in amazement.</p>
<p>“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby squealed excitedly.
“Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!”</p>
<p>“Winky?” said Harry. “She’s here too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s hand and pulled
him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood
there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was
positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great
Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished,
but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that
were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.</p>
<p>At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen,
beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were
all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts
crest, and tied, as Winky’s had been, like a toga.</p>
<p>Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.</p>
<p>“Winky, sir!” he said.</p>
<p>Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had
obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt
and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large
ears. However, while every one of Dobby’s strange collection of garments
was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was
plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There were soup stains
all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.</p>
<p>“Hello, Winky,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Winky’s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of
her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done
at the Quidditch World Cup.</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to
the end of the kitchen. “Winky, don’t cry, please don’t . . .”</p>
<p>But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up
at Harry.</p>
<p>“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked loudly, over
Winky’s sobs.</p>
<p>“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing
a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.</p>
<p>“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at
him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and
retreated.</p>
<p>“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked as Dobby handed
around the tea.</p>
<p>“Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!” said Dobby happily. “Dobby came to
see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a
house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very
difficult indeed —”</p>
<p>At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose
dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the
flow.</p>
<p>“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to
find work!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby hasn’t found work, sir, because
Dobby wants paying now!”</p>
<p>The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and
watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby
had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, “Good
for you, Dobby!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. “But most
wizards doesn’t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. ‘That’s not the
point of a house-elf,’ they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby’s
face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be
paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!”</p>
<p>The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as
though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained
where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her
crying.</p>
<p>“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out
Winky has been freed too, sir!” said Dobby delightedly.</p>
<p>At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown
on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and
positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her
knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the
slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly
over Winky’s screeches.</p>
<p>“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! ‘Why doesn’t Dobby
and Winky find work together?’ Dobby says. ‘Where is there enough work
for two house-elves?’ says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him,
sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir,
and Professor Dumbledore took us on!”</p>
<p>Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes
again.</p>
<p>“And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants
paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week
and one day off a month!”</p>
<p>“That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor,
over Winky’s continued screaming and fist-beating.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends
off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the
prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat
him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn’t wanting
too much, miss, he likes work better.”</p>
<p>“And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?” Hermione
asked kindly.</p>
<p>If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly
mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at
Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and
suddenly furious.</p>
<p>“Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she
squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed
of being freed!”</p>
<p>“Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But — Winky, come on! It’s
Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn’t do anything wrong,
he was really horrible to you —”</p>
<p>But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her
hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn’t hear a word, and
screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting
Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to
sack bad Winky!”</p>
<p>“Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,” squeaked Dobby
confidentially. “Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore;
she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won’t do it.”</p>
<p>“Can’t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?”
Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. “’Tis part of
the house-elf’s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our
silence, sir. We upholds the family’s honor, and we never speaks ill of
them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon
this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to —”</p>
<p>Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent
forward. Dobby whispered, “He said we is free to call him a — a barmy
old codger if we likes, sir!”</p>
<p>Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.</p>
<p>“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said, talking
normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. “Dobby
likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his
secrets and our silence for him.”</p>
<p>“But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?” Harry asked
him, grinning.</p>
<p>A slightly fearful look came into Dobby’s immense eyes.</p>
<p>“Dobby — Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He squared his small
shoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were —
were — bad Dark wizards!”</p>
<p>Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his
own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging
his head on it very hard, squealing, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”</p>
<p>Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from
the table.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby breathlessly,
rubbing his head.</p>
<p>“You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to be ashamed of
yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!”</p>
<p>“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly. “Dobby
doesn’t care what they think anymore!”</p>
<p>“Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears leaking down her
face once more. “My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He
is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches
all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is
doing it before her . . . oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was
freed? Oh the shame, the shame!” She buried her face in her skirt again
and bawled.</p>
<p>“Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting
along perfectly well without you. We’ve seen him, you know —”</p>
<p>“You is seeing my master?” said Winky breathlessly, raising her
tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione.
“You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione, “he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard
Tournament.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to Harry’s great surprise
(and Ron’s and Hermione’s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked
angry again. “Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master
isn’t liking him, oh no, not at all!”</p>
<p>“Bagman — bad?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” Winky said, nodding her head furiously. “My master is
telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying . . . Winky — Winky
keeps her master’s secrets. . . .”</p>
<p>She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into
her skirt, “Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!”</p>
<p>They couldn’t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her
to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about
his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages.</p>
<p>“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!” he said
happily, pointing at his bare chest.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, Dobby,” said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great
liking to the elf, “I’ll give you the one my mum knits me this
Christmas, I always get one from her. You don’t mind maroon, do
you?”</p>
<p>Dobby was delighted.</p>
<p>“We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,” Ron told him, “but
it’ll go well with your tea cozy.”</p>
<p>As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves
pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione
refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and
curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and
pies.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around
the door to say good night. “See you, Dobby!”</p>
<p>“Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?” Dobby
asked tentatively.</p>
<p>“’Course you can,” said Harry, and Dobby beamed.</p>
<p>“You know what?” said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the
kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall
again. “All these years I’ve been really impressed with Fred and George,
nicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not exactly difficult, is
it? They can’t wait to give it away!”</p>
<p>“I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those
elves, you know,” said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble
staircase. “Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see
how happy he is, being free, and slowly it’ll dawn on them that they
want that too!”</p>
<p>“Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Oh she’ll cheer up,” said Hermione, though she sounded a bit
doubtful. “Once the shock’s worn off, and she’s got used to Hogwarts,
she’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.”</p>
<p>“She seems to love him,” said Ron thickly (he had just started on a
cream cake).</p>
<p>“Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she?” said Harry. “Wonder
what Crouch says at home about him?”</p>
<p>“Probably says he’s not a very good Head of Department,” said
Hermione, “and let’s face it . . . he’s got a point, hasn’t he?”</p>
<p>“I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch,” said Ron. “At least
Bagman’s got a sense of humor.”</p>
<p>“Don’t let Percy hear you saying that,” Hermione said, smiling
slightly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone with a sense of
humor, would he?” said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. “Percy
wouldn’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing
Dobby’s tea cozy.”</p>
