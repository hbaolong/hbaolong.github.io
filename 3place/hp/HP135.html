<h4 id="chapter-three">CHAPTER THREE</h4>
<p>WILL AND WON’T</p>
<p>Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair
beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out
at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of
his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his
mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window
sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the
artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked
ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.</p>
<p>The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of
rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the
floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled
robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on
his desk. The headline of one blared:</p>
<p>HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?</p>
<p>Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the
Ministry of Magic, during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted
once more.</p>
<p>“We’re not allowed to talk about it, don’t ask me anything,” said one
agitated Obliviator, who refused to give his name as he left the
Ministry last night.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have
confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of
Prophecy.</p>
<p>Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm
the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding
community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban
for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy.
The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife
that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have
survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the
Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call
Potter “the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names him as the
only one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</p>
<p>The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown,
although (ctd. page 2, column 5)</p>
<p>A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the
headline:</p>
<p>SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE</p>
<p>Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white
picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged
face. The picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as
Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with
enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift between
the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of
the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour taking office.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met with Dumbledore
at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to comment on
the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 3,
column 2)</p>
<p>To the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that
a story bearing the title MINISTRY GUARANTEES STUDENTS’ SAFETY was
visible.</p>
<p>Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of
the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of
students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this
autumn.</p>
<p>“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail
about its stringent new security plans,” said the Minister, although an
insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a
complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors
dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.</p>
<p>Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough stand on student
safety. Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good
friend of Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”</p>
<p>But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage
standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber
eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to
gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked her beak
impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her.</p>
<p>A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open;
it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old
underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the
very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with
the words:</p>
<p>——— ISSUED ON BEHALF OF ———</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic</p>
<p>PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES</p>
<p>The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an
organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following
simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your
home from attack.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You are advised not to leave the house alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness.
Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has
fallen.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure
that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield
and Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage family members,
Side-Along-Apparition.</p></li>
<li><p>Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as
to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice
Potion (see page 2).</p></li>
<li><p>Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or
neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law
Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius
Curse (see page 4).</p></li>
<li><p>Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other
building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror office
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be
using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an Inferius, or encounter
with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch
or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up.
An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on
the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by
Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting
writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three
days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll,
it now lay quite flat.</p>
<p>Dear Harry,</p>
<p>If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive
this coming Friday at eleven P.M. to escort you to the Burrow, where you
have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.</p>
<p>If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a
matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall
explain this more fully when I see you.</p>
<p>Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this
Friday,</p>
<p>I am, yours most sincerely,</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore</p>
<p>Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances
at this missive every few minutes since seven o’clock that evening, when
he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had
a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless
to keep rereading Dumbledore’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” with
the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait:
Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.</p>
<p>But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he
was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of
their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was
going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore’s letter might have gone
astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter
might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or
trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down
and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the
possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in
her cage.</p>
<p>The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at
that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window went out.</p>
<p>Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily
straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he
pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the
pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the
garden path.</p>
<p>Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked
over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within
reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a
set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of crisps across the room,
the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon
shouted, “Who the blazes is calling at this time of night?”</p>
<p>Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers
in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that
Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky and close to laughter,
he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time
to hear a deep voice say, “Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I
daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?”</p>
<p>Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt
several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to
remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the
doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard.
Half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was
wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley,
whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore’s, though black, and who
was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though
he could not believe his tiny eyes.</p>
<p>“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you
that I was coming,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. “However, let us assume
that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger
overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.”</p>
<p>He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door
behind him.</p>
<p>“It is a long time since my last visit,” said Dumbledore, peering
down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. “I must say, your agapanthus are
flourishing.”</p>
<p>Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech
would return to him, and soon — the vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple
was reaching danger point — but something about Dumbledore seemed to
have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant
wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even
Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very
difficult to bully.</p>
<p>“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking up at him through
his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. “Excellent,
excellent.”</p>
<p>These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as
he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say “excellent”
was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to be rude —” he began, in a tone that threatened
rudeness in every syllable.</p>
<p>“— yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,”
Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. “Best to say nothing at all,
my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.”</p>
<p>The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt, wearing
rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway
through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her
rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.</p>
<p>“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to
effect an introduction. “We have corresponded, of course.” Harry thought
this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an
exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. “And this
must be your son, Dudley?”</p>
<p>Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door. His large,
blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly
disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. Dumbledore
waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys
were going to say anything, but as the silence stretched on he
smiled.</p>
<p>“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting
room?”</p>
<p>Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry,
still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last few stairs
and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair nearest
the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign
interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.</p>
<p>“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss
first,” said Dumbledore. “And I would prefer not to do so in the open.
We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little
longer.”</p>
<p>“You will, will you?”</p>
<p>Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, and
Dudley skulking behind them both.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.”</p>
<p>He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual
flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all
three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another
flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.</p>
<p>“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.</p>
<p>As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was
blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned
away.</p>
<p>“Sir — what happened to your — ?”</p>
<p>“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.”</p>
<p>Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the
Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.</p>
<p>“I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,”
Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but the evidence so far suggests that
that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.”</p>
<p>A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses
appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of
honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to
each person in the room.</p>
<p>“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said Dumbledore, raising
his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never
tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys,
after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses
completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the
sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that
Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.</p>
<p>“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, “a difficulty has
arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the
Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s
will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he
owned.”</p>
<p>Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did not look
at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh. Right.”</p>
<p>“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on.
“You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and
you inherit all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly
problematic part of the legacy —”</p>
<p>“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa.
Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was
now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he
attempted to beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided
in the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had
been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve,
Grimmauld Place.”</p>
<p>“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes
narrowing, but nobody answered him.</p>
<p>“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. “I don’t care.
You can have it, I don’t really want it.” Harry never wanted to set foot
in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought
he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark
musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so
desperately to leave.</p>
<p>“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, however, vacated the
building temporarily.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who
was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of
mead, “Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the
direct line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the
very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him
and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he
wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell
or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be
owned by anyone other than a pureblood.”</p>
<p>A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s mother
that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into
Harry’s mind. “I bet there has,” he said.</p>
<p>“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an enchantment exists, then
the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of
Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix
Lestrange.”</p>
<p>Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the
telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix
Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, inherit his house?</p>
<p>“No,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it either,” said
Dumbledore calmly. “The situation is fraught with complications. We do
not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for
example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed
from Sirius’s hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the
doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as
we have clarified the position.”</p>
<p>“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to own it?”</p>
<p>“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple test.”</p>
<p>He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but
before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, “Will you get
these ruddy things off us?”</p>
<p>Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with
their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on
their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand
again. All three glasses vanished. “But it would have been better
manners to drink it, you know.”</p>
<p>It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of
unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with
Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes
on Dumbledore’s wand.</p>
<p>“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking
as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have indeed inherited
the house, you have also inherited —”</p>
<p>He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a
house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat’s ears, and
enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet and
covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek;
nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew
his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost
above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his
pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, “What the hell is that?”</p>
<p>“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” croaked the
house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled
feet and pulling his ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes,
Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress,
Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t
—”</p>
<p>“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher’s
continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a
certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust at the
writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don’t want him.”</p>
<p>“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”</p>
<p>“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix
Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the
Order of the Phoenix for the past year?”</p>
<p>“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”</p>
<p>Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be
permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of
owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed
Sirius, was repugnant.</p>
<p>“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has passed into your
ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of
some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.”</p>
<p>“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T!”</p>
<p>Kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing
to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!”</p>
<p>It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He
grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging.
After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward
onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his
hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent,
tantrum.</p>
<p>“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “It
seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of
number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.”</p>
<p>“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, aghast, as
Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.</p>
<p>“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I might make a
suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there.
In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — Kreacher — I
want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other
house-elves.”</p>
<p>Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs
in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and,
with another loud crack, vanished.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff,
Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but
Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different
arrangements —”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak
would prefer that.”</p>
<p>“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was
thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the
interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the
time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the
hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk
packed?”</p>
<p>“Erm . . .”</p>
<p>“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.</p>
<p>“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to
pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.</p>
<p>It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he
needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from
under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and
forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his
trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig’s cage in the other, he made his
way back downstairs.</p>
<p>He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in
the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.</p>
<p>Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite
at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry
did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, “Professor — I’m ready
now.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” And he turned
to speak to the Dursleys once more.</p>
<p>“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year’s time
—”</p>
<p>“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since
Dumbledore’s arrival.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely.</p>
<p>“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders
doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after next.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the Wizarding world, we
come of age at seventeen.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but Dumbledore ignored
him.</p>
<p>“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort has
returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a
state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted
to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the
day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter
explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing the hope that you
would care for him as though he were your own.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm,
and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill
emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly
closer together.</p>
<p>“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He
has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best
that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage
you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.”</p>
<p>Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as
though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between
them.</p>
<p>“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began Uncle Vernon furiously,
but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as
though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.</p>
<p>“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful
protection while he can still call this house ‘home.’ However miserable
he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at
least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to
operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the
moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to
return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which
will ensure that the protection continues until that time.”</p>
<p>None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as
though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated.
Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt
Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.</p>
<p>“Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore at last,
standing up and straightening his long black cloak. “Until we meet
again,” he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could
wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat,
he swept from the room.</p>
<p>“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore,
who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon which Hedwig’s cage was
perched.</p>
<p>“We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said, pulling
out his wand again. “I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there.
However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in
case.”</p>
<p>Harry extracted his Cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying
not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an
inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk,
cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the
front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.</p>
<p>“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that
flighty temptress, adventure.”</p>
