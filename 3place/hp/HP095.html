<h4 id="chapter-one">CHAPTER ONE</h4>
<p>DUDLEY DEMENTED</p>
<p>The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a
drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars
that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that
were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes
had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and
lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into
the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of
tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a
teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside
number four.</p>
<p>He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched,
slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space
of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and
the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry
Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors, who were the
sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law,
but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening
he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way he would be
spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of
the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed
below.</p>
<p>On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of
hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot,
hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding
their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty
questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down
in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle.</p>
<p>Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window,
Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the boy’s
stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the
house.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon grunted.</p>
<p>“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what
he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dudley
hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister
is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on our news
—”</p>
<p>“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!”</p>
<p>“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .”</p>
<p>The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning
and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was concealed
behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking him around for
tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and
vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s voice floated out of the window
again.</p>
<p>“Dudders out for tea?”</p>
<p>“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many
little friends, he’s so popular . . .”</p>
<p>Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were
astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his
dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening
vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing
stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during
his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the
holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along
the way.</p>
<p>The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock news
reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight —
after a month of waiting — would be the night —</p>
<p>“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —”</p>
<p>“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the
end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower
bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, it
would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction
were more important than stranded holidaymakers . . .</p>
<p>He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue
sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the
expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . .
and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why
nothing had happened yet . . .</p>
<p>He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not
recognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained
disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon,
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter
that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s
divorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid
affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in
every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the
newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of
keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in
Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more .
. .”</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing
budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously
onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing
to crawl out from under the window.</p>
<p>He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very
quick succession.</p>
<p>A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat
streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’
living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this signal, he
jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his
jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword. But before
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided
with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant crash made Aunt
Petunia scream even louder.</p>
<p>Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise,
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands
reached through the open window and closed tightly around his
throat.</p>
<p>“Put — it — away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “Now!
Before — anyone — sees!”</p>
<p>“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled,
Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-like fingers with his left hand,
his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain
in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon
yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock —
some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making
him impossible to hold.</p>
<p>Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened up,
and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud
cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and
tried to look innocent.</p>
<p>“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number Seven,
who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear that car
backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”</p>
<p>He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.</p>
<p>Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their
strangling.</p>
<p>“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a
croaky voice that trembled with fury.</p>
<p>“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and
right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the
cracking noise.</p>
<p>“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —”</p>
<p>“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon’s
wide, purple one. She looked livid.</p>
<p>“Why were you lurking under our window?”</p>
<p>“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our
window, boy?”</p>
<p>“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice.</p>
<p>His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.</p>
<p>“Listening to the news! Again?”</p>
<p>“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re really
up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh!
You know perfectly well that your lot . . .”</p>
<p>“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered
his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot
don’t get on our news!”</p>
<p>“That’s all you know,” said Harry.</p>
<p>The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia
said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those —” she too lowered
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls — doing
if they’re not bringing you news?”</p>
<p>“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that
one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those
pestilential birds!”</p>
<p>Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth
this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how
bad Harry felt at admitting it.</p>
<p>“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.</p>
<p>“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.</p>
<p>“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the
front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up
the street.</p>
<p>He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt
and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not care
very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his
mind.</p>
<p>Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at
this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared
back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again
and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible . .
.</p>
<p>He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his
favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt
Petunia’s dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to
him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?</p>
<p>And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked
away.</p>
<p>Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking inside a
neighbor’s house?</p>
<p>Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer
rolled over him once again . . .</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five o’clock so
that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet — but was
there any point in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the
front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran
the paper finally realized that Voldemort was back it would be headline
news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.</p>
<p>If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his
best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had that
their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.</p>
<p>“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .” “We’ve been
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .”
“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a
fair amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. . .
.”</p>
<p>But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with
a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you
quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as
Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron
were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house. He could
hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the Burrow when
he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at them that he
had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away
unopened, though he had regretted this after eating the wilting salad
Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.</p>
<p>And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he, Harry, busy?
Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much more than they? Had
they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it been he who had entered
that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered and been tied to that
tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?</p>
<p>Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the
graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking
moments too.</p>
<p>He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed
the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped
eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry
was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty of proper news as
Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained words of caution and
consolation instead of tantalizing hints:</p>
<p>“I know this must be frustrating for you. . . .” “Keep your nose
clean and everything will be okay. . . .” “Be careful and don’t do
anything rash. . . .”</p>
<p>Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had (by and
large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temptation
to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow by
himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing
something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first
place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff . . .</p>
<p>Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the
parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he
reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends
had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain, and
stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the
Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to think of some
fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to
look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when
he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long
dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he
supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was
awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he
did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very
interesting anymore . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that
Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back
they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to
be expected . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .</p>
<p>The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to
yell with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known
Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging
for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced
to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about
water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so
easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along
too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit
tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid
Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious
thoughts whirled around in Harry’s head, and his insides writhed with
anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the
smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of
traffic on the road beyond the park railings.</p>
<p>He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of
voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from
the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to
silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of
them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft
ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were
wheeling along.</p>
<p>Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was
unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home,
accompanied by his faithful gang.</p>
<p>Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the
discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As
Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of
the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it, had made
Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the primary
school days when he had served as Dudley’s first punching bag. Harry was
not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that
Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for
celebration. Neighborhood children all around were terrified of him —
even more terrified than they were of “that Potter boy,” who, they had
been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.</p>
<p>Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered whom
they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found himself
thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m sitting
here all alone. . . . Come and have a go. . . .</p>
<p>If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make
a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn’t want to
lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking Harry
. . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s dilemma; to taunt him,
watch him, with him powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others
tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he had his wand . . . let them
try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had
once made his life hell —</p>
<p>But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were almost
at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them. . . .
Seeking a fight was not a smart move . . . He must not use magic . . .
He would be risking expulsion again . . .</p>
<p>Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along
Magnolia Road.</p>
<p>There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose
clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . .</p>
<p>He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be
home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley again,
so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park
gate.</p>
<p>Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who
drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred Little
Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of
jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he passed
the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road
Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at
the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a
large lilac tree and waited.</p>
<p>“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to
guffaws from the others.</p>
<p>“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.</p>
<p>“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.</p>
<p>“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.</p>
<p>“See you then,” said Dudley.</p>
<p>“Bye Dud!”</p>
<p>“See ya, Big D!”</p>
<p>Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner
into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within
hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming
tunelessly.</p>
<p>“Hey, Big D!”</p>
<p>Dudley turned.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.</p>
<p>“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”</p>
<p>“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into
fists.</p>
<p>“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”</p>
<p>“Shut your face.”</p>
<p>“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky
Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”</p>
<p>Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry
seemed to be demanding all his self-control.</p>
<p>“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago
—”</p>
<p>“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?”</p>
<p>“He cheeked me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”</p>
<p>A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though
he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only
outlet he had.</p>
<p>They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen
Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and
Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked
because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between
garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.</p>
<p>“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley said
after a few seconds.</p>
<p>“What thing?”</p>
<p>“That — that thing you’re hiding.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned again.</p>
<p>“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time . . .”</p>
<p>Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.</p>
<p>“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not. You’d
get expelled from that freak school you go to.”</p>
<p>“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”</p>
<p>“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely
convinced. Harry laughed softly.</p>
<p>“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have
you?” Dudley snarled.</p>
<p>“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a
ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How
old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”</p>
<p>“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was twice
as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out
—”</p>
<p>“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened
of nasty Harry’s wand?”</p>
<p>“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.</p>
<p>“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all
dark like this.”</p>
<p>“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.</p>
<p>He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a
strangely triumphant look.</p>
<p>“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or
something?”</p>
<p>“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your
sleep. Moaning.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging
sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in
his dreams.</p>
<p>Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched,
whimpering voice. “‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric
— your boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone
dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know about
Cedric?</p>
<p>“‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning
you!”</p>
<p>“‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed Cedric!
Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at me!”</p>
<p>Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand
directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, to
jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect, struck
dumb, sprouting feelers —</p>
<p>“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you understand
me?”</p>
<p>“Point that thing somewhere else!”</p>
<p>“I said, do you understand me?”</p>
<p>“Point it somewhere else!”</p>
<p>“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”</p>
<p>“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”</p>
<p>Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in
icy water.</p>
<p>Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky was
suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty
streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant grumble
of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was
suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total,
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a
thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.</p>
<p>For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning
to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he could — then
his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have the power to turn
off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, trying to see
something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless
veil.</p>
<p>Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.</p>
<p>“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”</p>
<p>“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!”</p>
<p>“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”</p>
<p>“I said shut up!”</p>
<p>Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right.
The cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing
up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around,
unseeing . . .</p>
<p>It was impossible . . . They couldn’t be here . . . Not in Little
Whinging . . . He strained his ears . . . He would hear them before he
saw them . . .</p>
<p>“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are you
d-do — ?”</p>
<p>“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”</p>
<p>But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been
dreading.</p>
<p>There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something
that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible
jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.</p>
<p>“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!”</p>
<p>“Dudley, shut —”</p>
<p>WHAM!</p>
<p>A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the
second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand had
flown out of his hand.</p>
<p>“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as he
scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in the
blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence,
stumbling.</p>
<p>“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!”</p>
<p>There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps stopped.
At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could
mean only one thing. There was more than one.</p>
<p>“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!
Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like
spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on — Lumos!”</p>
<p>He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from
his right hand — the wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up,
scrambled to his feet, and turned around.</p>
<p>His stomach turned over.</p>
<p>A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering
over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on
the night as it came.</p>
<p>Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.</p>
<p>“Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the
dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic
fogging his brain — concentrate —</p>
<p>A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.</p>
<p>“Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>His voice sounded dim and distant . . . Another wisp of silver smoke,
feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do it
anymore, he couldn’t work the spell —</p>
<p>There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter
. . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling
his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. . . .</p>
<p>But there was no happiness in him . . . The dementor’s icy fingers
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death,
Harry. . . . It might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I
have never died . . .”</p>
<p>He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —</p>
<p>And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath
—</p>
<p>“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”</p>
<p>An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.</p>
<p>“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted
down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY? DUDLEY!”</p>
<p>He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was
curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second dementor
was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands,
prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head
toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him . . .</p>
<p>“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor’s
eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver antlers
caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it
soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag cantered to the
end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.</p>
<p>Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane
rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry stood
quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking
to him; he was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in
Little Whinging . . .</p>
<p>Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry
bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then
heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising his wand
again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway out
of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out
of sight, but —</p>
<p>“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are more
of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”</p>
