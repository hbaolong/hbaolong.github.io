<h4 id="chapter-nine">CHAPTER NINE</h4>
<p>THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He
remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his
feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their
feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and packing them away.
Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of
attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s right, who was now gazing
down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch
Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go,
but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones
was busy with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the
exit and when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.</p>
<p>He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and
almost collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside,
looking pale and apprehensive.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore didn’t say —”</p>
<p>“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all
charges!”</p>
<p>Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.</p>
<p>“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found
you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t
—”</p>
<p>But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just opened
again. The Wizengamot were filing out.</p>
<p>“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside
to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” said Harry quietly.</p>
<p>One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and
a few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. Weasley,
but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were
almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley
and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost
appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like
Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past
clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his
back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasley’s mouth
tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had
noticed his third son.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the
good news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels
disappeared up the stairs to the ninth level. “I’ll drop you off on the
way to that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on . . .”</p>
<p>“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked,
grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It
was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they
mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage,
it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might
strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of something much
deeper and nastier, and I for one —”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the
ninth-level corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away
from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a
pointed, pale face.</p>
<p>The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too broke
off in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed upon
Harry’s face.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy
coolly.</p>
<p>Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something heavy.
He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s
hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while
Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that Lucius Malfoy
dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in
the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when
Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.</p>
<p>“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,”
drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle
out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping . . .”</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.</p>
<p>“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”</p>
<p>“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.</p>
<p>“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and
glancing toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you
were up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves
sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s
shoulder.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.</p>
<p>“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are
any concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his
robes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a
full pocket of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s favorite
boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us. . . .
Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. Weasley.
“This way, Lucius.”</p>
<p>They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not
let go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.</p>
<p>“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business
to do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing down
here?”</p>
<p>“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said
Mr. Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder
as though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore
when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge
again.”</p>
<p>“What private business have they got together anyway?”</p>
<p>“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving
generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the
right people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t
want passed . . . Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy . . .”</p>
<p>The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that
flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the
Atrium and the doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.</p>
<p>“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters
like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven’t put
the Imperius Curse on him?”</p>
<p>“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr. Weasley.
“But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment —
which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk
about it anymore just now, Harry . . .”</p>
<p>The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted
Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again.
They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry
remembered.</p>
<p>“Wait . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from his
pocket, he turned back to the fountain.</p>
<p>He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry
thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid
smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and
centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at
humans of any description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping
servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione
would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his money
bag upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole
contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.</p>
<p>“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with
stuff!”</p>
<p>“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked
positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was
now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case against
you, none at all . . .”</p>
<p>“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I’d
get off,” said Harry, smiling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and
Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He got off,
he got off, he got off —”</p>
<p>“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too was
smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —”</p>
<p>“What?” said Sirius sharply.</p>
<p>“He got off, he got off, he got off —”</p>
<p>“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level nine,
then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought to
know.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal
Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but
Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner —”</p>
<p>“He got off, he got off, he got off —”</p>
<p>“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley, as
Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, come and sit down, have some
lunch, you hardly ate breakfast . . .”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier
than they had done since he had first arrived at number twelve,
Grimmauld Place, and Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been
somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The
gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even
Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the
kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise.</p>
<p>“’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way
they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing great
mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound
highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked
to me, though. Or even looked at me.”</p>
<p>And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that
he clapped his hand to it.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.</p>
<p>“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the
time now . . .”</p>
<p>None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping
themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape; Fred,
George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather anxious,
but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet Dumbledore
turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a
huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very
busy at the moment.”</p>
<p>“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”</p>
<p>“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was
one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem
wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put
up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing
Harry’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, he
was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even
Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother’s
room with Buckbeak.</p>
<p>“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry had
confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a
moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. “You belong at
Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being
selfish.”</p>
<p>“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he attempted to
prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his finger,
“you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company.”</p>
<p>“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the Order
of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be
coming to live here with him.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He
wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”</p>
<p>“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said
Hermione wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I
think a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d both
be outcasts together.”</p>
<p>“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely
shrugged.</p>
<p>“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius
gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.”</p>
<p>“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly.</p>
<p>“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said
Hermione simply.</p>
<p>At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.</p>
<p>“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the
cupboard.</p>
<p>“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron
bitterly. “D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived
here?”</p>
<p>“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can do
your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.”</p>
<p>“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.</p>
<p>“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps
you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully, as
Mrs. Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t be a
bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time
— we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds
to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds —”</p>
<p>“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably, but
only so Harry could hear him.</p>
<p>Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the
end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again,
to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the
Herbology greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty,
musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and
Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry
was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.</p>
<p>The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort
movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have
expected before he’d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the
Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes
only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made sure
that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether
Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that
Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his
arrival.</p>
<p>On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig’s
owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their
bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.</p>
<p>“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up
to Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d
forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .”</p>
<p>Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw
the bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which
swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It contained
two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term started on the
first of September, the other telling him which books he would need for
the coming year.</p>
<p>“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book of
Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by
Wilbert Slinkhard.”</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them
doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair.</p>
<p>“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said Fred
conversationally.</p>
<p>“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher,” said George.</p>
<p>“And about time too,” said Fred.</p>
<p>“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down beside them.</p>
<p>“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few
weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying,
Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this
year.”</p>
<p>“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last
four?” said George.</p>
<p>“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a
trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fingers.
“Yeah, I see what you mean.”</p>
<p>“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred.</p>
<p>Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very still
with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look
over his shoulder at the parchment.</p>
<p>Fred’s mouth fell open too.</p>
<p>“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter.
“Prefect?”</p>
<p>George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and
turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into
George’s palm.</p>
<p>“No way,” said George in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of
Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a
watermark. “No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . .
.”</p>
<p>The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at
Harry.</p>
<p>“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested
Harry had tricked them in some way.</p>
<p>“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George
indignantly.</p>
<p>“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred.</p>
<p>“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said
George to Fred.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble,
mate. Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right.”</p>
<p>He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron
a scathing look.</p>
<p>“Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the
prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.</p>
<p>Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for
a moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for
confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was
superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this
on Percy’s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks
flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.</p>
<p>“Did you — did you get — ?”</p>
<p>She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek.</p>
<p>“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too,
Harry, me too!”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand.
“It’s Ron, not me.”</p>
<p>“It — what?”</p>
<p>“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I
mean —”</p>
<p>She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expression
on his face.</p>
<p>“It’s my name on the letter,” he said.</p>
<p>“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I . . . well
. . . wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —”</p>
<p>“Unexpected,” said George, nodding.</p>
<p>“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . .
Ron’s done loads of . . . he’s really . . .”</p>
<p>The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley backed
into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.</p>
<p>“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing
around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and
started sorting the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll
take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while
you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are at
least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing . .
. what color would you like?”</p>
<p>“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking.</p>
<p>“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of
maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s pile.</p>
<p>“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over
quickly. “His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge.”</p>
<p>Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccupation
about pajamas.</p>
<p>“His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not . . . ?”</p>
<p>Ron held up his badge.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A
prefect! That’s everyone in the family!”</p>
<p>“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indignantly,
as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest
son.</p>
<p>“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what
wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s
the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this
worry, I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie —”</p>
<p>Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back
but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s neck, she was
kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than
his badge.</p>
<p>“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip . . .” he muttered, trying to
push her away.</p>
<p>She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what will it be? We
gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.”</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not dare
believe his ears.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.
“How about a nice new set of dress robes?”</p>
<p>“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as
though he sincerely regretted this generosity.</p>
<p>“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new
rat, you always liked Scabbers —”</p>
<p>“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.</p>
<p>“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — just a new one
for a change . . .”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.</p>
<p>“Of course you can. . . . Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a
broom to buy too. I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a
prefect! And don’t forget to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh,
I’m all of a dither!”</p>
<p>She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and
bustled from the room.</p>
<p>Fred and George exchanged looks.</p>
<p>“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a
falsely anxious voice.</p>
<p>“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them.</p>
<p>“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. “Going
to put us in detention?”</p>
<p>“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George.</p>
<p>“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which
Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it,
Hermione.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred,
pretending to tremble, “with these two on our case . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said
George, shaking his head.</p>
<p>And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.</p>
<p>“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling,
through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter
in the room upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron, they’re
only jealous!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the
ceiling. “They’ve always said only prats become prefects. . . . Still,”
he added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I
could go with Mum and choose. . . . She’ll never be able to afford a
Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . . Yeah,
I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows .
. .”</p>
<p>He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.</p>
<p>For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at
Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes
Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk.</p>
<p>“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.</p>
<p>“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice
at all, and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I
can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is
something they can understand —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice
that did not belong to him. “Take her!”</p>
<p>He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and
pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the
wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the
door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could
hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the
wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.</p>
<p>He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hedwig had
gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gazing
unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.</p>
<p>He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth
year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to
spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way
toward certain people. But if he had remembered . . . if he had thought
about it . . . what would he have expected?</p>
<p>Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.</p>
<p>Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not
lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he
would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as
arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone
else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron?</p>
<p>No, said the small voice defiantly.</p>
<p>Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own
feelings.</p>
<p>I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not better at
anything else.</p>
<p>That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in
lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he,
Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started at Hogwarts,
often risking much worse than expulsion?</p>
<p>Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice
in Harry’s head.</p>
<p>Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t
fight Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk.
They didn’t get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped.
They weren’t in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. .
. .</p>
<p>And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on the
night he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry
thought indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them!</p>
<p>But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t
choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous
situations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron
must have something you don’t. . . .</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the
wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.</p>
<p>“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .”</p>
<p>Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened
with himself.</p>
<p>Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was
not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world, going to
sulk because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron’s
back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at
something?</p>
<p>At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He
stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as
Ron bounded back through the door.</p>
<p>“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the
Cleansweep if she can.”</p>
<p>“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had
stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.”</p>
<p>The smile faded off Ron’s face.</p>
<p>“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I
thought it would be you!”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our
trunks packed, hadn’t we?”</p>
<p>It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered
themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to
retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow
them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving
his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then
putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on
his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black.
Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his
forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his
maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden
with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that
Ron took from her with a moan of longing.</p>
<p>“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want
you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron
ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new
broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.</p>
<p>Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the
heavily laden dinner table, which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE
— NEW PREFECTS. She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all
holiday.</p>
<p>“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the room.
“Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both owls
and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming.</p>
<p>Fred rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and
Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a
butterbeer.</p>
<p>“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as
Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask you
for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room
and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just in case
it’s something really nasty.”</p>
<p>“No problem, Molly . . .”</p>
<p>Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through
the ceiling of the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Drawing room . . .” he growled, as the pupil contracted. “Desk in
the corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to
go up and get rid of it, Molly?”</p>
<p>“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have
your drink. We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually . . .”
She gestured at the scarlet banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she
said fondly, ruffling Ron’s hair.</p>
<p>“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical
eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the
very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away toward
Sirius and Lupin.</p>
<p>“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his
normal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose
Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn’t
have appointed you . . .”</p>
<p>Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved
the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest
brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain
that they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was wearing a long
overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the
offer to remove it and put it with Moody’s traveling cloak.</p>
<p>“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone
had a drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new
Gryffindor prefects!”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then
applauded.</p>
<p>“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly from behind Harry
as everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to food. Her hair
was tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like Ginny’s older
sister. “My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary
qualities.”</p>
<p>“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.</p>
<p>“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks.</p>
<p>Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to
smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer
and choking on it.</p>
<p>“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the
back.</p>
<p>Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike
laugh.</p>
<p>“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in
detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”</p>
<p>“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise
some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely say
that I failed dismally.”</p>
<p>Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect
either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up
his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.</p>
<p>Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would
listen.</p>
<p>“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you
think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a
decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?”</p>
<p>Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf
rights.</p>
<p>“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation,
isn’t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking
they’re superior to other creatures . . .”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s
hair.</p>
<p>“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it
would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his
opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who
were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.</p>
<p>Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and
beckoned Harry closer.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our
financial backer.”</p>
<p>“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand to
Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint
rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely
stationary.</p>
<p>“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so
we’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.”</p>
<p>“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred.</p>
<p>“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his
saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m
not taking a Knut under twenty.”</p>
<p>“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl
quills,” said George.</p>
<p>“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.</p>
<p>“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re
okay.”</p>
<p>“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out.</p>
<p>Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it is, if
you’ll take ’em quick.”</p>
<p>“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied
his pockets into the twins’ outstretched hands and scuttled off toward
the food. “We’d better get these upstairs . . .”</p>
<p>Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred
to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how Fred and George
were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they
finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had
seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another
family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel
that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it
possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite
unsuitable?</p>
<p>Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty
weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of
his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even over
the surrounding chatter.</p>
<p>“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said
Kingsley.</p>
<p>“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.</p>
<p>“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,”
persisted Kingsley, “’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at
him every few days . . .”</p>
<p>Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know
he had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table, though not
remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as
it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his
nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then
tore a strip off it with his teeth.</p>
<p>“. . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and
in-built vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.</p>
<p>“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . .
Arthur, I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry,
dear.”</p>
<p>She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered whether
he could follow her without attracting attention.</p>
<p>“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody.</p>
<p>“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry.</p>
<p>Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring
sideways at Harry.</p>
<p>“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said.</p>
<p>From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old
Wizarding photograph.</p>
<p>“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. “Found it last night
when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore
hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought people might
like to see it.”</p>
<p>Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at
him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.</p>
<p>“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The
Moody in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly less
gray and his nose was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus
Diggle on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed
two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. That’s Frank
and Alice Longbottom —”</p>
<p>Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at
Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even
though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son,
Neville.</p>
<p>“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened to them
. . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that there’s Lupin,
obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits
of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the picture, and the
little photographic people edged sideways, so that those who were
partially obscured could move to the front.</p>
<p>“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and
his family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he
looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we
never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as
ever . . . Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear
that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill
him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along,
budge along . . .”</p>
<p>The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and
those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the
picture.</p>
<p>“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him,
strange bloke . . . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her
personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . .
there you go, thought that would interest you!”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at
him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized
at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts
to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.</p>
<p>“Eh?” said Moody.</p>
<p>Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and pitted face.
Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit
of a treat.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er . . . listen, I’ve
just remembered, I haven’t packed my . . .”</p>
<p>He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed;
Sirius had just said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?” and Moody
had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the
door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.</p>
<p>He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his
parents’ pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but
to have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . .
. No one would like that, he thought angrily. . . .</p>
<p>And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces . . .
Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had
died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into
madness . . . all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not
knowing that they were doomed. . . . Well, Moody might find that
interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . .</p>
<p>Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads,
glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he
heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Harry said.</p>
<p>There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the
remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened
the drawing-room door.</p>
<p>Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her
whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a
patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.</p>
<p>All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he
were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead,
no, it couldn’t be —</p>
<p>But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs —</p>
<p>“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked.</p>
<p>“R-r-riddikulus!” Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand at
Ron’s body.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes
wide open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.</p>
<p>“R-riddikulus!” she sobbed again.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, a trickle of
blood running down his face.</p>
<p>“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus!
RIDDIKULUS!”</p>
<p>Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .</p>
<p>“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down at
his own dead body on the floor. “Let someone else —”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius,
with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to
the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant.
Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly,
“Riddikulus!”</p>
<p>Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot
where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished
in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a storm of
crying, her face in her hands.</p>
<p>“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . .
.”</p>
<p>Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on
the head. “Just a stupid boggart . . .”</p>
<p>“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .”</p>
<p>Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart,
pretending to be Harry’s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who
avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye had
followed him all the way out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her
eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . .
Being silly . . .”</p>
<p>Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.</p>
<p>“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily.
“Not even able to get rid of a boggart . . .”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile.</p>
<p>“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes
again. “Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we
all come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . .
What if something d-d-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? And
what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going to
look after Ron and Ginny?”</p>
<p>“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t like last
time. The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what
Voldemort’s up to —”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the
name.</p>
<p>“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it —
look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise
that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in
the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered
twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by
one . . .”</p>
<p>Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ beaming faces.
He knew Moody was still watching him.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll come round.
It’s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he
does, the whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them. And
I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly.</p>
<p>“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur
died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d do, let
them starve?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.</p>
<p>“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes.</p>
<p>But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes
later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his
parents beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that
their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close.
The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of
Mrs. Weasley’s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.</p>
<p>Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and
his stomach churned horribly.</p>
<p>“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded
again.</p>
<p>“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” said a sly voice
from the empty picture on the wall.</p>
<p>Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life,
and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been
worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.</p>
