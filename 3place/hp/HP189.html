<h4 id="chapter-twenty-seven">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h4>
<p>THE FINAL HIDING PLACE</p>
<p>There was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was
going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they
would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as
they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a
gray-and-green map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an
escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck,
he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing
on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air
like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear
he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and
Hermione seemed to be sobbing.</p>
<p>After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that
the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing
but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the
question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather
frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing,
nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a
good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he
could feel his scar prickling. . . .</p>
<p>How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into
the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify
Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then,
when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would
know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. . . .</p>
<p>The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It climbed
steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry
could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring
in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside
parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers
winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy
ribbon.</p>
<p>“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew
farther and farther north.</p>
<p>“No idea,” Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb with cold but he
did not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some
time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the
dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention
desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself
last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at
that point, it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its
back?</p>
<p>The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still
the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its
enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. Every
part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s
back.</p>
<p>“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of
silence, “or are we losing height?”</p>
<p>Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in
the sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he
squinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had
divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected
sunlight.</p>
<p>Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing
in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.</p>
<p>“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to the
others. “Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!”</p>
<p>They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the
dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the
water.</p>
<p>“NOW!”</p>
<p>He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst
toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had
estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a
freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and
emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the
places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to
have noticed anything: It was already fifty feet away, swooping low over
the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione
emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, the
dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant
bank.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake
did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their
way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped,
sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.</p>
<p>Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have
happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his
wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.</p>
<p>When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time
that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had
angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was
singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of
dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then
pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell
Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changed and then
gulped down the juice.</p>
<p>“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the
skin on his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the downside —”</p>
<p>“— no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany
through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.</p>
<p>“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little scab . .
.”</p>
<p>Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had
just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting
in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of
juice.</p>
<p>“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging
round our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his
hand.</p>
<p>Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was
still drinking.</p>
<p>“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all
right?”</p>
<p>“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can
look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think
they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”</p>
<p>All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was
difficult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger,
but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until
his throat was raw.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping
herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who will
know we know about his Horcruxes!”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said Ron hopefully. “Maybe
they’ll cover up —”</p>
<p>The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were
extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was
standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and
on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.</p>
<p>“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and
fear burned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded — but it could not
be true, he could not see how . . .</p>
<p>The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above
his.</p>
<p>“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!”</p>
<p>“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror,
“m-my Lord . . . we t-tried t-to st-stop them. . . . Im-impostors, my
Lord . . . broke — broke into the — into the Lestranges’ v-vault. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing
impostors? Who were they?”</p>
<p>“It was . . . it was . . . the P-Potter b-boy and t-two accomplices.
. . .”</p>
<p>“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping
him. “Tell me! What did they take?”</p>
<p>“A . . . a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord . . .”</p>
<p>The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s: He
was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody
had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered
his secret?</p>
<p>The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted
through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching
wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy
threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again
his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for
bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup —</p>
<p>Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they passed before
him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality
— the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the
boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he
traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who
had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore,
whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death
through the boy, the boy —</p>
<p>But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord
Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard
of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of
how many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord Voldemort not
have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been
attacked, mutilated?</p>
<p>True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he
had thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than
ghost . . . No, surely, the rest were safe . . . The other Horcruxes
must be intact. . . .</p>
<p>But he must know, he must be sure . . . He paced the room, kicking
aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and
burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts —</p>
<p>A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that he
had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be
related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had
never been traced to him: The ring, surely, was safe.</p>
<p>And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or
penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was
absurd. . . .</p>
<p>As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the
Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place.
. . .</p>
<p>And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent
to do his bidding, under his protection. . . .</p>
<p>But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his
hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes.
. . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake
alone . . .</p>
<p>Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease
flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name . . .
Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts . . . Their
abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it
was there that he would go first. . . .</p>
<p>The lake, surely impossible . . . though was there a slight
possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds,
through the orphanage.</p>
<p>And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it
would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let
alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to
the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle . . . To tell
Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been
a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity
and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?</p>
<p>He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him:
He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he strode from
the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the
fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered
out to join him like a long shadow. . . .</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: He
was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and
Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and
by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into
Voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering,
vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup
lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, deep blue shot
with gold in the failing sun.</p>
<p>“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort’s
high screams. “He knows, and he’s going to check where the others are,
and the last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I knew
it. I knew it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried.</p>
<p>“But what did you see? How do you know?”</p>
<p>“I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s” —
Harry remembered the killings — “he’s seriously angry, and scared too,
he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others
are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because
Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I
think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be there within
hours —”</p>
<p>“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to
his feet too.</p>
<p>“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about
exactly where it is —”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and Harry
pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t
got a plan, we need to —”</p>
<p>“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to
sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was
impossible now. “Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes
the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux,
decides it isn’t safe enough?”</p>
<p>“But how are we going to get in?”</p>
<p>“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out
once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the
Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t really fit —”</p>
<p>“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”</p>
<p>The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: The
dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their
preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the
rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then
Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two. Harry
pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on
the spot into the crushing darkness.</p>
