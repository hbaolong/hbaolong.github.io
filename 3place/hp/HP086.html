<h4 id="chapter-twenty-nine">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h4>
<p>THE DREAM</p>
<p>It comes down to this,” said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. “Either
Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when
Viktor wasn’t looking.”</p>
<p>“It must’ve been Crouch,” said Ron at once. “That’s why he was gone
when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shaking his head. “He seemed really
weak — I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.”</p>
<p>“You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you
enough times?” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Okay . . . how’s this for a theory,” said Ron excitedly. “Krum
attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then Stunned himself!”</p>
<p>“And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?” said Hermione coldly.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah . . .”</p>
<p>It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their
dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a
note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds.
All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking
late into the night about Mr. Crouch.</p>
<p>“Just go through it again, Harry,” said Hermione. “What did
Mr. Crouch actually say?”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you, he wasn’t making much sense,” said Harry. “He said he
wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned
Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying
stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.”</p>
<p>“Well, that was his fault,” said Hermione testily.</p>
<p>“He was out of his mind,” said Harry. “Half the time he seemed to
think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy
about work and giving him instructions.”</p>
<p>“And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?” said Ron
tentatively.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you,” Harry repeated dully. “He said he’s getting
stronger.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, “But
he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just
raving. . . .”</p>
<p>“He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,” said
Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. “He was having real
trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to
know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he
had to see Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The
many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would
swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night’s hunting
with a mouse in its beak.</p>
<p>“If Snape hadn’t held me up,” Harry said bitterly, “we might’ve got
there in time. ‘The headmaster is busy, Potter . . . what’s this
rubbish, Potter?’ Why couldn’t he have just got out of the way?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he didn’t want you to get there!” said Ron quickly. “Maybe —
hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could’ve gotten down to the forest?
D’you reckon he could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?”</p>
<p>“Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,” said
Harry.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Ron muttered.</p>
<p>“We need to see Professor Moody,” said Hermione. “We need to find out
whether he found Mr. Crouch.”</p>
<p>“If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve been easy,” said
Harry.</p>
<p>“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,” said Ron, “because
it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t —”</p>
<p>“Shh!” said Hermione suddenly.</p>
<p>Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear
two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.</p>
<p>“— that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for
that —”</p>
<p>“— we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He
wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did —”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s blackmail!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will
you?”</p>
<p>The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold,
then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</p>
<p>“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the same time.</p>
<p>“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.</p>
<p>“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.</p>
<p>Fred grinned.</p>
<p>“Fine — we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you don’t ask us,” he
said.</p>
<p>He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it,
but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that
the name on it was covered.</p>
<p>“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a mock bow and
pointing at the door.</p>
<p>Ron didn’t move. “Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.</p>
<p>The grin vanished from Fred’s face. Harry saw George half glance at
Fred, before smiling at Ron.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.</p>
<p>“Didn’t sound like that,” said Ron.</p>
<p>Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, “I’ve
told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is.
Can’t see why you would, but —”</p>
<p>“It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone,” said Ron.
“George’s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.”</p>
<p>“Told you, I was joking,” said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled
the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the
nearest barn owl. “You’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older
brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you’ll be made a
prefect.”</p>
<p>“No, I won’t!” said Ron hotly.</p>
<p>George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off.
George turned around and grinned at Ron.</p>
<p>“Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.”</p>
<p>He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one
another.</p>
<p>“You don’t think they know something about all this, do you?”
Hermione whispered. “About Crouch and everything?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “If it was something that serious, they’d tell
someone. They’d tell Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.</p>
<p>“Well . . .” said Ron slowly, “I dunno if they would. They’re . . .
they’re obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was
hanging around with them — when — you know —”</p>
<p>“We weren’t talking.” Harry finished the sentence for him. “Yeah, but
blackmail . . .”</p>
<p>“It’s this joke shop idea they’ve got,” said Ron. “I thought they
were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to
start one. They’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on
about how it’s time to think about their future, and Dad can’t help
them, and they need gold to get started.”</p>
<p>Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.</p>
<p>“Yes, but . . . they wouldn’t do anything against the law to get
gold.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t they?” said Ron, looking skeptical. “I dunno . . . they
don’t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but this is the law,” said Hermione, looking scared. “This
isn’t some silly school rule. . . . They’ll get a lot more than
detention for blackmail! Ron . . . maybe you’d better tell Percy. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Are you mad?” said Ron. “Tell Percy? He’d probably do a Crouch and
turn them in.” He stared at the window through which Fred and George’s
owl had departed, then said, “Come on, let’s get some breakfast.”</p>
<p>“D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor Moody?” Hermione
said as they went down the spiral staircase.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry. “He’d probably blast us through the door if we
wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think we’re trying to attack him
while he’s asleep. Let’s give it till break.”</p>
<p>History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron’s
watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron’s was moving so slowly
he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were
so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and
slept; even Hermione wasn’t taking her usual notes, but was sitting with
her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of
focus.</p>
<p>When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors
toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He
looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping,
giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.</p>
<p>“Professor Moody?” Harry called as they made their way toward him
through the crowd.</p>
<p>“Hello, Potter,” growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of
passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the
back of Moody’s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke
again.</p>
<p>“Come in here.”</p>
<p>He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after
them, and closed the door.</p>
<p>“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble. “Mr. Crouch?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out
his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.</p>
<p>“Did you use the map?” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. “Took a leaf
out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He
wasn’t anywhere on there.”</p>
<p>“So he did Disapparate?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!” said Hermione. “There
are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?”</p>
<p>Moody’s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. “You’re
another one who might think about a career as an Auror,” he told her.
“Mind works the right way, Granger.”</p>
<p>Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Well, he wasn’t invisible,” said Harry. “The map shows invisible
people. He must’ve left the grounds, then.”</p>
<p>“But under his own steam?” said Hermione eagerly, “or because someone
made him?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown
off with him, couldn’t they?” said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at
Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.</p>
<p>“We can’t rule out kidnap,” growled Moody.</p>
<p>“So,” said Ron, “d’you reckon he’s somewhere in Hogsmeade?”</p>
<p>“Could be anywhere,” said Moody, shaking his head. “Only thing we
know for sure is that he’s not here.”</p>
<p>He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth
revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, “Now, Dumbledore’s
told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there’s nothing
you can do for Crouch. The Ministry’ll be looking for him now,
Dumbledore’s notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third
task.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry. “Oh yeah . . .”</p>
<p>He hadn’t given the maze a single thought since he’d left it with
Krum the previous night.</p>
<p>“Should be right up your street, this one,” said Moody, looking up at
Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. “From what
Dumbledore’s said, you’ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty
of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the
Sorcerer’s Stone in your first year, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“We helped,” Ron said quickly. “Me and Hermione helped.”</p>
<p>Moody grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, help him practice for this one, and I’ll be very surprised if
he doesn’t win,” said Moody. “In the meantime . . . constant vigilance,
Potter. Constant vigilance.” He took another long draw from his hip
flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of
the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.</p>
<p>“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, “you
stick close to Potter, all right? I’m keeping an eye on things, but all
the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out.”</p>
<p>Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down
beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of
Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took
the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, “Ha! She hasn’t got
wind of Crouch!” then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to
say on the mysterious events of the night before last.</p>
<p>Harry — what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the
forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you
are not going to go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody
highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop
Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them
in the dark. You could have been killed.</p>
<p>Your name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If
someone’s trying to attack you, they’re on their last chance. Stay close
to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm
yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few
hexes wouldn’t go amiss either. There’s nothing you can do about Crouch.
Keep your head down and look after yourself. I’m waiting for your letter
giving me your word you won’t stray out-of-bounds again.</p>
<p>“Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?” said Harry in
mild indignation as he folded up Sirius’s letter and put it inside his
robes. “After all the stuff he did at school!”</p>
<p>“He’s worried about you!” said Hermione sharply. “Just like Moody and
Hagrid! So listen to them!”</p>
<p>“No one’s tried to attack me all year,” said Harry. “No one’s done
anything to me at all —”</p>
<p>“Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,” said Hermione. “And
they must’ve done that for a reason, Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe
they’ve been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they’re going to
get you.”</p>
<p>“Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is right, and
someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would’ve been in the
trees near us, wouldn’t they? But they waited till I was out of the way
until they acted, didn’t they? So it doesn’t look like I’m their target,
does it?”</p>
<p>“They couldn’t have made it look like an accident if they’d murdered
you in the forest!” said Hermione. “But if you die during a task —”</p>
<p>“They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they?” said Harry. “Why
didn’t they just polish me off at the same time? They could’ve made it
look like Krum and I had a duel or something.”</p>
<p>“Harry, I don’t understand it either,” said Hermione desperately. “I
just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don’t like it. .
. . Moody’s right — Sirius is right — you’ve got to get in training for
the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to
Sirius and promise him you’re not going to go sneaking off alone
again.”</p>
<p>The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had
to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time
either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else
in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was
concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The
trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and
Hermione’s part.</p>
<p>“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as
he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having
just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row.
“Let’s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do
anything to help you. I’m not complaining or anything” — he got gingerly
to his feet, rubbing his backside — “but I’m aching all over. . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said Hermione
impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the
Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. “Just try and
fall backward!”</p>
<p>“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione!” said Ron
angrily. “Why don’t you take a turn?”</p>
<p>“Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway,” said Hermione hastily.
“And we don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s been able to
do that for ages. . . . I think we ought to start on some of these hexes
this evening.”</p>
<p>She looked down the list they had made in the library.</p>
<p>“I like the look of this one,” she said, “this Impediment Curse.
Should slow down anything that’s trying to attack you, Harry. We’ll
start with that one.”</p>
<p>The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwick’s
cupboard and slipped out of the classroom.</p>
<p>“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy,
while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad
strips of dazzling gold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high
windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had
been enameled.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be boiling in Trelawney’s room, she never puts out
that fire,” said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver
ladder and the trapdoor.</p>
<p>He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The
fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harry’s head swam
as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor
Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a
lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz
armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. It was extremely
comfortable.</p>
<p>“My dears,” said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged
armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her
strangely enlarged eyes, “we have almost finished our work on planetary
divination. Today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine
the effects of Mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present
time. If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights. . . .”</p>
<p>She waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only
source of light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from
under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within
a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in
place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in
thin air beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney
began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune. The
heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window
played across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere
behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop. . . .</p>
<p>He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear
blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower
and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry’s face, until
they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house
and entered. Now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room
at the very end . . . through the door they went, into a dark room whose
windows were boarded up. . . .</p>
<p>Harry had left the owl’s back . . . he was watching, now, as it
fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him. . . .
There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair . . . both of
them were stirring. . . .</p>
<p>One was a huge snake . . . the other was a man . . . a short, balding
man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose . . . he was wheezing and
sobbing on the hearth rug. . . .</p>
<p>“You are in luck, Wormtail,” said a cold, high-pitched voice from the
depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. “You are very fortunate
indeed. Your blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.”</p>
<p>“My Lord!” gasped the man on the floor. “My Lord, I am . . . I am so
pleased . . . and so sorry. . . .”</p>
<p>“Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. I will not be
feeding Wormtail to you, after all . . . but never mind, never mind . .
. there is still Harry Potter. . . .”</p>
<p>The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.</p>
<p>“Now, Wormtail,” said the cold voice, “perhaps one more little
reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you. . . .”</p>
<p>“My Lord . . . no . . . I beg you . . .”</p>
<p>The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was
pointing at Wormtail.</p>
<p>“Crucio!” said the cold voice.</p>
<p>Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on
fire, the screaming filled Harry’s ears as the scar on his forehead
seared with pain; he was yelling too. . . . Voldemort would hear him,
would know he was there. . . .</p>
<p>“Harry! Harry!”</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor
Trelawney’s room with his hands over his face. His scar was still
burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been real.
The whole class was standing around him, and Ron was kneeling next to
him, looking terrified.</p>
<p>“You all right?” he said.</p>
<p>“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly
excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. “What was it,
Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He
couldn’t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him;
Voldemort’s voice had sounded so close. . . .</p>
<p>“You were clutching your scar!” said Professor Trelawney. “You were
rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now, Potter, I have
experience in these matters!”</p>
<p>Harry looked up at her.</p>
<p>“I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,” he said. “Bad
headache.”</p>
<p>“My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary
clairvoyant vibrations of my room!” said Professor Trelawney. “If you
leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have
ever —”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure,” said
Harry.</p>
<p>He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.</p>
<p>“See you later,” Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and
headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing
an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a
real treat.</p>
<p>When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not
set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going
there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and
Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to
Dumbledore’s office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what
he had seen in the dream . . . it had been as vivid as the one that had
awoken him on Privet Drive. . . . He ran over the details in his mind,
trying to make sure he could remember them. . . . He had heard Voldemort
accusing Wormtail of making a blunder . . . but the owl had brought good
news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead . . . so Wormtail
was not going to be fed to the snake . . . he, Harry, was going to be
fed to it instead. . . .</p>
<p>Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance
to Dumbledore’s office without noticing. He blinked, looked around,
realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of
it. Then he remembered that he didn’t know the password.</p>
<p>“Lemon drop?” he tried tentatively.</p>
<p>The gargoyle did not move.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry, staring at it, “Pear Drop. Er — Licorice Wand.
Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor
Beans . . . oh no, he doesn’t like them, does he? . . . oh just open,
can’t you?” he said angrily. “I really need to see him, it’s
urgent!”</p>
<p>The gargoyle remained immovable.</p>
<p>Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his
big toe.</p>
<p>“Chocolate Frog!” he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. “Sugar
Quill! Cockroach Cluster!”</p>
<p>The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.</p>
<p>“Cockroach Cluster?” he said, amazed. “I was only joking. . . .”</p>
<p>He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of
a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed
behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door
knocker.</p>
<p>He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the
moving staircase and hesitated, listening.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see it at
all!” It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. “Ludo
says Bertha’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we
would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we’ve no
evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance
being linked with Barty Crouch’s!”</p>
<p>“And what do you think’s happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?” said
Moody’s growling voice.</p>
<p>“I see two possibilities, Alastor,” said Fudge. “Either Crouch has
finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his
personal history — lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere
—”</p>
<p>“He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,” said
Dumbledore calmly.</p>
<p>“Or else — well . . .” Fudge sounded embarrassed. “Well, I’ll reserve
judgment until after I’ve seen the place where he was found, but you say
it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what
that woman is?”</p>
<p>“I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent
dancer,” said Dumbledore quietly.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily. “Don’t you think you might be
prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don’t all turn out
harmless — if, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster
fixation he’s got —”</p>
<p>“I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, just
as calmly. “I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced,
Cornelius.”</p>
<p>“Can we wrap up this discussion?” growled Moody.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, let’s go down to the grounds, then,” said Fudge
impatiently.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that,” said Moody, “it’s just that Potter wants a word
with you, Dumbledore. He’s just outside the door.”</p>
