<h4 id="chapter-thirty-two">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h4>
<p>FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE</p>
<p>Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way,
and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He
raised his head.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” he said.</p>
<p>Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they
looked around.</p>
<p>They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously
traveled miles — perhaps hundreds of miles — for even the mountains
surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark
and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible
beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their
left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the
hillside.</p>
<p>Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.</p>
<p>“Did anyone tell you the Cup was a Portkey?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nope,” said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was
completely silent and slightly eerie. “Is this supposed to be part of
the task?”</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. “Wands out,
d’you reckon?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather
than him.</p>
<p>They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had,
yet again, the strange feeling that they were being watched.</p>
<p>“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly.</p>
<p>Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure
drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry
couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding
its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was,
he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to
obscure his face. And — several paces nearer, the gap between them
closing all the time — Harry saw that the thing in the person’s arms
looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a bundle of robes?</p>
<p>Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric.
Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the
approaching figure.</p>
<p>It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from
them. For a second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked
at one another.</p>
<p>And then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded with pain. It was
agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from
his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was
on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to
split open.</p>
<p>From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, “Kill
the spare.”</p>
<p>A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the
night: “Avada Kedavra!”</p>
<p>A blast of green light blazed through Harry’s eyelids, and he heard
something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar
reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified
of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.</p>
<p>Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was
dead.</p>
<p>For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric’s
face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of
a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly
surprised. And then, before Harry’s mind had accepted what he was
seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt
himself being pulled to his feet.</p>
<p>The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and
was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon
it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed
against it.</p>
<p>TOM RIDDLE</p>
<p>The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him
from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast
breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him
— hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who
was under the hood. It was Wormtail.</p>
<p>“You!” he gasped.</p>
<p>But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he
was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling
uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound
so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t move an inch, Wormtail drew
a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed
it roughly into Harry’s mouth; then, without a word, he turned from
Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn’t make a sound, nor could he see
where Wormtail had gone; he couldn’t turn his head to see beyond the
headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.</p>
<p>Cedric’s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him,
glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry’s wand was on
the ground at Cedric’s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought
was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be
stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain
again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn’t want to see what was in
those robes . . . he didn’t want that bundle opened. . . .</p>
<p>He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic
snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was
tied. Wormtail’s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It
sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then
he came back within Harry’s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a
stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to
be water — Harry could hear it slopping around — and it was larger than
any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a
full-grown man to sit in.</p>
<p>The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more
persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was
busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly
there were crackling flames beneath it. The large snake slithered away
into the darkness.</p>
<p>The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface
began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it
were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail
tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated.
And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.</p>
<p>“Hurry!”</p>
<p>The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might
have been encrusted with diamonds.</p>
<p>“It is ready, Master.”</p>
<p>“Now . . .” said the cold voice.</p>
<p>Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was
inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of
material blocking his mouth.</p>
<p>It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed
something ugly, slimy, and blind — but worse, a hundred times worse. The
thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human
child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It
was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and
legs were thin and feeble, and its face — no child alive ever had a face
like that — flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.</p>
<p>The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them
around Wormtail’s neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood
fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s weak, pale
face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the
cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in
the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail
lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it
vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom
with a soft thud.</p>
<p>Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance,
please . . . let it drown. . . .</p>
<p>Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond
his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the
night.</p>
<p>“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!”</p>
<p>The surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked. Horrified, Harry
watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail’s
command and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the
water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a
vivid, poisonous-looking blue.</p>
<p>And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining
silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified
sobs.</p>
<p>“Flesh — of the servant — w-willingly given — you will — revive —
your master.”</p>
<p>He stretched his right hand out in front of him — the hand with the
missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and
swung it upward.</p>
<p>Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it
happened — he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not
block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as
though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall
to the ground, heard Wormtail’s anguished panting, then a sickening
splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron. Harry couldn’t stand
to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it
shone through Harry’s closed eyelids. . . .</p>
<p>Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt
Wormtail’s anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was
right in front of him.</p>
<p>“B-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken . . . you will . . .
resurrect your foe.”</p>
<p>Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . . .
Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw
the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand. He felt
its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down
the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled
in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry’s cut, so that a
dribble of blood fell into it.</p>
<p>He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry’s blood. He poured it
inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail,
his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped
sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm,
gasping and sobbing.</p>
<p>The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all
directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety
blackness. Nothing happened. . . .</p>
<p>Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . . .</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were
extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron
instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn’t
see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air. . . .
It’s gone wrong, he thought . . . it’s drowned . . . please . . . please
let it be dead. . . .</p>
<p>But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge
of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising
slowly from inside the cauldron.</p>
<p>“Robe me,” said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and
Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm,
scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet,
reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master’s head.</p>
<p>The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and
Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for
three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a
nose that was flat as a snake’s with slits for nostrils . . .</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort had risen again.</p>
