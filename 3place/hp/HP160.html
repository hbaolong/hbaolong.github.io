<h4 id="chapter-twenty-eight">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h4>
<p>FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE</p>
<p>Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not
happened. . . . It could not have happened. . . .</p>
<p>“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape.</p>
<p>He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the
door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister
followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through
the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him
paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw
the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to
leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.</p>
<p>“Petrificus Totalus!”</p>
<p>The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something
solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit
the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the
darkened staircase.</p>
<p>Terror tore at Harry’s heart. . . . He had to get to Dumbledore and
he had to catch Snape. . . . Somehow the two things were linked. . . .
He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. . . .
Dumbledore could not have died. . . .</p>
<p>He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where
he landed, his wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust;
half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging
before him, but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom,
he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go!” and saw Snape
disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and
Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As
Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from
the fray and flew at him: It was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of
Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with
filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling
his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat —</p>
<p>“Petrificus Totalus!”</p>
<p>Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he
pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came
flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His
feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled:
There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood,
but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like
flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death
Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged
them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you
can’t dance forever, pretty —”</p>
<p>“Impedimenta!” yelled Harry.</p>
<p>His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain,
was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down
it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin,
each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw
Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in
all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them,
cracking stone, shattering the nearest window —</p>
<p>“Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but there was no time
to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly
avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits
of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape —</p>
<p>“Take that!” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the
female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her
arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself
after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was
lying across someone’s legs. Looking around, he saw Neville’s pale,
round face flat against the floor.</p>
<p>“Neville, are you — ?”</p>
<p>“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach,
“Harry . . . Snape ’n’ Malfoy . . . ran past . . .”</p>
<p>“I know, I’m on it!” said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the
enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man
gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around,
staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry
scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor,
ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to
come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he
did not yet know. . . .</p>
<p>He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape
had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered
the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to
secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could
hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he
sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody
footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was
heading toward the front doors — perhaps the Room of Requirement was
indeed blocked —</p>
<p>He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived
behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister
running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but
merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who
ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of
armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the
castle seemed to have awoken. . . .</p>
<p>He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and
sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached
the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down
the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and
out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad
Hufflepuffs stood.</p>
<p>“Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something about the Dark
Mark —” began Ernie Macmillan.</p>
<p>“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he
sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble
staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears
of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled
against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their
faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the
rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the
flagstones below.</p>
<p>Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He
could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for
the gates beyond which they could Disapparate — by the looks of them,
the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy
. . .</p>
<p>The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore after them; he
saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his
quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near
enough to get a good aim with a curse —</p>
<p>Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry
understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the
Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs
and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden
voice in his head said: not Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . .</p>
<p>Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell
forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both
nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the
brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in
behind him. . . .</p>
<p>“Impedimenta!” he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to
the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled
and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on
after Snape.</p>
<p>And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light
of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death
Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrid’s
immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his
giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however,
were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to
Disapparate —</p>
<p>Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape’s back,
and yelled, “Stupefy!”</p>
<p>He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s head; Snape
shouted, “Run, Draco!” and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry
looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Cruc —”</p>
<p>But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet
before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up
again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendio!” Harry heard
an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them:
Hagrid’s house was on fire.</p>
<p>“Fang’s in there, yer evil — !” Hagrid bellowed.</p>
<p>“Cruc —” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure
ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell
again. Harry could see him sneering.</p>
<p>“No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he shouted over the
rushing of the flames, Hagrid’s yells, and the wild yelping of the
trapped Fang. “You haven’t got the nerve or the ability —”</p>
<p>“Incarc —” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost
lazy flick of his arm.</p>
<p>“Fight back!” Harry screamed at him. “Fight back, you cowardly —”</p>
<p>“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. “Your father would
never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I
wonder?”</p>
<p>“Stupe —”</p>
<p>“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth
shut and your mind closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, deflecting the curse
once more. “Now come!” he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry.
“It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up —”</p>
<p>“Impedi —”</p>
<p>But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he
keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of
this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness —</p>
<p>“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had
started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and
panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you forgotten our
orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord — we are to leave him! Go!
Go!”</p>
<p>And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and
sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates.
Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared
not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he
staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated
Voldemort himself —</p>
<p>“Sectum — !”</p>
<p>Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but
Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape’s face clearly at
last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a
face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry
thought, Levi —</p>
<p>“No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was
soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand
flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as
Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and
defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by
the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before
he had cursed Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented
them — I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you’d turn my inventions on me,
like your filthy father, would you? I don’t think so . . . no!”</p>
<p>Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet
away into the darkness and out of sight.</p>
<p>“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage
and contempt. “Kill me like you killed him, you coward —”</p>
<p>“DON’T —” screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented,
inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog
stuck in the burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!”</p>
<p>And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something
hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots
of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath
seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above
him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at
Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him.
As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming
from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as
he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry
had never heard him screech —</p>
<p>Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand,
hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the
grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough,
by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the
hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just
beyond the school’s boundaries.</p>
<p>“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. “HAGRID?”</p>
<p>He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged
from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of
thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his
body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.</p>
<p>“Yeh all righ’, Harry? Yeh all righ’? Speak ter me, Harry. . . .”</p>
<p>Hagrid’s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the
stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and
felt Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.</p>
<p>“I’m all right,” panted Harry. “Are you?”</p>
<p>“’Course I am . . . take more’n that ter finish me.”</p>
<p>Hagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised him up with such
force that Harry’s feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set
him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid’s cheek from
a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.</p>
<p>“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’
. . .”</p>
<p>“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a
smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, “Aguamenti!”</p>
<p>A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand
arm, which felt like lead, and murmured “Aguamenti” too: Together, he
and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was
extinguished.</p>
<p>“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking
at the smoking wreck. “Nothin’ Dumbledore won’ be able to put righ’ . .
.”</p>
<p>Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In
the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.</p>
<p>“Hagrid . . .”</p>
<p>“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em
comin’,” said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin.
“They’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .”</p>
<p>“Hagrid . . .”</p>
<p>“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin’ down
from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em?
Where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them?”</p>
<p>“He . . .” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the
smoke. “Hagrid, he killed . . .”</p>
<p>“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be
seen completely blank, uncomprehending.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”</p>
<p>“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”</p>
<p>“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’
be stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”</p>
<p>“I saw it happen.”</p>
<p>“Yeh couldn’ have.”</p>
<p>“I saw it, Hagrid.”</p>
<p>Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but
sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow
to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a
jinx. . . .</p>
<p>“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep
his cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. .
. .”</p>
<p>Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking
uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. . . . As
they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of
its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside
as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters
had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must
have been killed. . . .</p>
<p>The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto
the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were
creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the
Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry’s eyes, however, were
fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that
he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he
was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared
wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore’s body must lie,
however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.</p>
<p>“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as he and Harry
approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their
ankles. “Wha’s tha’, lyin’ on the grass?” Hagrid added sharply, heading
now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was
congregating. “See it, Harry? Righ’ at the foot o’ the tower? Under
where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don’ think someone got thrown —
?”</p>
<p>Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express
aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his
face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit
him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was
suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing
feeling in his chest. . . .</p>
<p>He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the
very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a
gap.</p>
<p>Harry heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he
walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay
and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the
moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him
lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was
dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here,
spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would
ever, meet.</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms
and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened
the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of
blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise
old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth:
that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he
help. . . .</p>
<p>The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time,
he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked
down.</p>
<p>The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen
out of Dumbledore’s pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with
which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or
horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up,
that there was something wrong. . . .</p>
<p>He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as
the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any
markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be
Slytherin’s mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of
folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should
have been.</p>
<p>Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry
pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light
of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:</p>
<p>To the Dark Lord</p>
<p>I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to
know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real
Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.</p>
<p>I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be
mortal once more.</p>
