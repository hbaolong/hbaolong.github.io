<h4 id="chapter-twenty-nine">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h4>
<p>CAREER ADVICE</p>
<p>But why haven’t you got Occlumency lessons anymore?” said Hermione,
frowning.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you,” Harry muttered. “Snape reckons I can carry on by
myself now I’ve got the basics . . .”</p>
<p>“So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said Hermione
skeptically.</p>
<p>“Pretty much,” said Harry, not looking at her.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure
you can control them!” said Hermione indignantly. “Harry, I think you
should go back to him and ask —”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry forcefully. “Just drop it, Hermione, okay?”</p>
<p>It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her
custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules for
the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it — it was easier than
arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.</p>
<p>Ron had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left
until their exams.</p>
<p>“How can that come as a shock?” Hermione demanded, as she tapped each
little square on Ron’s schedule with her wand so that it flashed a
different color according to its subject.</p>
<p>“I dunno . . .” said Ron, “there’s been a lot going on . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, there you are,” she said, handing him his schedule, “if you
follow that you should do fine.”</p>
<p>Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.</p>
<p>“You’ve given me an evening off every week!”</p>
<p>“That’s for Quidditch practice,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>The smile faded from Ron’s face.</p>
<p>“What’s the point?” he said. “We’ve got about as much chance of
winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad’s got of becoming Minister of
Magic . . .”</p>
<p>Hermione said nothing. She was looking at Harry, who was staring
blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed
at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Harry?”</p>
<p>“What?” he said quickly. “Nothing . . .”</p>
<p>He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be
looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job
and slunk away under Hermione’s chair.</p>
<p>“I saw Cho earlier,” said Hermione tentatively, “and she looked
really miserable too. . . . Have you two had a row again?”</p>
<p>“Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said Harry, seizing gratefully on the
excuse.</p>
<p>“What about?”</p>
<p>“That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I don’t blame you!” said Ron angrily, setting down his
study schedule. “If it hadn’t been for her . . .”</p>
<p>Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found
helpful. All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah” and
“that’s right” whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell,
ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.</p>
<p>He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had
been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that he never
had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape’s aspersions on his
father’s character. Hadn’t people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how
wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like
himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry’s head. . . . He was as bad,
wasn’t he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that
his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had
described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not
imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it .
. . not unless they really loathed them . . . Perhaps Malfoy, or
somebody who really deserved it . . .</p>
<p>Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had
suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to
you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if
you know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius
said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place
that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able
to exercise some control over James and Sirius. . . . But in the
Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen. . . .</p>
<p>Harry reminded himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been
decent, yet the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at
James disturbed him quite as much as anything else. She had clearly
loathed James and Harry simply could not understand how they could have
ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had
forced her into it. . . .</p>
<p>For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of
comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James
he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold and
miserable at the thought of him.</p>
<p>The weather grew breezier, brighter, and warmer as the holidays
passed, but Harry was stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh
years, who were all trapped inside, traipsing back and forth to the
library. Harry pretended that his bad mood had no other cause but the
approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying
themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.</p>
<p>“Harry, I’m talking to you, can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>He looked around. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined
him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on
Sunday evening; Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review
Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice.</p>
<p>“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. “How come
you’re not at practice?”</p>
<p>“It’s over,” said Ginny. “Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the
hospital wing.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his
own bat.” She sighed heavily. “Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it’s
only just got through Umbridge’s new screening process . . .”</p>
<p>She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had
clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a
scribbled note across it in red ink, reading INSPECTED AND PASSED BY THE
HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR.</p>
<p>“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said Ginny. “There’s one for you. . . .
There you go . . .”</p>
<p>She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced
Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing
Whizbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a
hard lump rise in his throat.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was
painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him
feel like this.</p>
<p>“You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I’m sure
if you just talked to Cho . . .”</p>
<p>“It’s not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.</p>
<p>“Who is it, then?” asked Ginny.</p>
<p>“I . . .”</p>
<p>He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening; Madam
Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a
frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.</p>
<p>“I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I
can’t.”</p>
<p>More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted
any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit, and put it
into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg too, “if
you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to
do it . . .”</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Harry hopelessly. “With Umbridge policing the fires
and reading all our mail?”</p>
<p>“The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said Ginny
thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if
you’ve got enough nerve.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate —
Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors —
or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been
burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful. . . .</p>
<p>“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?”</p>
<p>“Oh damn,” whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. “I forgot —”</p>
<p>Madam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face contorted
with rage.</p>
<p>“Chocolate in the library!” she screamed. “Out — out — OUT!”</p>
<p>And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry’s books, bag, and ink
bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly
over the head as they ran.</p>
<p>As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations,
a batch of pamphlets, leaflets, and notices concerning various Wizarding
careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the
end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which
read:</p>
<p>CAREER ADVICE</p>
<p>All fifth years will be required to attend a short meeting with their
Head of House during the first week of the Summer term, in which they
will be given the opportunity to discuss their future careers. Times of
individual appointments are listed below.</p>
<p>Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in
Professor McGonagall’s office at half-past two on Monday, which would
mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent a
considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all
the career information that had been left there for their perusal.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the
holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed
bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front. “It says here you need
at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration,
Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . .
Don’t want much, do they?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a very responsible job, isn’t it?” said Hermione
absently. She was poring over a bright pink-and-orange leaflet that was
headed SO YOU THINK YOU’D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS? “You don’t
seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles. . . . All they
want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies . . . ‘Much more important is your
enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun!’”</p>
<p>“You’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,”
said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like . . .” He was
halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking. “Listen to this:</p>
<p>“‘Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure,
and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a
position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting
Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . .’ They want
Arithmancy, though. . . . You could do it, Hermione!”</p>
<p>“I don’t much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in
HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?</p>
<p>“Hey,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. He looked around; Fred and George
had come to join them. “Ginny’s had a word with us about you,” said
Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing
several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off onto
the floor. “She says you need to talk to Sirius?”</p>
<p>“What?” said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway toward
picking up MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND
CATASTROPHES.</p>
<p>“Yeah . . .” said Harry, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I thought I’d
like —”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so ridiculous,” said Hermione, straightening up and looking
at him as though she could not believe her eyes. “With Umbridge groping
around in the fires and frisking all the owls?”</p>
<p>“Well, we think we can find a way around that,” said George,
stretching and smiling. “It’s a simple matter of causing a diversion.
Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem
front during the Easter holidays?”</p>
<p>“What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?”
continued Fred. “No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course,
we’d have messed up people’s studying too, which would be the very last
thing we’d want to do.”</p>
<p>He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken
aback by this thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>“But it’s business as usual from tomorrow,” Fred continued briskly.
“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that
Harry can have his chat with Sirius?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but still,” said Hermione with an air of explaining something
very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you do cause a diversion,
how is Harry supposed to talk to him?”</p>
<p>“Umbridge’s office,” said Harry quietly.</p>
<p>He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no
alternative; Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was
not being watched was her own.</p>
<p>“Are — you — insane?” said Hermione in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade
and was watching the conversation warily.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging.</p>
<p>“And how are you going to get in there in the first place?”</p>
<p>Harry was ready for this question.</p>
<p>“Sirius’s knife,” he said.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock,”
said Harry. “So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t
work, which I bet she has —”</p>
<p>“What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry
was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her husband
during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an
opinion. “If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping Ron hard
on the back. “Right, then. We’re thinking of doing it tomorrow, just
after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact if everybody’s in
the corridors — Harry, we’ll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw
her right away from her own office — I reckon we should be able to
guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?” he said, looking at George.</p>
<p>“Easy,” said George.</p>
<p>“What sort of diversion is it?” asked Ron.</p>
<p>“You’ll see, little bro,” said Fred, as he and George got up again.
“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor
round about five o’clock tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he
had done on the morning of his hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was
not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge’s office and using her
fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that
was certainly bad enough — today also happened to be the first time he
would be in close proximity with Snape since Snape had thrown him out of
his office, as they had Potions that day.</p>
<p>After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry
got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville’s bed,
staring out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty,
opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering
beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not
sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what
he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius’s own
account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there
might have been, any excuse at all for his father’s behavior. . . .</p>
<p>Something caught Harry’s attention: movement on the edge of the
Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging
from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched,
Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it.
Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge
again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so
badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . .</p>
<p>Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and
started to dress.</p>
<p>With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge’s office ahead,
Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not
reckoned on Hermione’s almost continual attempts to dissuade him from
what he was planning to do at five o’clock. For the first time ever, she
was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as
Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that
Harry tried very hard to ignore.</p>
<p>“. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled,
she’ll be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I
expect she’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions .
. .”</p>
<p>“Hermione,” said Ron in a low and indignant voice, “are you going to
stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to
take notes instead?”</p>
<p>“You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!”</p>
<p>By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was
speaking to Hermione any longer. Undeterred, she took advantage of their
silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered
under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five
whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.</p>
<p>Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were
invisible. Harry was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was one
of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful he had to
suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure
from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new
approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when
left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite
easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a
flask, corked it, and took it up to Snape’s desk for marking, feeling
that he might at last have scraped an E.</p>
<p>He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy gave a
gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His potion sample
lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him with a look of
gloating pleasure.</p>
<p>“Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .”</p>
<p>Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron,
intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to
his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I’m really
sorry, Harry, I thought you’d finished, so I cleared up!”</p>
<p>Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he
hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that
he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that
Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge’s office
again.</p>
<p>He was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to Divination that
he had quite forgotten his career appointment with Professor McGonagall,
remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasn’t in her office. He
hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes
late.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Professor,” he panted, as he closed the door. “I forgot . .
.”</p>
<p>“No matter, Potter,” she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody
else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a
fussy little pie-frill around her neck, and a small, horribly smug smile
on her face.</p>
<p>“Sit down, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands
shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her
desk.</p>
<p>Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend
he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.</p>
<p>“Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you
might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue
into sixth and seventh years,” said Professor McGonagall. “Have you had
any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave
Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Er,” said Harry.</p>
<p>He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very
distracting.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled.</p>
<p>“You’d need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall,
extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and
opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under
‘Exceeds Expectations’ grade, I see. Then you would be required to
undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror
office. It’s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best.
In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three
years.”</p>
<p>At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though
she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall
ignored her.</p>
<p>“You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?”
she went on, talking a little more loudly than before.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “I would also advise
—”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this
time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them
again, and continued as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need
to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you
now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes
unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at Ordinary
Wizarding Level. I’d say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the moment, so
you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a
chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and
Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the merest flicker of a
smile. “Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must
tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who
get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their O.W.L.s, so —”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.</p>
<p>“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor McGonagall asked
curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.</p>
<p>“Oh no, thank you very much,” said Umbridge, with that simpering
laugh Harry hated so much. “I just wondered whether I could make the
teensiest interruption, Minerva?”</p>
<p>“I daresay you’ll find you can,” said Professor McGonagall through
tightly gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament
for an Auror?” said Professor Umbridge sweetly.</p>
<p>“Were you?” said Professor McGonagall haughtily. “Well, Potter,” she
continued, as though there had been no interruption, “if you are serious
in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing
your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick
has graded you between ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expectations’ for the
last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense
Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor
Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure you wouldn’t like a
cough drop, Dolores?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Professor Umbridge, who
had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned that you might
not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in
front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .”</p>
<p>“What, this thing?” said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion,
as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of
Harry’s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then
placed it back into the folder without comment.</p>
<p>“Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a
pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror —”</p>
<p>“Did you not understand my note, Minerva?” asked Professor Umbridge
in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.</p>
<p>“Of course I understood it,” said Professor McGonagall, her teeth
clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled.</p>
<p>“Well, then, I am confused. . . . I’m afraid I don’t quite understand
how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that —”</p>
<p>“False hope?” repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look
round at Professor Umbridge. “He has achieved high marks in all his
Defense Against the Dark Arts tests —”</p>
<p>“I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you
will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his
classes with me —”</p>
<p>“I should have made my meaning plainer,” said Professor McGonagall,
turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. “He has achieved
high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent
teacher.”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb
blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard, and
began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to
side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils
flared, her eyes burning.</p>
<p>“Any questions, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry. “What sort of character and aptitude tests do the
Ministry do on you, if you get enough N.E.W.T.s?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to
pressure and so forth,” said Professor McGonagall, “perseverance and
dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to
mention very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more
study even after you’ve left school, so unless you’re prepared to —”</p>
<p>“I think you’ll also find,” said Umbridge, her voice very cold now,
“that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be
Aurors. Their criminal records.”</p>
<p>“— unless you’re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you
should really look at another —”</p>
<p>“— which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror
as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.”</p>
<p>“A very good chance, then,” said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Potter has a criminal record,” said Umbridge loudly.</p>
<p>“Potter has been cleared of all charges,” said Professor McGonagall,
even more loudly.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make
a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor had given
place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly
sinister.</p>
<p>“Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall got to her feet too, and in her case this was a
much more impressive move. She towered over Professor Umbridge.</p>
<p>“Potter,” she said in ringing tones, “I will assist you to become an
Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I
will make sure you achieve the required results!”</p>
<p>“The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter!” said
Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.</p>
<p>“There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is
ready to join!” shouted Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Aha!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at
McGonagall. “Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That’s what you want, isn’t
it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus
Dumbledore! You think you’ll be where I am, don’t you, Senior
Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!”</p>
<p>“You are raving,” said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful.
“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.”</p>
<p>Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room,
not daring to look at Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor
McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the
corridor.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a
race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
that afternoon.</p>
<p>“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do,
Harry,” Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to
chapter thirty-four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”). “Umbridge looks
like she’s in a really bad mood already . . .”</p>
<p>Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept
his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused,
thinking. . . .</p>
<p>He could just imagine Professor McGonagall’s reaction if he were
caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge’s office mere hours after she
had vouched for him. . . . There was nothing to stop him simply going
back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer
holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had
witnessed in the Pensieve. . . . Nothing, except that the thought of
taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead
weight had dropped into his stomach. . . . And then there was the matter
of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention
the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his
schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisibility Cloak. . . .</p>
<p>But the fact remained that if he were caught . . .</p>
<p>“Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!”
whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge.
“And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!”</p>
<p>He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of
what his father had done on a summer’s day more than twenty years ago. .
. .</p>
<p>And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor
common room . . . “You’re less like your father than I thought. . . .
The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James . . .”</p>
<p>But did he want to be like his father anymore?</p>
<p>“Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” Hermione said in anguished
tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.</p>
<p>He did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed determined
to give neither his opinion nor his advice. He would not look at Harry,
though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more,
he said in a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay? He can make up his own
mind.”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway
along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of a
diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells
reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the classrooms
all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the
ceiling fearfully —</p>
<p>Then Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short
legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the
opposite direction: It was now or never.</p>
<p>“Harry — please!” said Hermione weakly.</p>
<p>But he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely onto his
shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now
hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was
about in the east wing. . . .</p>
<p>Harry reached the corridor where Umbridge’s office was situated and
found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet
creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius’s
knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and
carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor
until he reached Umbridge’s door.</p>
<p>He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it
and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny
click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the
door quickly behind him, and looked around.</p>
<p>It was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on the
plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated
broomsticks.</p>
<p>Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found
what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing
glittering Floo powder.</p>
<p>He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He
had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work.
Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder
and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded
at once into emerald-green flames.</p>
<p>“Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” Harry said loudly and clearly.</p>
<p>It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced; he
had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his
entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the
network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country: This
time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge’s office,
and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire. . . .</p>
<p>And then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling
rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler
around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up
out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat
poring over a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>“Sirius?”</p>
<p>The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.</p>
<p>“Harry!” he said, looking thoroughly shocked. “What are you — what’s
happened, is everything all right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a — a
chat with Sirius.”</p>
<p>“I’ll call him,” said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking
perplexed. “He went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding
in the attic again . . .”</p>
<p>And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with
nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius
had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the
fire — his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged
contact with Umbridge’s hard stone floor.</p>
<p>Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.</p>
<p>“What is it?” said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out
of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he
and Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned.
“Are you all right? Do you need help?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to
talk . . . about my dad . . .”</p>
<p>They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time
to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the
second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed from the
start of the diversion — George had only guaranteed him twenty. He
therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the
Pensieve.</p>
<p>When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment.
Then Lupin said quietly, “I wouldn’t like you to judge your father on
what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen —”</p>
<p>“I’m fifteen!” said Harry heatedly.</p>
<p>“Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each
other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of
those things, you can understand that, can’t you? I think James was
everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at
Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this
little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James —
whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry — always hated the Dark
Arts.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason,
just because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he finished
with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.</p>
<p>“I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly.</p>
<p>Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what
you’ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in
the school at whatever they did — everyone thought they were the height
of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away —”</p>
<p>“If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said
Sirius.</p>
<p>Lupin smiled.</p>
<p>“He kept messing up his hair,” said Harry in a pained voice.</p>
<p>Sirius and Lupin laughed.</p>
<p>“I’d forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately.</p>
<p>“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin
beamed reminiscently. “Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an
idiot.”</p>
<p>“Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were
all idiots! Well — not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at Lupin,
but Lupin shook his head.</p>
<p>“Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the
guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves
sometimes. . . . That was something . . .”</p>
<p>“And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on
his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the
lake, hoping they were watching him!”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was
around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn’t stop himself showing off
whenever he got near her.”</p>
<p>“How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated
him!”</p>
<p>“Nah, she didn’t,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.</p>
<p>“Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.</p>
<p>“Even Snape?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a special case. I mean, he
never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect
James to take that lying down, could you?”</p>
<p>“And my mum was okay with that?”</p>
<p>“She didn’t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,” said
Sirius. “I mean, James didn’t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him
in front of her, did he?”</p>
<p>Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he
was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He
grew out of it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay,” said Harry heavily. “I just never thought I’d feel
sorry for Snape.”</p>
<p>“Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease between his
eyebrows, “how did Snape react when he found you’d seen all this?”</p>
<p>“He told me he’d never teach me Occlumency again,” said Harry
indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint —”</p>
<p>“He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a
mouthful of ashes.</p>
<p>“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lupin quickly. “He’s stopped giving
you lessons?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great
overreaction. “But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s a bit of a relief to
tell you the —”</p>
<p>“I’m coming up there to have a word with Snape!” said Sirius
forcefully and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back
down again.</p>
<p>“If anyone’s going to tell Snape it will be me!” he said firmly. “But
Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no
account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears —”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me!” said Harry, outraged. “You
didn’t see him when we got out of the Pensieve —”</p>
<p>“Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!”
said Lupin sternly. “Do you understand me? Nothing!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay,” said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention
annoyed. “I’ll . . . I’ll try and say something to him. . . . But it
won’t be . . .”</p>
<p>He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.</p>
<p>“Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Sirius, glancing behind him. “It must be somebody your end
. . .”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart skipped several beats.</p>
<p>“I’d better go!” he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out
of Grimmauld Place’s fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving
on his shoulders, and then he found himself kneeling in front of
Umbridge’s fire with his head firmly back on, watching the emerald
flames flicker and die.</p>
<p>“Quickly, quickly!” he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the
office door. “Ah, she’s left it open . . .”</p>
<p>Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull
it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked
absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself
feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge’s
desk, and began rifling through the papers inside it.</p>
<p>“Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it
at last. . . . They’ve had it coming to them for years . . .”</p>
<p>He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly
back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.</p>
<p>Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had his bag and the
Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the
door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along
faster than Harry had ever seen him go.</p>
<p>One landing down from Umbridge’s office and Harry thought it was safe
to become visible again; he pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag
and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and movement
coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble staircase and
found what looked like most of the school assembled there.</p>
<p>It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students
were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry
noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap);
teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the
onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking
exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing
overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in the middle of
the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been
cornered.</p>
<p>“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was standing
just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey.
“So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp,
do you?”</p>
<p>“Pretty amusing, yeah,” said Fred, looking back up at her without the
slightest sign of fear.</p>
<p>Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with
happiness.</p>
<p>“I’ve got the form, Headmistress,” he said hoarsely, waving the piece
of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. “I’ve got the
form and I’ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it now . .
.”</p>
<p>“Very good, Argus,” she said. “You two,” she went on, gazing down at
Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my
school.”</p>
<p>“You know what?” said Fred. “I don’t think we are.”</p>
<p>He turned to his twin.</p>
<p>“George,” said Fred, “I think we’ve outgrown full-time
education.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve been feeling that way myself,” said George lightly.</p>
<p>“Time to test our talents in the real world, d’you reckon?” asked
Fred.</p>
<p>“Definitely,” said George.</p>
<p>And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and
said together, “Accio Brooms!”</p>
<p>Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his
left he ducked just in time — Fred and George’s broomsticks, one still
trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened
them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor toward their owners.
They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and stopped sharply in front
of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone
floor.</p>
<p>“We won’t be seeing you,” Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his
leg over his broomstick.</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t bother to keep in touch,” said George, mounting his
own.</p>
<p>Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent,
watchful crowd.</p>
<p>“If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs,
come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,”
he said in a loud voice. “Our new premises!”</p>
<p>“Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they’re going to
use our products to get rid of this old bat,” added George, pointing at
Professor Umbridge.</p>
<p>“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the
Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the
floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging
dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist
bobbing on his level above the crowd.</p>
<p>“Give her hell from us, Peeves.”</p>
<p>And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student
before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as
Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students
below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.</p>
