<h4 id="chapter-eight">CHAPTER EIGHT</h4>
<p>SNAPE VICTORIOUS</p>
<p>Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility
Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face,
listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His
immediate thought was that someone, surely, would check the compartments
before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting
realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would
be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would
walk in and step on him.</p>
<p>Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an
absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open
mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and now
the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the
dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and the loud
babble of talk.</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them.
Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall,
looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally
realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to
London.</p>
<p>He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then
he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells
without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out
of his hand, by saying the words “Accio Wand!” over and over again in
his head, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded
the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being
made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked
voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness
spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages
trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing
from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be
recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy
Parkinson.</p>
<p>The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he
was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling.
The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express
was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. . . .</p>
<p>Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead
said, “Wotcher, Harry.”</p>
<p>There was a flash of red light and Harry’s body unfroze; he was able
to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the
blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his head
to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just
pulled away.</p>
<p>“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the train
windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the
station. “Come on, we’ll jump.”</p>
<p>Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train
door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath
them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little
on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet
steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from
view.</p>
<p>The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was
looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been
discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back
the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>“Who did it?”</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for . . . well . .
.”</p>
<p>“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see
in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she
had been when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can fix your nose if you
stand still.”</p>
<p>Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit
Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when
it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed
stock-still and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Episkey,” said Tonks.</p>
<p>Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and
felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot!”</p>
<p>“You’d better put that Cloak back on, and we can walk up to the
school,” said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the Cloak back over
himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature
erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.</p>
<p>“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send
messages like this.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you or they’ll
worry. Come on, we’d better not dawdle.”</p>
<p>They set off toward the lane that led to the school.</p>
<p>“How did you find me?”</p>
<p>“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you had that Cloak. I
thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were
drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d check.”</p>
<p>“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra
protection,” said Tonks.</p>
<p>“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ?”</p>
<p>“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.”</p>
<p>“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made
carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his Cloak. Last
year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying
at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed
older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of
what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that
Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to
her, that it hadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring himself
to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius’s death; it was no more
her fault than anyone else’s (and much less than his), but he did not
like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on
through the cold night in silence, Tonks’s long cloak whispering on the
ground behind them.</p>
<p>Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before
appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great
relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each
topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry, and he was quite
keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand
to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.</p>
<p>“Alohomora!” he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock,
but nothing happened.</p>
<p>“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore bewitched them
himself.”</p>
<p>Harry looked around.</p>
<p>“I could climb a wall,” he suggested.</p>
<p>“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder jinxes on all
of them. Security’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of
helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for
morning.”</p>
<p>“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks. “Look.”</p>
<p>A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so
pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms
of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with
the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing
yellow light was ten feet away from them, and Harry had pulled off his
Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a
rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy
hair of Severus Snape.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping
the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates
creaked open. “Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have
evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from
your appearance.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my —” Harry began, but Snape cut
across him.</p>
<p>“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite — ah — safe in
my hands.”</p>
<p>“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, frowning.</p>
<p>“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here,
so I took it instead. And incidentally,” said Snape, standing back to
allow Harry to pass him, “I was interested to see your new
Patronus.”</p>
<p>He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains
with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into
place.</p>
<p>“I think you were better off with the old one,” said Snape, the
malice in his voice unmistakable. “The new one looks weak.”</p>
<p>As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of
shock and anger on Tonks’s face. Then she was covered in darkness once
more.</p>
<p>“Good night,” Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the
walk up to the school with Snape. “Thanks for . . . everything.”</p>
<p>“See you, Harry.”</p>
<p>Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body
was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible
that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from
their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and
irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry’s forgiveness by his
attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to
think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape’s snide remarks to
Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the
Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor
in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry
clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt
satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that
Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the
darkness.</p>
<p>“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” said Snape.
“And, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I
don’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in
the term: We haven’t even started pudding. You might have set a record,
Potter.”</p>
<p>The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot,
but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London
than tell Snape why he was late.</p>
<p>“I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?” Snape continued.
“And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the
Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic
effect.”</p>
<p>Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might
explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few
minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else
listening.</p>
<p>They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front
doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk
and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the
doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry wondered whether he could
slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the
long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the
entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry’s
mind, however, Snape said, “No Cloak. You can walk in so that everyone
sees you, which is what you wanted, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors:
anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall, with its four long
House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was
decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below
glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who
walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people
really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a
good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the
benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.</p>
<p>“Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your face?” said Ron,
goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity.</p>
<p>“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said Harry, grabbing a spoon and
squinting at his distorted reflection.</p>
<p>“You’re covered in blood!” said Hermione. “Come here —”</p>
<p>She raised her wand, said “Tergeo!” and siphoned off the dried
blood.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Harry, feeling his now clean face. “How’s my nose
looking?”</p>
<p>“Normal,” said Hermione anxiously. “Why shouldn’t it? Harry, what
happened? We’ve been terrified!”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that
Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless
Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to
eavesdrop.</p>
<p>“But —” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Not now, Hermione,” said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He
hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in
something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a
dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he
could, but there was always a chance it wouldn’t reach too many
Gryffindor ears.</p>
<p>He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of
chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with
puddings.</p>
<p>“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said Hermione, as Ron dived for a
large chocolate gateau.</p>
<p>“Hat say anything interesting?” asked Harry, taking a piece of
treacle tart.</p>
<p>“More of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face
of our enemies, you know.”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast,
doesn’t he? It can’t be long now.”</p>
<p>“Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast —”</p>
<p>“You’ve seen Snape? How come?” said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of
gateau.</p>
<p>“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively.</p>
<p>“Hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said Hermione. “Look, he’s
waving at you, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was
indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself
with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the
top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid’s elbow and
shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking
disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see
the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s other
side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the
start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with
beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her
spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had
been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had
been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill
Harry’s parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had made him
even less eager to find himself in her company, but thankfully, this
year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled
in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table.
Draco Malfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and
applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides
burning again. What he would not give to fight Malfoy one-on-one . .
.</p>
<p>“So what did Professor Slughorn want?” Hermione asked.</p>
<p>“To know what really happened at the Ministry,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione. “People were
interrogating us about it on the train, weren’t they, Ron?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron. “All wanting to know if you really are ‘the Chosen
One’ —”</p>
<p>“There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the
ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely
connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff.
“I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known
that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will
not pester you for information, however. ‘Harry Potter knows that he can
confide in me with complete confidence,’ I told them. ‘I would rather
die than betray his trust.’”</p>
<p>“That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already dead,” Ron
observed.</p>
<p>“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said
Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and
glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as
Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter
echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.</p>
<p>“The very best of evenings to you!” he said, smiling broadly, his
arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.</p>
<p>“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione.</p>
<p>She was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore’s right hand was
as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to
fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers swept the room; Dumbledore,
interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold
sleeve over his injury.</p>
<p>“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now . . . to our new
students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full
of magical education awaits you . . .”</p>
<p>“His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,” Harry
whispered to Hermione. “I thought he’d have cured it by now, though . .
. or Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”</p>
<p>“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated
expression. “But there are some injuries you can’t cure . . . old curses
. . . and there are poisons without antidotes. . . .”</p>
<p>“. . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there
is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys’
Wizard Wheezes.</p>
<p>“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give
their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for
new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor
Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the
candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into
shadow — “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old
post of Potions master.”</p>
<p>“Potions?”</p>
<p>“Potions?”</p>
<p>The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.</p>
<p>“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry.
“But you said —”</p>
<p>“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so
that it carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the
position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”</p>
<p>“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction.
He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How
could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all
this time? Hadn’t it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not
trust him to do it?</p>
<p>“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense
Against the Dark Arts!” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when
Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he
was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be
teaching.</p>
<p>Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up at the
mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of
the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could
detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. “Snape’ll be gone
by the end of the year.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ron.</p>
<p>“That job’s jinxed. No one’s lasted more than a year. . . . Quirrell
actually died doing it. . . . Personally, I’m going to keep my fingers
crossed for another death. . . .”</p>
<p>“Harry!” said Hermione, shocked and reproachful.</p>
<p>“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,”
said Ron reasonably. “That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay
long-term. Moody didn’t.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the
only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of
conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heart’s
desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had
just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments,
but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before
continuing.</p>
<p>“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his
followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.”</p>
<p>The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry
glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his
fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster’s
words unworthy of his attention.</p>
<p>“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present
situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to
ensure that we remain safe. The castle’s magical fortifications have
been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more
powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness
on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to
abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon
you, however irksome you might find them — in particular, the rule that
you are not to be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you
notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to
report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct
yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and others’
safety.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once
more.</p>
<p>“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could
possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested
for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip
pip!”</p>
<p>With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches were moved back
and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward
their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the
gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell
the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the
lace on his trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of
him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect’s duty of
shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.</p>
<p>“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once they were at the
very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of
anyone else.</p>
<p>Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship
that Ron did not laugh.</p>
<p>“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” he said
darkly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry bitterly. “Listen to what
he was saying before he found out I was there. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy’s boasts. With what
Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.</p>
<p>“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson. . . . What
kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?”</p>
<p>“How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at Hogwarts? It
wouldn’t be the first —”</p>
<p>“I wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha’ name, Harry,” said a reproachful voice
behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his
head.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore uses that name,” said Harry stubbornly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid mysteriously. “So
how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.”</p>
<p>“Got held up on the train,” said Harry. “Why were you late?”</p>
<p>“I was with Grawp,” said Hagrid happily. “Los’ track o’ the time.
He’s got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it — nice
big cave. He’s much happier than he was in the forest. We were havin’ a
good chat.”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron’s eye; the last
time he had met Hagrid’s half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent for
ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words,
two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly. “Yeh’ll be
amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as me assistant.”</p>
<p>Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze.
They were now standing beside the oak front doors.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight after lunch.
Come early an’ yeh can say hello ter Buck — I mean, Witherwings!”</p>
<p>Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the front doors
into the darkness.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron was
experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.</p>
<p>“You’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?”</p>
<p>Ron shook his head. “And you’re not either, are you?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head too.</p>
<p>“And Hermione,” said Ron, “she’s not, is she?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he
realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did
not like to think.</p>
