<h4 id="chapter-twenty-seven">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h4>
<p>THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER</p>
<p>Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore onto the top
of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering,
Dumbledore’s weight still upon him, Harry concentrated harder than he
had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes,
gripping Dumbledore’s arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forward
into that feeling of horrible compression.</p>
<p>He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The smell of salt,
the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping
in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible
moment Harry’s imagination showed him more Inferi creeping toward him
around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was
stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps
and lit upper windows.</p>
<p>“We did it, Professor!” Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly
realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest. “We did it! We got
the Horcrux!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that
his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off balance; then he saw
his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a
streetlamp.</p>
<p>“Sir, are you all right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his
mouth twitched. “That potion . . . was no health drink. . . .”</p>
<p>And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the ground.</p>
<p>“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t worry
—”</p>
<p>He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be
seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore
quickly to the hospital wing.</p>
<p>“We need to get you up to the school, sir. . . . Madam Pomfrey . .
.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dumbledore. “It is . . . Professor Snape whom I need. . .
. But I do not think . . . I can walk very far just yet. . . .”</p>
<p>“Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, find a place you
can stay — then I can run and get Madam —”</p>
<p>“Severus,” said Dumbledore clearly. “I need Severus. . . .”</p>
<p>“All right then, Snape — but I’m going to have to leave you for a
moment so I can —”</p>
<p>Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard running footsteps.
His heart leapt: Somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help — and
looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street
toward them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing
gown embroidered with dragons.</p>
<p>“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank
goodness, thank goodness, I couldn’t think what to — but what’s wrong
with Albus?”</p>
<p>She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“He’s hurt,” said Harry. “Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three
Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?”</p>
<p>“You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you realize — haven’t you seen —
?”</p>
<p>“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not listening to her, “I
think we can get him inside —”</p>
<p>“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. “Rosmerta, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“The — the Dark Mark, Albus.”</p>
<p>And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread
flooded Harry at the sound of the words. . . . He turned and looked.</p>
<p>There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing green
skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever
they had entered a building . . . wherever they had murdered. . . .</p>
<p>“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched
painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I put the cat out,
but when I got upstairs —”</p>
<p>“We need to return to the castle at once,” said Dumbledore.
“Rosmerta” — and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in
command of the situation — “we need transport — brooms —”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking very
frightened. “Shall I run and fetch — ?”</p>
<p>“No, Harry can do it.”</p>
<p>Harry raised his wand at once.</p>
<p>“Accio Rosmerta’s Brooms!”</p>
<p>A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub
burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each
other to Harry’s side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at
waist height.</p>
<p>“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” said Dumbledore,
as he mounted the broom nearest him. “It might be that nobody within
Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your
Invisibility Cloak.”</p>
<p>Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself
before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back
toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and
rose up into the air. As they sped toward the castle, Harry glanced
sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight
of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant:
He was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long
silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too
looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous
bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his
mind. . . .</p>
<p>How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, and Ginny’s luck run
out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over
the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the
D.A.? And if it was . . . he was the one who had told them to patrol the
corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds. . . .
Would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?</p>
<p>As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked
earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears,
Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he
understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the
boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments
he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed. The
Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest
of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?</p>
<p>Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was
dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked
around.</p>
<p>The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led
back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a
fight to the death, of a body.</p>
<p>“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green
skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them. “Is it the
real Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor?”</p>
<p>In the dim green glow from the Mark, Harry saw Dumbledore clutching
at his chest with his blackened hand.</p>
<p>“Go and wake Severus,” said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. “Tell him
what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody
else, and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.”</p>
<p>“But —”</p>
<p>“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!”</p>
<p>Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but
his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he
heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked around at
Dumbledore, who gestured him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his
wand as he did so.</p>
<p>The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted,
“Expelliarmus!”</p>
<p>Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself
fall back against the tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue,
unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened —
Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm —</p>
<p>Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore’s wand flying in an
arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood. . . . Dumbledore had
wordlessly immobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the
spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.</p>
<p>Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore
still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at
his disarmer and said, “Good evening, Draco.”</p>
<p>Malfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that he and
Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.</p>
<p>“Who else is here?”</p>
<p>“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”</p>
<p>Harry saw Malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish
glare of the Mark.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “I’ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your
school tonight.”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an
ambitious homework project. “Very good indeed. You found a way to let
them in, did you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under your nose and you
never realized!”</p>
<p>“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “Yet . . . forgive me . . . where are
they now? You seem unsupported.”</p>
<p>“They met some of your guards. They’re having a fight down below.
They won’t be long. . . . I came on ahead. I — I’ve got a job to
do.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” said Dumbledore
softly.</p>
<p>There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible,
paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear
sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco
Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, who, incredibly,
smiled.</p>
<p>“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.</p>
<p>He seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw
him flush in the Mark’s greenish light.</p>
<p>“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy more forcefully.
“You don’t know what I’ve done!”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost killed Katie Bell
and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation,
to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble
attempts. . . . So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your
heart has been really in it.”</p>
<p>“It has been in it!” said Malfoy vehemently. “I’ve been working on it
all year, and tonight —”</p>
<p>Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled
yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said Dumbledore
conversationally. “But you were saying . . . yes, you have managed to
introduce Death Eaters into my school, which, I admit, I thought
impossible. . . . How did you do it?”</p>
<p>But Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to whatever was
happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as Harry was.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” suggested
Dumbledore. “What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you
have perhaps realized, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix
here tonight too. And after all, you don’t really need help. . . . I
have no wand at the moment. . . . I cannot defend myself.”</p>
<p>Malfoy merely stared at him.</p>
<p>“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke.
“You are afraid to act until they join you.”</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to
hurt Dumbledore. “It’s you who should be scared!”</p>
<p>“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not
nearly as easy as the innocent believe. . . . So tell me, while we wait
for your friends . . . how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to
have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.”</p>
<p>Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to
vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore,
his wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart. Then, as though he
could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend that broken Vanishing
Cabinet that no one’s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last
year.”</p>
<p>“Aaaah.” Dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a
moment. “That was clever. . . . There is a pair, I take it?”</p>
<p>“In Borgin and Burkes,” said Malfoy, “and they make a kind of passage
between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts
one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going
on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the
cabinet was traveling between them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear
him. . . . In the end, he managed to Apparate out, even though he’d
never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was
a really good story, but I was the only one who realized what it meant —
even Borgin didn’t know — I was the one who realized there could be a
way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one.”</p>
<p>“Very good,” murmured Dumbledore. “So the Death Eaters were able to
pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you. . . . A clever
plan, a very clever plan . . . and, as you say, right under my
nose.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort
from Dumbledore’s praise. “Yeah, it was!”</p>
<p>“But there were times,” Dumbledore went on, “weren’t there, when you
were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet? And you resorted
to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace
that was bound to reach the wrong hands . . . poisoning mead there was
only the slightest chance I might drink. . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did
you?” sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the
strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly,
mutely, against the enchantment binding him.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, I did,” said Dumbledore. “I was sure it was
you.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded.</p>
<p>“I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on
my orders —”</p>
<p>“He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my mother —”</p>
<p>“Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but —”</p>
<p>“He’s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t working for you,
you just think he is!”</p>
<p>“We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust
Professor Snape —”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy. “He’s been
offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself — wanting
a bit of the action — ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace,
that was stupid, it could have blown everything —’ But I haven’t told
him what I’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, he’s going to wake
up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and he won’t be the Dark Lord’s
favorite anymore, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!”</p>
<p>“Very gratifying,” said Dumbledore mildly. “We all like appreciation
for our own hard work, of course. But you must have had an accomplice,
all the same . . . someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip
Katie the — the — aaaah . . .”</p>
<p>Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about
to fall asleep. “. . . of course . . . Rosmerta. How long has she been
under the Imperius Curse?”</p>
<p>“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted.</p>
<p>There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last.
Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at
Dumbledore, who went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own
bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the
room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead . . . well, naturally,
Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to
Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present. . . . Yes,
very neat . . . very neat . . . Poor Mr. Filch would not, of course,
think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s. Tell me, how have you been
communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of
communication in and out of the school monitored.”</p>
<p>“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep
talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. “I had one and she had
the other and I could send her messages —”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called
themselves Dumbledore’s Army used last year?” asked Dumbledore. His
voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower
down the wall as he said it.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got the idea from them,” said Malfoy, with a twisted smile.
“I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well,
I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing
potions.”</p>
<p>“Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” said
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. “You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when
I’m about to kill you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little
on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. “But as for being about
to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite
alone, I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me,
and still you have not acted. . . .”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted
something very bitter.</p>
<p>“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a little puzzled
about how it happened. . . . You knew that I had left the school? But of
course,” he answered his own question, “Rosmerta saw me leaving, she
tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were just going for a
drink, you’d be back. . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, I certainly did have a drink . . . and I came back . . . after
a fashion,” mumbled Dumbledore. “So you decided to spring a trap for
me?”</p>
<p>“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry
up here, to see who’d been killed,” said Malfoy. “And it worked!”</p>
<p>“Well . . . yes and no . . .” said Dumbledore. “But am I to take it,
then, that nobody has been murdered?”</p>
<p>“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed to go up an
octave as he said it. “One of your people . . . I don’t know who, it was
dark. . . . I stepped over the body. . . . I was supposed to be waiting
up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they do that,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded
as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led
to where Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Harry stood, and Harry’s heart
thundered unheard in his invisible chest. . . . Someone was dead. . . .
Malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who was it?</p>
<p>“There is little time, one way or another,” said Dumbledore. “So let
us discuss your options, Draco.”</p>
<p>“My options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here with a wand —
I’m about to kill you —”</p>
<p>“My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you were
going to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you
would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white
as Dumbledore. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole
family!”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said Dumbledore. “Why
else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew
that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I
suspected you.”</p>
<p>Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.</p>
<p>“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had
been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,” continued
Dumbledore. “But now at last we can speak plainly to each other. . . .
No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky
that your unintentional victims survived. . . . I can help you,
Draco.”</p>
<p>“No, you can’t,” said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly
indeed. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no
choice.”</p>
<p>“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more
completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send
members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your
father is safe at the moment in Azkaban. . . . When the time comes, we
can protect him too. . . . Come over to the right side, Draco . . . you
are not a killer. . . .”</p>
<p>Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They thought I’d die
in the attempt, but I’m here . . . and you’re in my power. . . . I’m the
one with the wand. . . . You’re at my mercy. . . .”</p>
<p>“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, and not yours,
that matters now.”</p>
<p>Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still
trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction —</p>
<p>But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a second
later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes
burst through the door onto the ramparts. Still paralyzed, his eyes
staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: It
seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.</p>
<p>A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy
giggle.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a stocky little
woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning
eagerly. “Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well
done!”</p>
<p>“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming
the man to a tea party. “And you’ve brought Alecto too. . . . Charming .
. .”</p>
<p>The woman gave an angry little titter. “Think your little jokes’ll
help you on your deathbed then?” she jeered.</p>
<p>“Jokes? No, no, these are manners,” replied Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy
man with matted gray hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater’s robes
looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever
heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture
of dirt, sweat, and, unmistakably, blood coming from him. His filthy
hands had long yellowish nails.</p>
<p>“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” rasped the other. “Pleased to see me,
Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>“No, I cannot say that I am.”</p>
<p>Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin
and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.</p>
<p>“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon
now? This is most unusual. . . . You have developed a taste for human
flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Fenrir Greyback. “Shocks you that, does it,
Dumbledore? Frightens you?”</p>
<p>“Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” said
Dumbledore. “And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited
you, of all people, into the school where his friends live. . . .”</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Fenrir; he did not
seem to want to even glance at him. “I didn’t know he was going to come
—”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,” rasped
Greyback. “Not when there are throats to be ripped out . . . Delicious,
delicious . . .”</p>
<p>And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth,
leering at Dumbledore. “I could do you for afters, Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“No,” said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy,
brutal-looking face. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now,
Draco, and quickly.”</p>
<p>Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as
he stared into Dumbledore’s face, which was even paler, and rather lower
than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.</p>
<p>“He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” said the
lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister’s wheezing giggles.
“Look at him — what’s happened to you, then, Dumby?”</p>
<p>“Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,” said Dumbledore.
“Old age, in short . . . One day, perhaps, it will happen to you . . .
if you are lucky. . . .”</p>
<p>“What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled the Death Eater,
suddenly violent. “Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and
doing nothing, nothing. I don’t even know why the Dark Lord’s bothering
to kill yer! Come on, Draco, do it!”</p>
<p>But at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below
and a voice shouted, “They’ve blocked the stairs — Reducto!
REDUCTO!”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated all opposition,
but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower, and, by the
sound of it, created a barrier behind them —</p>
<p>“Now, Draco, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man angrily.</p>
<p>But Malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his hands
outstretched, his teeth bared.</p>
<p>“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light
and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and
staggered, looking furious. Harry’s heart was hammering so hard it
seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned
by Dumbledore’s spell — if he could only move, he could aim a curse from
under the Cloak —</p>
<p>“Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us —” screeched the woman, but
at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more
and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes
swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four
Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and
wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able —”</p>
<p>But somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite softly.</p>
<p>“Severus . . .”</p>
<p>The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all
evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.</p>
<p>Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out
of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the
werewolf seemed cowed.</p>
<p>Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and
hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.</p>
<p>“Severus . . . please . . .”</p>
<p>Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Avada Kedavra!”</p>
<p>A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit
Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s scream of horror never left
him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was
blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended
beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a
great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.</p>
