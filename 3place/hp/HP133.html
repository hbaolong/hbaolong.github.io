<h4 id="chapter-one">CHAPTER ONE</h4>
<p>THE OTHER MINISTER</p>
<p>It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in
his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain
without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting
for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between
wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress
unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult
week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more
he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more
clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his
political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news
that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had
happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also
to explain why each and every one of them was the government’s
fault.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of these
accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his
government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was
outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on
bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts
were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a
dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare
anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those
two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government
should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country
that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it
his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen
this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a
lot more time with his family?</p>
<p>“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent had concluded,
barely concealing his own broad grin.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt
it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the
weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July. . . . It
wasn’t right, it wasn’t normal. . . .</p>
<p>He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it
went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head
he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a
fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed
against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister
got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that
was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his
back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.</p>
<p>He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the
dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very
slowly to face the empty room.</p>
<p>“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.</p>
<p>For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody
would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive
voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It
was coming — as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough — from
the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a
small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.</p>
<p>“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond
immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.”</p>
<p>The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. . . . It’s not a very good
time for me. . . . I’m waiting for a telephone call, you see . . . from
the President of —”</p>
<p>“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime
Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.</p>
<p>“But I really was rather hoping to speak —”</p>
<p>“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will
telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “Kindly respond
immediately to Mr. Fudge.”</p>
<p>“I . . . oh . . . very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Yes,
I’ll see Fudge.”</p>
<p>He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had
barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a
relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life
in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying
not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared
within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had
climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the
sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his
hand.</p>
<p>“Ah . . . Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward
with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you again.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said
nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose
occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in
themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad
news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was
thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime
Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never
boded well.</p>
<p>“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand very briefly and
gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.</p>
<p>“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, pulling up the
chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. “What
a week, what a week . . .”</p>
<p>“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime Minister stiffly,
hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already
without any extra helpings from Fudge.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking
morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been having the same week you
have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge . . . the Bones and Vance
murders . . . not to mention the ruckus in the West Country . . .”</p>
<p>“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your people were — were
involved in those — those things, were they?”</p>
<p>Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. “Of course
they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve realized what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I . . .” hesitated the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge’s
visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not
appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course,
it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very
first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were
yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.</p>
<p>He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph
that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had
heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that
ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of
Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself.</p>
<p>Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of
the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to
find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he
felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and
shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly
explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret
all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his
head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the
whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from
getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that
encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of
broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime
Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge
had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a
fatherly sort of way.</p>
<p>“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me again.
I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going on our
end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical
population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let live. And I must
say, you’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to
throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the
opposition.”</p>
<p>At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. “You’re —
you’re not a hoax, then?”</p>
<p>It had been his last, desperate hope.</p>
<p>“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”</p>
<p>And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a gerbil.</p>
<p>“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup
chewing on the corner of his next speech, “but why — why has nobody told
me — ?”</p>
<p>“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle
Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his
jacket. “We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.”</p>
<p>“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a former Prime
Minister warned me — ?”</p>
<p>At this, Fudge had actually laughed.</p>
<p>“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?”</p>
<p>Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace,
stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound.
The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that
he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a
living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?</p>
<p>The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had
tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination
brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a
vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable
encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed
his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man
who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the Prime Minister’s dismay,
however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several
carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall,
the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope
that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term
in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of
his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his
nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving
nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had
trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell
himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything
like this happened.</p>
<p>Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime
Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again
announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the
fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the
Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster,
Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never
heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something that sounded like
“Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the
remotest sense to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>“. . . I’ve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, tipping a
large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket.
“Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight . . . the dementors are
in uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a breakout before.
Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black’s a known Muggle
killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who. . . . But of course,
you don’t even know who You-Know-Who is!” He had gazed hopelessly at the
Prime Minister for a moment, then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d
better fill you in. . . . Have a whiskey . . .”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own
office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless.
Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber
liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister’s
hand, and drew up a chair.</p>
<p>Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused
to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of
parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free
hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had
stood up too.</p>
<p>“So you think that . . .” He had squinted down at the name in his
left hand. “Lord Vol —”</p>
<p>“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” snarled Fudge.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. . . . You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still
alive, then?”</p>
<p>“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had fastened his
pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but we’ve never found him. If you ask
me, he’s not dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s Black we ought
to be worrying about. You’ll put out that warning, then? Excellent.
Well, I hope we don’t see each other again, Prime Minister! Good
night.”</p>
<p>But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a
harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room
to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the
Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that
several Muggles had been “involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not
to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who’s Mark had been seen again meant
nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle
Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they
spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re importing three
foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite
routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that we have to
notify you if we’re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the
country.”</p>
<p>“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good day to you.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes
would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had
erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there
had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.</p>
<p>“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.</p>
<p>“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, already with one
foot in the flames. “We’ll have them rounded up in no time — just
thought you ought to know!”</p>
<p>And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one
moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.</p>
<p>Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister
was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite
Fudge’s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a
lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each
visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or,
as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime
Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it
would be with graver news still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping
out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly
surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there,
was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this
extremely gloomy week.</p>
<p>“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — Wizarding
community?” snapped the Prime Minister now. “I have a country to run and
quite enough concerns at the moment without —”</p>
<p>“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. “The Brockdale Bridge
didn’t wear out. That wasn’t really a hurricane. Those murders were not
the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s family would be safer without
him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to
St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should
be effected tonight.”</p>
<p>“What do you . . . I’m afraid I . . . What?” blustered the Prime
Minister.</p>
<p>Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime Minister, I am very
sorry to have to tell you that he’s back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is
back.”</p>
<p>“Back? When you say ‘back’ . . . he’s alive? I mean —”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that
horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him
about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had
committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance
fifteen years earlier.</p>
<p>“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is a man alive if
he can’t be killed? I don’t really understand it, and Dumbledore won’t
explain properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a body and is walking
and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our
discussion, yes, he’s alive.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent
habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up
made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous
conversations.</p>
<p>“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”</p>
<p>“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly
in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin’s beard, no. Black’s
dead. Turns out we were — er — mistaken about Black. He was innocent
after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either.
I mean,” he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster,
“all the evidence pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but
anyway, as I say, he’s dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry
of Magic premises. There’s going to be an inquiry, actually. . . .”</p>
<p>To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of
pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost
immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though
he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces,
there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under
his charge. . . . Not yet, anyway . . .</p>
<p>While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his
desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by-the-by now. The point is, we’re
at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.”</p>
<p>“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. “Surely that’s a
little bit of an overstatement?”</p>
<p>“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his
followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,” said Fudge, speaking
more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a
lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the open, they have been
wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge — he did it, Prime Minister, he
threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and —”</p>
<p>“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed and I’m
having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion
joints and I don’t know what else!” said the Prime Minister
furiously.</p>
<p>“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying you would have
caved in to blackmail like that?”</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about
the room, “but I would have put all my efforts into catching the
blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!”</p>
<p>“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every effort?” demanded
Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in the Ministry was — and is — trying to
find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about
one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded
capture for almost three decades!”</p>
<p>“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the
West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every
pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these
terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse
than it being the government’s fault after all.</p>
<p>“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.</p>
<p>“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up
and down. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible
injuries —”</p>
<p>“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s
followers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an
invisible wall. “What involvement?”</p>
<p>Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for
the grand effect,” he said. “The Office of Misinformation has been
working around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to
modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened,
we’ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of
Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant —
it’s been a disaster.”</p>
<p>“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.</p>
<p>“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,” said Fudge.
“What with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.”</p>
<p>“Losing who?”</p>
<p>“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We
think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have murdered her in person, because
she was a very gifted witch and — and all the evidence was that she put
up a real fight.”</p>
<p>Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped
spinning his bowler hat.</p>
<p>“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minister,
momentarily diverted from his anger. “Our newspapers. Amelia Bones . . .
it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a — a
nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of publicity. The police
are baffled, you see.”</p>
<p>Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. “Killed in a room
that was locked from the inside, wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know
exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching
him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn’t hear about that
one —”</p>
<p>“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened just around the
corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with
it, ‘breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister’s backyard —’”</p>
<p>“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely listening to
the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors swarming all over the place,
attacking people left, right, and center. . . .”</p>
<p>Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible
to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.</p>
<p>“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,” he said
cautiously.</p>
<p>“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. They’ve deserted
the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that
wasn’t a blow.”</p>
<p>“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror,
“didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness
out of people?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s causing all this
mist.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea
of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside,
spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite
faint.</p>
<p>“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! It’s your
responsibility as Minister of Magic!”</p>
<p>“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister
of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole
Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a
fortnight. I’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!”
said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his
indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still
rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I can
do?”</p>
<p>“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was
sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to
introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but
of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.”</p>
<p>Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing
the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of
a quill. Catching Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a
moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time.
“I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but
he won’t budge. If he’d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might
still be . . . Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.”</p>
<p>Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was
broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its
crisp, official voice.</p>
<p>“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent.
Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely
flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up,
and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him
moments later onto the antique rug.</p>
<p>Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, the Prime
Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down
his long black robes, and look around.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour
looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane
of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind
a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even
though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression
of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood
why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in
these dangerous times.</p>
<p>“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his
hand.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then
pulled out a wand from under his robes.</p>
<p>“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door and
tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock
click.</p>
<p>“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d
rather that door remained unlocked.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or
watched,” he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the
curtains swept across them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get
down to business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied,
“I am perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got, thank you very
—”</p>
<p>“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for
the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse.
The new secretary in your outer office —”</p>
<p>“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets
through twice the work the rest of them —”</p>
<p>“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of
a smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your
protection.”</p>
<p>“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just
put your people into my office, I decide who works for me —”</p>
<p>“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour
coldly.</p>
<p>“I am — that’s to say, I was —”</p>
<p>“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour.</p>
<p>“I . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be . . . er
. . . excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely
seemed to hear him.</p>
<p>“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” he continued.
“The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a
duck.”</p>
<p>“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,” said
Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his brains, but he could still be
dangerous.”</p>
<p>“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Surely a bit
of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink . . .”</p>
<p>“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and
Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to
strangle three of them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best that we
remove him from Muggle society for a while.”</p>
<p>“I . . . well . . . He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the Prime
Minister anxiously.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the
fireplace.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of
developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, I shall probably be too
busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has
consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.”</p>
<p>Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as
though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his
pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime
Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the
words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.</p>
<p>“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards! You can do magic! Surely you
can sort out — well — anything!”</p>
<p>Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous
look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said
kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime
Minister.”</p>
<p>And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the
bright green fire and vanished.</p>
