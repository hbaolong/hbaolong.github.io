<h4 id="chapter-fifteen">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h4>
<p>THE UNBREAKABLE VOW</p>
<p>Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was
approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual
twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel
had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles
glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of
mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups
of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time
Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately,
however, Harry’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an
unusually good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that he
was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes
between classes.</p>
<p>Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause
for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it
all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the
moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the
improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with
the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment
that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry
found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed
unlikely ever to speak to each other again.</p>
<p>Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from
Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.</p>
<p>“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged Krum. So she’s
found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it’s a free country. I
haven’t done anything wrong.”</p>
<p>Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they
were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A
Quest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and
Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.</p>
<p>“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. “I mean, all
right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party with her, but she
never said . . . just as friends . . . I’m a free agent. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him.
Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud
crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words “Krum”
and “can’t complain” again.</p>
<p>Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her
properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped
around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione
refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, so Harry
generally joined her in the library, which meant that their
conversations were held in whispers.</p>
<p>“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said Hermione,
while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. “I
really couldn’t care less.”</p>
<p>She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she
punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his
voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower over
Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting
Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the Prince’s useful additions
to Libatius Borage’s text.</p>
<p>“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few moments, “you need to
be careful.”</p>
<p>“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse
whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving
back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape
or Slughorn have taught me in —”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione,
giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m
talking about earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I
came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that
Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re
all hoping they’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn’s party,
and they all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love potions, which
I’m afraid to say probably work —”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It seemed
extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have
abandoned her at this crucial juncture.</p>
<p>“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said
Hermione scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt
whether even the Half-Blood Prince” — she gave the book another nasty
look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at
once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, that’ll stop all the
others thinking they’ve still got a chance. It’s tomorrow night, they’re
getting desperate.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, who was still
trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the
fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him
devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.</p>
<p>“Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane looked
like she meant business,” said Hermione grimly.</p>
<p>She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing
her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry
watched her with his mind a long way away.</p>
<p>“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch had banned
anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?”</p>
<p>“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?”
asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.</p>
<p>“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these
girls are able to bring love potions into school?”</p>
<p>“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,”
said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”</p>
<p>“You know a lot about it.”</p>
<p>Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy
of Advanced Potion-Making.</p>
<p>“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in
the summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions in
people’s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. .
. .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. “The point is,
Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These girls are getting stuff into the
school disguised as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought
the necklace into the school — ?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry . . . not that again . . .”</p>
<p>“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry.</p>
<p>“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and
concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark
objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that
necklace, within seconds. But something that’s just been put in the
wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or
dangerous —”</p>
<p>“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.</p>
<p>“— so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion,
and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from
—”</p>
<p>Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved
close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment
later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the
corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked
nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.</p>
<p>“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you return anything you
have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book,
you depraved boy?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, snatching
his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it
with a clawlike hand.</p>
<p>“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!”</p>
<p>“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, tugging it out
of her grip.</p>
<p>She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had
hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frog-marched him
away.</p>
<p>“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. Why did you
have to bring that stupid book?”</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or d’you think she
overheard you being rude about Filch? I’ve always thought there might be
something going on between them. . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh, ha ha . . .”</p>
<p>Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made
their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common
room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly
in love with each other.</p>
<p>“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive
password.</p>
<p>“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she swung
forward to admit them.</p>
<p>“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the
portrait hole. “Fancy a gillywater?”</p>
<p>Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.”</p>
<p>“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his
hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got firewhisky in them. My gran
sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”</p>
<p>“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could not think what
else to say. “Er — I’m just going over here with . . .”</p>
<p>He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.</p>
<p>“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask someone, sooner
they’ll all leave you alone and you can —”</p>
<p>But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and
Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.</p>
<p>“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only seven
o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory without
another word.</p>
<p>Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day
of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after which he
and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It now seemed impossible
that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays
began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm
down, think better of their behavior. . . .</p>
<p>But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring
a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked
upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in
front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their
own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first
attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular
handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate
impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time
Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found
deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.
She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things
behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just now,
scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.</p>
<p>He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on
the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting
her vaguely on the back.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is
bright yellow?”</p>
<p>“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”</p>
<p>He held out her books.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and
turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on
her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . .
.”</p>
<p>And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer words of
comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.</p>
<p>“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it was Moaning
Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something
about that Ron Weasley. . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” said Luna, as they
set off down the corridor together. “But he can be a bit unkind. I
noticed that last year.”</p>
<p>“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of
speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her.
“So have you had a good term?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely without the D.A.
Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration
class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —”</p>
<p>“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight?”</p>
<p>The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them; he
heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.</p>
<p>Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise.</p>
<p>“Slughorn’s party? With you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you
might like . . . I mean . . .” He was keen to make his intentions
perfectly clear. “I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don’t
want to . . .”</p>
<p>He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming as
he had never seen her beam before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to a party
before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party?
Should I do mine too?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to
put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight
o’clock then.”</p>
<p>“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped;
unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right underneath
Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning
maliciously at them.</p>
<p>“Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty
luuuuurves Looooooony!”</p>
<p>And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!”</p>
<p>“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And sure enough, in
no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was
taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party.</p>
<p>“You could’ve taken anyone!” said Ron in disbelief over dinner.
“Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?”</p>
<p>“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on
her way to join friends. “I’m really glad you’re taking her, Harry,
she’s so excited.”</p>
<p>And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel
pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party, but could
not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting
alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her
furtively.</p>
<p>“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly.</p>
<p>“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered
Ron.</p>
<p>“What did you have to imitate her for?”</p>
<p>“She laughed at my mustache!”</p>
<p>“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with
Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her
arms around Ron’s neck.</p>
<p>“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed
and bored by the behavior of their two friends.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts, then? I
heard your parents wanted you to leave.”</p>
<p>“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati.
“That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn’t been
anything since . . . Oh, hi, Hermione!”</p>
<p>Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling
guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked
around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more
brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.</p>
<p>“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely.
“Are you going to Slughorn’s party tonight?”</p>
<p>“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it
sounds like it’s going to be really good. . . . You’re going, aren’t
you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —”</p>
<p>There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink
and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard
anything.</p>
<p>“— we’re going up to the party together.”</p>
<p>“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you mean?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who almost” — she put
a great deal of emphasis on the word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.”</p>
<p>“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a most
un-Hermione-ish giggle.</p>
<p>“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip.
“Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don’t you? First Krum, then
McLaggen . . .”</p>
<p>“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione corrected her, still
smiling. “Well, see you . . . Got to go and get ready for the party. . .
.”</p>
<p>She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to
discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about
McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked
strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence
the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, he
found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom
seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was
wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain
amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite
nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish
earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.</p>
<p>“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?”</p>
<p>“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase
away from all the staring and muttering. “Did you hear, there’s supposed
to be a vampire coming?”</p>
<p>“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna.</p>
<p>“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the Minister of
Magic?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “Father wrote a
very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from
Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the
Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get out!”</p>
<p>Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a
vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father’s bizarre views
as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching
Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud
conversation were growing louder with every step they took.</p>
<p>Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical
trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s office was much larger than the usual
teacher’s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald,
crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all
inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the
red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the
ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of
light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued
from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly
warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were
negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by
the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked
like little roving tables.</p>
<p>“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had
squeezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so many people I’d like
you to meet!”</p>
<p>Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking
jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to
Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party;
Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.</p>
<p>“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine,
author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course,
his friend Sanguini.”</p>
<p>Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry’s
hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall
and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked
rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking
curious and excited.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering
shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was saying to Professor Slughorn
only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we
have all been waiting?’”</p>
<p>“Er,” said Harry, “were you?”</p>
<p>“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seriously” —
his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike — “I would be
delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about
you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few
interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the
book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your
part, I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t quite — Sanguini,
stay here!” added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been
edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his
eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf
and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand before turning his attention back
to Harry.</p>
<p>“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —”</p>
<p>“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and I’ve just
seen a friend of mine, sorry.”</p>
<p>He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a
long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members
of the Weird Sisters.</p>
<p>“Hermione! Hermione!”</p>
<p>“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!”</p>
<p>“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly
disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a
thicket of Devil’s Snare.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she said.
“Under the mistletoe,” she added in explanation, as Harry continued to
look questioningly at her.</p>
<p>“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely.</p>
<p>“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassionately. “I
debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole
—”</p>
<p>“You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted.</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen makes
Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to see him
coming, he’s so tall. . . .”</p>
<p>The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room,
scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that
Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.</p>
<p>“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.</p>
<p>“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna
with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. “I haven’t
seen you in my classes lately. . . .”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken
titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought,
would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore
might have got rid of the horse? But no . . . we share classes. . . .
It’s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know . . .”</p>
<p>Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under
cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to
Hermione and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you planning to
tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?”</p>
<p>Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think I’d stoop that
low?”</p>
<p>Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can ask out McLaggen
—”</p>
<p>“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. “I’ve got no
plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened
at Keeper tryouts.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall apart again,
and we’ll lose the next match —”</p>
<p>“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys care about?
Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve just
been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ nonstop
ever since — oh no, here he comes!”</p>
<p>She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment
she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches
and vanished.</p>
<p>“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a
minute later.</p>
<p>“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s
conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones,
noticing him for the first time.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “The rumors! The
stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very long time.
. . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you not
returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the
utmost importance!”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a loud
voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney’s other side, his
face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one
hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I don’t think I’ve
ever known such a natural at Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry
with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you know — like his
mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can
tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus —”</p>
<p>And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop
Snape out of thin air toward them.</p>
<p>“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped Slughorn
happily. “I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional potion-making!
Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five
years!”</p>
<p>Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down
his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter
anything at all.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should
have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death — never
had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even you,
Severus —”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who
felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start
investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.</p>
<p>“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?” asked
Slughorn.</p>
<p>“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology .
. .”</p>
<p>“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said Snape, with
the faintest sneer.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly.</p>
<p>“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said Luna
unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The Aurors are part of the
Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They’re working to
bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark
Magic and gum disease.”</p>
<p>Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh.
Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging from his
goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something
calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being dragged
by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.</p>
<p>“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the
maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, “I discovered
this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited
to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him
with an invitation?”</p>
<p>Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch’s grip, looking furious.</p>
<p>“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was trying to
gate-crash, happy?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee
on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster say that
nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got permission, didn’t he,
eh?”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, waving a
hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party.
Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.”</p>
<p>Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly
predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look
almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though
both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid?</p>
<p>But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had
turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy had
composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his
generosity, and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy’s thanks.
“I did know your grandfather, after all. . . .”</p>
<p>“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly. “Said
you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him;
he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact
that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time
he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark
shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.</p>
<p>“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.</p>
<p>“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, “it’s Christmas,
don’t be too hard —”</p>
<p>“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to
be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, Draco.”</p>
<p>They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry
stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit,
Luna — er — bathroom.”</p>
<p>“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he
hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy
with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.</p>
<p>It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak
out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite
deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry
ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and
loud talk still issuing from Slughorn’s office behind him. Perhaps Snape
had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons . . . or perhaps he was
escorting him back to the Slytherin common room. . . . Harry pressed his
ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a
great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last
classroom in the corridor and heard voices.</p>
<p>“. . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled
—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?”</p>
<p>“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and
foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.”</p>
<p>“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last time, I didn’t
do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one knows about —
don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid,
but it won’t work — I can stop you!”</p>
<p>There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah . . . Aunt
Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you
trying to conceal from your master, Draco?”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want you
butting in!”</p>
<p>Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . .
What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this — Snape,
toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?</p>
<p>“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared
my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my
office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco —”</p>
<p>“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” jeered Malfoy.</p>
<p>There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You know perfectly well
that I do not wish to do either of those things.”</p>
<p>“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!”</p>
<p>“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to
push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “I am trying to help
you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable
Vow, Draco —”</p>
<p>“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, because I don’t need your
protection! It’s my job, he gave it to me and I’m doing it, I’ve got a
plan and it’s going to work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I
thought it would!”</p>
<p>“What is your plan?”</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business!”</p>
<p>“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you —”</p>
<p>“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”</p>
<p>“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme,
wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary
mistakes —”</p>
<p>“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put them in
detention!”</p>
<p>“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had risen
excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their
Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they will need to
work a little harder than they are doing at pres —”</p>
<p>“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark Arts —
it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting
against the Dark Arts —”</p>
<p>“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where
do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how
to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at
night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in
assistants like Crabbe and Goyle —”</p>
<p>“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side, better
people!”</p>
<p>“Then why not confide in me, and I can —”</p>
<p>“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glory!”</p>
<p>There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are speaking
like a child. I quite understand that your father’s capture and
imprisonment has upset you, but —”</p>
<p>Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps on
the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it
burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open
door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and out of
sight.</p>
<p>Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape
emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he
returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the
Cloak, his mind racing.</p>
