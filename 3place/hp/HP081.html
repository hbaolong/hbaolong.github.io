<h4 id="chapter-twenty-four">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h4>
<p>RITA SKEETER’S SCOOP</p>
<p>Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was
much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy
conversations. Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry
that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for
the ball, “but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said
matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to
discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other,
though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione
about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and
Hagrid, but Hermione didn’t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a
half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.</p>
<p>“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I knew he
couldn’t be pure giant because they’re about twenty feet tall. But
honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can’t all be horrible. .
. . It’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves.
. . . It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but
perhaps he didn’t want another row, because he contented himself with
shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn’t looking.</p>
<p>It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during
the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather
flat now that Christmas was over — everybody except Harry, that is, who
was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.</p>
<p>The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer
from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn’t done anything about
working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking
the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening
it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some
sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from
thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He
closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the
sound had changed, but it hadn’t. He tried asking the egg questions,
shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the
egg across the room — though he hadn’t really expected that to help.</p>
<p>Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his
less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was
keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed
to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would
have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what
was coming in the first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange had
been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn’t need that sort of
rubbishy help — not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in
hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and
Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills
as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his
stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too.</p>
<p>Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows
were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn’t see out of them
in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures
much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably
warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so
forcefully that Hagrid’s cabin would catch fire.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Hagrid’s cabin, however, they found an elderly
witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing
before his front door.</p>
<p>“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she barked at them
as they struggled toward her through the snow.</p>
<p>“Who’re you?” said Ron, staring at her. “Where’s Hagrid?”</p>
<p>“My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,” she said briskly. “I am your
temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.”</p>
<p>“Where’s Hagrid?” Harry repeated loudly.</p>
<p>“He is indisposed,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.</p>
<p>Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry’s ears. He turned; Draco
Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of
them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see Professor
Grubbly-Plank.</p>
<p>“This way, please,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off
around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at
Hagrid’s cabin. All the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone
and ill?</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Hagrid?” Harry said, hurrying to catch up with
Professor Grubbly-Plank.</p>
<p>“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he was being
nosy.</p>
<p>“I do mind, though,” said Harry hotly. “What’s up with him?”</p>
<p>Professor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn’t hear him. She
led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were
standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the
forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered.</p>
<p>Many of the girls “ooooohed!” at the sight of the unicorn.</p>
<p>“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown. “How did she get
it? They’re supposed to be really hard to catch!”</p>
<p>The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look
gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and
throwing back its horned head.</p>
<p>“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm
and catching Harry hard in the chest. “They prefer the woman’s touch,
unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does
it. . . .”</p>
<p>She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving
the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor
Grubbly-Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.</p>
<p>“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t think a skrewt —
?”</p>
<p>“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what you’re thinking,”
said Malfoy softly. “No, he’s just too ashamed to show his big, ugly
face.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean?” said Harry sharply.</p>
<p>Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a
folded page of newsprint.</p>
<p>“There you go,” he said. “Hate to break it to you, Potter. . . .”</p>
<p>He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with
Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an
article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.</p>
<p>DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial
staff appointments, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In
September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody, the
notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts,
a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic,
given Moody’s well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden
movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and
kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care
of Magical Creatures.</p>
<p>Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his
third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever
since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid
used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the
additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of
many better-qualified candidates.</p>
<p>An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using
his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a
succession of horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind eye,
Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many
admit to being “very frightening.”</p>
<p>“I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a
bad bite off a flobberworm,” says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student.
“We all hate Hagrid, but we’re just too scared to say anything.”</p>
<p>Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation,
however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he
admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed “Blast-Ended Skrewts,” highly
dangerous crosses between manticores and fire-crabs. The creation of new
breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely
observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty
restrictions.</p>
<p>“I was just having some fun,” he says, before hastily changing the
subject.</p>
<p>As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed
evidence that Hagrid is not — as he has always pretended — a pure-blood
wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can
exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose
whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>
<p>Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point
of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The
handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and
were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign
of terror.</p>
<p>While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were
killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among
them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still
existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of
Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa’s son
appears to have inherited her brutal nature.</p>
<p>In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall from
power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware
of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus Dumbledore
surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow
students, is warned about the dangers of associating with
part-giants.</p>
<p>Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.</p>
<p>“How did she find out?” he whispered.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.</p>
<p>“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy.
“What’s this rubbish about him” — he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad
bite off a flobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”</p>
<p>Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.</p>
<p>“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s teaching career,”
said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-giant . . . and there was me
thinking he’d just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. .
. . None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. . . .
They’ll be worried he’ll eat their kids, ha, ha. . . .”</p>
<p>“You —”</p>
<p>“Are you paying attention over there?”</p>
<p>Professor Grubbly-Plank’s voice carried over to the boys; the girls
were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so
angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to
stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor
Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys
could hear too.</p>
<p>“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson
had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch.
“That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . .
. proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. . . .”</p>
<p>“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the
steps.</p>
<p>“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice. “He can still be
gamekeeper, can’t he?”</p>
<p>Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed
that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to
have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who
would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from
Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.</p>
<p>“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the
Great Hall. “I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told
us about uni —”</p>
<p>“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet
article under Hermione’s nose.</p>
<p>Hermione’s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the
same as Ron’s.</p>
<p>“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don’t think Hagrid
told her?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and
throwing himself into a chair, furious. “He never even told us, did he?
I reckon she was so mad he wouldn’t give her loads of horrible stuff
about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.”</p>
<p>“Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,” said
Hermione quietly.</p>
<p>“We’d have seen her in the garden!” said Ron. “Anyway, she’s not
supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her.
. . .”</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry, ladling chicken
casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. “Sort
of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.”</p>
<p>“Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly. “We didn’t
have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother
where anyone could have heard him!”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to go and see him,” said Harry. “This evening, after
Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?” he
shot at Hermione.</p>
<p>“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change,
having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do
want Hagrid back, of course I do!” Hermione added hastily, quailing
under Harry’s furious stare.</p>
<p>So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once
more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid’s cabin. They
knocked, and Fang’s booming barks answered.</p>
<p>“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry shouted, pounding on the door. “Open
up!”</p>
<p>Hagrid didn’t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door,
whining, but it didn’t open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes;
Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no
response.</p>
<p>“What’s he avoiding us for?” Hermione said when they had finally
given up and were walking back to the school. “He surely doesn’t think
we’d care about him being half-giant?”</p>
<p>But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn’t see a sign of him all
week. He didn’t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn’t see
him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor
Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes.
Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.</p>
<p>“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to Harry whenever
there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry’s
retaliation. “Missing the elephant-man?”</p>
<p>There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was
very surprised that Harry was going to go.</p>
<p>“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being
quiet,” she said. “Really get to work on that egg.”</p>
<p>“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,”
Harry lied.</p>
<p>“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Well done!”</p>
<p>Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still
had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages .
. . whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get
a chance to persuade him to come back.</p>
<p>He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set
off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the
Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the
deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed,
but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto
the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the
lake.</p>
<p>“He’s mad!” said Harry, staring at Krum’s dark head as it bobbed out
into the middle of the lake. “It must be freezing, it’s January!”</p>
<p>“It’s a lot colder where he comes from,” said Hermione. “I suppose it
feels quite warm to him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” said Ron. He didn’t sound
anxious — if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of
voice and frowned.</p>
<p>“He’s really nice, you know,” she said. “He’s not at all like you’d
think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told
me.”</p>
<p>Ron said nothing. He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but
Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had
looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure
wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.</p>
<p>Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the
slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once
he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.</p>
<p>The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the
tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn’t there. Heart sinking, he went up to
the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam
Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed
behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t he ever go into the office?” Hermione whispered suddenly.
“Look!”</p>
<p>She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman
reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins.
Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom
had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.</p>
<p>It was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three
Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and
therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was
looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the
forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced
over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.</p>
<p>“In a moment, in a moment!” Harry heard him say brusquely to the
goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish
grin back in place.</p>
<p>“Harry!” he said. “How are you? Been hoping to run into you!
Everything going all right?”</p>
<p>“Fine, thanks,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?” said Bagman
eagerly. “You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?”</p>
<p>“Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a
table.</p>
<p>Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam
Rosmerta.</p>
<p>“Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on your splendid
performance against that Horntail, Harry,” said Bagman. “Really
superb.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Harry, but he knew this couldn’t be all that Bagman
wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron
and Hermione. Bagman didn’t seem in any particular rush to spill the
beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the
goblins, who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their
dark, slanting eyes.</p>
<p>“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing
Harry watching the goblins too. “Their English isn’t too good . . . it’s
like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . .
but at least they used sign language another human could recognize. This
lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of
Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means ‘pickax.’ I don’t like to use it in case
they think I’m threatening them.”</p>
<p>He gave a short, booming laugh.</p>
<p>“What do they want?” Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still
watching Bagman very closely.</p>
<p>“Er — well . . .” said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. “They . . .
er . . . they’re looking for Barty Crouch.”</p>
<p>“Why are they looking for him here?” said Harry. “He’s at the
Ministry in London, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is,” said
Bagman. “He’s sort of . . . stopped coming to work. Been absent for a
couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he’s
ill. Apparently he’s just been sending instructions in by owl. But would
you mind not mentioning that to anyone, Harry? Because Rita Skeeter’s
still poking around everywhere she can, and I’m willing to bet she’d
work up Barty’s illness into something sinister. Probably say he’s gone
missing like Bertha Jorkins.”</p>
<p>“Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“No,” said Bagman, looking strained again. “I’ve got people looking,
of course . . .” (About time, thought Harry) “and it’s all very strange.
She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin
there. And then she left the cousin’s house to go south and see an aunt
. . . and she seems to have vanished without trace en route. Blowed if I
can see where she’s got to . . . she doesn’t seem the type to elope, for
instance . . . but still. . . . What are we doing, talking about goblins
and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you” — he lowered his voice —
“how are you getting on with your golden egg?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . not bad,” Harry said untruthfully.</p>
<p>Bagman seemed to know he wasn’t being honest.</p>
<p>“Listen, Harry,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I feel very
bad about all this . . . you were thrown into this tournament, you
didn’t volunteer for it . . . and if . . .” (his voice was so quiet now,
Harry had to lean closer to listen) “if I can help at all . . . a prod
in the right direction . . . I’ve taken a liking to you . . . the way
you got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word.”</p>
<p>Harry stared up into Bagman’s round, rosy face and his wide,
baby-blue eyes.</p>
<p>“We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t we?” he said,
careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing
the Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the
rules.</p>
<p>“Well . . . well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but — come on,
Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Have you offered Cedric help?” Harry said.</p>
<p>The smallest of frowns creased Bagman’s smooth face. “No, I haven’t,”
he said. “I — well, like I say, I’ve taken a liking to you. Just thought
I’d offer . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks,” said Harry, “but I think I’m nearly there with the
egg . . . couple more days should crack it.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman’s help, except
that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance
would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron,
Hermione, or Sirius.</p>
<p>Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn’t say much more as Fred
and George turned up at that point.</p>
<p>“Hello, Mr. Bagman,” said Fred brightly. “Can we buy you a
drink?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry,
“no, thank you, boys . . .”</p>
<p>Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was
surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.</p>
<p>“Well, I must dash,” he said. “Nice seeing you all. Good luck,
Harry.”</p>
<p>He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and
exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>“What did he want?” Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.</p>
<p>“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“He shouldn’t be doing that!” said Hermione, looking very shocked.
“He’s one of the judges! And anyway, you’ve already worked it out —
haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . nearly,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was
trying to persuade you to cheat!” said Hermione, still looking deeply
disapproving. “I hope he’s trying to help Cedric as much!”</p>
<p>“He’s not, I asked,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Who cares if Diggory’s getting help?” said Ron. Harry privately
agreed.</p>
<p>“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said Hermione, sipping her
butterbeer. “What were they doing here?”</p>
<p>“Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,” said Harry. “He’s still
ill. Hasn’t been into work.”</p>
<p>“Maybe Percy’s poisoning him,” said Ron. “Probably thinks if Crouch
snuffs it he’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical
Cooperation.”</p>
<p>Hermione gave Ron a don’t-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said,
“Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with
the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”</p>
<p>“Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,” said Harry.
“Maybe they need an interpreter.”</p>
<p>“Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” Ron asked
Hermione. “Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for
the Protection of Ugly Goblins?”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” said Hermione sarcastically. “Goblins don’t need
protection. Haven’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been
telling us about goblin rebellions?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry and Ron together.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re quite capable of dealing with wizards,” said Hermione,
taking another sip of butterbeer. “They’re very clever. They’re not like
house-elves, who never stick up for themselves.”</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” said Ron, staring at the door.</p>
<p>Rita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow robes
today; her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was
accompanied by her paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and she and
the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby,
Harry, Ron, and Hermione glaring at her as she approached. She was
talking fast and looking very satisfied about something.</p>
<p>“. . . didn’t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why
would that be, do you think? And what’s he doing with a pack of goblins
in tow anyway? Showing them the sights . . . what nonsense . . . he was
always a bad liar. Reckon something’s up? Think we should do a bit of
digging? ‘Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman . .
.’ Snappy start to a sentence, Bozo — we just need to find a story to
fit it —”</p>
<p>“Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.</p>
<p>A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter’s eyes widened behind her
jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.</p>
<p>“Harry!” she said, beaming. “How lovely! Why don’t you come and join
— ?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,” said Harry
furiously. “What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?”</p>
<p>Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my
—”</p>
<p>“Who cares if he’s half-giant?” Harry shouted. “There’s nothing wrong
with him!”</p>
<p>The whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over
from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon
she was filling with mead was overflowing.</p>
<p>Rita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back
almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out
her Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview
about the Hagrid you know, Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your
unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it. Would you call him a
father substitute?”</p>
<p>Hermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand
as though it were a grenade.</p>
<p>“You horrible woman,” she said, through gritted teeth, “you don’t
care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, won’t they? Even
Ludo Bagman —”</p>
<p>“Sit down, you silly little girl, and don’t talk about things you
don’t understand,” said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they
fell on Hermione. “I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your
hair curl . . . not that it needs it —” she added, eyeing Hermione’s
bushy hair.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” said Hermione, “c’mon, Harry — Ron . . .”</p>
<p>They left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry
glanced back as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill
was out; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment
on the table.</p>
<p>“She’ll be after you next, Hermione,” said Ron in a low and worried
voice as they walked quickly back up the street.</p>
<p>“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage.
“I’ll show her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I’ll get her back for this.
First Harry, then Hagrid . . .”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said Ron nervously.
“I’m serious, Hermione, she’ll dig up something on you —”</p>
<p>“My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet. She can’t scare me into
hiding!” said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry
and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen
Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face.
“And Hagrid isn’t hiding anymore! He should never have let that excuse
for a human being upset him! Come on!”</p>
<p>Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road,
through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to
Hagrid’s cabin.</p>
<p>The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as
they approached.</p>
<p>“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. “Hagrid,
that’s enough! We know you’re in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a
giantess, Hagrid! You can’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you!
Hagrid, get out here, you’re just being —”</p>
<p>The door opened. Hermione said, “About t — !” and then stopped, very
suddenly, because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid,
but with Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.</p>
<p>“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione in a rather small
voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “Why
don’t you come in?”</p>
<p>“Oh . . . um . . . okay,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon
Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears.
Harry fended off Fang and looked around.</p>
<p>Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of
tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and
he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from
trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.</p>
<p>“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Hagrid looked up.</p>
<p>“’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice.</p>
<p>“More tea, I think,” said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving
tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore
magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a
slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, “Did you by any chance hear what
Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?”</p>
<p>Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and
continued, “Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you,
judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.”</p>
<p>“Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said, staring at Hagrid.
“You don’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry, Professor,” he added
quickly, looking at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said,
Harry,” said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the
ceiling.</p>
<p>“Er — right,” said Harry sheepishly. “I just meant — Hagrid, how
could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you?”</p>
<p>Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes and fell
slowly into his tangled beard.</p>
<p>“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid,” said
Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. “I have shown you
the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own
days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they
would have something to say about it —”</p>
<p>“Not all of ’em,” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Not all of ’em wan’ me ter
stay.”</p>
<p>“Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I’m
afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,” said Dumbledore,
now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles. “Not a week has
passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven’t had at
least one owl complaining about the way I run it. But what should I do?
Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?”</p>
<p>“Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily.</p>
<p>“Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives!” Harry said furiously.
“Look at the Dursleys!”</p>
<p>“An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My own brother,
Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat.
It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He
held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I’m
not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione quietly, “please come
back, we really miss you.”</p>
<p>Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his
tangled beard.</p>
<p>Dumbledore stood up. “I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid,
and I expect you back at work on Monday,” he said. “You will join me for
breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon
to you all.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fang’s ears. When
the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his
dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last,
Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great man,
Dumbledore . . . great man . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he is,” said Ron. “Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?”</p>
<p>“Help yerself,” said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand.
“Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all righ’ . . . I bin stupid . . .
my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. . . .” More
tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully, and said,
“Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I? Here . . .”</p>
<p>Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled
out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid’s crinkled black eyes,
beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven
or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face
was beardless, young, round, and smooth — he looked hardly older than
eleven.</p>
<p>“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,” Hagrid croaked.
“Dad was dead chuffed . . . thought I migh’ not be a wizard, see, ’cos
me mum . . . well, anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic,
really . . . but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me
second year. . . .</p>
<p>“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me
the gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em second
chances . . . tha’s what sets him apar’ from other Heads, see. He’ll
accept anyone at Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent. Knows
people can turn out okay even if their families weren’ . . . well . . .
all tha’ respectable. But some don’ understand that. There’s some who’d
always hold it against yeh . . . there’s some who’d even pretend they
just had big bones rather than stand up an’ say — I am what I am, an’
I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s
some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth botherin’ with.’
An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m not botherin’ with her no more,
I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . I’ll give her big bones.”</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would
rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to
Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid
was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.</p>
<p>“Yeh know wha’, Harry?” he said, looking up from the photograph of
his father, his eyes very bright, “when I firs’ met you, you reminded me
o’ me a bit. Mum an’ Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’ like yeh wouldn’ fit
in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it . . . an’
now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!”</p>
<p>He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, “Yeh
know what I’d love, Harry? I’d love yeh ter win, I really would. It’d
show ’em all . . . yeh don’ have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don’
have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It’d show ’em Dumbledore’s the one
who’s got it righ’, lettin’ anyone in as long as they can do magic. How
you doin’ with that egg, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Great,” said Harry. “Really great.”</p>
<p>Hagrid’s miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile.</p>
<p>“Tha’s my boy . . . you show ’em, Harry, you show ’em. Beat ’em
all.”</p>
<p>Lying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went
back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to
banish the image of the happy expression on Hagrid’s whiskery face as he
had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg
weighed more heavily than ever on Harry’s conscience that evening, and
by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind — it was time
to shelve his pride and see if Cedric’s hint was worth anything.</p>
