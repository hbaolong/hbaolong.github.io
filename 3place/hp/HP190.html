<h4 id="chapter-twenty-eight">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h4>
<p>THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p>Harry’s feet touched road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade
High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond
the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward
Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks,
and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how
he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak
Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as he
relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.</p>
<p>The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he
had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s
body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even
as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three
Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters
dashed into the street, their wands aloft.</p>
<p>Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many
of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their position. One
of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing
around the distant mountains.</p>
<p>“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The
Summoning Charm had not worked on it.</p>
<p>“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater who
had tried the charm, and then to his fellows, “Spread out. He’s
here.”</p>
<p>Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Hermione
backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the
Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness,
listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying
along the street from the Death Eaters’ searching wands.</p>
<p>“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”</p>
<p>“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a Death Eater
shouted,</p>
<p>“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find
you!”</p>
<p>“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that spell to
tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here,
trap us —”</p>
<p>“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have
free rein, they’d find him quick enough!”</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”</p>
<p>“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life,
not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”</p>
<p>There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel
dementors they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them
away immediately.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione
whispered.</p>
<p>Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over
the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars,
which vanished. In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of
his arm and together, they turned on the spot.</p>
<p>The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become
solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their
charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh.
He, Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way
along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner,
gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible
because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with
their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense
fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming
more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested,
tasting despair on the air, closing in —</p>
<p>He raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer the Dementor’s
Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he
thought as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors
scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of
sight.</p>
<p>“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a
stag!”</p>
<p>The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and
the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry
in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts
nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a
rough voice said, “Potter, in here, quick!”</p>
<p>He obeyed without hesitation: The three of them hurtled through the
open doorway.</p>
<p>“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure,
passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind
him.</p>
<p>Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the
stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of
the Hog’s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second
doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as
fast as they could. The stairs opened onto a sitting room with a
threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large
oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of
vacant sweetness.</p>
<p>Shouts reached them from the street below. Still wearing the
Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked down.
Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman, was
the only person not wearing a hood.</p>
<p>“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what?
You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at ’em! I’m
not having ’em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater. “That was a stag, it
was Potter’s!”</p>
<p>“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You idiot
— Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>Something huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head down, it
charged toward the High Street and out of sight.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I saw —” said the Death Eater, though with less
certainty.</p>
<p>“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions
told the barman. “Someone was out in the street against regulations
—”</p>
<p>“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your
curfew!”</p>
<p>“You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”</p>
<p>“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking
my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope
for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned
him. He’s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is
he, now?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry
about yourself, breaking curfew!”</p>
<p>“And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s
closed down? What’ll happen to your little sidelines then?”</p>
<p>“Are you threatening — ?”</p>
<p>“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death
Eater.</p>
<p>“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”</p>
<p>“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater. “Break
curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!”</p>
<p>The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermione moaned
with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a
wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the
Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below,
rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.</p>
<p>Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a
small, rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the
portrait of the girl.</p>
<p>The barman entered the room.</p>
<p>“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of
them. “What were you thinking, coming here?”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you enough. You saved our
lives.”</p>
<p>The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the face,
trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard. He wore
spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant
blue.</p>
<p>“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”</p>
<p>There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each
other.</p>
<p>“You sent Dobby.”</p>
<p>The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.</p>
<p>“Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?”</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”</p>
<p>The barman’s face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m
sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.”</p>
<p>He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at
any of them.</p>
<p>“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.</p>
<p>He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire.</p>
<p>“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s
mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.</p>
<p>“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told
me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”</p>
<p>Ron gasped.</p>
<p>“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth.</p>
<p>“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”</p>
<p>“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just
proved my Patronus is a goat?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively
as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.</p>
<p>“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room,
reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a
pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the
fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence
but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets, and the sound of
chewing.</p>
<p>“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and
Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to think of
the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard
what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling
Charm’s set off, they’ll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I
don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time.
Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on
and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains,
and you’ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been
hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest
him.”</p>
<p>“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to get
as far from here as you can.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into
the castle. Dumbledore — I mean, your brother — wanted us —”</p>
<p>The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses
momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind
eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.</p>
<p>“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and
people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand
plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if
you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He’s gone where none
of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him anything.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand,” said Harry again.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I understood
my own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with
exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s . . . he left me
a job.”</p>
<p>“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort
of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without
overstretching themselves?”</p>
<p>Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.</p>
<p>“I-it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to —”</p>
<p>“‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth
roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I —” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the
offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order of the
Phoenix —”</p>
<p>“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished.
You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s
kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants
you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take
these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be
in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with
you.”</p>
<p>“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job —”</p>
<p>“Give it to someone else!”</p>
<p>“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all —”</p>
<p>“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with
you?”</p>
<p>Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple
word would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was
thinking.</p>
<p>“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee.
Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a
natural.”</p>
<p>The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the
mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture
in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone
else.</p>
<p>“Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is that your sister?
Ariana?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you,
missy?”</p>
<p>Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had
turned red.</p>
<p>“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare
Hermione.</p>
<p>“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead.
“Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice, he did. Well,
so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.”</p>
<p>Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and
uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He
had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to
continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus
Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he
wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he
did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose.
He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brother’s: The
bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the
object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he
was thinking and despised him for it.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Hermione in
a low voice.</p>
<p>“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how many of the people my
brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d
left ’em well alone.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.</p>
<p>“Never you mind,” said Aberforth.</p>
<p>“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are you —
are you talking about your sister?”</p>
<p>Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the
words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.</p>
<p>“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by
three Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back
garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard
can at that age. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their
way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they
got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick.
Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger
and the intensity of his pain.</p>
<p>“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She
wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and
drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and
at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and
scared and harmless.</p>
<p>“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth,
“and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never
said why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had
become, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have
seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy,
unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when
she couldn’t keep it in any longer.</p>
<p>“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she
was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and
happy.</p>
<p>“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy
seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not
Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his
books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with
‘the most notable magical names of the day,’” Aberforth sneered. “He
didn’t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her
to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm
down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used
to help me feed the goats.</p>
<p>“Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there,” said
Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one
of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . . it was
an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”</p>
<p>Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want
to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how
long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he
had ever spoken about it.</p>
<p>“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge.
The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off
on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!”</p>
<p>Aberforth spat into the fire.</p>
<p>“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about
school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my
education and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for
Mr. Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister,
stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right
for a few weeks . . . till he came.”</p>
<p>And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face.</p>
<p>“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to,
someone just as bright and talented as he was. And looking after Ariana
took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new
Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they
were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind,
and if one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus
was working for the greater good?</p>
<p>“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly
time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em,
face-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at
Harry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and
angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, you’d better give it
up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit state, you can’t take her
with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re making your
clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn’t
like that,” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the
firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone white and blind
again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me
what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my
brilliant brother . . . Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t
have to be hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out
of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?</p>
<p>“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my wand, and he
pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s
best friend — and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us
were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she
couldn’t stand it —”</p>
<p>The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had
suffered a mortal wound.</p>
<p>“— and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what
she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been
any of us — and she was dead.”</p>
<p>His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest
chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as
Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard
it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it.</p>
<p>“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”</p>
<p>He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record
already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his
account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his
sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the —”</p>
<p>“He was never free,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.</p>
<p>“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a
potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading
with someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please . . . hurt me
instead.’”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into
details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events
that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts
had eclipsed it so thoroughly.</p>
<p>“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he
did,” said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. “He
thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana. . . . It was
torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was
free.”</p>
<p>Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined
hands. After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure, Potter, that my
brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can
you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?”</p>
<p>A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth. “Why
didn’t he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to
survive’?”</p>
<p>“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you’ve
got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to
think about the greater good! This is war!”</p>
<p>“You’re seventeen, boy!”</p>
<p>“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given
up!”</p>
<p>“Who says I’ve given up?”</p>
<p>“‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’” Harry repeated.
“‘You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s
kidding themselves.’”</p>
<p>“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish
You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep
going until I succeed — or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this
might end. I’ve known it for years.”</p>
<p>He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He
merely scowled.</p>
<p>“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t help
us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way
in ourselves. If you can help us — well, now would be a great time to
mention it.”</p>
<p>Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes
that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his
throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached
the portrait of Ariana.</p>
<p>“You know what to do,” he said.</p>
<p>She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits
usually did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to
be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure
retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
<p>“Er — what — ?” began Ron.</p>
<p>“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know they’ve
got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all
around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what
my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you
expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and
the Carrows as his deputies . . . well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it?
You say you’re prepared to die.”</p>
<p>“But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture.</p>
<p>A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and
now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as
she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than
she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer
than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes
to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the
two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the
portrait. Then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little
door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his
hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real
Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the
mantelpiece, and yelled, “I knew you’d come! I knew it, Harry!”</p>
