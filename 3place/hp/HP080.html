<h4 id="chapter-twenty-three">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h4>
<p>THE YULE BALL</p>
<p>Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had
been given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when term
ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as
fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly
less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk
slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual.
Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and
for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into
feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors
had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme
caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and
George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing
something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a
crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn’t forgotten Dudley
and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.</p>
<p>Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The
pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted
pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin,
while the Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging
white with frost. The house-elves down in the kitchen were outdoing
themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and
only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain
about.</p>
<p>“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying
grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron
skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur). “I will not fit
into my dress robes!”</p>
<p>“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the
entrance hall. “She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn’t
she?”</p>
<p>“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron.</p>
<p>He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a
response by asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione
merely frowned and said, “I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of
me.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them. “You’re not
telling me someone’s asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared
Mudblood?”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving
to somebody over Malfoy’s shoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”</p>
<p>Malfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for
Moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.</p>
<p>“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione
scathingly, and she, Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase
laughing heartily.</p>
<p>“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning,
“your teeth . . .”</p>
<p>“What about them?” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re different . . . I’ve just noticed. . . .”</p>
<p>“Of course they are — did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy
gave me?”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, they’re different to how they were before he put that
hex on you. . . . They’re all . . . straight and — and
normal-sized.”</p>
<p>Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it
too: It was a very different smile from the one he remembered.</p>
<p>“Well . . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she
held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they
normally were,” she said. “And I just . . . let her carry on a bit.” She
smiled even more widely. “Mum and Dad won’t be too pleased. I’ve been
trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted
me to carry on with my braces. You know, they’re dentists, they just
don’t think teeth and magic should — look! Pigwidgeon’s back!”</p>
<p>Ron’s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden
banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him
were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and
said, “Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn’t he cute?”</p>
<p>“Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and
snatching up Pigwidgeon. “You bring letters to the addressee! You don’t
hang around showing off!”</p>
<p>Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron’s fist. The
third-year girls all looked very shocked.</p>
<p>“Clear off!” Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon,
who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. “Here —
take it, Harry,” Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls
scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled Sirius’s reply off
Pigwidgeon’s leg, Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor
Tower to read it.</p>
<p>Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more
holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and
Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was
gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out:</p>
<p>Dear Harry,</p>
<p>Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name
in that goblet shouldn’t be feeling too happy right now! I was going to
suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its weakest point
— “That’s what Krum did!” Hermione whispered — but your way was better,
I’m impressed.</p>
<p>Don’t get complacent, though, Harry. You’ve only done one task;
whoever put you in for the tournament’s got plenty more opportunity if
they’re trying to hurt you. Keep your eyes open — particularly when the
person we discussed is around — and concentrate on keeping yourself out
of trouble.</p>
<p>Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.</p>
<p>“He sounds exactly like Moody,” said Harry quietly, tucking the
letter away again inside his robes. “‘Constant vigilance!’ You’d think I
walk around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls. . . .”</p>
<p>“But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still got two tasks
to do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start
working out what it means. . . .”</p>
<p>“Hermione, he’s got ages!” snapped Ron. “Want a game of chess,
Harry?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione’s face,
he said, “Come on, how’m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise
going on? I won’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.”</p>
<p>“Oh I suppose not,” she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess
match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron’s, involving a
couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.</p>
<p>Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused
his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw
something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the
darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.</p>
<p>“Dobby!” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost
fell out of bed. “Don’t do that!”</p>
<p>“Dobby is sorry, sir!” squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward
with his long fingers over his mouth. “Dobby is only wanting to wish
Harry Potter ‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir! Harry
Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual,
while his heart rate returned to normal. “Just — just prod me or
something in future, all right, don’t bend over me like that. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his
glasses from his bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken
Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through the
gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.</p>
<p>“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked sleepily.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered. “Go back to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Nah . . . presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the
foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake
they might as well get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned
back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still
looking worried that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble
tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.</p>
<p>“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he squeaked
tentatively.</p>
<p>“’Course you can,” said Harry. “Er . . . I’ve got something for you
too.”</p>
<p>It was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he
quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up
pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had
once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was
that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a
year now. He pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby,
saying, “Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. . . .”</p>
<p>But Dobby was utterly delighted.</p>
<p>“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he said, ripping
off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon’s. “I has seven now, sir. .
. . But sir . . .” he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks
up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his
shorts, “they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is
giving you two the same!”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn’t spot that?” said Ron, grinning
over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. “Tell
you what, Dobby — here you go — take these two, and you can mix them up
properly. And here’s your sweater.”</p>
<p>He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the
hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent. Dobby looked quite
overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again,
bowing deeply to Ron. “Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is
Harry Potter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also
as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless —”</p>
<p>“They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the
ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same. “Wow, Harry —” He
had just opened Harry’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat. “Cool!” He jammed
it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.</p>
<p>Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be —
socks.</p>
<p>“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily. “He is
buying the wool out of his wages, sir!”</p>
<p>The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon
it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.</p>
<p>“They’re . . . they’re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry,
and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness
again.</p>
<p>“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the
kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving
good-bye to Ron and the others as he passed.</p>
<p>Harry’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd
socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of
a single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were
remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book
called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of
Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock
and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all
Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs,
Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of
course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package, including a new sweater (green,
with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry supposed Charlie had told her
all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince
pies.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went
down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor
Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the
Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred
turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s Wizarding
Crackers.</p>
<p>They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was
untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and
Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to
watch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at
five o’clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the
ball.</p>
<p>“What, you need three hours?” said Ron, looking at her incredulously
and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown
by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. “Who’re you going
with?” he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up
the stone steps into the castle.</p>
<p>There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at
seven o’clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others
abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The
Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from
downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate
liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.</p>
<p>“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they gave the
password, and she swung forward to let them inside.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes
up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none
as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner
with an appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the
fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a
desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm
on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now
lace-free, although he hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still
looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.</p>
<p>“I still can’t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the
year,” muttered Dean.</p>
<p>“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of
his cuffs.</p>
<p>The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different
colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry
at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of
shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold
bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she
wasn’t giggling.</p>
<p>“You — er — look nice,” he said awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she said. “Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,”
she added to Ron.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Ron, looking around. “Where’s Hermione?”</p>
<p>Parvati shrugged. “Shall we go down then, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room.
Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait
hole.</p>
<p>The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around
waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be
thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different
Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati
found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes
of bright turquoise. She didn’t look too enthusiastic about having Ron
as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and
sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd.
“Oh no . . .”</p>
<p>He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur
Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin,
and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, Roger Davies. When
they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads
of the crowd.</p>
<p>“Where is Hermione?” he said again.</p>
<p>A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common
room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet
with a high collar, which in Harry’s opinion made him look like a vicar.
Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy’s
arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled
moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see,
had managed to find a partner.</p>
<p>The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the
Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the
front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry
didn’t know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front
of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy
lights — meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the
rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues
of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.</p>
<p>Then Professor McGonagall’s voice called, “Champions over here,
please!”</p>
<p>Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said “See you
in a minute” to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd
parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress
robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles
around the brim of her hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors
while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in
procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour
and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked
so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he
could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry
too; he looked away from them so he wouldn’t have to talk to them. His
eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>It was Hermione.</p>
<p>But she didn’t look like Hermione at all. She had done something with
her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up
into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made
of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself
differently, somehow — or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty
or so books she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling —
rather nervously, it was true — but the reduction in the size of her
front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn’t understand how
he hadn’t spotted it before.</p>
<p>“Hi, Harry!” she said. “Hi, Parvati!”</p>
<p>Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn’t
the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum’s fan
club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest
loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and
even he didn’t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron,
however, walked right past Hermione without looking at her.</p>
<p>Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told
the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow
her. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they
entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of
the Hall, where the judges were sitting.</p>
<p>The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost,
with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black
ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a
hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen
people.</p>
<p>Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to
be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry
so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting
through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top
table. Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was
looking sulky.</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table,
but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron’s as he watched
Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright
purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any
of the students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of
black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them
politely. But Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The
fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.</p>
<p>When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew
out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took
the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new,
navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry
thought it ought to be fined.</p>
<p>“I’ve been promoted,” Percy said before Harry could even ask, and
from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme
ruler of the universe. “I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant, and I’m
here representing him.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he come?” Harry asked. He wasn’t looking forward to being
lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all. Hasn’t
been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising — overwork. He’s not
as young as he was — though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind
remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the
whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with
the misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was
called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but — well,
as I say, he’s getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he’s
found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we
had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with
— that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around — no, poor man, he’s
having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad he knew he had
someone he could rely upon to take his place.”</p>
<p>Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling
Percy “Weatherby” yet, but resisted the temptation.</p>
<p>There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small
menus were lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up
uncertainly and looked around — there were no waiters. Dumbledore,
however, looked carefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly
to his plate, “Pork chops!”</p>
<p>And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table
placed their orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione
to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining
— surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves? — but for
once, Hermione didn’t seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in
talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was
eating.</p>
<p>It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak
before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at
that.</p>
<p>“Vell, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable,
I am thinking,” he was telling Hermione. “Ve have just four floors, and
the fires are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger
even than these — though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve
are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are flying every day, over the
lakes and the mountains —”</p>
<p>“Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn’t reach his
cold eyes, “don’t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming
friend will know exactly where to find us!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Igor, all this secrecy . . .
one would almost think you didn’t want visitors.”</p>
<p>“Well, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to
their fullest extent, “we are all protective of our private domains, are
we not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been
entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our
school’s secrets, and right to protect them?”</p>
<p>“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets,
Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably. “Only this morning, for instance, I
took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a
beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a
really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back
to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished.
But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at
five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon —
or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.”</p>
<p>Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry
could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to
Roger Davies.</p>
<p>“Zis is nothing,” she said dismissively, looking around at the
sparkling walls of the Great Hall. “At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we ’ave
ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not
melt, of course . . . zey are like ’uge statues of diamond, glittering
around ze place. And ze food is seemply superb. And we ’ave choirs of
wood nymphs, ’oo serenade us as we eat. We ’ave none of zis ugly armor
in ze ’alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons, ’e
would be expelled like zat.” She slapped her hand onto the table
impatiently.</p>
<p>Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his
face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the
impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word
she was saying.</p>
<p>“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on
the table in imitation of Fleur. “Like that. Yeah.”</p>
<p>Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other
staff tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up
at the top table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around,
saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the
candlelight.</p>
<p>Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept
calling her “Hermy-own.”</p>
<p>“Her-my-oh-nee,” she said slowly and clearly.</p>
<p>“Herm-own-ninny.”</p>
<p>“Close enough,” she said, catching Harry’s eye and grinning.</p>
<p>When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked
the students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the
tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he
conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of
drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon
it.</p>
<p>The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly
enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in
black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their
instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that
he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the
lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other
champions and their partners were standing up.</p>
<p>“Come on!” Parvati hissed. “We’re supposed to dance!”</p>
<p>Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters
struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit
dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he could see
Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati
had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the
other tightly in hers.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving
slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over
the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had
come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the
center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby — he could
see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet — and
Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her
that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she
moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an
extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously
avoiding his wooden leg.</p>
<p>“Nice socks, Potter,” Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye
staring through Harry’s robes.</p>
<p>“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,” said Harry,
grinning.</p>
<p>“He is so creepy!” Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. “I don’t
think that eye should be allowed!”</p>
<p>Harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief.
The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more,
and Harry let go of Parvati at once.</p>
<p>“Let’s sit down, shall we?”</p>
<p>“Oh — but — this is a really good one!” Parvati said as the Weird
Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance
floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exuberantly that
people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the
table where Ron and Padma were sitting.</p>
<p>“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle
of butterbeer.</p>
<p>Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were
dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one
foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a
disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat
down on Harry’s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within
minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.</p>
<p>“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.</p>
<p>“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from
Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.</p>
<p>Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair. She was a
bit pink in the face from dancing.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand.
“Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.”</p>
<p>Ron gave her a withering look. “Viktor?” he said. “Hasn’t he asked
you to call him Vicky yet?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him in surprise. “What’s up with you?” she
said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not going to tell
you.”</p>
<p>Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.</p>
<p>“Ron, what — ?”</p>
<p>“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. “He’s competing against Harry!
Against Hogwarts! You — you’re —” Ron was obviously casting around for
words strong enough to describe Hermione’s crime, “fraternizing with the
enemy, that’s what you’re doing!”</p>
<p>Hermione’s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment. “The enemy! Honestly —
who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was
the one who wanted his autograph? Who’s got a model of him up in their
dormitory?”</p>
<p>Ron chose to ignore this. “I s’pose he asked you to come with him
while you were both in the library?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing
more brightly. “So what?”</p>
<p>“What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you?”</p>
<p>“No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said he’d been
coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t
been able to pluck up the courage!”</p>
<p>Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was
the same color as Parvati’s robes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well — that’s his story,” said Ron nastily.</p>
<p>“And what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he? He knows who
you hang around with. . . . He’s just trying to get closer to Harry —
get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him —”</p>
<p>Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her
voice quivered.</p>
<p>“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about
Harry, not one —”</p>
<p>Ron changed tack at the speed of light.</p>
<p>“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his egg means! I
suppose you’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little
library sessions —”</p>
<p>“I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione, looking
outraged. “Never. How could you say something like that — I want Harry
to win the tournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?”</p>
<p>“You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.</p>
<p>“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign
wizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione hotly.</p>
<p>“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”</p>
<p>People were starting to stare at them.</p>
<p>“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with Hermione
coming with Krum —”</p>
<p>But Ron ignored Harry too.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering where you are,”
said Ron.</p>
<p>“Don’t call him Vicky!”</p>
<p>Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor,
disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger
and satisfaction on his face.</p>
<p>“Are you going to ask me to dance at all?” Padma asked him.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.</p>
<p>“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and
the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so
fast that Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning
Charm.</p>
<p>“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.</p>
<p>Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.</p>
<p>“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. “Lost her, have
you?”</p>
<p>Krum was looking surly again.</p>
<p>“Vell, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,” he said, and he
slouched off.</p>
<p>“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?”</p>
<p>Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking
extremely pompous. “Excellent! That’s the whole point, you know —
international magical cooperation!”</p>
<p>To Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s vacated seat. The top
table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor
Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid
were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through
the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song
ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss
Professor McGonagall’s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at
which point Fred and George accosted him.</p>
<p>“What do they think they’re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?”
Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. “No respect . .
.”</p>
<p>Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and,
spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.</p>
<p>“I hope my brothers weren’t bothering you, Mr. Bagman?” said Percy at
once.</p>
<p>“What? Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman. “No, they were just
telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I
could advise them on the marketing. I’ve promised to put them in touch
with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko’s Joke Shop. . . .”</p>
<p>Percy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to
bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he
got home. Apparently Fred and George’s plans had grown even more
ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman
opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.</p>
<p>“How do you feel the tournament’s going, Mr. Bagman? Our department’s
quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire” — he glanced at
Harry — “was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone
very smoothly since, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been enormous fun. How’s
old Barty doing? Shame he couldn’t come.”</p>
<p>“Oh I’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,” said Percy
importantly, “but in the meantime, I’m more than willing to take up the
slack. Of course, it’s not all attending balls” — he laughed airily —
“oh no, I’ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up
in his absence — you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment
of flying carpets into the country? And then we’ve been trying to
persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling.
I’ve got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new
year —”</p>
<p>“Let’s go for a walk,” Ron muttered to Harry, “get away from Percy. .
. .”</p>
<p>Pretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron left the table,
edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall.
The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose
garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they
found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and
large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded
like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches.
He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the
rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an
unpleasantly familiar voice.</p>
<p>“. . . don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.”</p>
<p>“Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!” Karkaroff’s voice
sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. “It’s
been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously
concerned, I can’t deny it —”</p>
<p>“Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly. “Flee — I will make your
excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out
and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured.
Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from
them.</p>
<p>“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled as a girl ran
past him. “And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!” as a boy went
rushing after her. “And what are you two doing?” he added, catching
sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked
slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously
to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.</p>
<p>“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly. “Not against the law, is
it?”</p>
<p>“Keep walking, then!” Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his
long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after
Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.</p>
<p>“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.</p>
<p>“And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?” said
Harry slowly.</p>
<p>They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could
see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two
enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the
moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.</p>
<p>“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an oddly husky
voice.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron froze. This didn’t sound like the sort of scene they
ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the
path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in
a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head
toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without
being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron,
eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head
vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the
reindeer.</p>
<p>“What did you know, ’Agrid?” said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low
voice.</p>
<p>Harry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would
hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have)
— if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and
hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option. Instead he tried to
interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer’s back,
but the beetle just wasn’t interesting enough to block out Hagrid’s next
words.</p>
<p>“I jus’ knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or
yer father?”</p>
<p>“I — I don’t know what you mean, ’Agrid. . . .”</p>
<p>“It was my mother,” said Hagrid quietly. “She was one o’ the las’
ones in Britain. ’Course, I can’ remember her too well . . . she left,
see. When I was abou’ three. She wasn’ really the maternal sort. Well .
. . it’s not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her . . .
might be dead fer all I know. . . .”</p>
<p>Madame Maxime didn’t say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself,
took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer’s
antlers, listening. . . . He had never heard Hagrid talk about his
childhood before.</p>
<p>“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny little bloke, my dad
was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an’ put him on top o’ the
dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. . . .” Hagrid’s deep
voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring
at the silvery fountain. “Dad raised me . . . but he died, o’ course,
jus’ after I started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after that.
Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. . . .”</p>
<p>Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose
heavily.</p>
<p>“So . . . anyway . . . enough abou’ me. What about you? Which side
you got it on?”</p>
<p>But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.</p>
<p>“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather was doing, it was
nowhere near as cold as her voice. “I think I will go in now.”</p>
<p>“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve never met
another one before!”</p>
<p>“Anuzzer what, precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.</p>
<p>Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood
there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t
— but it was no good.</p>
<p>“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>“’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through
the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and
Roger fall out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more insulted in
my life! ’Alf-giant? Moi? I ’ave — I ’ave big bones!”</p>
<p>She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the
air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still
sitting on the bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make
out his expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode
away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the
direction of his cabin.</p>
<p>“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. . . .”</p>
<p>But Ron didn’t move.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.</p>
<p>Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.</p>
<p>“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being half-giant?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “So what?”</p>
<p>He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was
once again revealing his ignorance of the Wizarding world. Brought up by
the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that
were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with
each successive year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards
would not have said “So what?” upon finding out that one of their
friends had a giantess for a mother.</p>
<p>“I’ll explain inside,” said Ron quietly, “c’mon. . . .”</p>
<p>Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private
clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and
Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of
Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry
and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.</p>
<p>“So?” Harry prompted Ron. “What’s the problem with giants?”</p>
<p>“Well, they’re . . . they’re . . .” Ron struggled for words. “. . .
not very nice,” he finished lamely.</p>
<p>“Who cares?” Harry said. “There’s nothing wrong with Hagrid!”</p>
<p>“I know there isn’t, but . . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,”
Ron said, shaking his head. “I always thought he’d got in the way of a
bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to
mention it. . . .”</p>
<p>“But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . no one who knows him will care, ’cos they’ll know he’s
not dangerous,” said Ron slowly. “But . . . Harry, they’re just vicious,
giants. It’s like Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like
trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren’t
any left in Britain now, though.”</p>
<p>“What happened to them?”</p>
<p>“Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves
killed by Aurors. There’re supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . .
They hide out in mountains mostly. . . .”</p>
<p>“I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding,” Harry said, watching
Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges’ table, looking very somber.
“If Hagrid’s half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones . . . the only
thing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their
corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not
to watch Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick
something.</p>
<p>When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave
them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into
the entrance hall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball
could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to
bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening hadn’t been much fun.</p>
<p>Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good
night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a
very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without
speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry
heard someone calling him.</p>
<p>“Hey — Harry!”</p>
<p>It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the
entrance hall below.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.</p>
<p>Cedric looked as though he didn’t want to say whatever it was in
front of Ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb
the stairs.</p>
<p>“Listen . . .” Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. “I owe
you one for telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does
yours wail when you open it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . take a bath, okay?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and — er — just mull
things over in the hot water. It’ll help you think. . . . Trust me.”</p>
<p>Harry stared at him.</p>
<p>“Tell you what,” Cedric said, “use the prefects’ bathroom. Fourth
door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth
floor. Password’s ‘pine fresh.’ Gotta go . . . want to say good night
—”</p>
<p>He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to
Cho.</p>
<p>Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely
strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing
egg meant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look
like a fool, so Cho would like him even more by comparison?</p>
<p>The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the
portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up,
and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the
common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing
ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the
face.</p>
<p>“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t
you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun
now, and her face was screwed up in anger.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Ron yelled back. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not
as a last resort!”</p>
<p>Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione
turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to bed. Ron
turned to look at Harry.</p>
<p>“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well — that just proves
— completely missed the point —”</p>
