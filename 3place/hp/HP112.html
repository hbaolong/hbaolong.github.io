<h4 id="chapter-eighteen">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h4>
<p>DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY</p>
<p>Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other
explanation.”</p>
<p>“You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?” he said, outraged.</p>
<p>“I’m almost certain of it,” said Hermione grimly. “Watch your frog,
it’s escaping.”</p>
<p>Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping
hopefully toward the other side of the table — “Accio!” — and it zoomed
gloomily back into his hand.</p>
<p>Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private
chat: There was generally so much movement and activity that the danger
of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of
croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain
clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione’s whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught
Sirius went quite unnoticed.</p>
<p>“I’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering
Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,” Hermione whispered. “I
mean, once your letter had been read, it would have been quite clear you
weren’t ordering them, so you wouldn’t have been in trouble at all —
it’s a bit of a feeble joke, isn’t it? But then I thought, what if
somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be
a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch, let him do the
dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing
it from him or else demand to see it — I don’t think Filch would object,
when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights? Harry, you’re squashing
your frog.”</p>
<p>Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly
its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.</p>
<p>“It was a very, very close call last night,” said Hermione. “I just
wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!”</p>
<p>The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was
struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.</p>
<p>“If she’d caught Snuffles . . .”</p>
<p>Harry finished the sentence for her.</p>
<p>“He’d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.” He waved his wand
without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon
and emitted a high-pitched whistle.</p>
<p>“Silencio!” said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry’s frog,
which deflated silently before them. “Well, he mustn’t do it again,
that’s all. I just don’t know how we’re going to let him know. We can’t
send him an owl.”</p>
<p>“I don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,” said Ron. “He’s not stupid, he
knows she nearly got him. Silencio!”</p>
<p>The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.</p>
<p>“Silencio! SILENCIO!”</p>
<p>The raven cawed more loudly.</p>
<p>“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said Hermione, watching Ron
critically. “You don’t want to wave it, it’s more a sharp jab.”</p>
<p>“Ravens are harder than frogs,” said Ron testily.</p>
<p>“Fine, let’s swap,” said Hermione, seizing Ron’s raven and replacing
it with her own fat bullfrog. “Silencio!” The raven continued to open
and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.</p>
<p>“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s squeaky little
voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all jumped. “Now, let me see you try,
Mr. Weasley!”</p>
<p>“Wha — ? Oh — oh, right,” said Ron, very flustered. “Er —
Silencio!”</p>
<p>He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye; the
frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk.</p>
<p>It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given
additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.</p>
<p>They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour
outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the
first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the
chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody’s
head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling toward them
through the groups of gossiping students.</p>
<p>“I’ve got permission!” she said. “To re-form the Quidditch team!”</p>
<p>“Excellent!” said Ron and Harry together.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Angelina, beaming. “I went to McGonagall and I think she
might have appealed to Dumbledore — anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha!
So I want you down at the pitch at seven o’clock tonight, all right,
because we’ve got to make up time, you realize we’re only three weeks
away from our first match?”</p>
<p>She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from
Peeves, which hit a nearby first year instead, and vanished from
sight.</p>
<p>Ron’s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which
was now opaque with hammering rain.</p>
<p>“Hope this clears up . . . What’s up with you, Hermione?”</p>
<p>She too was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw
it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.</p>
<p>“Just thinking . . .” she said, still frowning at the rain-washed
window.</p>
<p>“About Siri . . . Snuffles?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“No . . . not exactly . . .” said Hermione slowly. “More . . .
wondering . . . I suppose we’re doing the right thing . . . I think . .
. aren’t we?”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Well, that clears that up,” said Ron. “It would’ve been really
annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he was
there.</p>
<p>“I was just wondering,” she said, her voice stronger now, “whether
we’re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts
group.”</p>
<p>“What!” said Harry and Ron together.</p>
<p>“Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!” said Ron
indignantly.</p>
<p>“I know,” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. “But after
talking to Snuffles . . .”</p>
<p>“But he’s all for it!” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione, staring at the window again. “Yes, that’s what
made me think maybe it wasn’t a good idea after all . . .”</p>
<p>Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready;
automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads
until he had passed.</p>
<p>“Let’s get this straight,” said Harry angrily, as they put their bags
back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think we should
do it anymore?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her own
hands she said, “Do you honestly trust his judgment?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do!” said Harry at once. “He’s always given us great
advice!”</p>
<p>An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the
ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things
at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it
sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully.</p>
<p>“You don’t think he has become . . . sort of . . . reckless . . .
since he’s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don’t think he’s . . .
kind of . . . living through us?”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean, ‘living through us’?” Harry retorted.</p>
<p>“I mean . . . well, I think he’d love to be forming secret defense
societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry. . . . I
think he’s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is . . .
so I think he’s keen to kind of . . . egg us on.”</p>
<p>Ron looked utterly perplexed.</p>
<p>“Sirius is right,” he said, “you do sound just like my mother.”</p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as Peeves
swooped down upon Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her
head.</p>
<p>The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven
o’clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch
pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet
slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, thundery
gray and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing
rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary. They found Fred
and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes
to get out of flying.</p>
<p>“— but I bet she’d know what we’d done,” Fred said out of the corner
of his mouth. “If only I hadn’t offered to sell her some Puking
Pastilles yesterday —”</p>
<p>“We could try the Fever Fudge,” George muttered, “no one’s seen that
yet —”</p>
<p>“Does it work?” inquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain on
the roof intensified and wind howled around the building.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah,” said Fred, “your temperature’ll go right up —”</p>
<p>“— but you get these massive pus-filled boils too,” said George, “and
we haven’t worked out how to get rid of them yet.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see any boils,” said Ron, staring at the twins.</p>
<p>“No, well, you wouldn’t,” said Fred darkly, “they’re not in a place
we generally display to the public —”</p>
<p>“— but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the —”</p>
<p>“All right, everyone, listen up,” said Angelina loudly, emerging from
the Captain’s office. “I know it’s not ideal weather, but there’s a good
chance we’ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it’s a good
idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. Harry, didn’t you do
something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we
played Hufflepuff in that storm?”</p>
<p>“Hermione did it,” said Harry. He pulled out his wand, tapped his
glasses and said, “Impervius!”</p>
<p>“I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina. “If we could just
keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all
together, come on — Impervius! Okay. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their
robes, shouldered their brooms, and followed Angelina out of the
changing rooms.</p>
<p>They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch;
visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was
fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds.</p>
<p>“All right, on my whistle,” shouted Angelina.</p>
<p>Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and
shot upward, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no idea
how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough
difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a
minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the
Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately Angelina did not see this; in
fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a
clue what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a
distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain
pummeling the surface of the lake.</p>
<p>Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat.
She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms,
insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without
any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were looking
particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with every
movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he toweled
his hair dry.</p>
<p>“I think a few of mine have ruptured,” said Fred in a hollow
voice.</p>
<p>“Mine haven’t,” said George, wincing. “They’re throbbing like mad . .
. feel bigger if anything . . .”</p>
<p>“OUCH!” said Harry.</p>
<p>He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain.
The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than in
months.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” said several voices.</p>
<p>Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was blurred
because he was not wearing his glasses; but he could still tell that
everyone’s face was turned toward him.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he muttered, “I — poked myself in the eye, that’s all . .
.”</p>
<p>But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as
the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their
hats pulled low over their ears.</p>
<p>“What happened?” said Ron, the moment that Alicia had disappeared
through the door. “Was it your scar?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“But . . .” Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and
stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t be near us now, can he?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his forehead.
“He’s probably miles away. It hurt because . . . he’s . . . angry.”</p>
<p>Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though
a stranger had spoken them — yet he knew at once that they were true. He
did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was,
whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper.</p>
<p>“Did you see him?” said Ron, looking horrified. “Did you . . . get a
vision, or something?”</p>
<p>Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his
memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain. . . .</p>
<p>A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices . . .</p>
<p>“He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough,” he
said.</p>
<p>Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth,
and yet quite certain that they were true.</p>
<p>“But . . . how do you know?” said Ron.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing
down upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron
sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.</p>
<p>“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a hushed voice.
“When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was angry?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>“What is it, then?”</p>
<p>Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge’s
face. . . . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feeling in
his stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a happy feeling. . .
. But, of course, he had not recognized it for what it was, as he had
been feeling so miserable himself. . . .</p>
<p>“Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said. “Really pleased.
He thought . . . something good was going to happen. And the night
before we came back to Hogwarts . . .” He thought back to the moment
when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in Grimmauld
Place. “He was furious . . .”</p>
<p>He looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him.</p>
<p>“You could take over from Trelawney, mate,” he said in an awed
voice.</p>
<p>“I’m not making prophecies,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“No, you know what you’re doing?” Ron said, sounding both scared and
impressed. “Harry, you’re reading You-Know-Who’s mind. . . .”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It’s more like . . . his mood, I
suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what mood he’s in. . . . Dumbledore
said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that
when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell.
Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s pleased too . . .”</p>
<p>There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to tell someone,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“I told Sirius last time.”</p>
<p>“Well, tell him about this time!”</p>
<p>“Can’t, can I?” said Harry grimly. “Umbridge is watching the owls and
the fires, remember?”</p>
<p>“Well then, Dumbledore —”</p>
<p>“I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said Harry shortly, getting
to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, and swinging it around
himself. “There’s no point telling him again.”</p>
<p>Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’d want to know,” he said.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged.</p>
<p>“C’mon . . . we’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice . . .”</p>
<p>They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stumbling up
the muddy lawns, not talking. Harry was thinking hard. What was it that
Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough?</p>
<p>“He’s got other plans . . . plans he can put into operation very
quietly indeed . . . stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a
weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.”</p>
<p>He had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too
absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the
ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry
interference. . . . But now they came back to him and made him wonder. .
. . Voldemort’s anger would make sense if he was no nearer laying hands
on the weapon, whatever it was. . . . Had the Order thwarted him,
stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now?</p>
<p>“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Ron’s voice and Harry came back to his
senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common
room.</p>
<p>It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks
curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted elf hats
lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she was not
around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have
her urge him to go to Dumbledore too. Ron kept throwing him anxious
glances, but Harry pulled out his Potions book and set to work to finish
his essay, though he was only pretending to concentrate and, by the time
that Ron said he was going to bed too, had written hardly anything.</p>
<p>Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a
passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not
taking in a word of it. . . .</p>
<p>These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine,
and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts,
where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and
recklessness. . . .</p>
<p>. . . Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in
Grimmauld Place. . . .</p>
<p>. . . moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are
therefore much used . . .</p>
<p>. . . the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they
found out that he knew what Voldemort was feeling . . .</p>
<p>. . . therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts . .
.</p>
<p>. . . confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what
Voldemort was feeling? What was this weird connection between them,
which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily?</p>
<p>. . . where the wizard is desirous . . .</p>
<p>. . . how he would like to sleep . . .</p>
<p>. . . of producing hot-headedness . . .</p>
<p>. . . It was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire,
with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crookshanks
purring and the crackling of the flames. . . .</p>
<p>The book slipped from Harry’s slack grip and landed with a dull thud
on the hearthrug. His head fell sideways. . . .</p>
<p>He was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his footsteps
echoing in the silence. As the door at the end of the passage loomed
larger his heart beat fast with excitement. . . . If he could only open
it . . . enter beyond . . .</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand. . . . His fingertips were inches from it.
. . .</p>
<p>“Harry Potter, sir!”</p>
<p>He awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the
common room, but there was something moving close by.</p>
<p>“Whozair?” said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. The fire was
almost extinguished, the room very dark.</p>
<p>“Dobby has your owl, sir!” said a squeaky voice.</p>
<p>“Dobby?” said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom toward the
source of the voice.</p>
<p>Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione
had left her half a dozen knitted hats. His large, pointed ears were now
sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats that Hermione
had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the other, so that his
head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on the very topmost
bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured.</p>
<p>“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf
squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face. “Professor
Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir!”</p>
<p>He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the
threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot
and fluttered onto the arm of Harry’s chair.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Dobby!” said Harry, stroking Hedwig’s head and blinking
hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream. . . .
It had been very vivid. . . . Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the
elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his
feet looked far too big for his body.</p>
<p>“Er . . . have you been taking all the clothes Hermione’s been
leaving out?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been taking some for
Winky too, sir.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, how is Winky?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>Dobby’s ears drooped slightly.</p>
<p>“Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous
round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. “She still does not
care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of
them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks
hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all
himself, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet
Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!” Dobby sank into a
deep bow again. “But Harry Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby went on,
straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry. “Dobby heard him
muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having bad dreams?”</p>
<p>“Not really bad,” said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. “I’ve had
worse.”</p>
<p>The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. Then he said
very seriously, his ears drooping, “Dobby wishes he could help Harry
Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier
now . . .”</p>
<p>Harry smiled.</p>
<p>“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer . . .”</p>
<p>He bent and picked up his Potions book. He’d have to try and finish
the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the firelight
illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand — the result of
his detention with Umbridge.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me, Dobby,” said
Harry slowly.</p>
<p>The elf looked around, beaming.</p>
<p>“Name it, Harry Potter, sir!”</p>
<p>“I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice
Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the
teachers. Especially,” Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the
scars shone pearly white, “Professor Umbridge.”</p>
<p>He expected the elf’s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected
him to say that this was impossible, or else that he would try, but his
hopes were not high. . . . What he had not expected was for Dobby to
give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands
together.</p>
<p>“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily. “Dobby heard
tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It
is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of
Requirement!”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Harry curiously.</p>
<p>“Because it is a room that a person can only enter,” said Dobby
seriously, “when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and
sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the
seeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping his
voice and looking guilty, “when Winky has been very drunk. He has hidden
her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer
there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it
off, sir. . . . And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning
materials there when he has run short, sir, and —”</p>
<p>“— and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, suddenly
remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous
Christmas, “would it fill itself with chamber pots?”</p>
<p>“Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding earnestly. “It is a most
amazing room, sir.”</p>
<p>“How many people know about it?” said Harry, sitting up straighter in
his chair.</p>
<p>“Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it,
sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it
is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.”</p>
<p>“It sounds brilliant,” said Harry, his heart racing. “It sounds
perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?”</p>
<p>“Anytime, Harry Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking delighted at
Harry’s enthusiasm. “We could go now, if you like!”</p>
<p>For a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was halfway out of his
seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not
for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione’s whispered in his
ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, and he was exhausted.</p>
<p>“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his
chair. “This is really important. . . . I don’t want to blow it, it’ll
need proper planning. . . . Listen, can you just tell me exactly where
this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there?”</p>
<p>Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across
the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could hardly
hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops
hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon’s Care of
Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept
grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense
relief, Angelina sought out her team at lunch to tell them that
Quidditch practice was canceled.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Harry quietly, when she told him, “because we’ve found
somewhere to have our first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight o’clock,
seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed
by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?”</p>
<p>She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others;
Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked up to
take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him.</p>
<p>“What?” he said thickly.</p>
<p>“Well . . . it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe.
Don’t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?”</p>
<p>“This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore knows
about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s expression cleared.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore told you about it?”</p>
<p>“Just in passing,” said Harry, shrugging.</p>
<p>“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said Hermione briskly and she
raised no more objections.</p>
<p>Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those
people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog’s Head and
telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry’s
disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her
friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the
news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had
turned up in the Hog’s Head.</p>
<p>At half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the Gryffindor
common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his
hand. Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine
o’clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they
made their way up to the seventh floor.</p>
<p>“Hold it,” said Harry warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment at
the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand, and muttering,
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”</p>
<p>A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment.
Tiny black moving dots, labeled with names, showed where various people
were.</p>
<p>“Filch is on the second floor,” said Harry, holding the map close to
his eyes and scanning it closely, “and Mrs. Norris is on the
fourth.”</p>
<p>“And Umbridge?” said Hermione anxiously.</p>
<p>“In her office,” said Harry, pointing. “Okay, let’s go.”</p>
<p>They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to
Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting
Barnabas the Barmy’s foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his
relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch. “Dobby said
to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we
need.”</p>
<p>They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank
stretch of wall, then at the man-size vase on its other side. Ron had
screwed up his eyes in concentration, Hermione was whispering something
under her breath, Harry’s fists were clenched as he stared ahead of
him.</p>
<p>We need somewhere to learn to fight. . . . he thought. Just give us a
place to practice . . . somewhere they can’t find us . . .</p>
<p>“Harry,” said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their
third walk past.</p>
<p>A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at
it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle,
pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with
flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors
below.</p>
<p>The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs
there were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far
end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes,
Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had
hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody’s office.</p>
<p>“These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning,” said Ron
enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.</p>
<p>“And just look at these books!” said Hermione excitedly, running a
finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. “A Compendium
of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts
Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .” She looked
around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of
hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were
doing was right. “Harry, this is wonderful, there’s everything we need
here!”</p>
<p>And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its
shelf, sank onto the nearest cushion, and began to read.</p>
<p>There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked around; Ginny,
Neville, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean had arrived.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” said Dean, staring around, impressed. “What is this
place?”</p>
<p>Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had
arrived, and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o’clock
arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and
turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly
loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully
marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Harry, slightly nervously. “This is the place we’ve
found for practices, and you’ve — er — obviously found it okay —”</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic!” said Cho, and several people murmured their
agreement.</p>
<p>“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning around at it. “We once hid from
Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then .
. .”</p>
<p>“Hey, Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean from the rear of the
room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.</p>
<p>“Dark Detectors,” said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach
them. “Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around,
but you don’t want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled . .
.”</p>
<p>He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures
were moving around inside it, though none was recognizable. He turned
his back on it.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do
first and — er —” He noticed a raised hand. “What, Hermione?”</p>
<p>“I think we ought to elect a leader,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Harry’s leader,” said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she
were mad, and Harry’s stomach did yet another back flip.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,” said Hermione,
unperturbed. “It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So —
everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?”</p>
<p>Everybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it
very halfheartedly.</p>
<p>“Er — right, thanks,” said Harry, who could feel his face burning.
“And — what, Hermione?”</p>
<p>“I also think we ought to have a name,” she said brightly, her hand
still in the air. “It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity,
don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?” said Angelina hopefully.</p>
<p>“Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?” suggested Fred.</p>
<p>“I was thinking,” said Hermione, frowning at Fred, “more of a name
that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it
safely outside meetings.”</p>
<p>“The Defense Association?” said Cho. “The D.A. for short, so nobody
knows what we’re talking about?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the D.A.’s good,” said Ginny. “Only let’s make it stand for
Dumbledore’s Army because that’s the Ministry’s worst fear, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at
this.</p>
<p>“All in favor of the D.A.?” said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her
cushion to count. “That’s a majority — motion passed!”</p>
<p>She pinned the piece of paper with all of their names on it on the
wall and wrote DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY across the top in large letters.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry, when she had sat down again, “shall we get
practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is
Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic
but I’ve found it really useful —”</p>
<p>“Oh please,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his
arms. “I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against
You-Know-Who, do you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life
last June.”</p>
<p>Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very
quiet.</p>
<p>“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all
those eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and
practice.”</p>
<p>It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as
seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided
up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.</p>
<p>“You can practice with me,” Harry told him. “Right — on the count of
three, then — one, two, three —”</p>
<p>The room was suddenly full of shouts of “Expelliarmus!”: Wands flew
in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them
flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went
spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and
landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved
it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around he thought he had been right
to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of
shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming
their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backward a few
paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his
wand fly out of his hand.</p>
<p>“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I
DID IT!”</p>
<p>“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that
in a real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring
in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side.
“Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and
Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the
rest are doing?”</p>
<p>Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth to disarm
Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony
did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for
the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet
from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye.
“Couldn’t resist . . .”</p>
<p>Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was
doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to
jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving
his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were
enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books
leaping off the shelves around them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy,
occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his
hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.</p>
<p>“Okay, stop!” Harry shouted. “Stop! STOP!”</p>
<p>I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on
top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone
lowered their wands.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but there’s definite room for
improvement.” Zacharias Smith glared at him. “Let’s try again . . .”</p>
<p>He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make
suggestions. Slowly the general performance improved. He avoided going
near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking twice around
every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any
longer.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached. “Expelliarmious! I
mean, Expellimellius! I — oh, sorry, Marietta!”</p>
<p>Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta
extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was
his fault.</p>
<p>“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” Cho told
Harry ruefully.</p>
<p>“That was quite good,” Harry lied, but when she raised her eyebrows
he said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I
was watching from over there . . .”</p>
<p>She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and
turned away.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind her,” Cho muttered. “She doesn’t really want to be here
but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do
anything that might upset Umbridge, you see — her mum works for the
Ministry.”</p>
<p>“What about your parents?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge
too,” said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. “But if they think I’m not
going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric —”</p>
<p>She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell
between them; Terry Boot’s wand went whizzing past Harry’s ear and hit
Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose.</p>
<p>“Well, my father is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!”
said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had
been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley
attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over
his head. “He’s always saying he’d believe anything of Fudge, I mean,
the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he uses
the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he feeds
secretly to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there’s his
Umgubular Slashkilter —”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask,” Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking
puzzled. She giggled.</p>
<p>“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of the room, “have
you checked the time?”</p>
<p>He looked down at his watch and received a shock — it was already ten
past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms
immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being
out-of-bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody stopped shouting,
“Expelliarmus!” and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor.</p>
<p>“Well, that was pretty good,” said Harry, “but we’ve overrun, we’d
better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?”</p>
<p>“Sooner!” said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in
agreement.</p>
<p>Angelina, however, said quickly, “The Quidditch season’s about to
start, we need team practices too!”</p>
<p>“Let’s say next Wednesday night, then,” said Harry, “and we can
decide on additional meetings then. . . . Come on, we’d better get going
. . .”</p>
<p>He pulled out the Marauder’s Map again and checked it carefully for
signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in threes
and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned
safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor
that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west
side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the
seventh floor and the Fat Lady’s portrait.</p>
<p>“That was really, really good, Harry,” said Hermione, when finally it
was just her, Harry, and Ron left.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the
door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. “Did you see me
disarm Hermione, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Only once,” said Hermione, stung. “I got you loads more than you got
me —”</p>
<p>“I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times —”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re counting the one where you tripped over your own
feet and knocked the wand out of my hand —”</p>
<p>They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not
listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder’s Map, but he was also
thinking of how Cho had said he made her nervous. . . .</p>
