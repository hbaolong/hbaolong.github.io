<h4 id="chapter-two">CHAPTER TWO</h4>
<p>SPINNER’S END</p>
<p>M any miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime
Minister’s windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between
overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disused
mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the
whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox
that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip
wrappings in the tall grass.</p>
<p>But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out
of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed
upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings
for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long
cloak rustling over the grass.</p>
<p>With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the
undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a
flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground,
dead.</p>
<p>The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.</p>
<p>“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from under the hood.
“I thought perhaps an Auror — Cissy, wait!”</p>
<p>But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light,
was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.</p>
<p>“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me —”</p>
<p>The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other
wrenched it away.</p>
<p>“Go back, Bella!”</p>
<p>“You must listen to me!”</p>
<p>“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!”</p>
<p>The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of
old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The
other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking
across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their
windows dull and blind in the darkness.</p>
<p>“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. “Here? In this
Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot
—”</p>
<p>But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the
rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.</p>
<p>“Cissy, wait!”</p>
<p>Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting
through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical
street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running
between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with
her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in
catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each
other.</p>
<p>“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him —”</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord is . . . I believe . . . mistaken,” Bella panted, and
her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to
check that they were indeed alone. “In any case, we were told not to
speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord’s
—”</p>
<p>“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath
her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other’s face. Bella merely
laughed.</p>
<p>“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t —”</p>
<p>“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa breathed, a note
of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife,
there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister’s arm as
though burned.</p>
<p>“Narcissa!”</p>
<p>But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed
again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted
labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named
Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like
a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she
passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last
house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs
room.</p>
<p>She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath,
had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing
in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night
breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it
opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a
man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and
black eyes.</p>
<p>Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to
shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave
her the look of a drowned person.</p>
<p>“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that
the light fell upon her and her sister too. “What a pleasant
surprise!”</p>
<p>“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I speak to you? It’s
urgent.”</p>
<p>“But of course.”</p>
<p>He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her
still-hooded sister followed without invitation.</p>
<p>“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him.</p>
<p>“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly
mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.</p>
<p>They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the
feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in
books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare
sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a
pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling.
The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually
inhabited.</p>
<p>Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it
aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in
her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was
fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her
gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.</p>
<p>“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling himself in the
armchair opposite the two sisters.</p>
<p>“We . . . we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not counting
vermin, are we?”</p>
<p>He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang,
a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small
man stood frozen.</p>
<p>“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,” said Snape
lazily.</p>
<p>The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into
the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an
unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked
as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.</p>
<p>“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix! How charming
—”</p>
<p>“Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said Snape. “And
then he will return to his bedroom.”</p>
<p>Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.</p>
<p>“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding Snape’s eye.</p>
<p>“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you
here to assist me.”</p>
<p>“To assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean your
house!”</p>
<p>“I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous
assignments,” said Snape silkily. “This can be easily arranged: I shall
speak to the Dark Lord —”</p>
<p>“I can speak to him myself if I want to!”</p>
<p>“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the meantime,
bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do.”</p>
<p>Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue,
but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard
banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a
dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the
rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the
book-covered door behind him.</p>
<p>Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of
them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst
Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did not
seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and draining it.</p>
<p>The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa
took her second drink she said in a rush, “Severus, I’m sorry to come
here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who
can help me —”</p>
<p>Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the
concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed
by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.</p>
<p>“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to listening at
doors, I don’t know what he means by it. . . . You were saying,
Narcissa?”</p>
<p>She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.</p>
<p>“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say
nothing to anyone, but —”</p>
<p>“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled Bellatrix.
“Particularly in present company!”</p>
<p>“‘Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically. “And what am I to
understand by that, Bellatrix?”</p>
<p>“That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!”</p>
<p>Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered
her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat
back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into
Bellatrix’s glowering face.</p>
<p>“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to
say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,”
said Snape. “Why is it that you do not trust me?”</p>
<p>“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly, striding out from behind the
sofa to slam her glass upon the table. “Where to start! Where were you
when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him
when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you’ve
lived in Dumbledore’s pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring
the Sorcerer’s Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord
was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve
the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still
alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?”</p>
<p>She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in
her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden
in her hands.</p>
<p>Snape smiled.</p>
<p>“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You
can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and
carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you,
I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark
Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you
really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I
would be sitting here talking to you?”</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>“I know he believes you, but . . .”</p>
<p>“You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him?
Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished
Legilimens the world has ever seen?”</p>
<p>Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little
discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink
again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when the Dark Lord
fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus
Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord’s orders
that I took up the post?”</p>
<p>She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape
forestalled her.</p>
<p>“You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the
same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius” — he
inclined his head slightly to Narcissa — “and many others did not
attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I
was wrong, but there it is. . . . If he had not forgiven we who lost
faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.”</p>
<p>“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately. “I, who spent many years
in Azkaban for him!”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored voice. “Of
course, you weren’t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was
undoubtedly fine —”</p>
<p>“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. “While
I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing
Dumbledore’s pet!”</p>
<p>“Not quite,” said Snape calmly. “He wouldn’t give me the Defense
Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring
about a relapse . . . tempt me into my old ways.”</p>
<p>“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your
favorite subject?” she jeered. “Why did you stay there all that time,
Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?”</p>
<p>“Hardly,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never
deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to
give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present
than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is. . . .”</p>
<p>“But you stayed —”</p>
<p>“Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint of
impatience for the first time. “I had a comfortable job that I preferred
to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know.
Dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and
I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I
do not see why you do.</p>
<p>“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a little more
loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, “why I stood
between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer’s Stone. That is easily answered.
He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I
had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore’s stooge. He was in a
pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He
did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him
over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not
trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was,
I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone
and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose
of medicine.</p>
<p>“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t fly back to him
at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn —”</p>
<p>“Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledore’s
orders.”</p>
<p>“On Dumbledore’s — ?” she began, in tones of outrage.</p>
<p>“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By waiting two hours,
just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By
allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark
Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass
information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since!
Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months.
I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had
plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move,
to escape like Karkaroff, didn’t I?</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished
entirely, I assure you, when I explained that I remained faithful,
although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought
that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.”</p>
<p>“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix. “What useful
information have we had from you?”</p>
<p>“My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,” said
Snape. “If he chooses not to share it with you —”</p>
<p>“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing up at once.
“He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful —”</p>
<p>“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his
disbelief. “Does he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?”</p>
<p>“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The Dark Lord
has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious — if Lucius hadn’t
—”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!” said Narcissa, in
a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.</p>
<p>“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape smoothly. “What is
done, is done.”</p>
<p>“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you were once again
absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?”</p>
<p>“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. “Perhaps you disagree
with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have
noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order
of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak of dangers . . . you were
facing six teenagers, were you not?”</p>
<p>“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before
long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while we are on the subject of the
Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their
headquarters, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the place.
You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is
satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order. It led,
as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of
Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though
I give you full credit for finishing him off.”</p>
<p>He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not
soften.</p>
<p>“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could
have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done
it. Why?”</p>
<p>“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” asked Snape.</p>
<p>“He . . . lately, we . . . I am asking you, Snape!”</p>
<p>“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used
his blood to regenerate, making him invincible —”</p>
<p>“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered.</p>
<p>“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already
confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to
explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least
until a year ago. . . .”</p>
<p>“But why did you keep him alive?”</p>
<p>“Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore’s protection that
was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his
favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to
it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at
Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors
that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived
the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lord’s old followers
thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once
more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him
the moment he set foot in the castle.</p>
<p>“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no
extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of
tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented
friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and
self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to
have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs,
but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have
been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.”</p>
<p>“And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never
suspected you?” asked Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your true
allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?”</p>
<p>“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you overlook
Dumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I
spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from
my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms — though, as I
say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help.
Dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had
made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to
say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark
Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury
because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all
these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein
lies my great value to the Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best
to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to
her sister.</p>
<p>“Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?”</p>
<p>Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.</p>
<p>“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who can help me, I
have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her
eyelids.</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” Narcissa continued,
her eyes still closed. “He wishes none to know of the plan. It is . . .
very secret. But —”</p>
<p>“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said Snape at once.
“The Dark Lord’s word is law.”</p>
<p>Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water.
Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the
house.</p>
<p>“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even Snape says so:
You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!”</p>
<p>But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window,
peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them
again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.</p>
<p>“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a low voice. “I
am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been
in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great
treachery to the Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, breathing more
freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. . . .”</p>
<p>“You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of
satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. “You know?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you require, Narcissa? If
you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am
afraid there is no hope, none at all.”</p>
<p>“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. “My son
. . . my only son . . .”</p>
<p>“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. “The Dark Lord
is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: He isn’t
shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove
himself, excited at the prospect —”</p>
<p>Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while
at Snape.</p>
<p>“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store!
Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for
Lucius’s mistake, I know it!”</p>
<p>Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as
though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.</p>
<p>“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she persisted. “To punish
Lucius?”</p>
<p>“If Draco succeeds,” said Snape, still looking away from her, “he
will be honored above all others.”</p>
<p>“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can he, when the Dark
Lord himself — ?”</p>
<p>Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.</p>
<p>“I only meant . . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus . .
. please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco’s favorite teacher.
. . . You are Lucius’s old friend. . . . I beg you. . . . You are the
Dark Lord’s favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to
him, persuade him — ?”</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to
attempt it,” said Snape flatly. “I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is
not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got
himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the
prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very
angry indeed.”</p>
<p>“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” choked Narcissa.
“He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!”</p>
<p>When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little
self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape
and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears
falling onto his chest, she gasped, “You could do it. You could do it
instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and
he would reward you beyond all of us —”</p>
<p>Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands.
Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, “He intends me
to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try
first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be
able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as
spy.”</p>
<p>“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is killed!”</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape quietly. “He failed to
hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not
forgive easily.”</p>
<p>She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the
floor.</p>
<p>“My only son . . . my only son . . .”</p>
<p>“You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly. “If I had sons, I
would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!”</p>
<p>Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long
blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, and
steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced
the glass into her hand.</p>
<p>“Narcissa, that’s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.”</p>
<p>She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky
sip.</p>
<p>“It might be possible . . . for me to help Draco.”</p>
<p>She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.</p>
<p>“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? Would you look after
him, see he comes to no harm?”</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off
the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape’s feet, seized his hand in
both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.</p>
<p>“If you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it?
Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?”</p>
<p>“The Unbreakable Vow?”</p>
<p>Snape’s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out
a cackle of triumphant laughter.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he’ll try, I’m sure. . . . The
usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action . . . oh, on the
Dark Lord’s orders, of course!”</p>
<p>Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon
Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his
hand.</p>
<p>“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,” he said
quietly. “Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix’s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was
kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrix’s astonished gaze, they
grasped right hands.</p>
<p>“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape coldly.</p>
<p>She drew it, still looking astonished.</p>
<p>“And you will need to move a little closer,” he said.</p>
<p>She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip
of her wand on their linked hands.</p>
<p>Narcissa spoke.</p>
<p>“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to
fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?”</p>
<p>“I will,” said Snape.</p>
<p>A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its
way around their hands like a red-hot wire.</p>
<p>“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from
harm?”</p>
<p>“I will,” said Snape.</p>
<p>A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the
first, making a fine, glowing chain.</p>
<p>“And, should it prove necessary . . . if it seems Draco will fail . .
.” whispered Narcissa (Snape’s hand twitched within hers, but he did not
draw away), “will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered
Draco to perform?”</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their
clasped hands, her eyes wide.</p>
<p>“I will,” said Snape.</p>
<p>Bellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue
of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound
itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery
snake.</p>
