<h4 id="chapter-twelve">CHAPTER TWELVE</h4>
<p>PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE</p>
<p>Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory
before Harry had even put on his socks.</p>
<p>“Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me
too long?” asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped out
of sight.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag
onto his shoulder. “He’s just . . .” But apparently he was unable to say
exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him
out of the room.</p>
<p>Neville and Ron both gave Harry it’s-his-problem-not-yours looks, but
Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this was he going to have
to take?</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up
with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed
toward breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s sake.”</p>
<p>She was staring at the common room notice board, where a large new
sign had been put up.</p>
<p>GALLONS OF GALLEONS!</p>
<p>Pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings?</p>
<p>Like to earn a little extra gold?</p>
<p>Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room, for simple,
part-time, virtually painless jobs</p>
<p>(WE REGRET THAT ALL WORK IS UNDERTAKEN AT APPLICANT’S OWN RISK)</p>
<p>“They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign,
which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of the
first Hogsmeade weekend in October. “We’ll have to talk to them,
Ron.”</p>
<p>Ron looked positively alarmed.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they climbed out through
the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!”</p>
<p>Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the
prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was
not one that he found inviting.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked down a
flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of
whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. “You look
really angry about something.”</p>
<p>“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know-Who,” said Ron
succinctly, when Harry did not respond.</p>
<p>Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf,
sighed.</p>
<p>“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a
lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?” Harry said loudly.</p>
<p>“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth
shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped
jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t
noticed, we’re on your side.”</p>
<p>There was a short pause.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice.</p>
<p>“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook
her head. “Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the end-of-term
feast last year?”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed
again.</p>
<p>“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and
enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong
bond of friendship and trust —’”</p>
<p>“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her in
admiration.</p>
<p>“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity.</p>
<p>“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what —”</p>
<p>“The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing
is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s only been
back two months, and we’ve started fighting among ourselves. And the
Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together, be united —”</p>
<p>“And Harry said it last night,” retorted Ron, “if that means we’re
supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.”</p>
<p>“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of inter-House
unity,” said Hermione crossly.</p>
<p>They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of
fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight
of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he
might attack stragglers.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like
that,” said Harry sarcastically.</p>
<p>They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking
instinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor
Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher,
and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted
ceiling above them echoed Harry’s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud
gray.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman’s
staying,” he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor
table.</p>
<p>“Maybe . . .” said Hermione thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“What?” said both Harry and Ron together.</p>
<p>“Well . . . maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not
being here.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said Ron, half laughing.
“How could we not notice?”</p>
<p>Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided
hair had marched up to Harry.</p>
<p>“Hi, Angelina.”</p>
<p>“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an
answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.”</p>
<p>“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina’s pep
talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been, which could
only be an improvement.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on
Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then
we can see how the new person’ll fit in.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry, and she smiled at him and departed.</p>
<p>“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely, sitting down
beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. “I suppose that will
make quite a difference to the team?”</p>
<p>“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good
Keeper . . .”</p>
<p>“Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron.</p>
<p>With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through
the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters
and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with
droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was
nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only
correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new
to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however, had
to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn
owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.</p>
<p>“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry irritably, thinking
of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s
leg and it took off again. “I’m not bothering . . . load of
rubbish.”</p>
<p>“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione darkly,
and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging
until Harry and Ron had finished eating.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it
down by her plate. “Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out
schedules.</p>
<p>“Look at today!” groaned Ron. “History of Magic, double Potions,
Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape,
Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and
George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted . . .”</p>
<p>“Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and
squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. “Hogwarts prefects surely don’t
wish to skive off lessons?”</p>
<p>“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his schedule
under Fred’s nose. “That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>“Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the column. “You can
have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.”</p>
<p>“Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Because you’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven’t got an
antidote yet,” said George, helping himself to a kipper.</p>
<p>“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think I’ll
take the lessons.”</p>
<p>“And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said Hermione, eyeing Fred
and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor
notice board.”</p>
<p>“Says who?” said George, looking astonished.</p>
<p>“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.”</p>
<p>“Leave me out of it,” said Ron hastily.</p>
<p>Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.</p>
<p>“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said
Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. “You’re starting your fifth year,
you’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.”</p>
<p>“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?”
asked Hermione.</p>
<p>“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keeping
your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said Fred
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said
George happily. “Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept coming
over faint . . .”</p>
<p>“Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember?” said Fred
reminiscently.</p>
<p>“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,” said
George.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d forgotten. . . . Hard to keep
track sometimes, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,” said George. “If you
care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spirits
up somehow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “But we feel our futures lie outside
the world of academic achievement.”</p>
<p>“We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for
our seventh year,” said George brightly, “now that we’ve got —”</p>
<p>He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been
about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.</p>
<p>“— now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said hastily. “I mean, do
we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we didn’t think Mum could take us leaving
school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s biggest
prat.”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to waste our last year here, though,” said Fred,
looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. “We’re going to use it
to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average
Hogwarts student requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the
results of our research, and then produce the products to fit the
demand.”</p>
<p>“But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?” asked
Hermione skeptically. “You’re going to need all the ingredients and
materials — and premises too, I suppose . . .”</p>
<p>Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately
dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say
overhead, “Ask us no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione.
C’mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few
Extendable Ears before Herbology.”</p>
<p>Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking
away, each carrying a stack of toast.</p>
<p>“What did that mean?” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. “‘Ask
us no questions . . .’ Does that mean they’ve already got some gold to
start a joke shop?”</p>
<p>“You know, I’ve been wondering about that,” said Ron, his brow
furrowed. “They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I
couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons . . .”</p>
<p>Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these
dangerous waters.</p>
<p>“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because
of the exams?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really
important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get
career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what
N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.”</p>
<p>“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked the
other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off
toward their History of Magic classroom.</p>
<p>“Not really,” said Ron slowly. “Except . . . well . . .”</p>
<p>He looked slightly sheepish.</p>
<p>“What?” Harry urged him.</p>
<p>“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an offhand
voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently.</p>
<p>“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron. “You’ve got to be really
good. What about you, Hermione?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I think I’d really like to do
something worthwhile.”</p>
<p>“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing,” said Hermione
thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.</p>
<p>History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever
devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a
wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe
drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied the
form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took
notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron had so far
managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione’s
notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power
of Binns’s voice.</p>
<p>Today they suffered three-quarters of an hour’s droning on the
subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten
minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject
might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and
he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner
of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of
the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom
for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused to
lend you my notes this year?”</p>
<p>“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your
conscience, Hermione . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even try to listen
to him, do you?”</p>
<p>“We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your brains or your
memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are — is it
nice to rub it in?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked
slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.</p>
<p>A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in
huddles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony,
turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air
and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson
of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be
something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a
two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward
them.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harry!”</p>
<p>It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again. This
was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling
girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask
her to the Yule Ball.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you’re not
covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be
thinking along the same lines.</p>
<p>“You got that stuff off, then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last
meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. “So did you . . . er . . .
have a good summer?”</p>
<p>The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been
Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her
holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry’s. . . . Something
seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all right, you
know . . .”</p>
<p>“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron demanded suddenly, pointing at the
front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double
gold T was pinned. “You don’t support them, do you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do,” said Cho.</p>
<p>“Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning
the league?” said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily
accusatory tone of voice.</p>
<p>“I’ve supported them since I was six,” said Cho coolly. “Anyway . . .
see you, Harry.”</p>
<p>She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the
courtyard before rounding on Ron.</p>
<p>“You are so tactless!”</p>
<p>“What? I only asked her if —”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?”</p>
<p>“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —”</p>
<p>“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team
for?”</p>
<p>“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —”</p>
<p>“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only
bought them last season —”</p>
<p>“But what does it matter?”</p>
<p>“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the
bandwagon —”</p>
<p>“That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione
were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the
way down to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect
that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes’
conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to
leave the country.</p>
<p>And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside
Snape’s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn’t
she? She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry
for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she
was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she
thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for
Cedric’s death. . . . Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to
him, and that made the second time in two days . . . and at this
thought, Harry’s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dungeon
door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that
seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom behind
Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back,
ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.</p>
<p>“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p>There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class
had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped.
Snape’s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s
silence.</p>
<p>“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, sweeping over to his
desk and staring around at them all, “I think it appropriate to remind
you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during
which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and
use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly
are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in your O.W.L., or suffer my
. . . displeasure.”</p>
<p>His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.</p>
<p>“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with
me,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions
class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying
good-bye.”</p>
<p>His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back,
feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up
Potions after fifth year.</p>
<p>“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of
farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt
N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon
maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L.
students.</p>
<p>“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and
soothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the
ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes
irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you
are doing.” On Harry’s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her
expression one of the utmost attentiveness. “The ingredients and method”
— Snape flicked his wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they appeared
there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his wand again
— “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cupboard sprang open)
— “you have an hour and a half. . . . Start.”</p>
<p>Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly
have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be
added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the
mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in
clockwise, then in counterclockwise directions; the heat of the flames
on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level
for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was
added.</p>
<p>“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called
Snape, with ten minutes left to go.</p>
<p>Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the
dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray
steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prodding
the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they
had gone out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a
shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked down
his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he could find
nothing to criticize. At Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape stopped,
looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk on his face.</p>
<p>“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”</p>
<p>The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they
loved hearing Snape taunt Harry.</p>
<p>“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy laughed.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his
wand.</p>
<p>“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the
instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the
dungeon.</p>
<p>“‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to
simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of
hellebore.’”</p>
<p>His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had
proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing
his potion to simmer for seven minutes.</p>
<p>“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry very quietly.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore . . .”</p>
<p>“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly
worthless. Evanesco.”</p>
<p>The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing
foolishly beside an empty cauldron.</p>
<p>“Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one
flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name,
and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework: twelve
inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in
potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”</p>
<p>While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away
his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron’s, which was
now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had achieved
the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now having to
gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving
zero marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand back into his bag and
slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape’s
desk with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the bell rang,
Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by
the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall. The ceiling had
turned an even murkier gray during the morning. Rain was lashing the
high windows.</p>
<p>“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, sitting down
next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd’s pie. “Your potion wasn’t
nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole thing
shattered and set his robes on fire.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glowering at his plate, “since when has
Snape ever been fair to me?”</p>
<p>Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and
Harry’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set
foot in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“I did think he might be a bit better this year,” said Hermione in a
disappointed voice. “I mean . . . you know . . .” She looked carefully
around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and
nobody was passing the table. “. . . Now he’s in the Order and
everything.”</p>
<p>“Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said Ron sagely.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape,
where’s the evidence he ever really stopped working for
You-Know-Who?”</p>
<p>“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he
doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his
mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and
offended. “Can’t you give it a rest?” he said. “You’re always having a
go at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his shepherd’s
pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting
there.</p>
<p>He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many
students hurrying toward lunch. The anger that had just flared so
unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and
Hermione’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.
Serve them right, he thought. Why can’t they give it a rest? . . .
Bickering all the time . . . It’s enough to drive anyone up the wall. .
. .</p>
<p>He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing;
Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who
ignored him.</p>
<p>“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cadogan
in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on,
and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a
neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and
angry-looking wolfhound.</p>
<p>Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the
trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently he was the first to
ascend the silver ladder that led to Sybill Trelawney’s classroom when
the bell rang.</p>
<p>Divination was Harry’s least favorite class after Potions, which was
due mainly to Professor Trelawney’s habit of predicting his premature
death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and
glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind
of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was busy
putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the spindly
little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the
room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and
the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not to notice him
as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the
next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked around
carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or as directly as he
could while having to wend his way between tables, chairs, and
overstuffed poufs.</p>
<p>“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down beside
Harry.</p>
<p>“Good,” grunted Harry.</p>
<p>“But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking
out your temper on us,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“I’m not —”</p>
<p>“I’m just passing on the message,” said Ron, talking over him. “But I
reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat
you.”</p>
<p>“I never said it —”</p>
<p>“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy
voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of
himself again. “And welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been
following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am
delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely — as, of
course, I knew you would.</p>
<p>“You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle,
by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of
divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your
O.W.L. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are
of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of
divination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter
very little. However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination,
so . . .”</p>
<p>Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that
Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as
examinations.</p>
<p>“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on
the matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use The
Dream Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry
on.”</p>
<p>The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a
double period. By the time they had all finished reading the
introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream
interpretation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up
with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of a
nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s
best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.</p>
<p>“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron. “You say one.”</p>
<p>“You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently.</p>
<p>He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly
well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need
Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him that.
. . .</p>
<p>“Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,” said
Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. “What d’you reckon
that means?”</p>
<p>“Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or
something,” said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without
interest.</p>
<p>It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and
Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of
keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he
and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.</p>
<p>“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already? Binns set us a
foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use
of moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from Trelawney!
Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were they? That
Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . .”</p>
<p>When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom they
found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk, wearing
the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on
top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly
perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.</p>
<p>The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was,
as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a
disciplinarian she was likely to be.</p>
<p>“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had sat
down.</p>
<p>A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply.</p>
<p>“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “That won’t do, now, will it? I
should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’
One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!”</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her.</p>
<p>“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. “That wasn’t too
difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.”</p>
<p>Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away” had
never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry
shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink, and
parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own
wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard
sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:</p>
<p>Defense Against the Dark Arts</p>
<p>A Return to Basic Principles</p>
<p>“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted
and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face
the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. “The constant
changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any
Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being
far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year.</p>
<p>“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to
be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured,
theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year.
Copy down the following, please.”</p>
<p>She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was
replaced by:</p>
<p>Course aims:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can
legally be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical
use.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching
quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge’s
three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of Defensive
Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”</p>
<p>There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. “When I ask
you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Umbridge,’ or
‘No, Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive
Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to page
five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need
to talk.”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the
chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy
toad’s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical
Theory and started to read.</p>
<p>It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor
Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read
the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first
few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was
absentmindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring
at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise
to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of
Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge
with her hand in the air.</p>
<p>Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when
instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that
came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she merely
shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer
questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking
just as resolutely in another direction.</p>
<p>After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the
only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read
was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch
Hermione’s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye than to
struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.”</p>
<p>When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at
their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore
the situation no longer.</p>
<p>“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she asked
Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.</p>
<p>“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing her
small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with them
at the end of class.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“And your name is — ?”</p>
<p>“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if
you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice of
determined sweetness.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written up
there about using defensive spells.”</p>
<p>There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned
their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the
blackboard.</p>
<p>“Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little
laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that
would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely
aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.</p>
<p>“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class,
Mr. — ?”</p>
<p>“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on
him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”</p>
<p>“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked
Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.</p>
<p>“No, but —”</p>
<p>“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the
‘whole point’ of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you
have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about
defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —”</p>
<p>“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked
it won’t be in a —”</p>
<p>“Hand, Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge.</p>
<p>Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned
away from him again, but now several other people had their hands up
too.</p>
<p>“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.</p>
<p>“Dean Thomas.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Thomas?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to
be attacked, it won’t be risk-free —”</p>
<p>“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating
fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”</p>
<p>“No, but —”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge talked over him.</p>
<p>“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this
school,” she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, “but
you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class,
very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty little
laugh, “extremely dangerous half-breeds.”</p>
<p>“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily, “he was
the best we ever —”</p>
<p>“Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced to
spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and
potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are
likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”</p>
<p>“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —”</p>
<p>“Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!”</p>
<p>Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from
her.</p>
<p>“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed
illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”</p>
<p>“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas
hotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads —”</p>
<p>“Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!” trilled Professor Umbridge. “Now,
it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more
than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all,
is what school is all about. And your name is?” she added, staring at
Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.</p>
<p>“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense
Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can
actually do the countercurses and things?”</p>
<p>“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no
reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully
controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge
dismissively.</p>
<p>“Without ever practicing them before?” said Parvati incredulously.
“Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will
be during our exam?”</p>
<p>“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough —”</p>
<p>“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry
loudly, his fist in the air again.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge looked up.</p>
<p>“This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,” she said
softly.</p>
<p>“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out
there?”</p>
<p>“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling
just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.</p>
<p>“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?”
inquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.</p>
<p>“Hmm, let’s think . . .” said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice,
“maybe Lord Voldemort?”</p>
<p>Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped
sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She
was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”</p>
<p>The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either
Umbridge or Harry.</p>
<p>“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her
stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk.</p>
<p>“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the
dead —”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angrily, “but yeah, he’s returned!”</p>
<p>“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,”
said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him. “As I was
saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large
once again. This is a lie.”</p>
<p>“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!”</p>
<p>“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge triumphantly.
“Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The
Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark
wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside
class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark
wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your
friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five,
‘Basics for Beginners.’”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry, however,
stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-scared,
half-fascinated.</p>
<p>“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his
sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.</p>
<p>“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord,
did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.</p>
<p>There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of
them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what
had happened on the night that Cedric had died. They stared avidly from
Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at
him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly.</p>
<p>“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had
hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly
listening classmates. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a moment he thought
she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, most
sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.”</p>
<p>He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to
the teacher’s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its
breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her
handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of
ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see
what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she rolled up
the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly
so that he could not open it.</p>
<p>“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Umbridge,
holding out the note to him.</p>
<p>He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even
looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the classroom door shut
behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to
McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap
into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man floating on his
back in midair, juggling several inkwells.</p>
<p>“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the
inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the
walls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.</p>
<p>“Get out of it, Peeves.”</p>
<p>“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry along
the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. “What is it this
time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in”
— Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — “tongues?”</p>
<p>“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the nearest
flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back
beside him.</p>
<p>“Oh, most think he’s barking, the Potty wee lad,</p>
<p>But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad,</p>
<p>But Peevesy knows better and says that he’s mad —”</p>
<p>“SHUT UP!”</p>
<p>A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from
her office looking grim and slightly harassed.</p>
<p>“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as
Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. “Why aren’t you in
class?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly.</p>
<p>“Sent? What do you mean, sent?”</p>
<p>He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall
took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand,
stretched it out, and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side
behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written,
and with each line they became narrower.</p>
<p>“Come in here, Potter.”</p>
<p>He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically
behind him.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. “Is this
true?”</p>
<p>“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had
intended. “Professor?” he added in an attempt to sound more polite.</p>
<p>“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“You called her a liar?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry.
Then she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.”</p>
<p>“Have — what?”</p>
<p>“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin
of cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And
sit down.”</p>
<p>There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned
by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the
Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and helped
himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as
he had done on that occasion.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s note and looked
very seriously at Harry.</p>
<p>“Potter, you need to be careful.”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. Her
tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk,
crisp, and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human
than usual.</p>
<p>“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much more
than House points and a detention.”</p>
<p>“What do you — ?”</p>
<p>“Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor McGonagall, with
an abrupt return to her usual manner. “You know where she comes from,
you must know to whom she is reporting.”</p>
<p>The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came
the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move.</p>
<p>“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week,
starting tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said, looking down at
Umbridge’s note again.</p>
<p>“Every evening this week!” Harry repeated, horrified. “But,
Professor, couldn’t you — ?”</p>
<p>“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly.</p>
<p>“But —”</p>
<p>“She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You
will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one. Just
remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.”</p>
<p>“But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. “Voldemort’s
back, you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is —”</p>
<p>“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straightening
her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used
Voldemort’s name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies?
It’s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!”</p>
<p>She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood
too.</p>
<p>“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at
him.</p>
<p>“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped.</p>
<p>He took one.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” he said grudgingly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-term
feast, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . she said . . . progress will be
prohibited or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic
is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, walked
around her desk, and held open the door for him.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” she
said, pointing him out of her office.</p>
