<h4 id="chapter-twenty">CHAPTER TWENTY</h4>
<p>THE DEMENTOR’S KISS</p>
<p>Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the
way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like
entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting
creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up
by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and
Hermione brought up the rear.</p>
<p>Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron
had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered
with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in
single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after
Sirius, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept
bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression
Sirius was making no effort to prevent this.</p>
<p>“You know what this means?” Sirius said abruptly to Harry as they
made their slow progress along the tunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?”</p>
<p>“You’re free,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yes . . . ,” said Sirius. “But I’m also — I don’t know if anyone
ever told you — I’m your godfather.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . your parents appointed me your guardian,” said Sirius
stiffly. “If anything happened to them . . .”</p>
<p>Harry waited. Did Sirius mean what he thought he meant?</p>
<p>“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and
uncle,” said Sirius. “But . . . well . . . think about it. Once my
name’s cleared . . . if you wanted a . . . a different home . . .”</p>
<p>Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s stomach.</p>
<p>“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a
bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. “Leave the Dursleys?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said Sirius quickly. “I
understand, I just thought I’d —”</p>
<p>“Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Sirius’s.
“Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can
I move in?”</p>
<p>Sirius turned right around to look at him; Snape’s head was scraping
the ceiling but Sirius didn’t seem to care.</p>
<p>“You want to?” he said. “You mean it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.</p>
<p>Sirius’s gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen
upon it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten
years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he
was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry’s parents’
wedding.</p>
<p>They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the
tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to
the knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered
upward without any sound of savaging branches.</p>
<p>Sirius saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and
Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.</p>
<p>The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant
windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still
wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry’s mind was buzzing. He was
going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his
parents’ best friend. . . . He felt dazed. . . . What would happen when
he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they’d seen
on television?</p>
<p>“One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was
still pointed sideways at Pettigrew’s chest.</p>
<p>Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing
slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Sirius, his
chin bumping on his chest. And then —</p>
<p>A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their
party was bathed in moonlight.</p>
<p>Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped
abruptly. Sirius froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione
stop.</p>
<p>Harry could see Lupin’s silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs
began to shake.</p>
<p>“Oh, my —” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his potion tonight! He’s
not safe!”</p>
<p>“Run,” Sirius whispered. “Run. Now.”</p>
<p>But Harry couldn’t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He
leapt forward but Sirius caught him around the chest and threw him
back.</p>
<p>“Leave it to me — RUN!”</p>
<p>There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin’s head was lengthening. So
was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on
his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks’s
hair was on end again; he was backing away —</p>
<p>As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared
from Harry’s side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog
bounded forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle
binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward,
away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping
at each other —</p>
<p>Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to
notice anything else. It was Hermione’s scream that alerted him —</p>
<p>Pettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his
bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light — and Ron lay
motionless on the ground. Another bang — Crookshanks flew into the air
and back to the earth in a heap.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;
Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. “Stay where you
are!” Harry shouted, running forward.</p>
<p>Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip
through the manacle on Ron’s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying
through the grass.</p>
<p>There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the
werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest —</p>
<p>“Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” Harry yelled.</p>
<p>Sirius was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back,
but at Harry’s words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound
of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.</p>
<p>“What did he do to him?” Hermione whispered. Ron’s eyes were only
half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could
hear him breathing, but he didn’t seem to recognize them.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone . . . they
had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in
midair.</p>
<p>“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” said Harry,
pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. “Come —”</p>
<p>But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a
yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. . . .</p>
<p>“Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.</p>
<p>He had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for
Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble —</p>
<p>Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed
to be coming from near the lake. They pelted toward it, and Harry,
running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it must mean
—</p>
<p>The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw
why — Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours,
his hands over his head.</p>
<p>“Nooo,” he moaned. “Noooo . . . please. . . .”</p>
<p>And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them,
gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the
familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his
vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were
encircling them. . . .</p>
<p>“Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled, raising his wand,
blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid
it of the faint screaming that had started inside it —</p>
<p>I’m going to live with my godfather. I’m leaving the Dursleys.</p>
<p>He forced himself to think of Sirius, and only Sirius, and began to
chant: “Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,
pale as death.</p>
<p>He’ll be all right. I’m going to go and live with him.</p>
<p>“Expecto Patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>“Expecto —” Hermione whispered, “Expecto — Expecto —”</p>
<p>But she couldn’t do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten
feet from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and
were getting closer. . . .</p>
<p>“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from
his ears. “EXPECTO PATRONUM!”</p>
<p>A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before
him. At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He
was alone . . . completely alone. . . .</p>
<p>“Expecto — Expecto Patronum —”</p>
<p>Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes.
With a huge effort, he fought to remember — Sirius was innocent —
innocent — We’ll be okay — I’m going to live with him —</p>
<p>“Expecto Patronum!” he gasped.</p>
<p>By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a dementor halt,
very close to him. It couldn’t walk through the cloud of silver mist
Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It
made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.</p>
<p>“No — no —” Harry gasped. “He’s innocent . . . Expecto — Expecto
Patronum —”</p>
<p>He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an
evil wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him.
Then it raised both its rotting hands — and lowered its hood.</p>
<p>Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed
skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth . . .
a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death
rattle.</p>
<p>A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t move or speak.
His Patronus flickered and died.</p>
<p>White fog was blinding him. He had to fight . . . Expecto Patronum .
. . he couldn’t see . . . and in the distance, he heard the familiar
screaming . . . Expecto Patronum . . . he groped in the mist for Sirius,
and found his arm . . . they weren’t going to take him. . . .</p>
<p>But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves
around Harry’s neck. They were forcing his face upward. . . . He could
feel its breath. . . . It was going to get rid of him first. . . . He
could feel its putrid breath. . . . His mother was screaming in his
ears. . . . She was going to be the last thing he ever heard —</p>
<p>And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a
silvery light growing brighter and brighter. . . . He felt himself fall
forward onto the grass —</p>
<p>Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes.
The dementor must have released him. The blinding light was illuminating
the grass around him. . . . The screaming had stopped, the cold was
ebbing away. . . .</p>
<p>Something was driving the dementors back. . . . It was circling
around him and Sirius and Hermione. . . . The rattling, sucking sounds
of the dementors were fading. They were leaving. . . . The air was warm
again. . . .</p>
<p>With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a
few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the
lake. . . . Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it
was. . . . It was as bright as a unicorn. . . . Fighting to stay
conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite
shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it
back . . . raising his hand to pat it . . . someone who looked strangely
familiar . . . but it couldn’t be . . .</p>
<p>Harry didn’t understand. He couldn’t think anymore. He felt the last
of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he
fainted.</p>
