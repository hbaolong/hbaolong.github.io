<h4 id="chapter-seventeen">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h4>
<p>BATHILDA’S SECRET</p>
<p>Harry, stop.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>They had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.</p>
<p>“There’s someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over
by the bushes.”</p>
<p>They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense
black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. . . .”</p>
<p>She broke from him to free her wand arm.</p>
<p>“We look like Muggles,” Harry pointed out.</p>
<p>“Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave!
Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!”</p>
<p>Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be
haunted: what if — ? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of
dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could
not move snow.</p>
<p>“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird. If it
was a Death Eater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here, and we
can put the Cloak back on.”</p>
<p>They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the
graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when
reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery
pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The
pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were now singing the
carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment
Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he
could say anything Hermione murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled
him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite
direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the point
where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again.
They walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with
multicolored lights, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the
curtains.</p>
<p>“How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione, who was
shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. “Harry?
What do you think? Harry?”</p>
<p>She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was
looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of
houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him;
she slipped a little on the ice.</p>
<p>“Harry —”</p>
<p>“Look. . . . Look at it, Hermione. . . .”</p>
<p>“I don’t . . . oh!”</p>
<p>He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and
Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had
taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high
grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered
in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown
apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and
Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once
have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.</p>
<p>“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione.</p>
<p>“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied. “Maybe it’s like the
injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?”</p>
<p>He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and
thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some
part of the house.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might — oh,
Harry, look!”</p>
<p>His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of
the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and
weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters
upon the wood it said:</p>
<p>On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter
lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have
survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to Muggles, has been
left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder
of the violence that tore apart their family.</p>
<p>And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added
by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy
Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed their names in Everlasting
Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had
left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen
years’ worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things.</p>
<p>Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. If you read this, Harry, we’re
all behind you!</p>
<p>Long live Harry Potter.</p>
<p>“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione,
indignant.</p>
<p>But Harry beamed at her.</p>
<p>“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . .”</p>
<p>He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane
toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square.
Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a woman.
She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy
ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an
impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer.
Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages
she was passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last
she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the
middle of the frozen road, facing them.</p>
<p>He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There was next to no
chance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a
house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was
not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd
behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old
ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be
able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the
strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they
were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved
hand and beckoned.</p>
<p>Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against
his.</p>
<p>“How does she know?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry
could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his
suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that
they stood facing each other in the deserted street.</p>
<p>Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long
months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come
in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the
shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her
ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he had
never encountered before.</p>
<p>Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump.</p>
<p>“Are you Bathilda?”</p>
<p>The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.</p>
<p>Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry
raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.</p>
<p>They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled
off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she
turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through a
garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled
for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped
back to let them pass.</p>
<p>She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose
as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside
her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely
level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue
and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into
Harry’s face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds
of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and
liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if
she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that
she would see.</p>
<p>The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food
intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of
scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.</p>
<p>“Bathilda?” Harry repeated.</p>
<p>She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin;
the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could
feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that
the thing that would destroy it was near?</p>
<p>Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had
not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.</p>
<p>“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione.</p>
<p>“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had
to,” said Harry. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all
there. Muriel called her ‘gaga.’”</p>
<p>“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room.</p>
<p>Hermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the
sitting room.</p>
<p>Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was
still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched
beneath their feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath the dank and
mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He wondered when
was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda’s house to check
whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do
magic, too, for she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace
cuff in constant danger of catching fire.</p>
<p>“Let me do that,” offered Harry, and he took the matches from her.
She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that
stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of
books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.</p>
<p>The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted
chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs.
When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty
glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As
Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered “Tergeo”: The dust
vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were
missing from the largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether
Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight of a
photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he
snatched it up.</p>
<p>It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had
perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of
the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the
boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with
the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing
photographs were: in Rita’s book.</p>
<p>“Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot?” he said, and his voice shook slightly. “Who
is this?”</p>
<p>Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione
light the fire for her.</p>
<p>“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in
his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda
looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest.</p>
<p>“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture
forward.</p>
<p>She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.</p>
<p>“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and louder
voice than usual. “This man? Do you know him? What’s he called?”</p>
<p>Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How
had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories?</p>
<p>“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly.</p>
<p>“Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione.</p>
<p>“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from
Gregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. “Who is this?”</p>
<p>But she only stared at him.</p>
<p>“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot?” asked
Hermione, raising her own voice. “Was there something you wanted to tell
us?”</p>
<p>Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a
few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head she looked
back into the hall.</p>
<p>“You want us to leave?” he asked.</p>
<p>She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at
herself, then at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Oh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with
her.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.”</p>
<p>But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising
vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.</p>
<p>“She wants me to go with her, alone.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the
candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud
noise.</p>
<p>“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to
me?”</p>
<p>“Do you really think she knows who you are?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his
own, “I think she does.”</p>
<p>“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda.</p>
<p>She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the
door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was
not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the midst of the
candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of
the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the
silver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket.</p>
<p>The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his
hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not topple
over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely. Slowly,
wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately
right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom.</p>
<p>It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a
chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the
door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
<p>“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start: Bathilda
had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not
heard her approach.</p>
<p>“You are Potter?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast,
faster than his own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating
sensation.</p>
<p>“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed
distracted by his lit wand-tip.</p>
<p>“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated.</p>
<p>Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry’s
scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his
sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily. He
felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold him!</p>
<p>Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to
close around him again; he did not know what had just happened.</p>
<p>“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time, much
louder.</p>
<p>“Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his
wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the
curtained window.</p>
<p>This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the
unmade bed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away from her.</p>
<p>“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was
heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.</p>
<p>“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.</p>
<p>And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled
mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the
corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he
saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place
where her neck had been.</p>
<p>The snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his
forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung
dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished: Then a powerful blow
from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him: He fell
backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing
—</p>
<p>He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, which
thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier:
Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor. From
below he heard Hermione call, “Harry?”</p>
<p>He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a
heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over
him, powerful, muscular —</p>
<p>“No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor.</p>
<p>“Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss . . . hold you . . . hold you . .
.”</p>
<p>“Accio . . . Accio Wand . . .”</p>
<p>But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the
snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air
from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that
throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was
flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath
drowned, distant footsteps, everything going. . . .</p>
<p>A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying,
flying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick or
thestral. . . .</p>
<p>He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had
released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the
landing light: It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her
deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air
filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass
and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand —</p>
<p>He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake,
its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment
Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of
red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the
face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry
raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more
powerfully than it had done in years.</p>
<p>“He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming!”</p>
<p>As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It
smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as
Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be
Hermione —</p>
<p>She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The
snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming,
was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with
the pain from his scar —</p>
<p>The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with
him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, “Confringo!” and her spell flew
around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at
them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the
back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he
leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the
smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the
night as they twisted in midair. . . .</p>
<p>And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running
across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the
windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and
vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the
girl’s, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells
ringing in Christmas Day. . . .</p>
<p>And his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was Harry’s pain . . .
that it could happen here, where it had happened before . . . here,
within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it
was to die . . . to die. . . . The pain was so terrible . . . ripped
from his body. . . . But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so
badly; if he was dead, how could he feel so unbearably, didn’t pain
cease with death, didn’t it go . . .</p>
<p>The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling
across the square, and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all
the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe . .
. And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and
rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . Not anger
. . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but triumph, yes. . . . He
had waited for this, he had hoped for it. . . .</p>
<p>“Nice costume, mister!”</p>
<p>He saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see
beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then
the child turned and ran away . . . Beneath the robe he fingered the
handle of his wand . . . One simple movement and the child would never
reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . .</p>
<p>And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination
was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not
know it yet. . . . And he made less noise than the dead leaves
slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and
stared over it. . . .</p>
<p>They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their
little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making
puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the
small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and
trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist. . . .</p>
<p>A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear,
her long dark-red hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up
the son and handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down upon the
sofa and stretched, yawning. . . .</p>
<p>The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did
not hear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and
pointed it at the door, which burst open.</p>
<p>He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It
was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand. . . .</p>
<p>“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off!”</p>
<p>Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! . . . He laughed before
casting the curse. . . .</p>
<p>“Avada Kedavra!”</p>
<p>The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed
against the wall, it made the banisters glare like lightning rods, and
James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. . . .</p>
<p>He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as
long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear . . . He
climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to
barricade herself in. . . . She had no wand upon her either. . . . How
stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in
friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments. . . .</p>
<p>He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled
against it with one lazy wave of his wand . . . and there she stood, the
child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the
crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in
shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead. . . .</p>
<p>“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”</p>
<p>“Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now.”</p>
<p>“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead —”</p>
<p>“This is my last warning —”</p>
<p>“Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . Not
Harry! Not Harry! Please — I’ll do anything —”</p>
<p>“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!”</p>
<p>He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more
prudent to finish them all. . . .</p>
<p>The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her
husband. The child had not cried all this time: He could stand,
clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the intruder’s
face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his
father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his
mother would pop up any moment, laughing —</p>
<p>He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face: He wanted to
see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The
child began to cry: It had seen that he was not James. He did not like
it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in
the orphanage —</p>
<p>“Avada Kedavra!”</p>
<p>And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and
he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where
the child was trapped and screaming, but far away . . . far away. . .
.</p>
<p>“No,” he moaned.</p>
<p>The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed
the boy, and yet he was the boy. . . .</p>
<p>“No . . .”</p>
<p>And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda’s house, immersed
in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake
slithered over broken china and glass . . . He looked down and saw
something . . . something incredible. . . .</p>
<p>“No . . .”</p>
<p>“Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right!”</p>
<p>He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was,
the unknown thief, the thief he was seeking. . . .</p>
<p>“No . . . I dropped it. . . . I dropped it. . . .”</p>
<p>“Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!”</p>
<p>He was Harry. . . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that was
rustling was not a snake. . . . He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Do you feel all — all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he lied.</p>
<p>He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of
blankets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the
quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was
drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets.</p>
<p>“We got away.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione. “I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into
your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been . . . Well, you haven’t been
quite . . .”</p>
<p>There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small
sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.</p>
<p>“You’ve been ill,” she finished. “Quite ill.”</p>
<p>“How long ago did we leave?”</p>
<p>“Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.”</p>
<p>“And I’ve been . . . what, unconscious?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortably. “You’ve been shouting and
moaning and . . . things,” she added in a tone that made Harry feel
uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like Voldemort, cried like the
baby in the crib?</p>
<p>“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, and he knew she
wanted to change the subject. “It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You’ve
got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The
snake bit you too, but I’ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on
it. . . .”</p>
<p>He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and
looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket
had burned him. He could also see the half-healed puncture marks to his
forearm.</p>
<p>“Where’ve you put the Horcrux?”</p>
<p>“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.”</p>
<p>He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all
my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore
might have left the sword there for you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was
the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack
you?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “She was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . .
all along.”</p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It
made the whole thing horribly vivid.</p>
<p>“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside
her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were
right. He knew I’d go back.”</p>
<p>“The snake was inside her?”</p>
<p>He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.</p>
<p>“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said.
“She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue,
all Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand
her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to
You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited,
he said to keep me there . . . and then . . .”</p>
<p>He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did
not need to know the details.</p>
<p>“. . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.”</p>
<p>He looked down at the puncture marks.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who
came.”</p>
<p>If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth
it, all of it . . . Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the
covers.</p>
<p>“Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible.
I’m fine. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand?”</p>
<p>She did not answer, she merely looked at him.</p>
<p>“Where’s my wand, Hermione?”</p>
<p>She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Harry . . .”</p>
<p>“Where’s my wand?”</p>
<p>She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.</p>
<p>The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile
strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood
had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as though
it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not
think properly: Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held
out the wand to Hermione.</p>
<p>“Mend it. Please.”</p>
<p>“Harry, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this —”</p>
<p>“Please, Hermione, try!”</p>
<p>“R-Reparo.”</p>
<p>The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up.</p>
<p>“Lumos!”</p>
<p>The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at
Hermione.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!”</p>
<p>Hermione’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The
feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry’s wand, which split into
two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing
. . . the wand that had survived so much . . .</p>
<p>“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “I’m
so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake
was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded
everywhere, and it must have — must have hit —”</p>
<p>“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. He felt empty,
stunned. “We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.”</p>
<p>“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione, the
tears trickling down her face. “Remember . . . remember Ron? When he
broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to
get a new one.”</p>
<p>Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort;
of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new
wand?</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, I’ll just
borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch.”</p>
<p>Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he
left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away
from her.</p>
