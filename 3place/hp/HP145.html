<h4 id="chapter-thirteen">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h4>
<p>THE SECRET RIDDLE</p>
<p>Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and
Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been
cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused
and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know
that Katie herself had not been the intended target.</p>
<p>“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron and Hermione,
who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry
mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.</p>
<p>Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he
had been in time for Monday night’s lesson, but having had no word to
the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore’s office at eight
o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking
unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled
when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the
desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.</p>
<p>“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” Dumbledore said.
“I believe you witnessed Katie’s accident.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. How is she?”</p>
<p>“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to
have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin:
There was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held
it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily
Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the
curse —”</p>
<p>“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam Pomfrey?”</p>
<p>“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the
wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather,
raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. “I
would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated
in my day.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore quellingly. “Professor
Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry.
Anyway, the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am
hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.”</p>
<p>“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, disregarding a
strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently
shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.</p>
<p>“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. “However, I shall
tell you in due course.”</p>
<p>“You will?” said Harry, startled.</p>
<p>“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of
silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of
his wand.</p>
<p>“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your
inheritance with light-fingered contempt,” said Dumbledore, frowning a
little. “He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three
Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured
that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius’s old
possessions.”</p>
<p>“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?” said
Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly
to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p>“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did Professor
McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco
Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“And do you — ?”</p>
<p>“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who
might have had a hand in Katie’s accident,” said Dumbledore. “But what
concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.”</p>
<p>Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very
important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and
second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as
Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began
swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands.</p>
<p>“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord
Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom
Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family
home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the
baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort.”</p>
<p>“How do you know she was in London, sir?”</p>
<p>“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” said Dumbledore,
“who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the
necklace we have just been discussing.”</p>
<p>He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill
them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the
swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the
Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair
that completely covered his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a
young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she
needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and
pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket
had been Slytherin’s. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time,
‘Oh, this was Merlin’s, this was, his favorite teapot,’ but when I
looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were
enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough
priceless. She didn’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy
to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus
Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had
come.</p>
<p>“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry indignantly.</p>
<p>“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” said Dumbledore.
“So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in
London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one
and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo’s
treasured family heirlooms.”</p>
<p>“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. “She could have got
food and everything for herself by magic, couldn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is my belief — I am
guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that when her husband
abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she
wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her
unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that
can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to
raise her wand even to save her own life.”</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly be feeling sorry
for Lord Voldemort?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not like
my mother —”</p>
<p>“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore gently. “Yes, Merope
Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge
her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and
she never had your mother’s courage. And now, if you will stand . .
.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the
front of the desk.</p>
<p>“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter my memory. I
think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate.
After you, Harry . . .”</p>
<p>Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the
memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . Seconds
later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he
and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London
street.</p>
<p>“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a
tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart.</p>
<p>This younger Albus Dumbledore’s long hair and beard were auburn.
Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the
pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit
of plum velvet that he was wearing.</p>
<p>“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, but
Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short
distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare
courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high
railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked
once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl
wearing an apron.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I
believe, is the matron here?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore’s
eccentric appearance. “Um . . . just a mo’ . . . MRS. COLE!” she
bellowed over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl
turned back to Dumbledore. “Come in, she’s on ’er way.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole
place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore
followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny,
harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a
sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was
talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“. . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been
picking his scabs and Eric Whalley’s oozing all over his sheets —
chicken pox on top of everything else,” she said to nobody in
particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead
in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed
her threshold.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cole simply gaped.</p>
<p>“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an
appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a
hallucination, she said feebly, “Oh yes. Well — well then — you’d better
come into my room. Yes.”</p>
<p>She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room,
part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old
and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and
seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.</p>
<p>“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and
arrangements for his future,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole.</p>
<p>“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come to offer Tom a
place at my school.”</p>
<p>“What school’s this, then?”</p>
<p>“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“And how come you’re interested in Tom?”</p>
<p>“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.”</p>
<p>“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He’s never
been entered for one.”</p>
<p>“Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —”</p>
<p>“Who registered him? His parents?”</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman.
Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his
wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a
piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole’s desktop.</p>
<p>“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the
piece of paper, “I think this will make everything clear.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed
intently at the blank paper for a moment.</p>
<p>“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, handing it back.
Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had
certainly not been present a few seconds before.</p>
<p>“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an extra-refined
voice.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin
drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own
glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore
for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate to press his advantage.</p>
<p>“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle’s
history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. “I
remember it clear as anything, because I’d just started here myself. New
Year’s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this
girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up
the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her in, and she had
the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of
gin.</p>
<p>“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore. “Anything
about the boy’s father, for instance?”</p>
<p>“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be
rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager
audience for her story. “I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks
like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she
was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his
father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn’t it?
We wondered whether she came from a circus — and she said the boy’s
surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another
word.</p>
<p>“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so important to the
poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came
looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage
and he’s been here ever since.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy
measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then
she said, “He’s a funny boy.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.”</p>
<p>“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then,
when he got a little older, he was . . . odd.”</p>
<p>“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently.</p>
<p>“Well, he —”</p>
<p>But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague
about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin
glass.</p>
<p>“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?”</p>
<p>“Definitely,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“And nothing I say can change that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely.</p>
<p>She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him.
Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, “He
scares the other children.”</p>
<p>“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it’s
very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty
things . . .”</p>
<p>Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was
interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew
rosier still.</p>
<p>“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit . . . well, Tom said he didn’t do it and I
don’t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn’t hang itself
from the rafters, did it?”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly.</p>
<p>“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know
is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then” — Mrs. Cole took
another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time — “on the
summer outing — we take them out, you know, once a year, to the
countryside or to the seaside — well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were
never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that
they’d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore they’d just gone
exploring, but something happened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well,
there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . .”</p>
<p>She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were
flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t think many people will be sorry
to see the back of him.”</p>
<p>“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be keeping him
permanently?” said Dumbledore. “He will have to return here, at the very
least, every summer.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty
poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and
Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though
two-thirds of the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see
him?”</p>
<p>“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too.</p>
<p>She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out
instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. The
orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic.
They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that
this was a grim place in which to grow up.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing
and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice
and entered.</p>
<p>“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — sorry,
Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll let him do it.”</p>
<p>Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed
the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an
old wardrobe, a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on
top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him,
holding a book.</p>
<p>There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s face. Merope had got
her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven
years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took
in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. There was a moment’s silence.</p>
<p>“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding
out his hand.</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore
drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them
looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.</p>
<p>“I am Professor Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“‘Professor’?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is that like
‘doctor’? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at
me?”</p>
<p>He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just
left.</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me looked at, doesn’t
she? Tell the truth!”</p>
<p>He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost
shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it
many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at
Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly.
After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if
anything, warier still.</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a
school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school —
your new school, if you would like to come.”</p>
<p>Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed
and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.</p>
<p>“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it?
‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m not going, see? That old cat’s
the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy
Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they’ll tell you!”</p>
<p>“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore patiently. “I am a
teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about
Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody
will force you —”</p>
<p>“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle.</p>
<p>“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle’s
last words, “is a school for people with special abilities —”</p>
<p>“I’m not mad!”</p>
<p>“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad
people. It is a school of magic.”</p>
<p>There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but
his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as
though trying to catch one of them lying.</p>
<p>“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“It’s . . . it’s magic, what I can do?”</p>
<p>“What is it that you can do?”</p>
<p>“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his
neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make things move
without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do,
without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy
me. I can make them hurt if I want to.”</p>
<p>His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed
again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.</p>
<p>“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fingers.
“I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.”</p>
<p>“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who was no longer
smiling, but watching Riddle intently. “You are a wizard.”</p>
<p>Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild
happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better
looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow
rougher, his expression almost bestial.</p>
<p>“Are you a wizard too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had
used when he had said, “Tell the truth.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you are accepting
your place at Hogwarts —”</p>
<p>“Of course I am!”</p>
<p>“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’”</p>
<p>Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he
said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I meant —
please, Professor, could you show me — ?”</p>
<p>Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would
tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations
at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and
must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore
drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at
the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.</p>
<p>The wardrobe burst into flames.</p>
<p>Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling
in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But
even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the
wardrobe completely undamaged.</p>
<p>Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression
greedy, he pointed at the wand. “Where can I get one of them?”</p>
<p>“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is something
trying to get out of your wardrobe.”</p>
<p>And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For
the first time, Riddle looked frightened.</p>
<p>“Open the door,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe
door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small
cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several
frantic mice trapped inside it.</p>
<p>“Take it out,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.</p>
<p>“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. “Yes, I
suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an expressionless voice.</p>
<p>“Open it,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without
looking at them. Harry, who had expected something much more exciting,
saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, and a
tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped
quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.</p>
<p>“You will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said
Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. “I shall know
whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at
Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and
appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, “Yes,
sir.”</p>
<p>“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you not only to use
magic, but to control it. You have — inadvertently, I am sure — been
using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our
school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your
magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel
students, and the Ministry of Magic — yes, there is a Ministry — will
punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept
that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again.</p>
<p>It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained
quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the
cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said
baldly, “I haven’t got any money.”</p>
<p>“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather
money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who
require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of
your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but —”</p>
<p>“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had taken the
heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat
gold Galleon.</p>
<p>“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and
school equipment with me. I can help you find everything —”</p>
<p>“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.</p>
<p>“Certainly, if you —”</p>
<p>“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for
myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this
Diagon Alley — sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s eye.</p>
<p>Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle,
but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope
containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how
to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, “You will be
able to see it, although Muggles around you — non-magical people, that
is — will not. Ask for Tom the barman — easy enough to remember, as he
shares your name —”</p>
<p>Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an
irksome fly.</p>
<p>“You dislike the name ‘Tom’?”</p>
<p>“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could
not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of
himself, he asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle
too, they’ve told me.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.</p>
<p>“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,” said
Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. “It must’ve been him. So — when
I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your
envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave from King’s Cross Station on
the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.”</p>
<p>Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand
again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can speak to snakes. I found out when
we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me, they whisper to me.
Is that normal for a wizard?”</p>
<p>Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power
until that moment, determined to impress.</p>
<p>“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation, “but
not unheard of.”</p>
<p>His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s face.
They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the
handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“I think that will do,” said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry’s
side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness
once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office.</p>
<p>“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.</p>
<p>Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.</p>
<p>“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you told him
he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I didn’t believe Hagrid at first, when he
told me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use his
word — ‘special,’” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Did you know — then?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all
time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be
what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to
Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done
in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already,
I felt I ought to do for others’ sake as much as his.</p>
<p>“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such
a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of all — he had
already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and
begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random
experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against
other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of
the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave
were most suggestive. . . . ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. . .
.’”</p>
<p>“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the
Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great
and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make
me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and
domination.</p>
<p>“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, indicating the
dark sky beyond the windows. “But before we part, I want to draw your
attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for
they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in
future meetings.</p>
<p>“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned that
another shared his first name, ‘Tom’?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other
people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be
different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a
few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘Lord
Voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for so long.</p>
<p>“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly
self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want
help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to
operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of
his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they
alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord
Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever
wanted one.</p>
<p>“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this,
Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box
of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from
victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of
particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like
tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.</p>
<p>“And now, it really is time for bed.”</p>
<p>Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell
upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last
time, but the ring was no longer there.</p>
<p>“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.</p>
<p>“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I thought you
might have the mouth organ or something.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his half-moon
spectacles.</p>
<p>“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth
organ.”</p>
<p>And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself
to be dismissed.</p>
