<h4 id="chapter-twenty-five">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h4>
<p>THE EGG AND THE EYE</p>
<p>As Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the
secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be
able to take as much time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to
accept more favors from Cedric, he also decided to use the prefects’
bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less
likely that he would be disturbed.</p>
<p>Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out
of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the
night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The
Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added
precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next
to the Cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The
map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and
secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people
inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the
corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching
the bathroom.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept
back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had
shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time
it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana
fritters”). “Good luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry
crept out past him.</p>
<p>It was awkward moving under the Cloak tonight, because Harry had the
heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the
other. However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by
checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that
he wouldn’t run into anyone he wanted to avoid. When he reached the
statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on
the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and
muttered the password, “Pine fresh,” just as Cedric had told him.</p>
<p>The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind
him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.</p>
<p>His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect
just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid
candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble,
including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into
the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around
the pool’s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set into its
handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at
the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and
there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a
blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her
face. It fluttered every time she snored.</p>
<p>Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the
walls. Magnificent though the bathroom was — and quite keen though he
was to try out a few of those taps — now he was here he couldn’t quite
suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on
earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg?
Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the Cloak, the map, and
the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and
turned on a few of the taps.</p>
<p>He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble
bath mixed with the water, though it wasn’t bubble bath as Harry had
ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of
footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it
would have supported his weight if he’d cared to test it; a third sent
heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.
Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps on and off,
particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the
surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of
hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering
its size, Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas,
slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.</p>
<p>It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he
actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and
treading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to
swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-colored steam
wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden
burst of understanding.</p>
<p>Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and
opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing
and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as
incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped
it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering
whether that hadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and then, making him jump so
badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom
floor, someone spoke.</p>
<p>“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.”</p>
<p>Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He
stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl
sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle,
who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three
floors below.</p>
<p>“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing
anything!”</p>
<p>The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty
feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps
ever since he had arrived.</p>
<p>“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking at him through
her thick spectacles. “You haven’t been to see me for ages.”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . well . . .” said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just
to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t see anything but his head, “I’m
not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’ one.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t used to care,” said Myrtle miserably. “You used to be in
there all the time.”</p>
<p>This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found
Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice
Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into
living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could
sneak into the Slytherin common room.</p>
<p>“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which was half-true;
Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtle’s bathroom. “I thought
I’d better not come back after that.”</p>
<p>“Oh . . . I see . . .” said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in
a morose sort of way. “Well . . . anyway . . . I’d try the egg in the
water. That’s what Cedric Diggory did.”</p>
<p>“Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry indignantly. “What
d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take
baths?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” said Myrtle, rather slyly, “but I’ve never come out to
speak to anyone before.”</p>
<p>“I’m honored,” said Harry darkly. “You keep your eyes shut!”</p>
<p>He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting
himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and
going to retrieve the egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered
through her fingers and said, “Go on, then . . . open it under the
water!”</p>
<p>Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it . . .
and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a
song whose words he couldn’t distinguish through the water.</p>
<p>“You need to put your head under too,” said Myrtle, who seemed to be
thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. “Go on!”</p>
<p>Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface — and now,
sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a
chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his
hands:</p>
<p>“Come seek us where our voices sound,</p>
<p>We cannot sing above the ground,</p>
<p>And while you’re searching, ponder this:</p>
<p>We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss,</p>
<p>An hour long you’ll have to look,</p>
<p>And to recover what we took,</p>
<p>But past an hour — the prospect’s black,</p>
<p>Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”</p>
<p>Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface,
shaking his hair out of his eyes.</p>
<p>“Hear it?” said Myrtle.</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . ‘Come seek us where our voices sound . . .’ and if I need
persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . .”</p>
<p>He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater
renditions of the egg’s song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod
water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above
the ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”</p>
<p>“Slow, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when
a dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of
a cat. Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices
could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to
underwater creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at
him.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking
to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles
had gone. . . .”</p>
<p>“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the
lake, apart from the giant squid?”</p>
<p>“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes
don’t have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not
expecting it. . . .”</p>
<p>Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the
lake with the contents of a toilet, Harry said, “Well, does anything in
there have a human voice? Hang on —”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the
wall.</p>
<p>“Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there?”</p>
<p>“Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses twinkling, “it took
Diggory much longer than that! And that was with her awake too” — Myrtle
jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike
on her glum face — “giggling and showing off and flashing her fins. . .
.”</p>
<p>“That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly. “The second task’s to go
and find the merpeople in the lake and . . . and . . .”</p>
<p>But he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the
excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in
his stomach. He wasn’t a very good swimmer; he’d never had much
practice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and
Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day, hadn’t
bothered to give him any. A couple of lengths of this bath were all very
well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and merpeople
would surely live right at the bottom. . . .</p>
<p>“Myrtle,” Harry said slowly, “how am I supposed to breathe?”</p>
<p>At this, Myrtle’s eyes filled with sudden tears again.</p>
<p>“Tactless!” she muttered, groping in her robes for a
handkerchief.</p>
<p>“What’s tactless?” said Harry, bewildered.</p>
<p>“Talking about breathing in front of me!” she said shrilly, and her
voice echoed loudly around the bathroom. “When I can’t . . . when I
haven’t . . . not for ages . . .”</p>
<p>She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. Harry
remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none
of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said impatiently. “I didn’t mean — I just forgot . .
.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said Myrtle, gulping,
looking at him out of swollen eyes. “Nobody missed me even when I was
alive. Took them hours and hours to find my body — I know, I was sitting
there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into the bathroom — ‘Are you
in here again, sulking, Myrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet
asked me to look for you —’ And then she saw my body . . . ooooh, she
didn’t forget it until her dying day, I made sure of that . . . followed
her around and reminded her, I did. I remember at her brother’s wedding
—”</p>
<p>But Harry wasn’t listening; he was thinking about the merpeople’s
song again. “We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss.” That sounded as
though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to
get back. What were they going to take?</p>
<p>“— and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me
stalking her, so I had to come back here and live in my toilet.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Harry vaguely. “Well, I’m a lot further on than I was. .
. . Shut your eyes again, will you? I’m getting out.”</p>
<p>He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried
himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.</p>
<p>“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?” Moaning
Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>“Er . . . I’ll try,” Harry said, though privately thinking the only
way he’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again was if every other toilet
in the castle got blocked. “See you, Myrtle . . . thanks for your
help.”</p>
<p>“’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility
Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap.</p>
<p>Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder’s Map to check
that the coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his
cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office . . . nothing else seemed
to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy
room on the floor above. . . . Harry had taken his first step back
toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye .
. . something distinctly odd.</p>
<p>Peeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was
flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner — Snape’s office.
But the dot wasn’t labeled “Severus Snape” . . . it was Bartemius
Crouch.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go
to work or to come to the Yule Ball — so what was he doing, sneaking
into Hogwarts at one o’clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as
the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there. . .
.</p>
<p>Harry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better
of him. He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the
nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to.</p>
<p>Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces
in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a
floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor
below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a
narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors. He
kept glancing down at the map, wondering . . . It just didn’t seem in
character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking
around somebody else’s office this late at night. . . .</p>
<p>And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was
doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of
Mr. Crouch, Harry’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step
Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the
golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm. He
lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the
long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step — the
Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder’s
Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in
the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.</p>
<p>The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the
staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below.
Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to
wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach —</p>
<p>Pulling the Cloak back over himself, Harry straightened up, listening
hard with his eyes screwed up with fear . . . and, almost immediately
—</p>
<p>“PEEVES!”</p>
<p>It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry
could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his
wheezy voice raised in fury.</p>
<p>“What’s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I’ll have
you, Peeves, I’ll have you, you’ll . . . and what is this?”</p>
<p>Filch’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the
wailing stopped — Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood
very still, one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening.
Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to
see Peeves . . . and there would be no Peeves . . . but if he came up
the stairs, he would spot the Marauder’s Map . . . and Invisibility
Cloak or not, the map would show “Harry Potter” standing exactly where
he was.</p>
<p>“Egg?” Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. “My sweet!” —
Mrs. Norris was obviously with him — “This is a Triwizard clue! This
belongs to a school champion!”</p>
<p>Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast —</p>
<p>“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been stealing!”</p>
<p>He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy
face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted
staircase.</p>
<p>“Hiding, are you?” he said softly. “I’m coming to get you, Peeves. .
. . You’ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves. . . . Dumbledore’ll
have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. . .
.”</p>
<p>Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at
his heels. Mrs. Norris’s lamp-like eyes, so very like her master’s, were
fixed directly upon Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder
whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with
apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old
flannel dressing gown — he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg
free, but it merely sank a few more inches — any second now, Filch was
going to spot the map or walk right into him —</p>
<p>“Filch? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the
stairs stood the only person who could make Harry’s situation worse:
Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.</p>
<p>“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently. “He threw
this egg down the stairs.”</p>
<p>Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry
gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him
away at any second. . . .</p>
<p>“Peeves?” said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch’s hands.
“But Peeves couldn’t get into my office. . . .”</p>
<p>“This egg was in your office, Professor?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Snape snapped. “I heard banging and wailing —”</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor, that was the egg —”</p>
<p>“— I was coming to investigate —”</p>
<p>“— Peeves threw it, Professor —”</p>
<p>“— and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a
cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!”</p>
<p>“But Peeves couldn’t —”</p>
<p>“I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again. “I seal my office
with a spell none but a wizard could break!” Snape looked up the stairs,
straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below. “I want
you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch.”</p>
<p>“I — yes, Professor — but —”</p>
<p>Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could
see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves.
Go, Harry pleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . . go . . .
Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch’s legs. . . . Harry had the
distinct impression that she could smell him. . . . Why had he filled
that bath with so much perfumed foam?</p>
<p>“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the headmaster
will have to listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a
student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once
and for all —”</p>
<p>“Filch, I don’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it’s my
office that’s —”</p>
<p>Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.</p>
<p>Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at
the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through
the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling
cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual.</p>
<p>“Pajama party, is it?” he growled up the stairs.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said Filch at once.
“Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — and then
Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off —”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch.</p>
<p>Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody’s
magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself.</p>
<p>Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through
Invisibility Cloaks . . . he alone could see the full strangeness of the
scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry,
trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody’s lopsided gash of a mouth
opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into
each other’s eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye
upon Snape again.</p>
<p>“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly. “Someone broke
into your office?”</p>
<p>“It is unimportant,” said Snape coldly.</p>
<p>“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very important. Who’d want
to break into your office?”</p>
<p>“A student, I daresay,” said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering
horribly on Snape’s greasy temple. “It has happened before. Potion
ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard . . .
students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. . . .”</p>
<p>“Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?” said Moody. “Not
hiding anything else in your office, are you?”</p>
<p>Harry saw the edge of Snape’s sallow face turn a nasty brick color,
the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly.</p>
<p>“You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody,” he said in a soft and dangerous
voice, “as you’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.”</p>
<p>Moody’s face twisted into a smile. “Auror’s privilege, Snape.
Dumbledore told me to keep an eye —”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape through clenched teeth.
“I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!”</p>
<p>“’Course Dumbledore trusts you,” growled Moody. “He’s a trusting man,
isn’t he? Believes in second chances. But me — I say there are spots
that don’t come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d’you know what I
mean?”</p>
<p>Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm
convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt
him.</p>
<p>Moody laughed. “Get back to bed, Snape.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!” Snape hissed,
letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. “I have as much
right to prowl this school after dark as you do!”</p>
<p>“Prowl away,” said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. “I look
forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time. . . . You’ve
dropped something, by the way. . . .”</p>
<p>With a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the Marauder’s Map,
still lying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch
both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised
his arms under the Cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his
attention, mouthing “It’s mine! Mine!”</p>
<p>Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning
comprehension on his face —</p>
<p>“Accio Parchment!”</p>
<p>The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape’s outstretched
fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moody’s hand.</p>
<p>“My mistake,” Moody said calmly. “It’s mine — must’ve dropped it
earlier —”</p>
<p>But Snape’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms to
the map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two
together, as only Snape could. . . .</p>
<p>“Potter,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing
it.</p>
<p>“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared
right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him.
“That egg is Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I
have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his
Invisibility Cloak!”</p>
<p>Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up
the stairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were
dilating, trying to sniff Harry out — trapped, Harry leaned backward,
trying to avoid Snape’s fingertips, but any moment now —</p>
<p>“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but I’ll be happy to
tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still
outstretched, inches from Harry’s chest.</p>
<p>“Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know who’s got it in
for that boy!” said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the
stairs. “And so am I, Snape . . . very interested. . . .” The torchlight
flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk
missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.</p>
<p>Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn’t see the
expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything.
Then Snape slowly lowered his hands.</p>
<p>“I merely thought,” said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, “that if
Potter was wandering around after hours again . . . it’s an unfortunate
habit of his . . . he should be stopped. For — for his own safety.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” said Moody softly. “Got Potter’s best interests at
heart, have you?”</p>
<p>There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other.
Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch’s legs, looking
for the source of Harry’s bubble-bath smell.</p>
<p>“I think I will go back to bed,” Snape said curtly.</p>
<p>“Best idea you’ve had all night,” said Moody. “Now, Filch, if you’ll
just give me that egg —”</p>
<p>“No!” said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn
son. “Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves’ treachery!”</p>
<p>“It’s the property of the champion he stole it from,” said Moody.
“Hand it over, now.”</p>
<p>Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch
made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for
a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still
breathing very fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor;
Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to
Mrs. Norris. “Never mind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the
morning . . . tell him what Peeves was up to. . . .”</p>
<p>A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his
staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward
him, a dull clunk on every other step.</p>
<p>“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.</p>
<p>“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of
his pocket and unfolding it.</p>
<p>“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.</p>
<p>“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical
eye going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting
to water from the pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could
help me — ?”</p>
<p>“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .”</p>
<p>Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of
the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still
gazing at the map.</p>
<p>“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to
see who broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.”</p>
<p>Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He
looked suddenly alarmed.</p>
<p>“Crouch?” he said. “You’re — you’re sure, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Positive,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, he’s not here anymore,” said Moody, his eye still whizzing
over the map. “Crouch . . . that’s very — very interesting. . . .”</p>
<p>He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry
could tell that this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted
to know what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him
slightly . . . yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of
trouble. . . .</p>
<p>“Er . . . Professor Moody . . . why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to
look around Snape’s office?”</p>
<p>Moody’s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It
was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was
sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell
him.</p>
<p>“Put it this way, Potter,” Moody muttered finally, “they say old
Mad-Eye’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I’m nothing —
nothing — compared to Barty Crouch.”</p>
<p>He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.</p>
<p>“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think . . . could this have
anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there’s something
going on. . . .”</p>
<p>“Like what?” said Moody sharply.</p>
<p>Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t want Moody to guess
that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to
tricky questions about Sirius.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been happening lately,
hasn’t it? It’s been in the Daily Prophet . . . the Dark Mark at the
World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything. . . .”</p>
<p>Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.</p>
<p>“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye roved back to
the Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be thinking along those lines,” he
said slowly. “Very possible . . . there have been some funny rumors
flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It’s
making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.” A grim smile twisted his
lopsided mouth. “Oh if there’s one thing I hate,” he muttered, more to
himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the left-hand
corner of the map, “it’s a Death Eater who walked free. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he
meant?</p>
<p>“And now I want to ask you a question, Potter,” said Moody in a more
businesslike tone.</p>
<p>Harry’s heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going
to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical
object — and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated
not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor
Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the
map in front of Harry, who braced himself —</p>
<p>“Can I borrow this?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Harry.</p>
<p>He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely
relieved that Moody wasn’t asking where he’d got it, and there was no
doubt that he owed Moody a favor.</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay.”</p>
<p>“Good boy,” growled Moody. “I can make good use of this . . . this
might be exactly what I’ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter,
come on, now. . . .”</p>
<p>They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining
the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen
before. They walked in silence to the door of Moody’s office, where he
stopped and looked up at Harry.</p>
<p>“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, taken aback.</p>
<p>“You want to consider it,” said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry
thoughtfully. “Yes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I’m guessing you
weren’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight?”</p>
<p>“Er — no,” said Harry, grinning. “I’ve been working out the
clue.”</p>
<p>Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again.</p>
<p>“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . . . See
you in the morning. . . .”</p>
<p>He went back into his office, staring down at the Marauder’s Map
again, and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about
Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant. . . . Why was Crouch
pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he
wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office?</p>
<p>And Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea .
. . but somehow, Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster
ten minutes later, the egg and the Cloak now safely back in his trunk,
he thought he’d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before
he chose it as a career.</p>
