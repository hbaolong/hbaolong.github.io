<h4 id="chapter-five">CHAPTER FIVE</h4>
<p>WEASLEYS’ WIZARD WHEEZES</p>
<p>Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides,
blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and
closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he
threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from
falling face forward out of the Weasleys’ kitchen fire.</p>
<p>“Did he eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull
Harry to his feet.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, straightening up. “What was it?”</p>
<p>“Ton-Tongue Toffee,” said Fred brightly. “George and I invented them,
and we’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . .
.”</p>
<p>The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw
that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two
red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew
immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley
brothers.</p>
<p>“How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of the two, grinning at
him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses
and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with
dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and
stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a
broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that
he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a
large, shiny burn on it.</p>
<p>Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s hand. Bill came
as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the Wizarding
bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had
always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about
rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was —
there was no other word for it — cool. He was tall, with long hair that
he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what
looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill’s clothes would not have
looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his
boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.</p>
<p>Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping
noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George’s shoulder. He
was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted. “What on earth did you give
that Muggle boy?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t give him anything,” said Fred, with another evil grin. “I
just dropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told
him to.”</p>
<p>“You dropped it on purpose!” roared Mr. Weasley. “You knew he’d eat
it, you knew he was on a diet —”</p>
<p>“How big did his tongue get?” George asked eagerly.</p>
<p>“It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink
it!”</p>
<p>Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.</p>
<p>“It isn’t funny!” Mr. Weasley shouted. “That sort of behavior
seriously undermines wizard–Muggle relations! I spend half my life
campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons —”</p>
<p>“We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle!” said Fred
indignantly.</p>
<p>“No, we gave it to him because he’s a great bullying git,” said
George. “Isn’t he, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry earnestly.</p>
<p>“That’s not the point!” raged Mr. Weasley. “You wait until I tell
your mother —”</p>
<p>“Tell me what?” said a voice behind them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump
woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed
with suspicion.</p>
<p>“Oh hello, Harry, dear,” she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her
eyes snapped back to her husband. “Tell me what, Arthur?”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was
with Fred and George, he hadn’t really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley
what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife
nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind
Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front
teeth, was Harry’s and Ron’s friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who
was small and red-haired, was Ron’s younger sister, Ginny. Both of them
smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet — she had
been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow.</p>
<p>“Tell me what, Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of
voice.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just —
but I’ve had words with them —”</p>
<p>“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got
anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione
from the doorway.</p>
<p>“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept there
last —”</p>
<p>“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.</p>
<p>“You stay where you are!” snarled Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny
set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that
zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.</p>
<p>“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.</p>
<p>Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.</p>
<p>“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly. “Great long price lists for stuff
they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets,
loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all
that . . .”</p>
<p>“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we
never thought they were actually making things,” said Ginny. “We thought
they just liked the noise.”</p>
<p>“Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit
dangerous,” said Ron, “and, you know, they were planning to sell it at
Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they
weren’t allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms.
. . . She’s furious at them anyway. They didn’t get as many O.W.L.s as
she expected.”</p>
<p>O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts
students took at the age of fifteen.</p>
<p>“And then there was this big row,” Ginny said, “because Mum wants
them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all
they want to do is open a joke shop.”</p>
<p>Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out
wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.</p>
<p>“Hi, Percy,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Oh hello, Harry,” said Percy. “I was wondering who was making all
the noise. I’m trying to work in here, you know — I’ve got a report to
finish for the office — and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when
people keep thundering up and down the stairs.”</p>
<p>“We’re not thundering,” said Ron irritably. “We’re walking. Sorry if
we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.”</p>
<p>“What are you working on?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,”
said Percy smugly. “We’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some
of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been
increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year —”</p>
<p>“That’ll change the world, that report will,” said Ron. “Front page
of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.”</p>
<p>Percy went slightly pink.</p>
<p>“You might sneer, Ron,” he said heatedly, “but unless some sort of
international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with
flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, all right,” said Ron, and he started off upstairs again.
Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny
followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen
below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told
Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.</p>
<p>The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it
had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron’s
favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving
on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill,
which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large
frog. Ron’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was
the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron’s letter to Harry in Privet
Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering
madly.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Pig,” said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds
that had been squeezed into the room. “Fred and George are in here with
us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,” he told Harry. “Percy
gets to keep his room all to himself because he’s got to work.”</p>
<p>“Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” Harry asked Ron.</p>
<p>“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny. “Its proper name is
Pigwidgeon.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron sarcastically.
“Ginny named him,” he explained to Harry. “She reckons it’s sweet. And I
tried to change it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything
else. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys
Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.”</p>
<p>Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry
knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about
his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione’s cat,
Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.</p>
<p>“Where’s Crookshanks?” Harry asked Hermione now.</p>
<p>“Out in the garden, I expect,” she said. “He likes chasing gnomes.
He’s never seen any before.”</p>
<p>“Percy’s enjoying work, then?” said Harry, sitting down on one of the
beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters
on the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Enjoying it?” said Ron darkly. “I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad
didn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him onto the subject of
his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch .
. . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . .
They’ll be announcing their engagement any day now.”</p>
<p>“Have you had a good summer, Harry?” said Hermione. “Did you get our
food parcels and everything?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks a lot,” said Harry. “They saved my life, those
cakes.”</p>
<p>“And have you heard from — ?” Ron began, but at a look from Hermione
he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron
and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from
the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry’s
godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad
idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how
Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to cover the
awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry.
“Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. The four of them left Ron’s room and
went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking
extremely bad-tempered.</p>
<p>“We’re eating out in the garden,” she said when they came in.
“There’s just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take the
plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables.
Knives and forks, please, you two,” she said to Ron and Harry, pointing
her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of
potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they
ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p>“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now directing her wand at a
dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the
floor, scooping up the potatoes. “Those two!” she burst out savagely,
now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant
Fred and George. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to them, I really
don’t. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they
possibly can. . . .”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen
table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured
from the wand-tip as she stirred.</p>
<p>“It’s not as though they haven’t got brains,” she continued
irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a
further poke of her wand, “but they’re wasting them, and unless they
pull themselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble. I’ve had more
owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry
on the way they’re going, they’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of
Magic Office.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open.
Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of
it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had
just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where we went wrong with them,” said Mrs. Weasley,
putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans.
“It’s been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won’t
listen to — OH NOT AGAIN!”</p>
<p>She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud
squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.</p>
<p>“One of their fake wands again!” she shouted. “How many times have I
told them not to leave them lying around?”</p>
<p>She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on
the stove was smoking.</p>
<p>“C’mon,” Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery
from the open drawer, “let’s go and help Bill and Charlie.”</p>
<p>They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the
yard.</p>
<p>They had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger
cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held
high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry
recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny
little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived
headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the
door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted
a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing
noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the
commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and
Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old
tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each
attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and George were
cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge,
apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.</p>
<p>Bill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and knocked one of its
legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to
see Percy’s head poking out of a window on the second floor.</p>
<p>“Will you keep it down?!” he bellowed.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Perce,” said Bill, grinning. “How’re the cauldron bottoms
coming on?”</p>
<p>“Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut.
Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass,
end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the
table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.</p>
<p>By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and
dishes of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys,
Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a
clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of
increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first,
Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and
ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.</p>
<p>At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about
his report on cauldron bottoms.</p>
<p>“I’ve told Mr. Crouch that I’ll have it ready by Tuesday,” Percy was
saying pompously. “That’s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like
to keep on top of things. I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it in good
time, I mean, it’s extremely busy in our department just now, what with
all the arrangements for the World Cup. We’re just not getting the
support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo
Bagman —”</p>
<p>“I like Ludo,” said Mr. Weasley mildly. “He was the one who got us
such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother,
Otto, got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I
smoothed the whole thing over.”</p>
<p>“Oh Bagman’s likable enough, of course,” said Percy dismissively,
“but how he ever got to be Head of Department . . . when I compare him
to Mr. Crouch! I can’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department
and not trying to find out what’s happened to them. You realize Bertha
Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday to
Albania and never came back?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “He
says Bertha’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must
say, if it was someone in my department, I’d be worried. . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh Bertha’s hopeless, all right,” said Percy. “I hear she’s been
shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than
she’s worth . . . but all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find
her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our
department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond
of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread
the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However” — Percy
heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine —
“we’ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International
Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments
too. As you know, we’ve got another big event to organize right after
the World Cup.”</p>
<p>Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end
of the table where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. “You know the
one I’m talking about, Father.” He raised his voice slightly. “The
top-secret one.”</p>
<p>Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, “He’s been
trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work.
Probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about
his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.</p>
<p>“. . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they
say at the bank?”</p>
<p>“Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring
home plenty of treasure,” said Bill patiently.</p>
<p>“And your hair’s getting silly, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, fingering
her wand lovingly. “I wish you’d let me give it a trim. . . .”</p>
<p>“I like it,” said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. “You’re so
old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it’s nowhere near as long as Professor
Dumbledore’s. . . .”</p>
<p>Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking
spiritedly about the World Cup.</p>
<p>“It’s got to be Ireland,” said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of
potato. “They flattened Peru in the semifinals.”</p>
<p>“Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.</p>
<p>“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,” said Charlie
shortly. “I wish England had got through. That was embarrassing, that
was.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his
isolation from the Wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet
Drive.</p>
<p>“Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,” said
Charlie gloomily. “Shocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and
Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.”</p>
<p>Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his
first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the
world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything
else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on
the Gryffindor House team.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before
they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had
finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was
perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling
extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several
gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely
pursued by Crookshanks.</p>
<p>Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the
family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, “So —
have you heard from Sirius lately?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked around, listening closely.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry softly, “twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him
yesterday. He might write back while I’m here.”</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a
moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar
hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him . . . but he
really didn’t want to worry them just now, not when he himself was
feeling so happy and peaceful.</p>
<p>“Look at the time,” Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her
wristwatch. “You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you — you’ll
be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your
school list out, I’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley.
I’m getting everyone else’s. There might not be time after the World
Cup, the match went on for five days last time.”</p>
<p>“Wow — hope it does this time!” said Harry enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Well, I certainly don’t,” said Percy sanctimoniously. “I shudder to
think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for
five days.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?” said
Fred.</p>
<p>“That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!” said Percy, going very
red in the face. “It was nothing personal!”</p>
<p>“It was,” Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. “We
sent it.”</p>
