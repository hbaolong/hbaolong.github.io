<h4 id="chapter-fifteen">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h4>
<p>THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE</p>
<p>Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the
tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and
resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried
Mad-Eye Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the
bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would
have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge’s door. Then
he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what
they were going to do next.</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too
long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took
them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the
enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron
obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show
they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a
small market town.</p>
<p>Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of
trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry
ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This,
however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an
unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies
made him freeze where he stood.</p>
<p>“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested Ron, when Harry
arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the
single word, dementors.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t . . . make one,” he panted, clutching the stitch in his
side. “Wouldn’t . . . come.”</p>
<p>Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel
ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors
gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing
cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he
was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry’s
willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless
dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see
them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they
went.</p>
<p>“So we still haven’t got any food.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Ron,” snapped Hermione. “Harry, what happened? Why do you
think you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly
yesterday!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated
by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him.
Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been thirteen
years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.</p>
<p>Ron kicked a chair leg.</p>
<p>“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had since I
bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!”</p>
<p>“You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said Harry,
stung.</p>
<p>“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”</p>
<p>“That’s convenient.”</p>
<p>“And what’s that supposed to — ?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and
startling both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket! Come
on,” she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not
react, “the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!”</p>
<p>She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his
head. The moment it parted contact with Harry’s skin he felt free and
oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there
was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations
lifted.</p>
<p>“Better?” asked Hermione.</p>
<p>“Yeah, loads better!”</p>
<p>“Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind
of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, “you don’t think
you’ve been possessed, do you?”</p>
<p>“What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything we’ve done
while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been
possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t
remember anything.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket. “Well,
maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.”</p>
<p>“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated firmly.
“If we lose it, if it gets stolen —”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it around
her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt.
“But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.”</p>
<p>“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can we
please get some food?”</p>
<p>“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said Hermione with
half a glance at Harry. “There’s no point staying where we know
dementors are swooping around.”</p>
<p>In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field
belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs
and bread.</p>
<p>“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as
they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money under
the chicken coop?”</p>
<p>Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “’Er-my-nee,
’oo worry ’oo much. ’Elax!”</p>
<p>And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably
well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter
that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first
of the three night watches.</p>
<p>This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach
meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least
surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at
the Dursleys’. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when
they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her
temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour.
Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day,
courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made
him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided
with Ron’s turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.</p>
<p>“So where next?” was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have
any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans
while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry
and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might
find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already
got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no
new information.</p>
<p>As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden
the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort
of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or
visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts,
where he had been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after
completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile:
These formed the basis of their speculations.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to
search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically.</p>
<p>“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his
Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the
snake is the sixth,” said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not in Albania,
it’s usually with Vol —”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”</p>
<p>“Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who — happy?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry,
who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to
break the nasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects,
they would’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.”</p>
<p>Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at
him, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden something at
Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed.</p>
<p>“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”</p>
<p>Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this
theory.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of
Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol —”</p>
<p>“Oi!”</p>
<p>“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If there
was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was
Hogwarts!”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant
he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left
—”</p>
<p>“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?” inquired
Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry
was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.</p>
<p>“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job
after he left,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find
something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another
Horcrux?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got
the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the
school!”</p>
<p>“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden
beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which
Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered
from their records that the place had been demolished many years before.
They visited its site and found a tower block of offices.</p>
<p>“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested
halfheartedly.</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had known it
all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been
determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul
there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or
mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as
far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a
building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and
marble floors.</p>
<p>Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the
countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for
security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues
to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded
spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of
cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a
sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the
Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse,
slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music
stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and
anxiety.</p>
<p>Harry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when
he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting
to the pain.</p>
<p>“What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry
wince.</p>
<p>“A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. The thief who
stole from Gregorovitch.”</p>
<p>And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment.
Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest
of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a
television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the
time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was
dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose
name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he
did. As Harry’s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy
swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of
pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at
the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they
were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.</p>
<p>As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and
Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several
times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and
twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away,
heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they
realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting
wood or water.</p>
<p>Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come
on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they
thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron
was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to
fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In
desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only
one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the
others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it.</p>
<p>Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it: They
were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists
joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their
troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying
edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing
isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total ignorance
of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.</p>
<p>“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a
riverbank in Wales, “can make good food appear out of thin air.”</p>
<p>He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate.
Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he had expected,
the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down
the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve
slightly when the time came to take off the locket.</p>
<p>“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No
one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s
Law of Elemental Transfigur —”</p>
<p>“Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone out
from between his teeth.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it
if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the
quantity if you’ve already got some —”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m always
the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl, I
suppose!”</p>
<p>“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot back
Ron.</p>
<p>Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto
the floor.</p>
<p>“You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients
and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here
and pull faces and moan and you can see how you —”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands.
“Shut up now!”</p>
<p>Hermione looked outraged.</p>
<p>“How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook —”</p>
<p>“Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!”</p>
<p>He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to
talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he
heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not
moving.</p>
<p>“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to
Hermione.</p>
<p>“I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling
and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be able to hear or
see us, whoever they are.”</p>
<p>Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged
stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the
steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had
pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they
had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total
darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches
and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses
were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time.</p>
<p>The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men
reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than
twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for
sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after
a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry
and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into
their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.</p>
<p>Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.</p>
<p>“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too
early in the season? Accio Salmon!”</p>
<p>There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of
fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the
Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he
could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any
human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue,
a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two
speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other.</p>
<p>A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large
shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking
salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking
of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.</p>
<p>“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”</p>
<p>Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English.</p>
<p>“So, you three have been on the run how long?” asked a new, mellow,
and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a
round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.</p>
<p>“Six weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up
with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk
not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There was a pause, while
knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the
ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” continued the man.</p>
<p>“Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry
suddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. “Heard Death Eaters were in
the area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to
register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter
of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay,
she’s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago,
son?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at
each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they
recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.</p>
<p>“Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man.</p>
<p>“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I’ve got
no proof he was a wizard, though.”</p>
<p>There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching;
then Ted spoke again.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but
surprised. Word was you’d been caught.”</p>
<p>“I was,” said Dirk. “I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for
it, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you’d
think; I don’t reckon he’s quite right at the moment. Might be
Confunded. If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who
did it, probably saved my life.”</p>
<p>There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river
rushed on. Then Ted said, “And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the
impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.”</p>
<p>“You had a false impression,” said the higher-voiced of the goblins.
“We take no sides. This is a wizards’ war.”</p>
<p>“How come you’re in hiding, then?”</p>
<p>“I deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin. “Having refused
what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal
safety was in jeopardy.”</p>
<p>“What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted.</p>
<p>“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin,
his voice rougher and less human as he said it. “I am not a
house-elf.”</p>
<p>“What about you, Griphook?”</p>
<p>“Similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. “Gringotts is no
longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding
master.”</p>
<p>He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk
laughed.</p>
<p>“What’s the joke?” asked Dean.</p>
<p>“He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards don’t
recognize, either.”</p>
<p>There was a short pause.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it,” said Dean.</p>
<p>“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English.</p>
<p>“Good man — goblin, I should say,” amended Ted hastily. “Didn’t
manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults,
I suppose?”</p>
<p>“If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,” replied
Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.</p>
<p>“Dean and I are still missing something here,” said Ted.</p>
<p>“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and
the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry’s
breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each
other, listening as hard as they could.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About the kids who
tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at
Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his
every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>“Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, was it?”</p>
<p>“Hardly,” chortled Dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard about it
from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to
take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.”</p>
<p>Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching
the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.</p>
<p>“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed open
the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught
them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.”</p>
<p>“Ah, God bless ’em,” said Ted. “What did they think, that they’d be
able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself?”</p>
<p>“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape
decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of days
later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it
down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.”</p>
<p>The goblins started to laugh again.</p>
<p>“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted.</p>
<p>“It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook.</p>
<p>“The sword of Gryffindor!”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — but it was
Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had
certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the
genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts
bank.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother telling the Death
Eaters this?”</p>
<p>“I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said Griphook
smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk’s laughter.</p>
<p>Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the
question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean
obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of
Ginny’s too.</p>
<p>“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal
it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook
indifferently.</p>
<p>“They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasleys
don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?”</p>
<p>“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said
Griphook.</p>
<p>“Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose we
should just be glad they’re still alive.”</p>
<p>“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked Dirk. “You believe
Snape killed Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>“’Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there and tell me
you think Potter had anything to do with it?”</p>
<p>“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk.</p>
<p>“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real thing —
the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said
Dirk, “me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things.
You’d think, if he knew anything we don’t, or had anything special going
for him, he’d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of
hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him
—”</p>
<p>“The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserve to be lied to if you’re
still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the
Quibbler.”</p>
<p>There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good
deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At
last he spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno
Lovegood’s?”</p>
<p>“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it a
look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not a
single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long
they’ll let him get away with it, mind, I don’t know. But Xeno says,
front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s against You-Know-Who
ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.”</p>
<p>“Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,” said
Dirk.</p>
<p>“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an
achievement,” said Ted. “I’d take tips from him gladly; it’s what we’re
trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With the
whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I’d have
expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they haven’t
already caught and killed him without publicizing it?”</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted.</p>
<p>There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and
forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to
sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the
trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then
clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who
had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer
they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, “Ginny —
the sword —”</p>
<p>“I know!” said Hermione.</p>
<p>She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it
right up to the armpit.</p>
<p>“Here . . . we . . . are . . .” she said between gritted teeth, and
she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag.
Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry
hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas
Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready
to cast a spell at any moment.</p>
<p>“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in
Dumbledore’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting against
the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he
hangs right beside the case!”</p>
<p>“Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath as
Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at
its center, cleared her throat, then said:</p>
<p>“Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?”</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black? Please
could we talk to you? Please?”</p>
<p>“‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas
Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:</p>
<p>“Obscuro!”</p>
<p>A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark eyes,
causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.</p>
<p>“What — how dare — what are you — ?”</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a
necessary precaution!”</p>
<p>“Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining
a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?”</p>
<p>“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze,
abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.</p>
<p>“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus’s
interest. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword
of Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that
in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted most
unwisely there —”</p>
<p>“Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus raised
supercilious eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side.
“Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the
extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!”</p>
<p>“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t Snape’s.”</p>
<p>“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus.
“Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her
punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!”</p>
<p>“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said
Hermione.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the
blindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me
from the house of my forebears?”</p>
<p>“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?”
asked Harry urgently.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work
for the oaf, Hagrid.”</p>
<p>“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly.</p>
<p>“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said Harry, “but
Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The
Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden
Forest, big deal!”</p>
<p>He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse
at the very least.</p>
<p>“What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone
else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been taken away for
cleaning or — or something?”</p>
<p>Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and
sniggered.</p>
<p>“Muggle-borns,” he said. “Goblin-made armor does not require
cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing
only that which strengthens it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps it
is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office?”</p>
<p>Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to
feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry
had a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore’s portrait — couldn’t you bring him along,
here, into yours?”</p>
<p>Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s
voice.</p>
<p>“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The
portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot
travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves
hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the
treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall
not be making a return visit!”</p>
<p>Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to
leave his frame.</p>
<p>“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please,
when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny
took it out, I mean?”</p>
<p>Phineas snorted impatiently.</p>
<p>“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its
case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.”</p>
<p>Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say
more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the
exit.</p>
<p>“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began
to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in
view when Harry gave a sudden shout.</p>
<p>“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?”</p>
<p>Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the
picture.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many
eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!”</p>
<p>And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but
his murky backdrop.</p>
<p>“Harry!” Hermione cried.</p>
<p>“I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the
air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down
the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel
hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s portrait back
into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag
aside and raised a shining face to Harry.</p>
<p>“The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that
which strengthen them — Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk
venom!”</p>
<p>“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he
wanted to use it on the locket —”</p>
<p>“— and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put
it in his will —”</p>
<p>“— so he made a copy —”</p>
<p>“— and put a fake in the glass case —”</p>
<p>“— and he left the real one — where?”</p>
<p>They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling
invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t
Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not
realized it at the time?</p>
<p>“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have left
it?”</p>
<p>“Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing.</p>
<p>“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione.</p>
<p>“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in there.”</p>
<p>“But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her.</p>
<p>“Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said
Hermione.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at
the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint,
about Snape’s trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden the sword well
away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon, Ron? Ron?”</p>
<p>Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron
had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a
lower bunk, looking stony.</p>
<p>“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk.</p>
<p>“You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.”</p>
<p>Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head,
apparently as nonplussed as he was.</p>
<p>“What’s the problem?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look at
Harry. “Not according to you, anyway.”</p>
<p>There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had
started to rain.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. “Spit it out,
will you?”</p>
<p>Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean,
unlike himself.</p>
<p>“All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down the
tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. Just add
it to the list of stuff you don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know?” repeated Harry. “I don’t know?”</p>
<p>Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it
pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river
chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation: Ron was
saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron,
“you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my
backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been
running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.”</p>
<p>“Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could
pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now
beating on the tent.</p>
<p>“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought I did too.”</p>
<p>“So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?” asked
Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d be
staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you
think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”</p>
<p>“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted Ron, standing up,
and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We thought Dumbledore
had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!”</p>
<p>“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain
thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.</p>
<p>“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm even
though he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with you from the
start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven’t
noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding
the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!”</p>
<p>“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high.
“Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t
been wearing it all day.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron.
“D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?
D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?”</p>
<p>“Harry, we weren’t —”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her. “You said it too, you said you were
disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than
—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say it like that — Harry, I didn’t!” she cried.</p>
<p>The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s
face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it
had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving
everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they
knew not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only
achievement was not, yet, to be dead.</p>
<p>“So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron.</p>
<p>“Search me,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Go home then,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward
Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they said about my
sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the Forbidden
Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t care what happens to her
in here — well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff —”</p>
<p>“I was only saying — she was with the others, they were with Hagrid
—”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my
family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear
that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I —”</p>
<p>“Not bothered what it meant, though?”</p>
<p>“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think it
means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think,
Ron, Bill’s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George
has lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with
spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant —”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself
about them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents
safely out of the way —”</p>
<p>“My parents are dead!” Harry bellowed.</p>
<p>“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.</p>
<p>“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over
your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and —”</p>
<p>Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was
clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.</p>
<p>“Protego!” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her
and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced
backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron
glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were
seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive
hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them.</p>
<p>“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a
nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Are you staying, or what?”</p>
<p>“I . . .” She looked anguished. “Yes — yes, I’m staying. Ron, we said
we’d go with Harry, we said we’d help —”</p>
<p>“I get it. You choose him.”</p>
<p>“Ron, no — please — come back, come back!”</p>
<p>She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed
it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and
silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the
trees.</p>
<p>After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her
face.</p>
<p>“He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated!”</p>
<p>She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.</p>
<p>Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it
around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s bunk and threw them
over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the
dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.</p>
