<h4 id="chapter-twelve">CHAPTER TWELVE</h4>
<p>SILVER AND OPALS</p>
<p>Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry caught sight of
the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at
meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he
was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the
lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the
lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had
felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.</p>
<p>Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to
Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be
allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the
school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was
always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.</p>
<p>Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving
stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his
textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in
anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt,
however, that the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making
hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the
more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and
shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation
with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes
scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the
crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.</p>
<p>Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self-invented
spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly
fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very
entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the
mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting
Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that
filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that
lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.
The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who
maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to
talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the
vicinity.</p>
<p>Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine
more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have
caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and
alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the
scribble:</p>
<p>Levicorpus (nvbl)</p>
<p>While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and
Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . .
. that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to
bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with
nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every
D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more
effective teacher than Snape so far.</p>
<p>Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward
flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone
had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced
Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as
though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.</p>
<p>“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and
Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed.
“Hang on — I’ll let you down —”</p>
<p>He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic,
trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one
cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the
counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might.</p>
<p>There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his
mattress.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to
roar with laughter.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the
alarm clock.”</p>
<p>By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several
of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves,
and gloves, Ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry’s new
spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in
regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.</p>
<p>“. . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the
bed again!” Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.</p>
<p>Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned
an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.</p>
<p>“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of
yours?” she asked.</p>
<p>Harry frowned at her.</p>
<p>“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Was it?”</p>
<p>“Well . . . yeah, it was, but so what?”</p>
<p>“So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation
and see what would happen?”</p>
<p>“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, preferring not
to answer the rest of the question.</p>
<p>“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic–approved,” said
Hermione. “And also,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes,
“because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit
dodgy.”</p>
<p>Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.</p>
<p>“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his
sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”</p>
<p>“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”</p>
<p>“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing.
And, er —”</p>
<p>“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.</p>
<p>“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.</p>
<p>“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”</p>
<p>This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use
the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that
particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful
possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be —
?</p>
<p>“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the
only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve
forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep,
helpless.”</p>
<p>Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the
behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his
aid.</p>
<p>“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were abusing it. Harry
and his dad were just having a laugh. You don’t like the Prince,
Hermione,” he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s
better than you at Potions —”</p>
<p>“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her cheeks
reddening. “I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing
spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking about
‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname,
and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!”</p>
<p>“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If he’d
been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being
‘half-blood,’ would he?”</p>
<p>Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been
pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry
about that later. . . .</p>
<p>“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough
pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most of
them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they
hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”</p>
<p>“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron
indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing
at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. “My whole family
are blood traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!”</p>
<p>“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. “We’d be best
pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in.”</p>
<p>This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a
distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.</p>
<p>“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.”</p>
<p>It was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name written upon it in
familiar thin, slanting writing.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Ginny . . . It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” Harry told Ron
and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its
contents. “Monday evening!” He felt suddenly light and happy. “Want to
join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she replied, waving at
them as she left.</p>
<p>Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the
names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process
took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with
his Secrecy Sensor.</p>
<p>“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?” demanded
Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. “Surely you
ought to be checking what we bring back IN?”</p>
<p>His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was
still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.</p>
<p>The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf
over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The
road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter
wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a
better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached
Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took
it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron
pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was
mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the
crowded shop.</p>
<p>“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm,
toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here all afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind them.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor
Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with
matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and
occupying at least a quarter of the shop.</p>
<p>“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said
Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. “It won’t do, m’boy, I’m
determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really —”</p>
<p>“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded Slughorn.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said Harry, who had
indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a
little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron
was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining
Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.</p>
<p>“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this
hard work!” said Slughorn. “But a little recreation never hurt anybody.
Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in this
weather. . . .”</p>
<p>“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor
Dumbledore that evening.”</p>
<p>“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, well . . . you
can’t evade me forever, Harry!”</p>
<p>And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little
notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said Hermione,
shaking her head. “They’re not that bad, you know. . . . They’re even
quite fun sometimes. . . .” But then she caught sight of Ron’s
expression. “Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would
last hours!”</p>
<p>Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more
interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have
done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione
asked him where he wanted to go next.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll be warm.”</p>
<p>They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the
sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the
sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was
lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The
exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside
the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his
rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other
Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer,
the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away,
leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were
barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.</p>
<p>“Mundungus!”</p>
<p>The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped
and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked
like the entire contents of a junk shop window.</p>
<p>“Oh, ’ello, ’Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing
stab at airiness. “Well, don’t let me keep ya.”</p>
<p>And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his
suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.</p>
<p>“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an
assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. “Gimme that!”</p>
<p>Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.</p>
<p>“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar —”</p>
<p>“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron’s hand
and stuffing it back into the case. “Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!”</p>
<p>Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat.
Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.</p>
<p>“Harry!” squealed Hermione.</p>
<p>“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who was almost nose
to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old
tobacco and spirits. “That had the Black family crest on it.”</p>
<p>“I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning
purple.</p>
<p>“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?”
snarled Harry.</p>
<p>“I — no —”</p>
<p>“Give it to me!”</p>
<p>“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn
blue.</p>
<p>There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s
throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then
— CRACK — he Disapparated.</p>
<p>Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see
where Mundungus had gone.</p>
<p>“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !”</p>
<p>“There’s no point, Harry.”</p>
<p>Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.</p>
<p>“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There’s no point
yelling.”</p>
<p>“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!”</p>
<p>“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this
piece of information. “You should get out of the cold.”</p>
<p>She watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks.</p>
<p>The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was nicking Sirius’s
stuff!”</p>
<p>“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are staring,”
whispered Hermione. “Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.”</p>
<p>Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few
minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.</p>
<p>“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry demanded of the other two
in a furious whisper. “Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything
that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?”</p>
<p>“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody
was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were
staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a
pillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know it’s your things
he’s stealing —”</p>
<p>Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he
owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t pleased to see
me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s the only
one who scares Mundungus.”</p>
<p>“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was
calming down. “Ron, what are you staring at?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry
knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid,
Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.</p>
<p>“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky,” said
Hermione waspishly.</p>
<p>Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently
considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius,
and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her
fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The
moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, “Shall we
call it a day and go back to school, then?”</p>
<p>The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was
getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks
tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves,
then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the
High Street. Harry’s thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the
road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her,
undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in
Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he
bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.</p>
<p>It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of
Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the
wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct
figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was
holding in her hand. “It’s nothing to do with you, Leanne!” Harry heard
Katie say.</p>
<p>They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast,
blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them,
Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged
it back and the package fell to the ground.</p>
<p>At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended
comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms oustretched, as though
she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. .
. . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes
were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.</p>
<p>Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her
eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling,
was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed;
Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie’s ankles, trying to tug
her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help,
but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she fell on top of them; Harry
and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could
hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she
thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.</p>
<p>Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.</p>
<p>“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the howling wind. “I’m
going for help!”</p>
<p>He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave
as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he
hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an
enormous bear on its hind legs.</p>
<p>“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into
which he had fallen.</p>
<p>“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and
beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin
visitin’ Grawp, he’s comin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ —”</p>
<p>“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something —”</p>
<p>“Wha’?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over
the raging wind.</p>
<p>“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry.</p>
<p>“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way . . .”</p>
<p>Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find
the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and
screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to
quiet her.</p>
<p>“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!”</p>
<p>“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I don’t know what
—”</p>
<p>Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down,
scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her.
Within seconds, Katie’s piercing screams had died away and the only
sound was the roar of the wind.</p>
<p>Hermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and put an arm around
her.</p>
<p>“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?”</p>
<p>“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now
sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal
a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry
seized his arm and pulled him back.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch it!”</p>
<p>He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of
the paper.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the thing. “It was on
display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed.
Katie must have touched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who had started to
shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of this?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in
the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at
Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said
it. . . . Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d been Imperiused and I didn’t
realize!”</p>
<p>Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder
gently.</p>
<p>“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?”</p>
<p>“No . . . she wouldn’t tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid
and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn’t listen and . . .
and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and — and —”</p>
<p>Leanne let out a wail of despair.</p>
<p>“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her arm still around
Leanne. “We’ll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his
face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and
picked it up.</p>
<p>“We’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said.</p>
<p>As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking
furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to
keep his thoughts to himself any longer.</p>
<p>“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and
Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was
hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we
followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!”</p>
<p>“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of people go to
Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the
girls’ bathroom?”</p>
<p>“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t
necessarily get it in the bathroom itself —”</p>
<p>“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly.</p>
<p>Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down
the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.</p>
<p>“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to
my office at once, please! What’s that you’re holding, Potter?”</p>
<p>“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took
the necklace from Harry. “No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she added
hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall
holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace to Professor Snape
at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!”</p>
<p>Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into
her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames,
and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate.
Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne.</p>
<p>“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?”</p>
<p>Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her
crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the
bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked
package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued
about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the
argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At
this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word
out of her.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, “go up to the
hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you
something for shock.”</p>
<p>When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to
Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</p>
<p>“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?”</p>
<p>“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione
could speak, “and then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I
see Professor Dumbledore, please?”</p>
<p>“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said Professor
McGonagall, looking surprised.</p>
<p>“Away?” Harry repeated angrily.</p>
<p>“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. “But anything
you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I’m
sure!”</p>
<p>For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not
invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating,
still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a
life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being
laughed at.</p>
<p>“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.”</p>
<p>On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on
the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit
of distance between herself and Harry.</p>
<p>“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said Professor
McGonagall, after a shocked pause. “Do you have any proof?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, “but . . .” and he told her about following Malfoy
to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him
and Mr. Borgin.</p>
<p>When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly
confused.</p>
<p>“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?”</p>
<p>“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend
something, he didn’t have it with him. But that’s not the point, the
thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was
that necklace —”</p>
<p>“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?”</p>
<p>“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him —”</p>
<p>“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked him if he wanted to
take it with him, and Malfoy said no —”</p>
<p>“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said Harry
angrily.</p>
<p>“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look carrying that down the
street?’” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,”
interjected Ron.</p>
<p>“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be all wrapped up,
so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak,
so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and
Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him
if he carried it down the street — and in any case,” she pressed on
loudly, before Harry could interrupt, “I asked Borgin about the
necklace, don’t you remember? When I went in to try and find out what
Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me
the price, he didn’t say it was already sold or anything —”</p>
<p>“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to
within about five seconds, of course he wasn’t going to tell you —
anyway, Malfoy could’ve sent off for it since —”</p>
<p>“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her
mouth to retort, looking furious. “Potter, I appreciate you telling me
this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely
because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been
purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people —”</p>
<p>“— that’s what I said —” muttered Ron.</p>
<p>“— and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place
this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this
school without our knowledge —”</p>
<p>“But —”</p>
<p>“— and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful
finality, “Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.”</p>
<p>Harry gaped at her, deflating.</p>
<p>“How do you know, Professor?”</p>
<p>“Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to
complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for
telling me your suspicions, Potter,” she said as she marched past them,
“but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell.
Good day to you all.”</p>
<p>She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past
her without another word.</p>
<p>Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall;
nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing
what had happened.</p>
<p>“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?”
asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.</p>
<p>“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever it was has had a
narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching
the necklace.”</p>
<p>“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said Harry. “Dumbledore
— the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their
top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted
him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided with Dumbledore. Or —”</p>
<p>“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve just turned
around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she? I was behind her
all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more
sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching
everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it
into the castle?”</p>
<p>“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, actually stamping
her foot in frustration.</p>
<p>“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. “Crabbe or Goyle
— or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he’ll have loads better
cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up —”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There’s no point
arguing with him.</p>
<p>“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.</p>
<p>The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was
quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have
returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no
buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie’s fate
had not yet spread.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about
it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good
armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. “The curse didn’t even
make it into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her
foot and offering it to the first year again. “It wasn’t very well
thought-out at all.”</p>
<p>“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s great thinkers?”
asked Harry.</p>
<p>Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.</p>
