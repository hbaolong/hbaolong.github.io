<h4 id="chapter-seventeen">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h4>
<p>CAT, RAT, AND DOG</p>
<p>Harry’s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays
of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long-shadowed
grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.</p>
<p>“Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing,
he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.</p>
<p>“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white. “He’ll be in worse trouble
if they know we’ve been to see him. . . .”</p>
<p>Hermione’s breathing was shallow and uneven.</p>
<p>“How — could — they?” she choked. “How could they?”</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.</p>
<p>They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep
themselves hidden under the Cloak. The light was fading fast now. By the
time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around
them.</p>
<p>“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest.
The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force
Scabbers deeper into his pocket. “What’s the matter with you, you stupid
rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me!”</p>
<p>“Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently. “Fudge’ll be out here
in a minute —”</p>
<p>“He won’t — stay — put —”</p>
<p>Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might,
trying to break free of Ron’s grip.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>
<p>But Harry had just seen — slinking toward them, his body low to the
ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks.
Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers’s
squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“Crookshanks!” Hermione moaned. “No, go away, Crookshanks! Go
away!”</p>
<p>But the cat was getting nearer —</p>
<p>“Scabbers — NO!”</p>
<p>Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s clutching fingers, hit
the ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after
him, and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the
Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.</p>
<p>“Ron!” Hermione moaned.</p>
<p>She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was
impossible to run full out under the Cloak; they pulled it off and it
streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could
hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.</p>
<p>“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —”</p>
<p>There was a loud thud.</p>
<p>“Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat —”</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right
in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in
his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.</p>
<p>“Ron — come on — back under the cloak —” Hermione panted. “Dumbledore
— the Minister — they’ll be coming back out in a minute —”</p>
<p>But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even
catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws. . . .
Something was bounding toward them out of the dark — an enormous,
pale-eyed, jet-black dog.</p>
<p>Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog had made an
enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over
backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth
—</p>
<p>But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him.
Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up;
he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.</p>
<p>Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed
Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around Ron’s outstretched
arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but
it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll —</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he
was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and
fall too.</p>
<p>Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes —</p>
<p>“Lumos!” he whispered.</p>
<p>The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased
Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were
creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop
them going nearer.</p>
<p>And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron
backward into a large gap in the roots — Ron was fighting furiously, but
his head and torso were slipping out of sight —</p>
<p>“Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped
lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.</p>
<p>All they could see now was one of Ron’s legs, which he had hooked
around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther
underground — but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron’s leg
had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.</p>
<p>“Harry — we’ve got to go for help —” Hermione gasped; she was
bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.</p>
<p>“No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t got time —”</p>
<p>“We’re never going to get through without help —”</p>
<p>Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like
knuckles.</p>
<p>“If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, darting here and
there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but
he couldn’t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range
of the tree’s blows.</p>
<p>“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly
on the spot, “please . . .”</p>
<p>Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering
branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the
trunk.</p>
<p>Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped
moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.</p>
<p>“Crookshanks!” Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped
Harry’s arm painfully hard. “How did he know — ?”</p>
<p>“He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly. “I’ve seen them
together. Come on — and keep your wand out —”</p>
<p>They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they
had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a
flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward,
headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low
tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the
light from Harry’s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside
him.</p>
<p>“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.</p>
<p>“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after
Crookshanks.</p>
<p>“Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked breathlessly from
behind him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. . . . It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map but Fred and
George said no one’s ever gotten into it. . . . It goes off the edge of
the map, but it looked like it ends up in Hogsmeade. . . .”</p>
<p>They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them,
Crookshanks’s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the
passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes. . . . All
Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to
him. . . . He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a
crouch. . . .</p>
<p>And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and
Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light
through a small opening.</p>
<p>He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both
raised their wands to see what lay beyond.</p>
<p>It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from
the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of
furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were
all boarded up.</p>
<p>Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.</p>
<p>Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was
deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy
hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm again. Her wide eyes were
traveling around the boarded windows.</p>
<p>“Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack.”</p>
<p>Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large
chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off
entirely.</p>
<p>“Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had moved
upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione’s grip on
Harry’s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. He raised
his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.</p>
<p>Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the
crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust
except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something
being dragged upstairs.</p>
<p>They reached the dark landing.</p>
<p>“Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their
wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they
heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud
purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod.</p>
<p>Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.</p>
<p>On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,
purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching
his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.</p>
<p>“Ron — are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Where’s the dog?”</p>
<p>“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. “Harry,
it’s a trap —”</p>
<p>“What —”</p>
<p>“He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . .”</p>
<p>Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a
snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The
waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked
like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius
Black.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at them.</p>
<p>Harry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their hands, high in the
air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were
fixed on Harry.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely. His
voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it.
“Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run
for a teacher. I’m grateful . . . it will make everything much easier. .
. .”</p>
<p>The taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as though Black had
bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry’s chest, leaving no place
for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his
hand, not to defend himself, but to attack . . . to kill. Without
knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden
movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and
held him back. . . . “No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified
whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.</p>
<p>“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!” he said
fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of
still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.</p>
<p>Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage that leg even
more.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully
to Harry to stay upright. “You’ll have to kill all three of us!”</p>
<p>“There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black, and his grin
widened.</p>
<p>“Why’s that?” Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron and
Hermione. “Didn’t care last time, did you? Didn’t mind slaughtering all
those Muggles to get at Pettigrew. . . . What’s the matter, gone soft in
Azkaban?”</p>
<p>“Harry!” Hermione whimpered. “Be quiet!”</p>
<p>“HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” Harry roared, and with a huge effort he
broke free of Hermione’s and Ron’s restraint and lunged forward —</p>
<p>He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and
skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all
Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and
that he didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but
Black didn’t raise the wands in time — one of Harry’s hands fastened
over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of
Harry’s other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and they fell,
backward, into the wall —</p>
<p>Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash
as the wands in Black’s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that
missed Harry’s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his
fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every
part of Black it could find.</p>
<p>But Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat —</p>
<p>“No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long —”</p>
<p>The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.</p>
<p>Then he saw Hermione’s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of
Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand
and Harry heard a faint clatter —</p>
<p>He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling
across the floor; he threw himself toward it but —</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk
themselves deep into Harry’s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks
now darted toward Harry’s wand —</p>
<p>“NO YOU DON’T!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that
made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned
—</p>
<p>“Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>They didn’t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip
bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron’s wands. Ron crawled
to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now
tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.</p>
<p>Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and
fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand
pointing straight at Black’s heart.</p>
<p>“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered.</p>
<p>Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black’s
chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black’s
left eye and his nose was bleeding.</p>
<p>“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but
his wand hand quite steady.</p>
<p>Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly. “But if you knew the whole
story —”</p>
<p>“The whole story?” Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears.
“You sold them to Voldemort. That’s all I need to know.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was a note of
urgency in his voice now. “You’ll regret it if you don’t. . . . You
don’t understand. . . .”</p>
<p>“I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry, and his voice
shook more than ever. “You never heard her, did you? My mum . . . trying
to stop Voldemort killing me . . . and you did that . . . you did it. .
. .”</p>
<p>Before either of them could say another word, something ginger
streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black’s chest and settled
himself there, right over Black’s heart. Black blinked and looked down
at the cat.</p>
<p>“Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.</p>
<p>But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black’s robes and wouldn’t shift.
He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with
those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.</p>
<p>Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on
the wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with
Black. . . . If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that
wasn’t Harry’s business. . . . If Black wanted to save it, that only
proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry’s parents. . . .</p>
<p>Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the
moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He
had to kill Black. This was his chance. . . .</p>
<p>The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand
poised, Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron’s ragged
breathing came from the bed; Hermione was quite silent.</p>
<p>And then came a new sound —</p>
<p>Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor — someone was
moving downstairs.</p>
<p>“WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly. “WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS
BLACK — QUICK!”</p>
<p>Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks;
Harry gripped his wand convulsively — Do it now! said a voice in his
head — but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still
hadn’t done it.</p>
<p>The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry
wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face
bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying
on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,
standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,
crumpled and bleeding at Harry’s feet.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” Lupin shouted.</p>
<p>Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione
was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room,
staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across
his chest.</p>
<p>Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t done it. His
nerve had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the
dementors.</p>
<p>Then Lupin spoke in an odd voice, a voice that shook with some
suppressed emotion.</p>
<p>“Where is he, Sirius?”</p>
<p>Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand what Lupin meant.
Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.</p>
<p>Black’s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn’t
move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed
straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked
bewildered.</p>
<p>“But then . . . ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it
seemed he was trying to read his mind, “. . . why hasn’t he shown
himself before now? Unless” — Lupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as though
he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could
see — “unless he was the one . . . unless you switched . . . without
telling me?”</p>
<p>Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin’s face, Black
nodded.</p>
<p>“Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going on — ?”</p>
<p>But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his
voice die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixedly at
Black. The professor walked to Black’s side, seized his hand, pulled him
to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black
like a brother.</p>
<p>Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.</p>
<p>“I DON’T BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.</p>
<p>Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off
the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. “You — you —”</p>
<p>“Hermione —”</p>
<p>“— you and him!”</p>
<p>“Hermione, calm down —”</p>
<p>“I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked. “I’ve been covering up for
you —”</p>
<p>“Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted. “I can explain
—”</p>
<p>Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh
wave of fury.</p>
<p>“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering out of
control, “and all the time you’ve been his friend!”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I haven’t been Sirius’s friend, but I am
now — Let me explain. . . .”</p>
<p>“NO!” Hermione screamed. “Harry, don’t trust him, he’s been helping
Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too — he’s a werewolf!”</p>
<p>There was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now on Lupin, who
looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.</p>
<p>“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he said. “Only one
out of three, I’m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the
castle and I certainly don’t want Harry dead. . . .” An odd shiver
passed over his face. “But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf.”</p>
<p>Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a
whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron
gasped,</p>
<p>“Get away from me, werewolf!”</p>
<p>Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to
Hermione and said, “How long have you known?”</p>
<p>“Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor Snape’s essay. . .
.”</p>
<p>“He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned that essay
hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant. . . . Did you check
the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or
did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw
me?”</p>
<p>“Both,” Hermione said quietly.</p>
<p>Lupin forced a laugh.</p>
<p>“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, Hermione.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit cleverer, I’d have
told everyone what you are!”</p>
<p>“But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the staff do.”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf?” Ron gasped.
“Is he mad?”</p>
<p>“Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to work very hard
to convince certain teachers that I’m trustworthy —”</p>
<p>“AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled. “YOU’VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE
TIME!” He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster
bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks
leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away
from both of them, dragging his leg.</p>
<p>“I have not been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll give me a
chance, I’ll explain. Look —”</p>
<p>He separated Harry’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s wands and threw each back
to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.</p>
<p>“There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt.
“You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you listen?”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick?</p>
<p>“If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a furious glance at
Black, “how did you know he was here?”</p>
<p>“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office
examining it —”</p>
<p>“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving his hand
impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony — that was my friends’
nickname for me at school.”</p>
<p>“You wrote — ?”</p>
<p>“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening,
because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak
out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed.
And I was right, wasn’t I?”</p>
<p>He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches
of dust rose at his feet.</p>
<p>“You might have been wearing your father’s old Cloak, Harry —”</p>
<p>“How d’you know about the Cloak?”</p>
<p>“The number of times I saw James disappearing under it . . . ,” said
Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. “The point is, even if you’re
wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map.
I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes
later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were
now accompanied by somebody else.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring
Harry’s interruption. “I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How
could he be with you?”</p>
<p>“No one was with us!” said Harry.</p>
<p>“And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius
Black. . . . I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of
you into the Whomping Willow —”</p>
<p>“One of us!” Ron said angrily.</p>
<p>“No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.”</p>
<p>He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.</p>
<p>“Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said evenly.</p>
<p>“What?” said Ron. “What’s Scabbers got to do with it?”</p>
<p>“Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?”</p>
<p>Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged,
thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him
escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black’s leg and made a soft hissing
noise.</p>
<p>Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he
gazed intently at Scabbers.</p>
<p>“What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking
scared. “What’s my rat got to do with anything?”</p>
<p>“That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly.</p>
<p>“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat —”</p>
<p>“No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.”</p>
<p>“An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter Pettigrew.”</p>
