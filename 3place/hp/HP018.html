<h4 id="chapter-one">CHAPTER ONE</h4>
<p>THE WORST BIRTHDAY</p>
<p>Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at
number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the
early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew
Harry’s room.</p>
<p>“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t
control that owl, it’ll have to go!”</p>
<p>Harry tried, yet again, to explain.</p>
<p>“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around outside. If I
could just let her out at night —”</p>
<p>“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling
from his bushy mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let
out.”</p>
<p>He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.</p>
<p>Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud
belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.</p>
<p>“I want more bacon.”</p>
<p>“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia,
turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We must build you up while we’ve
got the chance. . . . I don’t like the sound of that school food. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,”
said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?”</p>
<p>Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.</p>
<p>“Pass the frying pan.”</p>
<p>“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry irritably.</p>
<p>The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook
the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her
hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in
his temples.</p>
<p>“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean —”</p>
<p>“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the
table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?”</p>
<p>“But I —”</p>
<p>“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the
table with his fist.</p>
<p>“I just —”</p>
<p>“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER
THIS ROOF!”</p>
<p>Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
trying to heave Dudley to his feet.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Harry, “all right . . .”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.</p>
<p>Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon
had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment,
because Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as
not normal as it is possible to be.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were
unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry
felt.</p>
<p>He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache.
He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his
classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail
arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his
four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid,
in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,
especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the Wizarding world
(six tall goalposts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on
broomsticks).</p>
<p>All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and
top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a
cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come
home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House
Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to
the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework
done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of
magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having
a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had
even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from
carrying messages to anyone in the Wizarding world.</p>
<p>Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was
large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was
horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the
other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and
jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his
forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.</p>
<p>It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a
wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of
the reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years
before.</p>
<p>At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from
the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most
witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in
Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and
somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed
the instant he had failed to kill Harry.</p>
<p>So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her
husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding
why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the
Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had
killed his parents.</p>
<p>And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the
whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school,
where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the school year was
over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being
treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.</p>
<p>The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harry’s
twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never
given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely
. . .</p>
<p>At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,
“Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.”</p>
<p>Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.</p>
<p>“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,”
said Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle
Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He’d been talking of
nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming
to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him
(Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).</p>
<p>“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” said
Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in position at eight o’clock. Petunia,
you will be — ?”</p>
<p>“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting to welcome them
graciously to our home.”</p>
<p>“Good, good. And Dudley?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a foul, simpering
smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”</p>
<p>“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.</p>
<p>“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.
“And you?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not
there,” said Harry tonelessly.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them into the
lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen
—”</p>
<p>“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>“And, Dudley, you’ll say —”</p>
<p>“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Dudley,
offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.</p>
<p>“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.</p>
<p>“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,”
said Harry dully.</p>
<p>“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at
dinner. Petunia, any ideas?”</p>
<p>“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason. . . . Do tell
me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason. . . .”</p>
<p>“Perfect . . . Dudley?”</p>
<p>“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our hero at school,
Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’”</p>
<p>This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst
into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so
they wouldn’t see him laughing.</p>
<p>“And you, boy?”</p>
<p>Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.</p>
<p>“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,”
he said.</p>
<p>“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Masons
don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When
dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee,
Petunia, and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck,
I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. We’ll be
shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t think the
Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet
Drive.</p>
<p>“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley
and me. And you,” he snarled at Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way
while she’s cleaning.”</p>
<p>Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He
crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his
breath:</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to me . . . happy birthday to me . . .”</p>
<p>No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening
pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never
felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than
playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and
Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all.
Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said
he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.</p>
<p>Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s
cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it
wasn’t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use magic
outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was
only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that
stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his
wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had
enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley
tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the
long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from
the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and
now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.</p>
<p>What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch
or wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco
Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. . . .</p>
<p>Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of
last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord
Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he
was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.
Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it
had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking
in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now,
remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes —</p>
<p>Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been
staring absent-mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back.
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.</p>
<p>Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the
lawn.</p>
<p>“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward him.</p>
<p>The huge eyes blinked and vanished.</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had
been.</p>
<p>“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.</p>
<p>“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the days of the
week.”</p>
<p>“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come you haven’t got
any cards? Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?”</p>
<p>“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” said
Harry coolly.</p>
<p>Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat
bottom.</p>
<p>“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on
fire,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat
face.</p>
<p>“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic — he said he’ll
chuck you out of the house — and you haven’t got anywhere else to go —
you haven’t got any friends to take you —”</p>
<p>“Jiggery pokery!” said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus pocus —
squiggly wiggly —”</p>
<p>“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back
toward the house. “MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!”</p>
<p>Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the
hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done
magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head
with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the
promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.</p>
<p>While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry
cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower
beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The
sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he
shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very
thing Harry had been thinking himself . . . maybe he didn’t have any
friends at Hogwarts. . . .</p>
<p>Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as
he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down
his face.</p>
<p>It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he
heard Aunt Petunia calling him.</p>
<p>“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”</p>
<p>Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of
the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and
sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.</p>
<p>“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia,
pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen
table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.</p>
<p>Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment
he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. “Upstairs!
Hurry!”</p>
<p>As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of
Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just
reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s
furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>“Remember, boy — one sound —”</p>
<p>Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the
door, and turned to collapse on his bed.</p>
<p>The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.</p>
