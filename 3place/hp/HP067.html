<h4 id="chapter-ten">CHAPTER TEN</h4>
<p>MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to
pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible,
passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a
strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague “Merry
Christmas.”</p>
<p>“He’ll be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off
onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a person’s memory’s modified, it makes
him a bit disorientated for a while . . . and that was a big thing they
had to make him forget.”</p>
<p>They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the
Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of
witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys,
all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible.
Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue,
and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before
the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole
and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very
little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their
breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a
cry echoed along the lane.</p>
<p>“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front
yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her
face pale and strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched
in her hand.</p>
<p>“Arthur — I’ve been so worried — so worried —”</p>
<p>She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and the Daily Prophet
fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the
headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a
twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the
treetops.</p>
<p>“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing
Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, “you’re alive.
. . . Oh boys . . .”</p>
<p>And to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled
them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together.</p>
<p>“Ouch! Mum — you’re strangling us —”</p>
<p>“I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said, starting to
sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got
you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get
enough O.W.L.s? Oh Fred . . . George . . .”</p>
<p>“Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said Mr. Weasley
soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the
house. “Bill,” he added in an undertone, “pick up that paper, I want to
see what it says. . . .”</p>
<p>When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had
made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley
insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhisky, Bill handed his
father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy
looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I knew it,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Ministry blunders . . .
culprits not apprehended . . . lax security . . . Dark wizards running
unchecked . . . national disgrace . . . Who wrote this? Ah . . . of
course . . . Rita Skeeter.”</p>
<p>“That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!” said Percy
furiously. “Last week she was saying we’re wasting our time quibbling
about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if
it wasn’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for
the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans —”</p>
<p>“Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut up.”</p>
<p>“I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his
glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.</p>
<p>“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whisky. “If
I’d seen that, I’d have known you were alive!”</p>
<p>“Not by name,” said Mr. Weasley. “Listen to this: ‘If the terrified
wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the
wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were sadly
disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance
of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but refusing to
give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to
quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour
later, remains to be seen.’ Oh really,” said Mr. Weasley in
exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. “Nobody was hurt. What was I
supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods
. . . well, there certainly will be rumors now she’s printed that.”</p>
<p>He heaved a deep sigh. “Molly, I’m going to have to go into the
office; this is going to take some smoothing over.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come with you, Father,” said Percy importantly. “Mr. Crouch
will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in
person.”</p>
<p>He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset.</p>
<p>“Arthur, you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t got anything
to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go, Molly,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’ve made things worse.
I’ll just change into my robes and I’ll be off. . . .”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself,
“Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter for me, has she?”</p>
<p>“Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. “No . . . no, there
hasn’t been any post at all.”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at
both of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room,
Ron?”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . think I will too,” said Ron at once. “Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the
kitchen and up the stairs.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Harry?” said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of
the attic room behind them.</p>
<p>“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Harry said. “On Saturday
morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.”</p>
<p>Ron’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had
imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and
started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference
books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the
Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck.</p>
<p>“But — he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean — last time your
scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn’t he?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive,” said Harry. “But I was dreaming
about him . . . him and Peter — you know, Wormtail. I can’t remember all
of it now, but they were plotting to kill . . . someone.”</p>
<p>He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying “me,” but
couldn’t bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she
already did.</p>
<p>“It was only a dream,” said Ron bracingly. “Just a nightmare.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but was it, though?” said Harry, turning to look out of the
window at the brightening sky. “It’s weird, isn’t it? . . . My scar
hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and
Voldemort’s sign’s up in the sky again.”</p>
<p>“Don’t — say — his — name!” Ron hissed through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” Harry went on, ignoring
Ron. “At the end of last year?”</p>
<p>Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts.
Hermione’s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.</p>
<p>“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old
fraud says?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t there,” said Harry. “You didn’t hear her. This time was
different. I told you, she went into a trance — a real one. And she said
the Dark Lord would rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever
before . . . and he’d manage it because his servant was going to go back
to him . . . and that night Wormtail escaped.”</p>
<p>There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole
in his Chudley Cannons bedspread.</p>
<p>“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?” Hermione asked. “Are
you expecting a letter?”</p>
<p>“I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging. “I’m waiting
for his answer.”</p>
<p>“Good thinking!” said Ron, his expression clearing. “I bet Sirius’ll
know what to do!”</p>
<p>“I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“But we don’t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or
somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably. “Hedwig’s not going
to manage that journey in a few days.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his
stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.</p>
<p>“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,” said Ron.
“Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will
play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .”</p>
<p>“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-being-very-sensitive
sort of voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . .
He’s worried, and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll
get my Firebolt.”</p>
<p>Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much
like “Boys.”</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following
week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got
up, and returned well after dinner every night.</p>
<p>“It’s been an absolute uproar,” Percy told them importantly the
Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. “I’ve been
putting out fires all week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course,
if you don’t open a Howler straight away, it explodes. Scorch marks all
over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.”</p>
<p>“Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny, who was mending her
copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug
in front of the living room fire.</p>
<p>“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said Percy. “They want
compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher’s put in a
claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I’ve got
his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on
sticks.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry
liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the
time, but otherwise very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each
of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family’s names. There were
no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family
member might be. “Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there was
also “traveling,” “lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position
where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, “mortal peril.”</p>
<p>Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home” position,
but Mr. Weasley’s, which was the longest, was still pointing to “work.”
Mrs. Weasley sighed.</p>
<p>“Your father hasn’t had to go into the office on weekends since the
days of You-Know-Who,” she said. “They’re working him far too hard. His
dinner’s going to be ruined if he doesn’t come home soon.”</p>
<p>“Well, Father feels he’s got to make up for his mistake at the match,
doesn’t he?” said Percy. “If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make
a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first
—”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter
woman wrote!” said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.</p>
<p>“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was
disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,” said Bill, who
was playing chess with Ron. “Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good.
Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts Charm Breakers once, and
called me ‘a long-haired pillock’?”</p>
<p>“Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently. “If you’d
just let me —”</p>
<p>“No, Mum.”</p>
<p>Rain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had
bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a
fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick
servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at
his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out,
talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>“What are you two up to?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the
twins.</p>
<p>“Homework,” said Fred vaguely.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re still on holiday,” said
Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ve left it a bit late,” said George.</p>
<p>“You’re not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?”
said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly. “You wouldn’t be thinking of re-starting
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Now, Mum,” said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face.
“If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how
would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an
unfounded accusation?”</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Oh your father’s coming!” she said suddenly, looking up at the clock
again.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley’s hand had suddenly spun from “work” to “traveling”; a
second later it had shuddered to a halt on “home” with the others, and
they heard him calling from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Coming, Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room
carrying his dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted.</p>
<p>“Well, the fat’s really in the fire now,” he told Mrs. Weasley as he
sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically
with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower. “Rita Skeeter’s been ferreting
around all week, looking for more Ministry mess-ups to report. And now
she’s found out about poor old Bertha going missing, so that’ll be the
headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he should have sent
someone to look for her ages ago.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,” said Percy
swiftly.</p>
<p>“Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn’t found out about Winky,” said
Mr. Weasley irritably. “There’d be a week’s worth of headlines in his
house-elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark
Mark.”</p>
<p>“I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did
not conjure the Mark?” said Percy hotly.</p>
<p>“If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet
knows how mean he is to elves!” said Hermione angrily.</p>
<p>“Now look here, Hermione!” said Percy. “A high-ranking Ministry
official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants
—”</p>
<p>“His slave, you mean!” said Hermione, her voice rising passionately,
“because he didn’t pay Winky, did he?”</p>
<p>“I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that you’ve packed
properly!” said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. “Come on now,
all of you. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt over
his shoulder, and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even
louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans
from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in
the attic. Pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when
they entered. The sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent
him into a frenzy of excitement.</p>
<p>“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said Ron, throwing a packet across to
Harry. “It might shut him up.”</p>
<p>Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon’s cage,
then turned to his trunk. Hedwig’s cage stood next to it, still
empty.</p>
<p>“It’s been over a week,” Harry said, looking at Hedwig’s deserted
perch. “Ron, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?”</p>
<p>“Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron. “The Ministry
would want to show they’d caught someone, wouldn’t they?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I suppose. . . .”</p>
<p>“Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she’s
got some gold out of your vault for you . . . and she’s washed all your
socks.”</p>
<p>He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed and dropped the
money bag and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the
shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda
Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and
refills for his potion-making kit — he had been running low on spine of
lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into
his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.</p>
<p>“What is that supposed to be?”</p>
<p>He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon
velvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and
matching lace cuffs.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an
armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.</p>
<p>“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles. “Now, mind you
pack them properly so they don’t crease.”</p>
<p>“Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress,” said Ron, handing it out to
her.</p>
<p>“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley. “That’s for you. Dress
robes.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Ron, looking horror-struck.</p>
<p>“Dress robes!” repeated Mrs. Weasley. “It says on your school list
that you’re supposed to have dress robes this year . . . robes for
formal occasions.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Ron in disbelief. “I’m not wearing
that, no way.”</p>
<p>“Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “They’re all
like that! Your father’s got some for smart parties!”</p>
<p>“I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron stubbornly.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’ve got to have dress
robes, they’re on your list! I got some for Harry too . . . show him,
Harry. . . .”</p>
<p>In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It
wasn’t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn’t have
any lace on them at all — in fact, they were more or less the same as
his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of
black.</p>
<p>“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,” said
Mrs. Weasley fondly.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at Harry’s robes.
“Why couldn’t I have some like that?”</p>
<p>“Because . . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn’t
a lot of choice!” said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.</p>
<p>Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his
Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take
it.</p>
<p>“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly. “Never.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you
get a picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.”</p>
<p>She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny
spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an
