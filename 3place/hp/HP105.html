<h4 id="chapter-eleven">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h4>
<p>THE SORTING HAT’S NEW SONG</p>
<p>Harry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were having
the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he said nothing
about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door
behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help watching the silhouettes of
the horses moving beyond the window.</p>
<p>“Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?” asked Ginny. “What’s she
doing back here? Hagrid can’t have left, can he?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna. “He isn’t a very good
teacher, is he?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he is!” said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily.</p>
<p>Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said,
“Erm . . . yes . . . he’s very good.”</p>
<p>“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna,
unfazed.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the
wheels below them creaked into motion.</p>
<p>Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary, she
simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting
television program.</p>
<p>Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. When
they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on
either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forward to
try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid’s cabin by the
Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts
Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets,
jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery
bright above them.</p>
<p>The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to
the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned
again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was
definitely no sign of life within Hagrid’s cabin. Unwillingly, because
he had half hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead
upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night
air, their blank white eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that Ron
could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much
more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong
enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed, the
beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could Harry
suddenly see them, and why could Ron not?</p>
<p>“Are you coming or what?” said Ron beside him.</p>
<p>“Oh . . . yeah,” said Harry quickly, and they joined the crowd
hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.</p>
<p>The entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps
as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to
the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast.</p>
<p>The four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under
the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could
glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all along
the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the
Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one another,
exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other Houses,
eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes. Again Harry noticed people
putting their heads together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his
teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared.</p>
<p>Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and
left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats
together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the
Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last
two of whom gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him
quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before. He
had more important things to worry about, however: He was looking over
the students’ heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of
the Hall.</p>
<p>“He’s not there.”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no
real need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup.</p>
<p>“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.</p>
<p>“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly.</p>
<p>“You don’t think he’s . . . hurt, or anything, do you?” said Hermione
uneasily.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry at once.</p>
<p>“But where is he, then?”</p>
<p>There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville,
Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe he’s not back yet. You know
— from his mission — the thing he was doing over the summer for
Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it,” said Ron, sounding reassured, but
Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though
hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid’s absence.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?” she said sharply, pointing toward the middle of the
staff table.</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore,
sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long staff
table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a
matching hat. Dumbledore’s head was inclined toward the woman sitting
next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry thought,
like somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair
in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the
fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then she turned her face
slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of
recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy
eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s that Umbridge woman!”</p>
<p>“Who?” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!”</p>
<p>“Nice cardigan,” said Ron, smirking.</p>
<p>“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning. “What on earth’s
she doing here, then?”</p>
<p>“Dunno . . .”</p>
<p>Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not . . .”</p>
<p>Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask;
his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had
just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the
very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid’s. That meant
that the first years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle,
and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the entrance hall
opened. A long line of scared-looking first years entered, led by
Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient
wizard’s hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed
brim.</p>
<p>The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first years lined
up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and
Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then
stood back.</p>
<p>The first years’ faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy
right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling. Harry
recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood there,
waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which House he
belonged.</p>
<p>The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the
hat’s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into
song:</p>
<p>In times of old when I was new</p>
<p>And Hogwarts barely started</p>
<p>The founders of our noble school</p>
<p>Thought never to be parted:</p>
<p>United by a common goal,</p>
<p>They had the selfsame yearning,</p>
<p>To make the world’s best magic school</p>
<p>And pass along their learning.</p>
<p>“Together we will build and teach!”</p>
<p>The four good friends decided</p>
<p>And never did they dream that they</p>
<p>Might someday be divided,</p>
<p>For were there such friends anywhere</p>
<p>As Slytherin and Gryffindor?</p>
<p>Unless it was the second pair</p>
<p>Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?</p>
<p>So how could it have gone so wrong?</p>
<p>How could such friendships fail?</p>
<p>Why, I was there and so can tell</p>
<p>The whole sad, sorry tale.</p>
<p>Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those</p>
<p>Whose ancestry is purest.”</p>
<p>Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose</p>
<p>Intelligence is surest.”</p>
<p>Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those</p>
<p>With brave deeds to their name.”</p>
<p>Said Hufflepuff, “I’ll teach the lot,</p>
<p>And treat them just the same.”</p>
<p>These differences caused little strife</p>
<p>When first they came to light,</p>
<p>For each of the four founders had</p>
<p>A House in which they might</p>
<p>Take only those they wanted, so,</p>
<p>For instance, Slytherin</p>
<p>Took only pure-blood wizards</p>
<p>Of great cunning, just like him,</p>
<p>And only those of sharpest mind</p>
<p>Were taught by Ravenclaw</p>
<p>While the bravest and the boldest</p>
<p>Went to daring Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest,</p>
<p>And taught them all she knew,</p>
<p>Thus the Houses and their founders</p>
<p>Retained friendships firm and true.</p>
<p>So Hogwarts worked in harmony</p>
<p>For several happy years,</p>
<p>But then discord crept among us</p>
<p>Feeding on our faults and fears.</p>
<p>The Houses that, like pillars four,</p>
<p>Had once held up our school,</p>
<p>Now turned upon each other and,</p>
<p>Divided, sought to rule.</p>
<p>And for a while it seemed the school</p>
<p>Must meet an early end,</p>
<p>What with dueling and with fighting</p>
<p>And the clash of friend on friend</p>
<p>And at last there came a morning</p>
<p>When old Slytherin departed</p>
<p>And though the fighting then died out</p>
<p>He left us quite downhearted.</p>
<p>And never since the founders four</p>
<p>Were whittled down to three</p>
<p>Have the Houses been united</p>
<p>As they once were meant to be.</p>
<p>And now the Sorting Hat is here</p>
<p>And you all know the score:</p>
<p>I sort you into Houses</p>
<p>Because that is what I’m for,</p>
<p>But this year I’ll go further,</p>
<p>Listen closely to my song:</p>
<p>Though condemned I am to split you</p>
<p>Still I worry that it’s wrong,</p>
<p>Though I must fulfill my duty</p>
<p>And must quarter every year</p>
<p>Still I wonder whether Sorting</p>
<p>May not bring the end I fear.</p>
<p>Oh, know the perils, read the signs,</p>
<p>The warning history shows,</p>
<p>For our Hogwarts is in danger</p>
<p>From external, deadly foes</p>
<p>And we must unite inside her</p>
<p>Or we’ll crumble from within.</p>
<p>I have told you, I have warned you. . . .</p>
<p>Let the Sorting now begin.</p>
<p>The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it
was punctured, for the first time in Harry’s memory, with muttering and
whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging remarks
with their neighbors and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew
exactly what they were talking about.</p>
<p>“Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows
raised.</p>
<p>“Too right it has,” said Harry.</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different
qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own
role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give
the school advice before.</p>
<p>“I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said Hermione,
sounding slightly anxious.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning
across Neville toward her (Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable to
have a ghost lean through you). “The hat feels itself honor-bound to
give the school due warning whenever it feels —”</p>
<p>But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of
first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look
that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his
lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt
end. With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables,
Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and
called out,</p>
<p>“Abercrombie, Euan.”</p>
<p>The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forward
and put the hat on his head; it was only prevented from falling right
down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat considered for
a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted,
“GRYFFINDOR!”</p>
<p>Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan
Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he
would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at
again.</p>
<p>Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between
the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s
stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into
Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and
marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet.</p>
<p>Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all,
whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster. Between the
absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had
felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of
unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at
least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet
them all before the start-of-term feast.</p>
<p>“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms
stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, “welcome! To our old
hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech making, but this is not
it. Tuck in!”</p>
<p>There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as
Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so
as to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of
nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and
pies and dishes of vegetables, bread, sauces, and flagons of pumpkin
juice.</p>
<p>“Excellent,” said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized
the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate, watched
wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.</p>
<p>“What were you saying before the Sorting?” Hermione asked the ghost.
“About the hat giving warnings?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from
Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm.
“Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before, always at times
when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of
course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong from
within.”</p>
<p>“Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?” said Ron.</p>
<p>His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement for
him to make any noise at all.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?” said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while
Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, “How
can it know if the school’s in danger if it’s a hat?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “Of course, it lives in
Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.”</p>
<p>“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said Harry, looking over
at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. “Fat
chance.”</p>
<p>“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said Nick reprovingly.
“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to
separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the
competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of
seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.”</p>
<p>“Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron.</p>
<p>Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.</p>
<p>“Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never
been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my
veins —”</p>
<p>“What blood?” asked Ron. “Surely you haven’t still got — ?”</p>
<p>“It’s a figure of speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed
his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. “I
assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like,
even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am
quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!”</p>
<p>“Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said Hermione, throwing a
furious look at Ron.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ron’s mouth was packed to exploding point again and
all he could manage was “node iddum eentup sechew,” which Nick did not
seem to think constituted an adequate apology. Rising into the air, he
straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end
of the table, coming to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and
Dennis.</p>
<p>“Well done, Ron,” snapped Hermione.</p>
<p>“What?” said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his
food. “I’m not allowed to ask a simple question?”</p>
<p>“Oh forget it,” said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent
the rest of the meal in huffy silence.</p>
<p>Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile
them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily
through his steak-and-kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favorite
treacle tart.</p>
<p>When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the
hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet once
more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster.
Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed was waiting
somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft. . . .</p>
<p>“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg
a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,”
said Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the forest in the
grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students
ought to know by now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged
smirks.)</p>
<p>“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the
four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not
permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other
things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened
to Mr. Filch’s office door.</p>
<p>“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased
to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of
Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor
Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”</p>
<p>There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during
which Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks;
Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would be
teaching.</p>
<p>Dumbledore continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will
take place on the —”</p>
<p>He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she was
not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when nobody
understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then Professor
Umbridge said, “Hem, hem,” and it became clear that she had got to her
feet and was intending to make a speech.</p>
<p>Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat back
down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as though he
desired nothing better than to listen to her talk. Other members of
staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor Sprout’s
eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair, and Professor
McGonagall’s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No new teacher
had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the students were
smirking; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge simpered, “for those kind
words of welcome.”</p>
<p>Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again,
Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to
himself; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her
stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gave another little
throat-clearing cough (“Hem, hem”) and continued: “Well, it is lovely to
be back at Hogwarts, I must say!” She smiled, revealing very pointed
teeth. “And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!”</p>
<p>Harry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked happy; on
the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being addressed as
though they were five years old.</p>
<p>“I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and I’m
sure we’ll be very good friends!”</p>
<p>Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely concealing
grins.</p>
<p>“I’ll be her friend as long as I don’t have to borrow that cardigan,”
Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent
giggles.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again (“Hem, hem”), but when
she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice. She
sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull
learned-by-heart sound to them.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young
witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts with which
you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful
instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wizarding community must
be passed down through the generations lest we lose them forever. The
treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be
guarded, replenished, and polished by those who have been called to the
noble profession of teaching.”</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow
staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGonagall’s dark
eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and
Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with Professor
Sprout as Umbridge gave another little “Hem, hem” and went on with her
speech.</p>
<p>“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something
new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is
as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and
decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged,
for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A
balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change,
between tradition and innovation . . .”</p>
<p>Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was
slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when
Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads
together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho
Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along from
Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile at the
Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at
Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he was
only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect’s
badge gleaming on his chest.</p>
<p>Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her
audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have
broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her speech.
The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and
Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though
judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste.</p>
<p>“. . . because some changes will be for the better, while others will
come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment.
Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas
others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward,
then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability,
intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs
to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be
prohibited.”</p>
<p>She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, though
Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only
once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in, but most had
been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to
more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding
properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most
illuminating,” he said, bowing to her. “Now — as I was saying, Quidditch
tryouts will be held . . .”</p>
<p>“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,” said Hermione in a low
voice.</p>
<p>“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” Ron said quietly, turning a
glazed face upon Hermione. “That was about the dullest speech I’ve ever
heard, and I grew up with Percy.”</p>
<p>“I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It explained a
lot.”</p>
<p>“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load of waffle to
me.”</p>
<p>“There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,” said Hermione
grimly.</p>
<p>“Was there?” said Ron blankly.</p>
<p>“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How
about ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be
prohibited’?”</p>
<p>“Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. “It means the
Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore
had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was standing
up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking flustered.</p>
<p>“Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. “Hey — hey you lot!
Midgets!”</p>
<p>“Ron!”</p>
<p>“Well, they are, they’re titchy . . .”</p>
<p>“I know, but you can’t call them midgets. . . . First years!”
Hermione called commandingly along the table. “This way, please!”</p>
<p>A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead
the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had not
appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at them. A
blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified, nudged Euan, and
whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie looked equally
frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the grin slide
off his face like Stinksap.</p>
<p>“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out
of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more
whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed
ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then he
hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed shortcuts,
and had soon left most of the crowds behind.</p>
<p>He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he
walked through much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone was
staring at him: He had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months ago
clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen
Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been time last term to
explain himself before everyone went home, even if he had felt up to
giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in
that graveyard.</p>
<p>He had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room
and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before
he realized that he did not know the new password.</p>
<p>“Er . . .” he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed
the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him.</p>
<p>“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily.</p>
<p>“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, and he turned to
see Neville jogging toward him. “Guess what it is? I’m actually going to
be able to remember it for once —” He waved the stunted little cactus he
had shown them on the train. “Mimbulus mimbletonia!”</p>
<p>“Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward them
like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which
Harry and Neville now climbed.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy
circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety
old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people
were warming their hands before going up to their dormitories; on the
other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up
on the notice board. Harry waved good night to them and headed straight
for the door to the boys’ dormitories; he was not in much of a mood for
talking at the moment. Neville followed him.</p>
<p>Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and
were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters
and photographs. They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but
stopped abruptly the moment they saw him. Harry wondered whether they
had been talking about him, then whether he was being paranoid.</p>
<p>“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.</p>
<p>“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in the
West Ham colors. “Good holiday?”</p>
<p>“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would
have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it.
“You?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than Seamus’s anyway, he
was just telling me.”</p>
<p>“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his Mimbulus
mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.</p>
<p>Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal of
ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was
quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, “Me
mam didn’t want me to come back.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.</p>
<p>“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas out of
his trunk, still not looking at Harry.</p>
<p>“But — why?” said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus’s mother was
a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come
over so Dursley-ish.</p>
<p>Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his
pajamas.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose . . . because of
you.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. His heart was beating rather
fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she . . . er
. . . well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too . . .”</p>
<p>“She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She thinks I’m a liar
and Dumbledore’s an old fool?”</p>
<p>Seamus looked up at him. “Yeah, something like that.”</p>
<p>Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down onto his bedside table,
pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk, and pulled on
his pajamas. He was sick of it; sick of being the person who was stared
at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any of them
had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things
had happened to . . . Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he
thought savagely.</p>
<p>He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but
before he could do so, Seamus said, “Look . . . what did happen that
night when . . . you know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all?”</p>
<p>Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who had been
bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still
and Harry knew he was listening hard.</p>
<p>“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted. “Just read the Daily
Prophet like your mother, why don’t you? That’ll tell you all you need
to know.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus.</p>
<p>“I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to me like that!”</p>
<p>“I’ll talk to you how I want,” said Harry, his temper rising so fast
he snatched his wand back from his bedside table. “If you’ve got a
problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can be
moved, stop your mummy worrying —”</p>
<p>“Leave my mother out of this, Potter!”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes traveled from Harry,
who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus,
who was standing there with his fists raised.</p>
<p>“He’s having a go at my mother!” Seamus yelled.</p>
<p>“What?” said Ron. “Harry wouldn’t do that — we met your mother, we
liked her . . .”</p>
<p>“That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily
Prophet writes about me!” said Harry at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face. “Oh .
. . right.”</p>
<p>“You know what?” said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look.
“He’s right, I don’t want to share a dormitory with him anymore, he’s a
madman.”</p>
<p>“That’s out of order, Seamus,” said Ron, whose ears were starting to
glow red, always a danger sign.</p>
<p>“Out of order, am I?” shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was
turning paler. “You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with about
You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do!” said Ron angrily.</p>
<p>“Then you’re mad too,” said Seamus in disgust.</p>
<p>“Yeah? Well unfortunately for you, pal, I’m also a prefect!” said
Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. “So unless you want
detention, watch your mouth!”</p>
<p>Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a
reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but with
a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled
the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed
and fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked
at Dean and Neville.</p>
<p>“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said
aggressively.</p>
<p>“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They don’t
know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough
to tell them.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!”
Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, your parents don’t get the Daily
Prophet, they don’t know our headmaster’s been sacked from the
Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he’s
losing his marbles —”</p>
<p>“My gran says that’s rubbish,” piped up Neville. “She says it’s the
Daily Prophet that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She’s canceled our
subscription. We believe Harry,” he said simply. He climbed into bed and
pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus.
“My gran’s always said You-Know-Who would come back one day. She says if
Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.”</p>
<p>Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Neville. Nobody else said
anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and
vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent.
Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing
fondly at his moonlit cactus.</p>
<p>Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed,
putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with Seamus,
whom he had always liked very much. How many more people were going to
suggest that he was lying or unhinged?</p>
<p>Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the
Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown
him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped
Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two of them were in
this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his
version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding
community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that
Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked. . .
.</p>
<p>They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron
got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he
wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure before
that time came.</p>
