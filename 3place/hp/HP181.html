<h4 id="chapter-nineteen">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h4>
<p>THE SILVER DOE</p>
<p>It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight.
Harry’s dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of
them, first through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a wreath of
Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody
had called out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping
around the tent was footsteps or voices.</p>
<p>Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was
huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the
light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted
with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.</p>
<p>“We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she
pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “I kept thinking I could hear
people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.”</p>
<p>Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the
silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.</p>
<p>“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The snow
in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . . But perhaps we ought to
Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?”</p>
<p>Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux,
and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual
tightness engulfed them; Harry’s feet parted company with the snowy
ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with
leaves.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as
Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles.</p>
<p>“The Forest of Dean,” she said. “I came camping here once with my mum
and dad.”</p>
<p>Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold,
but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the
day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue
flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be
scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though he was
recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression
reinforced by Hermione’s solicitousness. That afternoon fresh flakes
drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a
fresh dusting of powdery snow.</p>
<p>After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert
than usual. Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow that
Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As
darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to keep watch and
told her to go to bed.</p>
<p>Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing
all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness
deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He
was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as to watch
Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas
holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.</p>
<p>Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest.
Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they
would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their
innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other,
sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over
dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before
mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments had worked for
weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could not throw off the
feeling that something was different tonight.</p>
<p>Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had
fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent.
The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have
been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition. He had
just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make
out his fingers when it happened.</p>
<p>A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the
trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed
simply to drift toward him.</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised
Hermione’s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding,
the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing
came closer. . . .</p>
<p>And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It
was a silver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over
the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine
powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its
wide, long-lashed eyes held high.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her
strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had
been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this
moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for
Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he
would have staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him
alone.</p>
<p>They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned
and walked away.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come
back!”</p>
<p>She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her
brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling
second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a
trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not
Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.</p>
<p>Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she
passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and
deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that
when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then
she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.</p>
<p>At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him
once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he
opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.</p>
<p>Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was
still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when
he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence
had meant safety.</p>
<p>“Lumos!” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.</p>
<p>The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he
stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles
of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she
enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond
the reach of the wandlight, watching him?</p>
<p>He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green
light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this
spot?</p>
<p>Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but
all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface
glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.</p>
<p>He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected
his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the
thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross
. . .</p>
<p>His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the
pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool
with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a sword
with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryffindor was
lying at the bottom of the forest pool.</p>
<p>Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How
could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place
where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this
spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of
guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they
had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was
the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the
wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline,
for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the
same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his
attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.</p>
<p>He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio
Sword.”</p>
<p>It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy,
the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the
depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking
hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had
been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.</p>
<p>“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom,
indifferent, motionless.</p>
<p>What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had
told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true
Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the
qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry’s head
answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors
apart.</p>
<p>Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath
dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he
was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the
moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.</p>
<p>He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced
now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he
walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he
examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because
the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.</p>
<p>With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of
clothing. Where “chivalry” entered into this, he thought ruefully, he
was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not
calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.</p>
<p>An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a
pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and
yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his
underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his
wand, his mother’s letter, the shard of Sirius’s mirror, and the old
Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione’s wand at the
ice.</p>
<p>“Diffindo.”</p>
<p>It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: The surface of
the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As
far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he
would have to submerge himself completely.</p>
<p>Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water
warmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s wand on the
ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he was
about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he
jumped.</p>
<p>Every pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his lungs
seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the
frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently the water
lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb
feet. He only wanted to dive once.</p>
<p>Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second,
gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done,
gathered all his courage, and dived.</p>
<p>The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself
seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom
and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around the
hilt; he pulled it upward.</p>
<p>Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water
weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty
hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had
tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.</p>
<p>Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface,
but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing,
suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers
unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head,
and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do,
and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death’s. . . .</p>
<p>Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his
life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another
person was panting and coughing and staggering around. Hermione had come
again, as she had come when the snake attacked. . . . Yet it did not
sound like her, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of
the footsteps. . . .</p>
<p>Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity.
All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the
place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone:
Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his
head.</p>
<p>“Are — you — mental?”</p>
<p>Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry
the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet.
There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his
hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the
Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other.</p>
<p>“Why the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung
backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis,
“didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?”</p>
<p>Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared
with Ron’s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold,
he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water’s edge and
began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his
head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every
time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived
into the pool, he had saved Harry’s life.</p>
<p>“It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice
weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused.</p>
<p>“Y-you cast that doe?”</p>
<p>“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!”</p>
<p>“My Patronus is a stag.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.”</p>
<p>Harry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final
sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron again.</p>
<p>“How come you’re here?”</p>
<p>Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at
all.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve — you know — I’ve come back. If —” He cleared his throat.
“You know. You still want me.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure seemed to
rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had
just saved Harry’s life.</p>
<p>Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see
the things he was holding.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up
the sword for Harry’s inspection. “That’s why you jumped in, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get here?
How did you find us?”</p>
<p>“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s a
big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a
tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you
following.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t see anyone else?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Ron. “I —”</p>
<p>But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some
yards away.</p>
<p>“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to
the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I
wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!”</p>
<p>Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two
oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between
the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. The
ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see
no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still
holding the sword and the Horcrux.</p>
<p>“Anything there?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“So how did the sword get in that pool?”</p>
<p>“Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.”</p>
<p>They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting
a little in the light from Hermione’s wand.</p>
<p>“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron.</p>
<p>“One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry.</p>
<p>The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket was
twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated
again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill
Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long
discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all.
Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a
flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the
rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered
the sword, however, Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, you should do it.”</p>
<p>“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to
be you.”</p>
<p>He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that
the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the
sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain
kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.</p>
<p>“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway,
okay? Because whatever’s in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle
in the diary tried to kill me.”</p>
<p>“How are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terrified.</p>
<p>“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry. The
answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always
known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with
Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid
with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a minuscule
snake, curled upon the cold rock.</p>
<p>“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!”</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Harry. “Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been
months —”</p>
<p>“I can’t, Harry, I’m serious — you do it —”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>“Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away from the
locket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! I’m not making excuses, Harry,
for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and
Hermione, it made me think stuff — stuff I was thinking anyway, but it
made everything worse, I can’t explain it, and then I’d take it off and
I’d get my head on straight again, and then I’d have to put the effing
thing back on — I can’t do it, Harry!”</p>
<p>He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his
head.</p>
<p>“You can do it,” said Harry, “you can! You’ve just got the sword, I
know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it,
Ron.”</p>
<p>The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed,
then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the
rock.</p>
<p>“Tell me when,” he croaked.</p>
<p>“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing
his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the
contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have
been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry’s neck still
burned.</p>
<p>“One . . . two . . . three . . . open.”</p>
<p>The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the
locket swung wide with a little click.</p>
<p>Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark
and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet
and slit-pupiled.</p>
<p>“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.</p>
<p>Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the
frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly,
bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the empty
windows.</p>
<p>Then a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux.</p>
<p>“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!”</p>
<p>“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.
All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding trees,
the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least
loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best,
always, eternally overshadowed . . .”</p>
<p>“Ron, stab it now!” Harry bellowed: He could feel the locket
quivering in his grip and was scared of what was coming. Ron raised the
sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet.</p>
<p>Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like
two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly
distorted.</p>
<p>Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of
the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in
the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron
and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as
it burned, suddenly, white-hot.</p>
<p>“Ron!” he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with
Voldemort’s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face.</p>
<p>“Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of
your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your
presumption —”</p>
<p>“Presumption!” echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and
yet more terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before
Ron, who looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly
at his side. “Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside
Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One?
What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?”</p>
<p>“Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move: His eyes
were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected
in them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their
voices lifted in an evil duet.</p>
<p>“Your mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione
jeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to
exchange . . .”</p>
<p>“Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing,
nothing, nothing to him,” crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched
like a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a
close embrace: Their lips met.</p>
<p>On the ground in front of them, Ron’s face filled with anguish. He
raised the sword high, his arms shaking.</p>
<p>“Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled.</p>
<p>Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in
his eyes.</p>
<p>“Ron — ?”</p>
<p>The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there
was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around,
slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend himself: but there was
nothing to fight.</p>
<p>The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: There was
only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand,
looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat
rock.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do.
Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their
normal blue; they were also wet.</p>
<p>Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken
Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were
gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly.
The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had
been its final act.</p>
<p>The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his
head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold.
Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron,
and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign
that Ron did not throw it off.</p>
<p>“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that
Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she
didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even
spoke to each other. With you gone . . .”</p>
<p>He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that
Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them.</p>
<p>“She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I
reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I
thought you knew.”</p>
<p>Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped
his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked
to where Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had
run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his
own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry
approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I know I
was a — a —”</p>
<p>He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word
would swoop down upon him and claim him.</p>
<p>“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting the
sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.”</p>
<p>“That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled.</p>
<p>“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said
Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”</p>
<p>Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the
still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket.</p>
<p>“And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve got to do is
find the tent again.”</p>
<p>But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest
with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey back
seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake
Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the
tent, Ron lagging a little behind him.</p>
<p>It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only
illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the
floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did
not move until Harry had said her name several times.</p>
<p>“Hermione!”</p>
<p>She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her
face.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s
someone here.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Who — ?”</p>
<p>She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the
threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s
rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.</p>
<p>Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward
Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her
lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile and
half raised his arms.</p>
<p>Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of
him that she could reach.</p>
<p>“Ouch — ow — gerroff! What the — ? Hermione — OW!”</p>
<p>“You — complete — arse — Ronald — Weasley!”</p>
<p>She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his
head as Hermione advanced.</p>
<p>“You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and — weeks — oh,
where’s my wand?”</p>
<p>She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and he
reacted instinctively.</p>
<p>“Protego!”</p>
<p>The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: The force of
it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth,
she leapt up again.</p>
<p>“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm —”</p>
<p>“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he seen her
lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my
wand! Give it back to me!”</p>
<p>“Hermione, will you please —”</p>
<p>“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched. “Don’t
you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!”</p>
<p>She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a
malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several
steps.</p>
<p>“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come
back!”</p>
<p>“I know,” Ron said, “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really —”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re sorry!”</p>
<p>She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at
Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness.</p>
<p>“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to
be all right if you just say sorry?”</p>
<p>“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron
was fighting back.</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. “Rack your
brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds —”</p>
<p>“Hermione,” interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, “he
just saved my —”</p>
<p>“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and
weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew —”</p>
<p>“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the
first time, and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm
between them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re
looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew
I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been
like —”</p>
<p>“What it’s been like for you?”</p>
<p>Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon,
but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily
speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity.</p>
<p>“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I walked
straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t go
anywhere!”</p>
<p>“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a
chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that
she would unravel them for several years.</p>
<p>“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re everywhere — gangs trying to earn
gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there’s a reward
from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like
I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a
Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to
the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“What did you say to them?”</p>
<p>“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.”</p>
<p>“And they believed that?”</p>
<p>“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll,
the smell off him. . . .”</p>
<p>Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this
small instance of humor, but her expression remained stony above her
tightly knotted limbs.</p>
<p>“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit
pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of
me and they’d taken my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while
the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the
stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and
Disapparated. I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again” — Ron held
up his right hand to show two missing fingernails; Hermione raised her
eyebrows coldly — “and I came out miles from where you were. By the time
I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d
gone.”</p>
<p>“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice she
adopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been simply terrified.
Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think, what happened
there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake turned up, it nearly killed
both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about
a second.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored
him.</p>
<p>“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings
into perspective, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Hermione,” said Harry quietly, “Ron just saved my life.”</p>
<p>She appeared not to have heard him.</p>
<p>“One thing I would like to know, though,” she said, fixing her eyes
on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find us tonight?
That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not
visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.”</p>
<p>Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans
pocket.</p>
<p>“This.”</p>
<p>She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.</p>
<p>“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold
and fierce.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said Ron. “I don’t know
how it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because
I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to
the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard
you.”</p>
<p>He was looking at Hermione.</p>
<p>“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he held up the
Deluminator again, “came out of this.”</p>
<p>“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone somewhere
between skepticism and curiosity.</p>
<p>“My name. ‘Ron.’ And you said . . . something about a wand. . .
.”</p>
<p>Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: It had
been the first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of them
since the day he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking about
repairing Harry’s wand.</p>
<p>“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and it
didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I
clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light
appeared right outside the window.”</p>
<p>Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes
focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.</p>
<p>“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light
you get around a Portkey, you know?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically.</p>
<p>“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it,
then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden.</p>
<p>“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and
when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed
and then it . . . well, it went inside me.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly.</p>
<p>“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement
with his free index finger, “right to my chest, and then — it just went
straight through. It was here,” he touched a point close to his heart,
“I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I
was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I
Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow
everywhere. . . .”</p>
<p>“We were there,” said Harry. “We spent two nights there, and the
second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the
dark and calling out!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective
spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you.
I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping
bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show
yourselves when you packed up the tent.”</p>
<p>“No, actually,” said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under the
Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early,
because, as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.”</p>
<p>“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d
appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you,
so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went
inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still
couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves
in the end — and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.”</p>
<p>“You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply.</p>
<p>They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe
and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the
other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked
together.</p>
<p>“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you see who
was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I
can’t believe this! Then what happened?”</p>
<p>Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had
waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that something was
wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as
far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in.</p>
<p>“— and Ron stabbed it with the sword.”</p>
<p>“And . . . and it went? Just like that?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Well, it — it screamed,” said Harry with half a glance at Ron.
“Here.”</p>
<p>He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and
examined its punctured windows.</p>
<p>Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield
Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron.</p>
<p>“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare
wand?”</p>
<p>“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the
locket. “Oh — oh yeah.”</p>
<p>He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand
out of its pocket. “Here. I figured it’s always handy to have a
backup.”</p>
<p>“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “Mine’s
broken.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her
feet, and he looked apprehensive again.</p>
<p>Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed
back into her bed and settled down without another word.</p>
<p>Ron passed Harry the new wand.</p>
<p>“About the best you could hope for, I think,” murmured Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember those birds she set
on me?”</p>
<p>“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled voice from
beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled
his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack.</p>
