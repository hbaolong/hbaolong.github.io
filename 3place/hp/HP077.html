<h4 id="chapter-twenty">CHAPTER TWENTY</h4>
<p>THE FIRST TASK</p>
<p>Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it
was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his
foot instead of his sock. When he’d finally got all his clothes on the
right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her
at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating
breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until
Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her
out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and
about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk
around the lake.</p>
<p>Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione
still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.</p>
<p>“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,” she said
desperately, “and then we can worry about Karkaroff.”</p>
<p>They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think
of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever
occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry
pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to
work searching through the large pile.</p>
<p>“‘Talon-clipping by charms . . . treating scale-rot . . .’ This is no
good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. . .
.”</p>
<p>“‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic
that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells
can penetrate . . .’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry, throwing aside
Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.</p>
<p>He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down,
and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at
his elbow.</p>
<p>“Well, there are Switching Spells . . . but what’s the point of
Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something
that would make it less dangerous. . . . The trouble is, like that book
said, not much is going to get through a dragon’s hide. . . . I’d say
Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven’t got a hope, I
doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless you’re supposed to put the
spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they’re not
simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any of those in class, I only
know about them because I’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . .
.”</p>
<p>“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut up for
a bit, please? I’m trying to concentrate.”</p>
<p>But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry’s
brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn’t seem to allow
room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic
Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but dragons had no
hair . . . pepper breath . . . that would probably increase a dragon’s
firepower . . . horn tongue . . . just what he needed, to give it an
extra weapon . . .</p>
<p>“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship?” said
Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at
the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of
books. “Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common room . . . his fan
club’ll be here in a moment, twittering away. . . .”</p>
<p>And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed
past them, one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her
waist.</p>
<p>Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he
seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from
Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and
thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn’t do
it. It was the only place he had ever been happy . . . well, he supposed
he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn’t remember
that.</p>
<p>Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a
dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made
him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his
throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw
Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.</p>
<p>Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons . . . the only champion
who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff
would have told Fleur and Krum. . . .</p>
<p>“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry said, coming to
his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll catch
you up.”</p>
<p>“Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring —”</p>
<p>“I’ll catch you up, okay?”</p>
<p>By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric
was at the top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn’t
want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had
been quoting Rita Skeeter’s article at him every time he went near them.
He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the
Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from
them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.</p>
<p>“Diffindo!”</p>
<p>Cedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it
onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends
bent down to help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m coming, go on. . . .”</p>
<p>This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand
back into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into
their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of
everyone but himself and Cedric.</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced
Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. “My bag just split . .
. brand-new and all . . .”</p>
<p>“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Cedric, looking up.</p>
<p>“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick
came out to see where Cedric had got to. “They’ve got four, one for each
of us, and we’ve got to get past them.”</p>
<p>Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling
since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”</p>
<p>“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know. . . .”</p>
<p>“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid would be in trouble
if he told the truth. “But I’m not the only one who knows. Fleur and
Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons
too.”</p>
<p>Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and
books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and
there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me?” he asked.</p>
<p>Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn’t have
asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn’t have let
his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps Malfoy or
Snape . . .</p>
<p>“It’s just . . . fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all know now
. . . we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>Cedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious way when
Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and
saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.</p>
<p>“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you go.”</p>
<p>Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?</p>
<p>“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology —”</p>
<p>“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now.
What if Moody wanted to know how he’d found out about the dragons? Would
Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a
ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a
ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d be smaller, much less easy to see from
a height of fifty feet . . .</p>
<p>He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them
and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as
the normal one.</p>
<p>“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,” Moody said
quietly.</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction he had
expected at all.</p>
<p>“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.</p>
<p>He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In
Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming,
winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived
here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating
new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now,
however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects
that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an
Auror.</p>
<p>On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning
top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one
himself, though it was much smaller than Moody’s. In the corner on a
small table stood an object that looked something like an
extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming slightly. What
appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not
reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none
of them clearly in focus.</p>
<p>“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who was watching Harry
closely.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden
aerial.</p>
<p>“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies . . .
no use here, of course, too much interference — students in every
direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework. Been humming
ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it
wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s extra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a
mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,” he
added in a growl.</p>
<p>“And what’s the mirror for?”</p>
<p>“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I’m not
really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s when I
open my trunk.”</p>
<p>He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under
the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in
there, until Moody’s next question brought him sharply back to
earth.</p>
<p>“So . . . found out about the dragons, have you?”</p>
<p>Harry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he hadn’t told
Cedric, and he certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had
broken the rules.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his
wooden leg with a groan. “Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard
Tournament and always has been.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort of accident
that I found out.”</p>
<p>Moody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve been telling
Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you
can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have told their
champions everything they can. They want to win. They want to beat
Dumbledore. They’d like to prove he’s only human.”</p>
<p>Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around
so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.</p>
<p>“So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon
yet?” said Moody.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I don’t show
favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you some good, general advice.
And the first bit is — play to your strengths.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I say you’ve got
them. Think now. What are you best at?”</p>
<p>Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy,
really —</p>
<p>“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help —”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye
barely moving at all. “You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve
heard.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but . . .” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve
only got my wand —”</p>
<p>“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting
him, “is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what
you need.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?</p>
<p>“Come on, boy . . .” whispered Moody. “Put them together . . . it’s
not that difficult. . . .”</p>
<p>And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon
in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he
needed —</p>
<p>“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into the greenhouse
three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as
he passed her. “Hermione — I need you to help me.”</p>
<p>“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back,
her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush
she was pruning.</p>
<p>“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by
tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>And so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but headed for a free
classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects
fly across the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books
and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping like
stones to the floor.</p>
<p>“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .”</p>
<p>“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A great big
dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . Okay, try
again. . . .”</p>
<p>He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused
point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying
without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor
Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position
of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in
July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better
of him, “just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to
suffer.”</p>
<p>Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly
caught Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still
feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the
lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with
his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though
he wasn’t entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms —
perhaps the fly was just stupid.</p>
<p>He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the
empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the
teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. They would have
stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry
wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room.
Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and
went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully
empty.</p>
<p>At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace,
surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs,
an old set of Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last
hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm.</p>
<p>“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking
exhausted but very pleased.</p>
<p>“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,”
Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try
again, “threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once
more. “Accio Dictionary!”</p>
<p>The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room,
and Harry caught it.</p>
<p>“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.</p>
<p>“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s
going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be
in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly. “Just as long as you’re
concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better
get some sleep . . . you’re going to need it.”</p>
<p>Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that
evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full
measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school
was one of great tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday,
giving all the students time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure —
though of course, they didn’t yet know what they would find there.</p>
<p>Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were
wishing him good luck or hissing “We’ll have a box of tissues ready,
Potter” as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he
wondered whether he mightn’t just lose his head when they tried to lead
him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time
was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great
dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first
lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch . . . and
then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?),
Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of
people were watching.</p>
<p>“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now. . . .
You have to get ready for your first task.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with
a clatter.</p>
<p>“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be fine!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.</p>
<p>He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn’t seem
herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As
she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November
afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve got
wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . .
. The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the
worse of you. . . . Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around
the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees
behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a
tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons
from view.</p>
<p>“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor
McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, “and wait for your turn,
Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there . . . he’ll be telling you the — the
procedure. . . . Good luck.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the
entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.</p>
<p>Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool. She
didn’t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy.
Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his
way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry
entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling
the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had
forgotten how to do it.</p>
<p>“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him. “Come
in, come in, make yourself at home!”</p>
<p>Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure,
standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp
robes again.</p>
<p>“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said Bagman
brightly. “When the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering
each of you this bag” — he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook
it at them — “from which you will each select a small model of the thing
you are about to face! There are different — er — varieties, you see.
And I have to tell you something else too . . . ah, yes . . . your task
is to collect the golden egg!”</p>
<p>Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he
understood Bagman’s words, and then started pacing around the tent
again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t reacted
at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their
mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had
volunteered for this. . . .</p>
<p>And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could
be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing,
joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were
a different species. And then — it seemed like about a second later to
Harry — Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.</p>
<p>“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.</p>
<p>She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect
model of a dragon — a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its
neck. And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise,
but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame
Maxime had told her what was coming.</p>
<p>The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese
Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn’t even blink,
just sat back down and stared at the ground.</p>
<p>Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray
Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what
was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the
Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its wings as he
looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.</p>
<p>“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each pulled out the
dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you
are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave
you in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you’re first,
just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now .
. . Harry . . . could I have a quick word? Outside?”</p>
<p>“Er . . . yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the
tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees,
and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.”</p>
<p>“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially.
“Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you
know. I mean,” Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further,
“you’re the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to help . .
.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, “no — I — I
know what I’m going to do, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him.</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people
this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. “I’ve got a plan
worked out, I —”</p>
<p>A whistle had blown somewhere.</p>
<p>“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried
off.</p>
<p>Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it,
greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but
all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.</p>
<p>Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they heard
the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and
was now face-to-face with the living counterpart of his model. . . .</p>
<p>It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and
listening. The crowd screamed . . . yelled . . . gasped like a single
many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the
Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now
taken to retracing Cedric’s steps, around and around the tent. And
Bagman’s commentary made everything much, much worse. . . . Horrible
pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there,
very narrow” . . . “He’s taking risks, this one!” . . . “Clever move —
pity it didn’t work!”</p>
<p>And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar
that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and
captured the golden egg.</p>
<p>“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now the marks from the
judges!”</p>
<p>But he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were
holding them up and showing them to the crowd.</p>
<p>“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again.
“Miss Delacour, if you please!”</p>
<p>Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward
her than he had done so far as she left the tent with her head held high
and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at
opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other’s gaze.</p>
<p>The same process started again. . . . “Oh I’m not sure that was
wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. “Oh . . . nearly!
Careful now . . . good lord, I thought she’d had it then!”</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once
more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur’s
marks were being shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for the third
time, the whistle.</p>
<p>“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out,
leaving Harry quite alone.</p>
<p>He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way
his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear . . . yet
at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of
the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away. . . .</p>
<p>“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese
Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its
collective breath. “That’s some nerve he’s showing — and — yes, he’s got
the egg!”</p>
<p>Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had
finished — it would be Harry’s turn any moment.</p>
<p>He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of
marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked
out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo
inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the
enclosure fence.</p>
<p>He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly
colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at
him from stands that had been magicked there since he’d last stood on
this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the
enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled,
her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard,
thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard
ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly
or not, Harry didn’t know or care. It was time to do what he had to do .
. . to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was
his only chance. . . .</p>
<p>He raised his wand.</p>
<p>“Accio Firebolt!” he shouted.</p>
<p>Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn’t
worked . . . if it wasn’t coming . . . He seemed to be looking at
everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent
barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of
faces around him swim strangely. . . .</p>
<p>And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned
and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods,
soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him,
waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . .
Bagman was shouting something . . . but Harry’s ears were not working
properly anymore . . . listening wasn’t important. . . .</p>
<p>He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a
second later, something miraculous happened. . . .</p>
<p>As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the
crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored pinpricks below, and the
Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had left not
only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back where he
belonged. . . .</p>
<p>This was just another Quidditch match, that was all . . . just
another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly
opposing team. . . .</p>
<p>He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one,
gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the
dragon’s front legs. “Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics .
. . let’s go. . . .”</p>
<p>He dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew what it was going
to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been
released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away . . .
but Harry didn’t care . . . that was no more than dodging a Bludger. . .
.</p>
<p>“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and
gasped. “Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?”</p>
<p>Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his
progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if he kept this up, it
would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or it would be
breathing fire again —</p>
<p>Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time
he was less lucky — he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up
to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long
spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes —</p>
<p>He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from
the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep. . . . Now he zoomed
around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to him. . .
.</p>
<p>The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was too protective
of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her
wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to
move too far from them . . . but he had to persuade her to do it, or
he’d never get near them. . . . The trick was to do it carefully,
gradually. . . .</p>
<p>He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to
make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient
threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and
that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared. . .
.</p>
<p>He flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck now
stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its
charmer. . . .</p>
<p>Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation.
He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail
thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire
into the air, which he dodged. . . . Her jaws opened wide. . . .</p>
<p>“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, “come on,
come and get me . . . up you get now . . .”</p>
<p>And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at
last, as wide as those of a small airplane — and Harry dived. Before the
dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was
speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now
unprotected by her clawed front legs — he had taken his hands off his
Firebolt — he had seized the golden egg —</p>
<p>And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over
the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as
though somebody had just turned the volume back up — for the first time,
he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming
and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup —</p>
<p>“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at that! Our
youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to
shorten the odds on Mr. Potter!”</p>
<p>Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail,
and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagall,
Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him
toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance. He flew back
over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came
in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks. . . .
He had got through the first task, he had survived. . . .</p>
<p>“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall as he got
off the Firebolt — which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed
that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll need to see
Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score. . . . Over there,
she’s had to mop up Diggory already. . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it! An’ agains’
the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie said that was the wors’
—”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn’t blunder
on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand.</p>
<p>Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing
in its socket.</p>
<p>“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.</p>
<p>“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please . . .” said Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam
Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.</p>
<p>“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The
tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow
through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was
sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking
furiously all the while. “Last year dementors, this year dragons, what
are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky . . .
this is quite shallow . . . it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up,
though. . . .”</p>
<p>She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and
stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal
instantly.</p>
<p>“Now, just sit quietly for a minute — sit! And then you can go and
get your score.”</p>
<p>She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say,
“How does it feel now, Diggory?”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got
to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d
reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside —
Hermione, followed closely by Ron.</p>
<p>“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There were
fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear.
“You were amazing! You really were!”</p>
<p>But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry
as though he were a ghost.</p>
<p>“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that
goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to do you in!”</p>
<p>It was as though the last few weeks had never happened — as though
Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he’d been made
champion.</p>
<p>“Caught on, have you?” said Harry coldly. “Took you long enough.”</p>
<p>Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other.
Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize
and suddenly he found he didn’t need to hear it.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words out. “Forget
it.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve —”</p>
<p>“Forget it,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.</p>
<p>Hermione burst into tears.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her, bewildered.</p>
<p>“You two are so stupid!” she shouted, stamping her foot on the
ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of them
could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed away, now
positively howling.</p>
<p>“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry, c’mon, they’ll be
putting up your scores. . . .”</p>
<p>Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than
he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the
tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.</p>
<p>“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird
thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned it into a
dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of
him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of
worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well — the
dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have
him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried
this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance —
well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored,
and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire — she
put it out with a bit of water out of her wand. And Krum — you won’t
believe this, but he didn’t even think of flying! He was probably the
best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye.
Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the
real eggs — they took marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any
damage to them.”</p>
<p>Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure.
Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the
five judges were sitting — right at the other end, in raised seats
draped in gold.</p>
<p>“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry, squinting
up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in
the air. What looked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which
twisted itself into a large figure eight.</p>
<p>“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded. “I suppose she took marks
off for your shoulder. . . .”</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.</p>
<p>“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.</p>
<p>Next, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder
than ever.</p>
<p>Ludo Bagman — ten.</p>
<p>“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But . . . I got hurt. . . . What’s
he playing at?”</p>
<p>“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.</p>
<p>And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a
number shot out of his wand too — four.</p>
<p>“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy, biased scumbag, you
gave Krum ten!”</p>
<p>But Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if Karkaroff had given
him zero; Ron’s indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred
points to him. He didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt
lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it wasn’t just
Ron . . . those weren’t only Gryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it
had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the
school had been on his side as well as Cedric’s. . . . He didn’t care
about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.</p>
<p>“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said Charlie
Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school.
“Listen, I’ve got to run, I’ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore
I’d tell her what happened — but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah — and
they told me to tell you you’ve got to hang around for a few more
minutes. . . . Bagman wants a word, back in the champions’ tent.”</p>
<p>Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow
looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to
how he’d felt while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long
wait before he’d walked out to face it. . . . There was no comparison;
the wait had been immeasurably worse.</p>
<p>Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric’s
face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending
his burn. He grinned at Harry when he saw him.</p>
<p>“Good one, Harry.”</p>
<p>“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.</p>
<p>“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and
looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon.
“Now, just a quick few words. You’ve got a nice long break before the
second task, which will take place at half past nine on the morning of
February the twenty-fourth — but we’re giving you something to think
about in the meantime! If you look down at those golden eggs you’re all
holding, you will see that they open . . . see the hinges there? You
need to solve the clue inside the egg — because it will tell you what
the second task is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure?
Well, off you go, then!”</p>
<p>Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back
around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what
the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the
clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a
witch leapt out from behind them.</p>
<p>It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the
Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I wonder if you
could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you
feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely. “Good-bye.”</p>
<p>And he set off back to the castle with Ron.</p>
