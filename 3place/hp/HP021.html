<h4 id="chapter-four">CHAPTER FOUR</h4>
<p>AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS</p>
<p>Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet
Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’
house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first
time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it
shouted,“Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!” The ghoul in the attic howled and
dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small
explosions from Fred and George’s bedroom were considered perfectly
normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron’s, however,
wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that
everybody there seemed to like him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force
him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit
next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with
questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like
plugs and the postal service worked.</p>
<p>“Fascinating!” he would say as Harry talked him through using a
telephone. “Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of
getting along without magic.”</p>
<p>Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had
arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment
she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor
with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over
whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the
bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending
he hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley
offered him.</p>
<p>“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron
identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.
“Dumbledore already knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a trick,
that man. You two’ve got them, too,” he added, as Fred and George ambled
in, still in their pajamas.</p>
<p>For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.
Harry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King’s
Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books
he’d need for the coming year.</p>
<p>SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:</p>
<p>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk</p>
<p>Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart</p>
<p>Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry’s.</p>
<p>“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he said. “The
new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan — bet it’s a
witch.”</p>
<p>At this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and quickly busied
himself with the marmalade.</p>
<p>“That lot won’t come cheap,” said George, with a quick look at his
parents. “Lockhart’s books are really expensive. . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. “I
expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny’s things secondhand.”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” Harry asked Ginny.</p>
<p>She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her
elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry,
because just then Ron’s elder brother Percy walked in. He was already
dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest.</p>
<p>“Morning, all,” said Percy briskly. “Lovely day.”</p>
<p>He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost
immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster
— at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was
breathing.</p>
<p>“Errol!” said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a
letter from under its wing. “Finally — he’s got Hermione’s answer. I
wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the
Dursleys.”</p>
<p>He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to
stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on
the draining board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped open
Hermione’s letter and read it out loud:</p>
<p>“’Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there,</p>
<p>“’I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that
you didn’t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would
get Harry into trouble, too. I’ve been really worried and if Harry is
all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be
better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery
might finish your one off.</p>
<p>“‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’ — How can she be?” said
Ron in horror. “We’re on vacation! — ’and we’re going to London next
Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don’t we meet in Diagon Alley?</p>
<p>“‘Let me know what’s happening as soon as you can. Love from
Hermione.’”</p>
<p>“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then,
too,” said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. “What’re you all
up to today?”</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a
small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that
blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could
practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high. They
couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain
if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw
apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry’s Nimbus
Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron’s old Shooting Star
was often outstripped by passing butterflies.</p>
<p>Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over
their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he
had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he
stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.</p>
<p>“Wish I knew what he was up to,” said Fred, frowning. “He’s not
himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s
and he hardly gloated at all.”</p>
<p>“Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing Harry’s puzzled
look. “Bill got twelve, too. If we’re not careful, we’ll have another
Head Boy in the family. I don’t think I could stand the shame.”</p>
<p>Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother,
Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them,
but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt
working for the wizards’ bank, Gringotts.</p>
<p>“Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this
year,” said George after a while. “Five sets of Lockhart books! And
Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground
vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had
left him. Of course, it was only in the Wizarding world that he had
money; you couldn’t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He
had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he
didn’t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch
to a large pile of gold.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a
quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and
Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered
inside.</p>
<p>“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed. “We’ll have to buy some more
today. . . . Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!”</p>
<p>And she offered him the flowerpot.</p>
<p>Harry stared at them all watching him.</p>
<p>“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered.</p>
<p>“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron suddenly. “Sorry,
Harry, I forgot.”</p>
<p>“Never?” said Mr. Weasley. “But how did you get to Diagon Alley to
buy your school things last year?”</p>
<p>“I went on the Underground —”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there escapators? How
exactly —”</p>
<p>“Not now, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Floo powder’s a lot quicker,
dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never used it before —”</p>
<p>“He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred. “Harry, watch us first.”</p>
<p>He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up
to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.</p>
<p>With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred,
who stepped right into it, shouted, “Diagon Alley!” and vanished.</p>
<p>“You must speak clearly, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George
dipped his hand into the flowerpot. “And be sure to get out at the right
grate. . . .”</p>
<p>“The right what?” said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped
George out of sight, too.</p>
<p>“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you
know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly —”</p>
<p>“He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” said Mr. Weasley, helping himself
to Floo powder, too.</p>
<p>“But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and
uncle?”</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t mind,” Harry reassured her. “Dudley would think it was
a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don’t worry about that
—”</p>
<p>“Well . . . all right . . . you go after Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley.
“Now, when you get into the fire, say where you’re going —”</p>
<p>“And keep your elbows tucked in,” Ron advised.</p>
<p>“And your eyes shut,” said Mrs. Weasley. “The soot —”</p>
<p>“Don’t fidget,” said Ron. “Or you might well fall out of the wrong
fireplace —”</p>
<p>“But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and
George.”</p>
<p>Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo
powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath,
scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt
like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot
of hot ash.</p>
<p>“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed.</p>
<p>It felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed
to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he
tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel
sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly,
still spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were
slapping his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred
stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his
bacon sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again
wishing it would stop, and then —</p>
<p>He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his
glasses snap.</p>
<p>Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet,
holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where
he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in
the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop
— but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school
list.</p>
<p>A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained
pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down
from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and
rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark,
narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was
definitely not Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where
it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward
the door, but before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on
the other side of the glass — and one of them was the very last person
Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing
broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his
left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small
crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped
into the shop.</p>
<p>The man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the same
pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the
shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the
counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing,
Draco.”</p>
<p>Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I thought you were
going to buy me a present.”</p>
<p>“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his father, drumming
his fingers on the counter.</p>
<p>“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House team?” said Malfoy,
looking sulky and bad-tempered. “Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand
last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for
Gryffindor. He’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s famous . . .
famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead. . . .”</p>
<p>Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.</p>
<p>“. . . everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar
and his broomstick —”</p>
<p>“You have told me this at least a dozen times already,” said
Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. “And I would remind you
that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not
when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord
disappear — ah, Mr. Borgin.”</p>
<p>A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy
hair back from his face.</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr. Borgin in a
voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted — and young Master Malfoy, too —
charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and
very reasonably priced —”</p>
<p>“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said Mr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin’s face.</p>
<p>“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more
raids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside
pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a few — ah —
items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call. . .
.”</p>
<p>Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the
list.</p>
<p>“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?”</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled.</p>
<p>“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a
certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are
rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act — no doubt that flea-bitten,
Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it —”</p>
<p>Harry felt a hot surge of anger.</p>
<p>“— and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear
—”</p>
<p>“I understand, sir, of course,” said Mr. Borgin. “Let me see . .
.”</p>
<p>“Can I have that?” interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand
on its cushion.</p>
<p>“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy’s
list and scurrying over to Draco. “Insert a candle and it gives light
only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has
fine taste, sir.”</p>
<p>“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,
Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, “No
offense, sir, no offense meant —”</p>
<p>“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly
still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for —”</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all have
favorites, that Hermione Granger —”</p>
<p>“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard
family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Ha!” said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both
abashed and angry.</p>
<p>“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. “Wizard
blood is counting for less everywhere —”</p>
<p>“Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.</p>
<p>“No, sir, nor with me, sir,” said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.</p>
<p>“In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,” said Mr. Malfoy
shortly. “I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important
business elsewhere today —”</p>
<p>They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer
and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco
paused to examine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read, smirking,
the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not
Touch. Cursed — Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to
Date.</p>
<p>Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He
walked forward — he stretched out his hand for the handle —</p>
<p>“Done,” said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco —”</p>
<p>Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.</p>
<p>“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow
to pick up the goods.”</p>
<p>The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily
manner.</p>
<p>“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you
haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in your manor. . . .”</p>
<p>Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry
waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,
slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop
door.</p>
<p>Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had
emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of
shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and
Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display
of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with
gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him
from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy,
Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against
hope he’d be able to find a way out of here.</p>
<p>An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous
candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn’t help, as Harry
had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly
enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys’ fire. Trying
to stay calm, he wondered what to do.</p>
<p>“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear, making him
jump.</p>
<p>An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked
horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy
teeth. Harry backed away.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just —”</p>
<p>“HARRY! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded
down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the
Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes
flashing over his great bristling beard.</p>
<p>“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief. “I was lost — Floo powder —”</p>
<p>Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away
from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks
followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright
sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the
distance — Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon
Alley.</p>
<p>“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so
forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an
apothecary. “Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy place,
Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down there —”</p>
<p>“I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him
off again. “I told you, I was lost — what were you doing down there,
anyway?”</p>
<p>“I was lookin’ fer a Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent,” growled Hagrid.
“They’re ruinin’ the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?”</p>
<p>“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,” Harry
explained. “I’ve got to go and find them. . . .”</p>
<p>They set off together down the street.</p>
<p>“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said Hagrid as Harry jogged
alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid’s
enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.</p>
<p>“Lousy Muggles,” growled Hagrid. “If I’d’ve known —”</p>
<p>“Harry! Harry! Over here!”</p>
<p>Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the
white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy
brown hair flying behind her.</p>
<p>“What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid — Oh, it’s wonderful to
see you two again — Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?”</p>
<p>“As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a grin.</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street
were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Mr. Weasley panted. “We hoped you’d only gone one grate too
far. . . .” He mopped his glistening bald patch. “Molly’s frantic —
she’s coming now —”</p>
<p>“Where did you come out?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly.</p>
<p>“Excellent!” said Fred and George together.</p>
<p>“We’ve never been allowed in,” said Ron enviously.</p>
<p>“I should ruddy well think not,” growled Hagrid.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging
wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry — oh, my dear — you could have been anywhere —”</p>
<p>Gasping for breath, she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag
and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn’t managed to beat away.
Mr. Weasley took Harry’s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and
returned them, good as new.</p>
<p>“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by
Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley! If you hadn’t found him, Hagrid!”). “See
yer at Hogwarts!” And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than
anyone else in the packed street.</p>
<p>“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” Harry asked Ron and Hermione
as they climbed the Gringotts steps. “Malfoy and his father.”</p>
<p>“Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley sharply behind
them.</p>
<p>“No, he was selling —”</p>
<p>“So he’s worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. “Oh, I’d
love to get Lucius Malfoy for something. . . .”</p>
<p>“You be careful, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were
bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. “That family’s trouble.
Don’t go biting off more than you can chew —”</p>
<p>“So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?” said Mr. Weasley
indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of
Hermione’s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran
all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce
them.</p>
<p>“But you’re Muggles!” said Mr. Weasley delightedly. “We must have a
drink! What’s that you’ve got there? Oh, you’re changing Muggle money.
Molly, look!” He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in
Mr. Granger’s hand.</p>
<p>“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry
were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts
goblin.</p>
<p>The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that
sped along miniature train tracks through the bank’s underground
tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’
vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when
it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and
just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before
sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they
reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he
hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.</p>
<p>Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered
vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their
friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a
secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers
off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.</p>
<p>“We’ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your
schoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. “And not one
step down Knockturn Alley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating
backs.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled
street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in
Harry’s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large
strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as
they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron
gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of
Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink
and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they
met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on
Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny
junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks
covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small
and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.</p>
<p>“A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,” Ron read
aloud off the back cover. “That sounds fascinating. . . .”</p>
<p>“Go away,” Percy snapped.</p>
<p>“’Course, he’s very ambitious, Percy, he’s got it all planned out. .
. . He wants to be Minister of Magic . . .” Ron told Harry and Hermione
in an undertone as they left Percy to it.</p>
<p>An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no
means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached
it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors,
trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner
stretched across the upper windows:</p>
<p>GILDEROY LOCKHART</p>
<p>will be signing copies of his autobiography</p>
<p>MAGICAL ME</p>
<p>today 12:30 P.M. to 4:30 P.M.</p>
<p>“We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed. “I mean, he’s written
almost the whole booklist!”</p>
<p>The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around
Mrs. Weasley’s age. A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,
“Calmly, please, ladies. . . . Don’t push, there . . . mind the books,
now. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to
the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books.
They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and
sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with
Mr. and Mrs. Granger.</p>
<p>“Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless
and kept patting her hair. “We’ll be able to see him in a minute. . .
.”</p>
<p>Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded
by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly
white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of
forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard’s
hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.</p>
<p>A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs
with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every
blinding flash.</p>
<p>“Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a
better shot. “This is for the Daily Prophet —”</p>
<p>“Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had
stepped on it.</p>
<p>Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron — and then he
saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted,
“It can’t be Harry Potter?”</p>
<p>The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward,
seized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into
applause. Harry’s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the
photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the
Weasleys.</p>
<p>“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his own gleaming
teeth. “Together, you and I are worth the front page.”</p>
<p>When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could hardly feel his
fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw
an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for quiet. “What an
extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little
announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time!</p>
<p>“When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he
only wanted to buy my autobiography — which I shall be happy to present
him now, free of charge —” The crowd applauded again. “He had no idea,”
Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses
slip to the end of his nose, “that he would shortly be getting much,
much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in
fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have
great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be
taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”</p>
<p>The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented
with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under
their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the
edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron.</p>
<p>“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the
cauldron. “I’ll buy my own —”</p>
<p>“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice Harry had no
trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face
with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.</p>
<p>“Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go into a bookshop
without making the front page.”</p>
<p>“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the
first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at
Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” drawled Malfoy. Ginny
went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching
stacks of Lockhart’s books.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something
unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry
here, eh?”</p>
<p>“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” retorted
Malfoy. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for
all those.”</p>
<p>Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron,
too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back
of his jacket.</p>
<p>“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. “What
are you doing? It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.”</p>
<p>It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder,
sneering in just the same way.</p>
<p>“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.</p>
<p>“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy. “All those
raids . . . I hope they’re paying you overtime?”</p>
<p>He reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy
Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to
Transfiguration.</p>
<p>“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s the use of being a
disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for
it?”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.</p>
<p>“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,
Malfoy,” he said.</p>
<p>“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and
Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company you keep,
Weasley . . . and I thought your family could sink no lower —”</p>
<p>There was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went flying;
Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into
a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all
their heads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred or George;
Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, no!”; the crowd stampeded
backward, knocking more shelves over; “Gentlemen, please — please!”
cried the assistant, and then, louder than all —</p>
<p>“Break it up, there, gents, break it up —”</p>
<p>Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant
he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut
lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of
Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny’s old Transfiguration book. He
thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.</p>
<p>“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you
—” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept
from the shop.</p>
<p>“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting
Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. “Rotten ter the
core, the whole family, everyone knows that — no Malfoy’s worth
listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on now — let’s get
outta here.”</p>
<p>The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he
barely came up to Hagrid’s waist and seemed to think better of it. They
hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley
beside herself with fury.</p>
<p>“A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . .
. what Gilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought —”</p>
<p>“He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as we were leaving?
He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he’d be able to work
the fight into his report — said it was all publicity —”</p>
<p>But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the
Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would
be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to
the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the
other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but
stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face.</p>
<p>Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before
helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn’t his favorite way to
travel.</p>
