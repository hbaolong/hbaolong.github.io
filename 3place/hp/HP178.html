<h4 id="chapter-sixteen">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h4>
<p>GODRIC’S HOLLOW</p>
<p>When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he
remembered what had happened. Then he hoped, childishly, that it had
been a dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by
turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk. It was
like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped
down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron’s. Hermione,
who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning,
but turned her face away quickly as he went by.</p>
<p>He’s gone, Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to keep thinking it
as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of
it. He’s gone and he’s not coming back. And that was the simple truth of
it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it
would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them
again.</p>
<p>He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione’s eyes were puffy
and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their
things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their
time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he
was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps
through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the
trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around (for he could not
help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods,
another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron
saying, “We thought you knew what you were doing!”, and he resumed
packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.</p>
<p>The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill
over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would
usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked
the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more
reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated,
reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside.</p>
<p>The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s hand and walked
away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her
knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing
that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to
the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the
contemptuous expression on Ron’s face. Harry strode off through the
heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its
center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their
protection.</p>
<p>They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was
determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know
that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when
she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry
had started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by
wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would
reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to
the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However,
Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself
taking it out simply to stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory,
wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break
into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her,
hoping that she was all right.</p>
<p>By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible
locations of Gryffindor’s sword, but the more they talked about the
places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and
far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might,
Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he
might hide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he
was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you
were doing. . . . We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do. . . .
We thought you had a real plan!</p>
<p>He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had
left him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but
they had no means of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as
they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was
staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends’
offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew
nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert
for any indication that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had
had enough, that she was leaving.</p>
<p>They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took
to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a
chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron’s
departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them
again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find
out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear,
blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him,
because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They
relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas
Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first
Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and
they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions
about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.</p>
<p>However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing
a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had
been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge’s
old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any
unofficial student societies.</p>
<p>From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably
Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue
Dumbledore’s Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly
it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and
of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as
his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape’s
crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined
simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s
regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in
charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment.
But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there
was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into
Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry
of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by
slipping in leading questions about Harry and Hermione’s whereabouts.
Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this,
and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days
after these unceremonious good-byes.</p>
<p>The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any
one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where
a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to
meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet
pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with
chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where
snow half buried the tent in the night.</p>
<p>They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several
sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to
suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to
them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a
supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the
money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might
be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese
and tinned pears. He had also had the foresight to suggest that they
take a few hours’ break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over
the end of the bunk beside him.</p>
<p>“Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The
Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could
get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long; but evidently
she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman’s Syllabary
lay open on the arm of the chair.</p>
<p>Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the
occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor
McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he
had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.</p>
<p>“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and —”</p>
<p>“Harry, could you help me with something?”</p>
<p>Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and
held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.</p>
<p>“Look at that symbol,” she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above
what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read
runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what looked like a
triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.</p>
<p>“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.”</p>
<p>“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary,
either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t
think it is! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it
isn’t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?”</p>
<p>“No . . . No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the same
symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what I thought too!”</p>
<p>“Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.”</p>
<p>She stared at him, openmouthed.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Krum told me . . .”</p>
<p>He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding.
Hermione looked astonished.</p>
<p>“Grindelwald’s mark?”</p>
<p>She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. “I’ve never
heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it in anything
I’ve ever read about him.”</p>
<p>“Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at
Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.”</p>
<p>She fell back into the old armchair, frowning.</p>
<p>“That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing in
a book of children’s stories?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is weird,” said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour would
have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on
Dark stuff.”</p>
<p>“I know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All
the other stories have little pictures over the titles.”</p>
<p>She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry
tried again.</p>
<p>“Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking. I — I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”</p>
<p>She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure
she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think
we’ll have to.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear me right?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I think
we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be either.
It’ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it
seems it’s there.”</p>
<p>“Er — what’s there?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.</p>
<p>“Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want to go
back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor’s
birthplace —”</p>
<p>“Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?”</p>
<p>“Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?”</p>
<p>“Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months:
The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I might’ve opened it, you
know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, as the village is named after him I’d have thought you might
have made the connection,” said Hermione. She sounded much more like her
old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to announce
that she was off to the library. “There’s a bit about the village in A
History of Magic, wait . . .”</p>
<p>She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally
extracting her copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by
Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the page she
wanted.</p>
<p>“‘Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689,
wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they
formed their own small communities within a community. Many small
villages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded
together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth in
Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the
south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families
who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most
celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric’s
Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric
Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged
the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient
magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of
hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many
centuries.’</p>
<p>“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing the
book, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the
end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric
Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dumbledore would have
expected you to make the connection?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah . . .”</p>
<p>Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the
sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the
lure of the village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had
narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.</p>
<p>“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s
great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had
sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:</p>
<p>“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”</p>
<p>“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index finger over
Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic.
“Well, I suppose —”</p>
<p>She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew
his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand
forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing
there.</p>
<p>“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did you do that
for? I thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least
—”</p>
<p>“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore
entrusted it to her?”</p>
<p>Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old
woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it likely
that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If
so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance:
Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a
fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now,
however, was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione’s theory, not when
she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with Harry’s dearest
wish.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s
Hollow?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.” She was
sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan
again had lifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to practice
Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and
perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think
we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we’ll
need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think we’d better do
that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause,
but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time since he had
discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.</p>
<p>He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had
had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he
would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could have
invited friends to his house . . . He might even have had brothers and
sisters . . . It would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth
birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to
him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where
it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night,
Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione’s beaded bag, and
from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago.
For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his
parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he
had left of them now.</p>
<p>Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following
day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort
would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths, she
was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that
they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later
— once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who
were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating
while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together — that Hermione agreed
to make the journey.</p>
<p>They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it
was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry
transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his
small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their
possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his
neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione’s buttoned-up coat.
Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into
the suffocating darkness once again.</p>
<p>Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were
standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which
the night’s first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood
on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in
their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights
indicated the center of the village.</p>
<p>“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “Why didn’t we
think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just
have to get rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it —”</p>
<p>Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse,
trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their
traces.</p>
<p>“Let’s take off the Cloak,” said Harry, and when she looked
frightened, “Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one
around.”</p>
<p>He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward
unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more
cottages: Any one of them might have been the one in which James and
Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the
front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches,
wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it
was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had
left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able
to see the cottage at all; he did not know what happened when the
subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they
were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small
square, was revealed to them.</p>
<p>Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a
war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas
tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little
church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright across the
square.</p>
<p>The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where
people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front
of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. They heard a
snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then
they heard a carol start up inside the little church.</p>
<p>“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Is it?”</p>
<p>He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for
weeks.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. “They . .
. they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the
graveyard behind it.”</p>
<p>Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more
like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see
after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached
for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward.
Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead.</p>
<p>“Harry, look!”</p>
<p>She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had
transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue
of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long
hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother’s
arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.</p>
<p>Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had never
imagined that there would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to see
himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his
forehead. . . .</p>
<p>“C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned
again toward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his
shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.</p>
<p>The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made
Harry’s throat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of
Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of
the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet
he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater. . . .</p>
<p>There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione
pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On
either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep
and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches
behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows
beneath the brilliant windows.</p>
<p>Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a
blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green
wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping
his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved
toward the nearest grave.</p>
<p>“Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of
Hannah’s!”</p>
<p>“Keep your voice down,” Hermione begged him.</p>
<p>They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks
into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old
headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness
to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.</p>
<p>“Harry, here!”</p>
<p>Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her,
his heart positively banging in his chest.</p>
<p>“Is it — ?”</p>
<p>“No, but look!”</p>
<p>She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the
frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and, a short
way below her dates of birth and death, AND HER DAUGHTER ARIANA. There
was also a quotation:</p>
<p>Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p>So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The
Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died
here.</p>
<p>Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not
help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this
graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had
never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place
together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of
what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to
him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay
side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence,
irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.</p>
<p>Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was
hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not understand what
these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest
member of the family once his mother had died.</p>
<p>“Are you sure he never mentioned — ?” Hermione began.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned
away, wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited
trepidation tainted with resentment.</p>
<p>“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the
darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.”</p>
<p>She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a
little frown on her face.</p>
<p>“Harry, come back a moment.”</p>
<p>He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his
way back through the snow toward her.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Look at this!”</p>
<p>The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly
make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.</p>
<p>“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”</p>
<p>He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it
was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to
be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”</p>
<p>Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the
headstone.</p>
<p>“It says Ig — Ignotus, I think. . . .”</p>
<p>“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” Harry told
her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her
crouched beside the old grave.</p>
<p>Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had
met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same
Wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the
dates that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away
from Godric’s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and
every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of
apprehension and anticipation.</p>
<p>The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much
deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then
realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of
churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the
square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights.</p>
<p>Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time,
sharp and clear from a few yards away.</p>
<p>“Harry, they’re here . . . right here.”</p>
<p>And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time:
He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his
chest, the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a
grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.</p>
<p>The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was
made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy
to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel
or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon
it.</p>
<p>JAMES POTTER</p>
<p>LILY POTTER</p>
<p>BORN 27 MARCH 1960</p>
<p>DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981</p>
<p>BORN 30 JANUARY 1960</p>
<p>DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981</p>
<p>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
<p>Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance
to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.</p>
<p>“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . .” A horrible
thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn’t that a Death
Eater idea? Why is that there?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it,
Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you know . . .
living beyond death. Living after death.”</p>
<p>But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty
words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering remains
lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came
before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his
face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let
them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick
snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James
lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living
son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their
sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping
under the snow with them.</p>
<p>Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He
could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp
gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain
control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not
thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen.
But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and
a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and
laid it on his parents’ grave.</p>
<p>As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could
stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermione’s shoulders,
and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked
away through the snow, past Dumbledore’s mother and sister, back toward
the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.</p>
