<h4 id="chapter-two">CHAPTER TWO</h4>
<p>THE SCAR</p>
<p>Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been
running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over
his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of
lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just
pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.</p>
<p>He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the
darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them
on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange
light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp
outside the window.</p>
<p>Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He
turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room,
opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the
door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes
puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar
of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still
stinging.</p>
<p>Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had
awoken. It had seemed so real. . . . There had been two people he knew
and one he didn’t. . . . He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to
remember. . . .</p>
<p>The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. . . . There had been
a snake on a hearth rug . . . a small man called Peter, nicknamed
Wormtail . . . and a cold, high voice . . . the voice of Lord Voldemort.
Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at
the very thought. . . .</p>
<p>He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had
looked like, but it was impossible. . . . All Harry knew was that at the
moment when Voldemort’s chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen
what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken
him . . . or had that been the pain in his scar?</p>
<p>And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old
man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming
confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom,
trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like
trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling
away as fast as he tried to hold on to them. . . . Voldemort and
Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry
could not remember the name . . . and they had been plotting to kill
someone else . . . him!</p>
<p>Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared
around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there.
As it happened, there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in
this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed,
revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.
Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up
by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually
perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been
reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book
were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of
sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.</p>
<p>Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one of the
wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a
fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch — in
Harry’s opinion, the best sport in the world — couldn’t distract him at
the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table,
crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street
below.</p>
<p>Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be
expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning. All the
curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness,
there wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.</p>
<p>And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed and
sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn’t the pain
that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost
all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in
a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not
long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an
airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they
were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his
scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by. . .
. But Voldemort couldn’t be here, now. . . . The idea of Voldemort
lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. . . .</p>
<p>Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he
half-expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And
then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous
grunting snore from the next room.</p>
<p>Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one
in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and
they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and
painless.</p>
<p>Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn’t as though
they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and
Dudley were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated
and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as
welcome in their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry’s long
absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that
he went to St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They
knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to
use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for
anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to
confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the Wizarding
world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them
about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was
laughable.</p>
<p>And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with
the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry
would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn’t been
for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents. . . .</p>
<p>Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort — the most
powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power
steadily for eleven years — arrived at his house and killed his father
and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had
performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and
wizards in his steady rise to power — and, incredibly, it had not
worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon
Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on
his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive.
His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the
terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived
for so long had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded, and Harry
Potter had become famous.</p>
<p>It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh
birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to
find out that everyone in the hidden Wizarding world knew his name.
Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers
followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of
this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry
was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle
again.</p>
<p>But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school.
He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the
birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July.
What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar
hurting?</p>
<p>At once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and
panicky.</p>
<p>“Your scar hurt? Harry, that’s really serious. . . . Write to
Professor Dumbledore! And I’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and
Afflictions. . . . Maybe there’s something in there about curse scars. .
. .”</p>
<p>Yes, that would be Hermione’s advice: Go straight to the headmaster
of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of
the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a
book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living
person to have survived a curse like Voldemort’s; it was highly
unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common
Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry
had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused
himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard,
full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach
somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever
Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find
him; Harry’s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone,
even without an address. But what would he write?</p>
<p>Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this
morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.</p>
<p>And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley’s,
reaction, and in a moment, Ron’s red hair and long-nosed, freckled face
seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.</p>
<p>“Your scar hurt? But . . . but You-Know-Who can’t be near you now,
can he? I mean . . . you’d know, wouldn’t you? He’d be trying to do you
in again, wouldn’t he? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a
bit. . . . I’ll ask Dad. . . .”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of
Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn’t have any
particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In
any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing
that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain.
Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron’s
sixteen-year-old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve.
The Weasleys were Harry’s favorite family in the world; he was hoping
that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned
something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want his
visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.</p>
<p>Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted
(and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like —
someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without
feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with
Dark Magic. . . .</p>
<p>And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious,
that he couldn’t believe it had taken so long — Sirius.</p>
<p>Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at
his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his
eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering
how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he
hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away. But then, perhaps it wasn’t so
surprising — after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his
godfather two months ago.</p>
<p>There was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete absence from Harry’s
life until then — Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail
guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends
who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet
Sirius had been innocent — the murders for which he had been convicted
had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort’s supporter, whom nearly
everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise,
however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous
year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.</p>
<p>For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the
Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name
had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him —
Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of
Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry had helped him
escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then,
Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if Wormtail
had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly
hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped
them forever.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he
couldn’t be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his
school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed
this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as
possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock
his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to
this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry
had a dangerous murderer for a godfather — for Harry had conveniently
forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.</p>
<p>Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at
Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with
wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not
approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow
them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the
other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white
sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case
the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry
found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright
sunlight; perhaps that was why Sirius had gone south. Sirius’s letters,
which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under
Harry’s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry
to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to now, all
right. . . .</p>
<p>Harry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that
precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had
risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of
movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s room, Harry
cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished
letter.</p>
<p>Dear Sirius,</p>
<p>Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly
get through my window.</p>
<p>Things are the same as usual here. Dudley’s diet isn’t going too
well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday.
They told him they’d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it,
so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window.
That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid
really, now he hasn’t even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his
mind off things.</p>
<p>I’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up
and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.</p>
<p>A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last
time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don’t
reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse
scars sometimes hurt years afterward?</p>
<p>I’ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she’s off hunting at
the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me.</p>
<p>Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting
in the dream; he didn’t want it to look as though he was too worried. He
folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when
Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his
wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection, he started to
get dressed before going down to breakfast.</p>
