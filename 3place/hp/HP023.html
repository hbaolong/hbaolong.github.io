<h4 id="chapter-si">CHAPTER SI</h4>
<p>XGILDEROY LOCKHART</p>
<p>The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to
go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long House tables
were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of
toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling
(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor
table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires
propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way
she said “Morning,” which told Harry that she was still disapproving of
the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted
them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with
the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.</p>
<p>“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a few things I
forgot.”</p>
<p>Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was
a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling
the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A
big, lumpy package bounced off Neville’s head and, a second later,
something large and gray fell into Hermione’s jug, spraying them all
with milk and feathers.</p>
<p>“Errol!” said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol
slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red
envelope in his beak.</p>
<p>“Oh, no —” Ron gasped.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding Errol
gently with the tip of her finger.</p>
<p>“It’s not that — it’s that.”</p>
<p>Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to
Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they
expected it to explode.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly.</p>
<p>“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid whisper. “It’ll
be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and” —
he gulped — “it was horrible.”</p>
<p>Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.</p>
<p>“What’s a Howler?” he said.</p>
<p>But Ron’s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to
smoke at the corners.</p>
<p>“Open it,” Neville urged. “It’ll all be over in a few minutes —”</p>
<p>Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol’s
beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split
second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a
roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.</p>
<p>“— STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY’D
EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU
STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS
GONE —”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the
plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the
stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who
had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his
crimson forehead could be seen.</p>
<p>“— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE
OF SHAME, WE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY
COULD BOTH HAVE DIED —”</p>
<p>Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried
very hard to look as though he couldn’t hear the voice that was making
his eardrums throb.</p>
<p>“— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK,
IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL
BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.”</p>
<p>A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from
Ron’s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat
stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people
laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.</p>
<p>Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of
Ron’s head.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you —”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped Ron.</p>
<p>Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.
Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer . . .</p>
<p>But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving
along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his
and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the
vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants
were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed
to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly
friendly again.</p>
<p>As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class
standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the
lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout’s arms were
full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the
Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in
slings.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over
her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her
clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy
Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his
golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold
trimming.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the assembled
students. “Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a
Whomping Willow! But I don’t want you running away with the idea that
I’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several
of these exotic plants on my travels . . .”</p>
<p>“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor Sprout, who was
looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.</p>
<p>There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in
greenhouse one before — greenhouse three housed far more interesting and
dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and
unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer
mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers
dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione
inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.</p>
<p>“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if he’s a couple of
minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?”</p>
<p>Judging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said,
“That’s the ticket,” and closed the greenhouse door in her face.</p>
<p>“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the
sunlight as he shook his head. “Harry, Harry, Harry.”</p>
<p>Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.</p>
<p>“When I heard — well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have
kicked myself.”</p>
<p>Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so
when Lockhart went on, “Don’t know when I’ve been more shocked. Flying a
car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d done it.
Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.”</p>
<p>It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant
teeth even when he wasn’t talking.</p>
<p>“Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said Lockhart. “Gave you
the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you
couldn’t wait to do it again.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, Professor, see —”</p>
<p>“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his
shoulder. “I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you’ve had that
first taste — and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was
bound to go to your head — but see here, young man, you can’t start
flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right?
Plenty of time for all that when you’re older. Yes, yes, I know what
you’re thinking! ‘It’s all right for him, he’s an internationally famous
wizard already!’ But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody
as you are now. In fact, I’d say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a
few people have heard of you, haven’t they? All that business with
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s
forehead. “I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning Witch
Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have — but
it’s a start, Harry, it’s a start.”</p>
<p>He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a
few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse,
he opened the door and slid inside.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of
the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored earmuffs were
lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and
Hermione, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can
tell me the properties of the Mandrake?”</p>
<p>To nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into the air.</p>
<p>“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Hermione,
sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. “It is used
to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original
state.”</p>
<p>“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor Sprout. “The
Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however,
dangerous. Who can tell me why?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as it shot up
again.</p>
<p>“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,” she said
promptly.</p>
<p>“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor Sprout. “Now,
the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.”</p>
<p>She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone
shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants,
purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite
unremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest idea what Hermione
meant by the “cry” of the Mandrake.</p>
<p>“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor Sprout.</p>
<p>There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn’t
pink and fluffy.</p>
<p>“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely
covered,” said Professor Sprout. “When it is safe to remove them, I will
give you the thumbs-up. Right — earmuffs on.”</p>
<p>Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound
completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own
ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty
plants firmly, and pulled hard.</p>
<p>Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.</p>
<p>Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out
of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale
green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his
lungs.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and
plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until
only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her
hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.</p>
<p>“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,”
she said calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than
water a begonia. “However, they will knock you out for several hours,
and as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure
your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your
attention when it is time to pack up.</p>
<p>“Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in
the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s
teething.”</p>
<p>She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making
it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired
Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.</p>
<p>“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the
hand. “Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. . . . And
you’re Hermione Granger — always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as
she had her hand shaken too) “— and Ron Weasley. Wasn’t that your flying
car?”</p>
<p>Ron didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.</p>
<p>“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin happily as they
began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. “Awfully brave
chap. Have you read his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been
cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and —
zap — just fantastic.</p>
<p>“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell you how glad I am
I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but
since I made her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see how
useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family. . . .”</p>
<p>After that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were
back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor
Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t. The Mandrakes
didn’t like coming out of the earth, but didn’t seem to want to go back
into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists,
and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash
a particularly fat one into a pot.</p>
<p>By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty,
aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a
quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall’s classes were always hard work, but today was
especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to
have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be
turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his
beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his
wand.</p>
<p>Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with
some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It
kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to
transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled
of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally
squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one.
Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased.</p>
<p>Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a
wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron,
who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.</p>
<p>“Stupid — useless — thing —”</p>
<p>“Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the wand let off a
volley of bangs like a firecracker.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron, stuffing the now
hissing wand into his bag. “‘It’s your own fault your wand got snapped
—’”</p>
<p>They went down to lunch, where Ron’s mood was not improved by
Hermione’s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had
produced in Transfiguration.</p>
<p>“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily changing the
subject.</p>
<p>“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione at once.</p>
<p>“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have you outlined all
Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?”</p>
<p>Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.</p>
<p>They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.
Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with
Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several
minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched.
Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he’d seen trying on
the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was
clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment
Harry looked at him, he went bright red.</p>
<p>“All right, Harry? I’m — I’m Colin Creevey,” he said breathlessly,
taking a tentative step forward. “I’m in Gryffindor, too. D’you think —
would it be all right if — can I have a picture?” he said, raising the
camera hopefully.</p>
<p>“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly.</p>
<p>“So I can prove I’ve met you,” said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging
further forward. “I know all about you. Everyone’s told me. About how
you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared
and everything and how you’ve still got a lightning scar on your
forehead” (his eyes raked Harry’s hairline) “and a boy in my dormitory
said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll move.”
Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, “It’s
amazing here, isn’t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was
magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad’s a milkman, he
couldn’t believe it either. So I’m taking loads of pictures to send home
to him. And it’d be really good if I had one of you” — he looked
imploringly at Harry — “maybe your friend could take it and I could
stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?”</p>
<p>“Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?”</p>
<p>Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed around the courtyard.
He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at
Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.</p>
<p>“Everyone line up!” Malfoy roared to the crowd. “Harry Potter’s
giving out signed photos!”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not,” said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. “Shut up,
Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as
thick as Crabbe’s neck.</p>
<p>“Jealous?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout anymore: Half the
courtyard was listening in. “Of what? I don’t want a foul scar right
across my head, thanks. I don’t think getting your head cut open makes
you that special, myself.”</p>
<p>Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.</p>
<p>“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and
started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Weasley,” sneered Malfoy. “You don’t want to start any
trouble or your mummy’ll have to come and take you away from school.” He
put on a shrill, piercing voice. “‘If you put another toe out of line’
—”</p>
<p>A knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly at this.</p>
<p>“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked Malfoy. “It’d be
worth more than his family’s whole house —”</p>
<p>Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with
Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!”</p>
<p>“What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding
toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. “Who’s giving out
signed photos?”</p>
<p>Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm
around his shoulders and thundered jovially, “Shouldn’t have asked! We
meet again, Harry!”</p>
<p>Pinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw
Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.</p>
<p>“Come on then, Mr. Creevey,” said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. “A
double portrait, can’t do better than that, and we’ll both sign it for
you.”</p>
<p>Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang
behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.</p>
<p>“Off you go, move along there,” Lockhart called to the crowd, and he
set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good
Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.</p>
<p>“A word to the wise, Harry,” said Lockhart paternally as they entered
the building through a side door. “I covered up for you back there with
young Creevey — if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won’t
think you’re setting yourself up so much. . . .”</p>
<p>Deaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined
with staring students and up a staircase.</p>
<p>“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of
your career isn’t sensible — looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank.
There may well come a time when, like me, you’ll need to keep a stack
handy wherever you go, but” — he gave a little chortle — “I don’t think
you’re quite there yet.”</p>
<p>They had reached Lockhart’s classroom and he let Harry go at last.
Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back
of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of
Lockhart’s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the
real thing.</p>
<p>The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat
down on either side of Harry.</p>
<p>“You could’ve fried an egg on your face,” said Ron. “You’d better
hope Creevey doesn’t meet Ginny, or they’ll be starting a Harry Potter
fan club.”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart
to hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan club.”</p>
<p>When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly
and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom’s
copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking
portrait on the front.</p>
<p>“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well. “Gilderoy
Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark
Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s
Most-Charming-Smile Award — but I don’t talk about that. I didn’t get
rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!”</p>
<p>He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.</p>
<p>“I see you’ve all bought a complete set of my books — well done. I
thought we’d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about —
just to check how well you’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in —”</p>
<p>When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of
the class and said, “You have thirty minutes — start — now!”</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his paper and read:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color?</p></li>
<li><p>What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition?</p></li>
<li><p>What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s greatest
achievement to date?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:</p>
<ol start="54" type="1">
<li>When is Gilderoy Lockhart’s birthday, and what would his ideal gift
be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through
them in front of the class.</p>
<p>“Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is
lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read
Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in chapter
twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic
and non-magic peoples — though I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of
Ogden’s Old Firewhisky!”</p>
<p>He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart
with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean
Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter.
Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt
attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name.</p>
<p>“. . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid
the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions — good
girl! In fact” — he flipped her paper over — “full marks! Where is Miss
Hermione Granger?”</p>
<p>Hermione raised a trembling hand.</p>
<p>“Excellent!” beamed Lockhart. “Quite excellent! Take ten points for
Gryffindor! And so — to business —”</p>
<p>He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto
it.</p>
<p>“Now — be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst
fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am
here. All I ask is that you remain calm.”</p>
<p>In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a
better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and
Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row
seat.</p>
<p>“I must ask you not to scream,” said Lockhart in a low voice. “It
might provoke them.”</p>
<p>As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the
cover.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said dramatically. “Freshly caught Cornish pixies.”</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself. He let out a snort of
laughter that even Lockhart couldn’t mistake for a scream of terror.</p>
<p>“Yes?” He smiled at Seamus.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are they?” Seamus
choked.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so sure!” said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at
Seamus. “Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!”</p>
<p>The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with
pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of
budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started
jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre
faces at the people nearest them.</p>
<p>“Right, then,” Lockhart said loudly. “Let’s see what you make of
them!” And he opened the cage.</p>
<p>It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.
Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air.
Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with
broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively
than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class
with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls,
upended the wastebasket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of
the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under
desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the
ceiling.</p>
<p>“Come on now — round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies,”
Lockhart shouted.</p>
<p>He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,
“Peskipiksi Pesternomi!”</p>
<p>It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and
threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own
desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second
later as the chandelier gave way.</p>
<p>The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the
relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of
Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, “Well,
I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.”
He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.</p>
<p>“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit
him painfully on the ear.</p>
<p>“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,” said Hermione,
immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and
stuffing them back into their cage.</p>
<p>“Hands on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of
reach with its tongue out. “Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was
doing —”</p>
<p>“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’ve read his books — look at all those
amazing things he’s done —”</p>
<p>“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.</p>
