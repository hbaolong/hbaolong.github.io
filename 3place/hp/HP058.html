<h4 id="chapter-one">CHAPTER ONE</h4>
<p>THE RIDDLE HOUSE</p>
<p>The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the Riddle House,”
even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived
there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows
boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over
its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest
building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and
unoccupied.</p>
<p>The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.”
Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there,
something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to
discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had been picked
over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that
nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version of the
tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at
daybreak on a fine summer’s morning, when the Riddle House had still
been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to
find all three Riddles dead.</p>
<p>The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused
as many people as she could.</p>
<p>“Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their
dinner things!”</p>
<p>The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had
seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody
wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for
they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich,
snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything,
worse. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer
— for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of
natural causes on the same night.</p>
<p>The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the
whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They
were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived
dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub
that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.</p>
<p>“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!”</p>
<p>Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a run-down
cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the
war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises,
and had been working for the Riddles ever since.</p>
<p>There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.</p>
<p>“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening
villagers, after her fourth sherry. “Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve
offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted
to mix, he didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard war, Frank. He
likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to —”</p>
<p>“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.
“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as
I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows!
All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all
sleeping. . . .”</p>
<p>The villagers exchanged dark looks.</p>
<p>“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,”
grunted a man at the bar.</p>
<p>“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.</p>
<p>“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn’t
I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the corner.</p>
<p>“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I remember, when he
was a kid . . .”</p>
<p>By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted
that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.</p>
<p>But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and
dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again,
that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the
house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been a teenage boy, a
stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the village had seen any
such boy, and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented
him.</p>
<p>Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the
report on the Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything.</p>
<p>The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had
examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been
poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could
tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of
unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect
health — apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did
note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that
each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face — but as
the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being
frightened to death?</p>
<p>As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the
police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the
Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of
curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of
suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the
Riddle House.</p>
<p>“’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t care what the
police say,” said Dot in the Hanged Man. “And if he had any decency,
he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.”</p>
<p>But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next
family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next — for neither
family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new
owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the
absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.</p>
<p>The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived
there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it
for “tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might be. The
wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank
was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg
stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in
fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him,
try as he might to suppress them.</p>
<p>Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys
from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of
the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked
so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for
a dare. They knew that old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds
amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping
across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.
Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like
their parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank
awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old
house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in
their attempts to punish him.</p>
<p>It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than
ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen
with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in
his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the
Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew
at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and
judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a
fire.</p>
<p>Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the
police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the
Riddles’ deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs
as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen,
fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He
picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set
off into the night.</p>
<p>The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor
did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house
until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the
old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.</p>
<p>He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it
for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered
where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his
nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of
footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a
little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of
the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that
lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and
stick.</p>
<p>On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the
intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a
flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold
across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping his
walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see
a narrow slice of the room beyond.</p>
<p>The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him.
Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s voice spoke
within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.</p>
<p>“There is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still
hungry.”</p>
<p>“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man — but it was
strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.
Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s
neck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.”</p>
<p>Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There
came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and
then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the
floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door,
pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and
there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of
sight again.</p>
<p>“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.</p>
<p>“I — I don’t know, my Lord,” said the first voice nervously. “She set
out to explore the house, I think. . . .”</p>
<p>“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said the second
voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me
greatly.”</p>
<p>Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door,
listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail
spoke again.</p>
<p>“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”</p>
<p>“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The place is
moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be
foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.”</p>
<p>Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing,
no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word “Quidditch,”
which was not a word at all.</p>
<p>“The — the Quidditch World Cup, my Lord?” said Wormtail. (Frank dug
his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) “Forgive me, but — I do
not understand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”</p>
<p>“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the
country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of
Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity,
checking and double-checking identities. They will be obsessed with
security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.”</p>
<p>Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard
the words “Ministry of Magic,” “wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each
of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of
only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals.
Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened
more closely still.</p>
<p>“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.</p>
<p>“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in
the cold voice now.</p>
<p>A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling
from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before
he lost his nerve.</p>
<p>“It could be done without Harry Potter, my Lord.”</p>
<p>Another pause, more protracted, and then —</p>
<p>“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice softly. “I see . .
.”</p>
<p>“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” said
Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is nothing to me, nothing
at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard —
any wizard — the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you
allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know that I can disguise
myself most effectively — I could be back here in as little as two days
with a suitable person —”</p>
<p>“I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice softly, “that is
true. . . .”</p>
<p>“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly
relieved now. “Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is
so well protected —”</p>
<p>“And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder . . .
perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail?
Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an
attempt to desert me?”</p>
<p>“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all —”</p>
<p>“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can always tell,
Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you.
I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch
me. . . .”</p>
<p>“No! My devotion to Your Lordship —”</p>
<p>“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here
if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I
need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?”</p>
<p>“But you seem so much stronger, my Lord —”</p>
<p>“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger, and a few days
alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained
under your clumsy care. Silence!”</p>
<p>Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once.
For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. Then
the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.</p>
<p>“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to
you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more
months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the
boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little
courage from you, Wormtail — courage you will find, unless you wish to
feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort’s wrath —”</p>
<p>“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. “All
through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — my Lord,
Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we
proceed, if I murder —”</p>
<p>“If?” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the plan,
Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You
will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do it
myself, but in my present condition . . . Come, Wormtail, one more death
and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it
alone. By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined us —”</p>
<p>“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of
sullenness in his voice.</p>
<p>“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has
never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.”</p>
<p>“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge
to his voice now. “I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha
Jorkins.”</p>
<p>“That is true,” said the second man, sounding amused. “A stroke of
brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail —
though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be
when you caught her, were you?”</p>
<p>“I — I thought she might be useful, my Lord —”</p>
<p>“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more
pronounced than ever. “However, I do not deny that her information was
invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for
that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform
an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their
right hands to perform. . . .”</p>
<p>“R-really, my Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded terrified again.</p>
<p>“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the surprise? Your part
will come at the very end . . . but I promise you, you will have the
honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.”</p>
<p>“You . . . you . . .” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as
though his mouth had gone very dry. “You . . . are going . . . to kill
me too?”</p>
<p>“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why would I kill
you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my
questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have
been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she
had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would
do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns. . .
.”</p>
<p>Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it,
but it made the second man laugh — an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as
his speech.</p>
<p>“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken
by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an
insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her,
Wormtail.”</p>
<p>Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand
gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the
cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind
of remorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a madman. And he was
planning more murders — this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in
danger —</p>
<p>Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the
police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the
telephone box in the village . . . but the cold voice was speaking
again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening
with all his might.</p>
<p>“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts . . . Harry
Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no
more argument. But quiet . . . I think I hear Nagini. . . .”</p>
<p>And the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises such as
Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without
drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or
seizure.</p>
<p>And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He
turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.</p>
<p>Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor,
and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a
thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet
long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a
wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer
and closer — What was he to do? The only means of escape was into the
room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was
the snake would surely kill him —</p>
<p>But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him,
and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the
spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in
seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the
gap.</p>
<p>There was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the hand on the walking
stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to
hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. . . .
This man could talk to snakes.</p>
<p>Frank didn’t understand what was going on. He wanted more than
anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem
was that his legs didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking
and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to
English again.</p>
<p>“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.</p>
<p>“In-indeed, my Lord?” said Wormtail.</p>
<p>“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini, there is an old
Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we
say.”</p>
<p>Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps, and
then the door of the room was flung wide open.</p>
<p>A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small,
watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his
face.</p>
<p>“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?”</p>
<p>The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire,
but Frank couldn’t see the speaker. The snake, on the other hand, was
curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a
pet dog.</p>
<p>Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken,
Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the
threshold.</p>
<p>The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long,
spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the
armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant,
for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.</p>
<p>“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.</p>
<p>“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, for now that
he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of
action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.</p>
<p>“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It means that
you are not a wizard.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing
steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard enough to interest the police
tonight, I have. You’ve done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll
tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration, “my wife knows
I’m up here, and if I don’t come back —”</p>
<p>“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly. “Nobody knows
you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord
Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows . . . he always knows. . . .”</p>
<p>“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I don’t
think much of your manners, my Lord. Turn ’round and face me like a man,
why don’t you?”</p>
<p>“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, barely audible now
over the crackling of the flames. “I am much, much more than a man.
However . . . why not? I will face you. . . . Wormtail, come turn my
chair around.”</p>
<p>The servant gave a whimper.</p>
<p>“You heard me, Wormtail.”</p>
<p>Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done
anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake
lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake
lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the
chair snagged on its rug.</p>
<p>And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in
it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his
mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never
heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There
was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled.
He was dead before he hit the floor.</p>
<p>Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a
start.</p>
