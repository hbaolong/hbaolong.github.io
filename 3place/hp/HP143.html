<h4 id="chapter-eleven">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h4>
<p>HERMIONE’S HELPING HAND</p>
<p>As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free periods were not the
hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to
attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set.
Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these
days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or
twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best
subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood
Prince.</p>
<p>Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the
Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently
looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see
them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on
U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells
work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside
into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than
ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly
if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.</p>
<p>One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of
practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far
been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming
to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions
when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had
mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid’s
huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at
breakfast.</p>
<p>“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. “And we’re
supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway,
explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid
subject?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” said Ron
darkly. “And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a narrow escape. You didn’t
hear him going on about his gormless brother — we’d have been teaching
Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.”</p>
<p>“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking upset.</p>
<p>“We’ll go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. He too was
missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off
without Grawp in their lives. “But trials might take all morning, the
number of people who have applied.” He felt slightly nervous at
confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. “I dunno why the team’s
this popular all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It’s not
Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! You’ve never been more interesting,
and frankly, you’ve never been more fanciable.”</p>
<p>Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look
of disdain before turning back to Harry.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they? The
whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about
Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the
last two years and escaped both times. And now they’re calling you ‘the
Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t you see why people are fascinated by
you?”</p>
<p>Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even
though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.</p>
<p>“And you’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when
they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still
see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you
write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. . .
.”</p>
<p>“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry,
look,” said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.</p>
<p>“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer
either,” Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.</p>
<p>“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially.</p>
<p>The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows,
scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving
more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their
children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry
had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular
correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might
write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very
surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all
the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large,
square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of
Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl,
Pigwidgeon.</p>
<p>“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of
Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts.</p>
<p>“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can give that
graffitied copy back.”</p>
<p>“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve thought it out
—”</p>
<p>He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and
tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, “Diffindo!” The cover fell
off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione looked
scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said,
“Reparo!”</p>
<p>There sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat
the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly
secondhand.</p>
<p>“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t complain, it cost nine
Galleons.”</p>
<p>Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving,
but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that
day’s copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the
front page.</p>
<p>“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he
posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper.</p>
<p>“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” said Hermione. “And
an arrest.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange.</p>
<p>“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry, startled.</p>
<p>“‘Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the
Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity.
Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on
his Clapham home . . .’”</p>
<p>“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty
youth he had first met three years before. “No way!”</p>
<p>“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron
reasonably. “You never can tell.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It
says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death
Eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression
on her face. “If he was under the Imperius Curse, he’d hardly stand
around gossiping about their plans, would he?”</p>
<p>“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,”
said Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister
of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at,
taking Stan seriously.”</p>
<p>“They probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said
Hermione, frowning. “People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’
parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been
withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.”</p>
<p>“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But Hogwarts is safer than
their homes, bound to be! We’ve got Aurors, and all those extra
protective spells, and we’ve got Dumbledore!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said Hermione very
quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet.
“Haven’t you noticed? His seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s this
past week.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster’s chair
was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen
Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.</p>
<p>“I think he’s left the school to do something with the Order,” said
Hermione in a low voice. “I mean . . . it’s all looking serious, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all
thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day
before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told
her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.</p>
<p>When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down
to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil.
Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins’ parents
wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the
two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did
surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly
nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron
blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly
became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to
laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had
broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the
way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to
find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.</p>
<p>As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of
Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were
nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to
seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating.
The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized
immediately from the Hogwarts Express.</p>
<p>“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” he said
confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry’s hand. “Cormac
McLaggen, Keeper.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, taking note of
the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all
three goal hoops without even moving.</p>
<p>“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” said
McLaggen, with something of a swagger. “Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a
bet.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . if you wait over there . . .”</p>
<p>He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was
sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen’s
face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment
because they were both “old Sluggy’s” favorites.</p>
<p>Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for
the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch.
This was a good decision: The first ten was made up of first years and
it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before.
Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and
he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goalposts.</p>
<p>The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had
ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about
giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When
he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went
to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.</p>
<p>The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the
fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were
Hufflepuffs.</p>
<p>“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor,” roared
Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, “leave now,
please!”</p>
<p>There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting
off the pitch, snorting with laughter.</p>
<p>After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving
a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found
himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an
excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly
good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the
competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was
with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many
complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected
Beaters.</p>
<p>“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way for the
Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed.</p>
<p>Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and
George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a
short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump
the size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with a ferociously hit
Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now
joined the spectators in the stands to watch the selection of their last
team member.</p>
<p>Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last,
hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned.
Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people
who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the
crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to
the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry
glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had
hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but
apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.</p>
<p>None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece.
To Harry’s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties
out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the
wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to
the ground grinding his teeth.</p>
<p>Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven.
“Good luck!” cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around,
expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have
quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment
later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more
grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.</p>
<p>Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five
penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of
the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that,
most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen’s red face
inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.</p>
<p>“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen menacingly. There was a
vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle
Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.”</p>
<p>“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he nearly
missed.”</p>
<p>McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this
time.</p>
<p>“Give me another go.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved
five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.”</p>
<p>He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he
contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what
sounded like threats to thin air.</p>
<p>Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.</p>
<p>“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well —”</p>
<p>“You did brilliantly, Ron!”</p>
<p>This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands;
Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a
rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with
himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at
Hermione.</p>
<p>After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following
Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team
and headed off toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying to break through
the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt
extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at
Hagrid’s.</p>
<p>“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was saying
happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it
—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.</p>
<p>“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron in a highly
satisfied voice. “Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction
on his fifth? Looked like he’d been Confunded. . . .”</p>
<p>To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at
these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his
other penalties in loving detail.</p>
<p>The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of
Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and
turned his huge head toward them.</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t
he?”</p>
<p>“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.</p>
<p>Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without
breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank
into a bow too.</p>
<p>“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to
stroke the feathery head. “Missing him? But you’re okay here with
Hagrid, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Oi!” said a loud voice.</p>
<p>Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a
large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous
boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded
forward.</p>
<p>“Git away from him! He’ll have yer fingers — oh. It’s yeh lot.”</p>
<p>Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their
ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then
turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.</p>
<p>“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door
and knocked loudly.</p>
<p>“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!”</p>
<p>There was no sound from within.</p>
<p>“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry said,
pulling out his wand.</p>
<p>“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t possibly —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back —”</p>
<p>But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as
Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him
and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.</p>
<p>“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh
threaten ter break down my door!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed
his wand inside his robes.</p>
<p>Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”</p>
<p>“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”</p>
<p>“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. That’s me
outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . .
.”</p>
<p>Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in
after Harry, looking rather frightened.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down
around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon
Harry’s knee and drooling all over his robes. “What’s this? Feelin’
sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.”</p>
<p>“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously.</p>
<p>“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.”</p>
<p>He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle,
muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs
of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes.
Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid’s cooking, and took one at
once.</p>
<p>“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and
started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each
tuber had done him a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to carry on
with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.”</p>
<p>Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bogeys
landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not
staying for dinner.</p>
<p>“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it into our
schedules!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again.</p>
<p>There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around:
Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and
hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the
corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like
foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.</p>
<p>“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound interested
rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.</p>
<p>“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>“And they grow into . . . ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.</p>
<p>“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em ter feed ter
Aragog.”</p>
<p>And without warning, he burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the
long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his
shaking shoulders. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s . . . him . . .” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming
as he mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think
he’s dyin’. . . . He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’
better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin
tergether so long. . . .”</p>
<p>Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for
anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present
a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant
scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal
giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible
of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who
dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only
narrowly escaped four years previously.</p>
<p>“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring
Ron’s frantic grimaces and head-shakings.</p>
<p>“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem
the flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s
family . . . they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill . . . bit restive
. . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an
undertone.</p>
<p>“. . . I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the
colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron
and looking up. “But thanks fer offerin’, Hermione. . . . It means a
lot. . . .”</p>
<p>After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although
neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant
grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for
granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual
self once more.</p>
<p>“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer
timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. “Even if yeh
applied fer Time-Turners —”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We smashed the entire stock
of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the
Daily Prophet.”</p>
<p>“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh could’ve done it. .
. . I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ Aragog .
. . an’ I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin
teachin’ yeh —”</p>
<p>At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that
Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was
a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them
off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.</p>
<p>“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and
they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had
abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his
back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven’t
got much time for dinner. . . .”</p>
<p>As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering
the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he
ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed
gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught
Hermione’s arm and held her back.</p>
<p>“What?” said Hermione defensively.</p>
<p>“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks like he was
Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you
were sitting.”</p>
<p>Hermione blushed.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you should have
heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a
nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn’t get in — you
wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on the team.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But wasn’t that
dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a prefect, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked.</p>
<p>“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to
the Great Hall and looking suspicious.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after
Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry’s stomach ache with hunger, but
they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when
Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.</p>
<p>“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he boomed genially,
twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous
belly. “I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a
spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re having a little party,
just a few rising stars, I’ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the
charming Melinda Bobbin — I don’t know whether you know her? Her family
owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of course, I hope very much
that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.”</p>
<p>Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was
as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at
him.</p>
<p>“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got a detention
with Professor Snape.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. “Dear, dear, I
was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word
with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to
persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both
later!”</p>
<p>He bustled away out of the Hall.</p>
<p>“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, the moment
Slughorn was out of earshot. “This detention’s already been postponed
once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone
else.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!” said
Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.</p>
<p>“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” snapped Ron,
who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.</p>
<p>After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common
room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but
they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a
bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and
frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening
Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.</p>
<p>“Anything new?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Not really . . .” Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning
the inside pages. “Oh, look, your dad’s in here, Ron — he’s all right!”
she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. “It just says
he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This second search of the Death
Eater’s residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur
Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit
Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been
acting upon a confidential tip-off.’”</p>
<p>“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at King’s Cross about Malfoy
and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at
their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him
—”</p>
<p>“But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, putting down the
newspaper with a surprised look. “We were all searched when we arrived,
weren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!”</p>
<p>“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. . . . Well,
Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the
entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact
Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can’t have
brought in anything dangerous!”</p>
<p>Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold
the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this
objection.</p>
<p>“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His mother or
someone.”</p>
<p>“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. “Filch told us
so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could
reach.”</p>
<p>Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did
not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark
object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with
his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown.</p>
<p>“Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?”</p>
<p>“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his
stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!” said Harry, firing
up.</p>
<p>“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, getting to his
feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.”</p>
<p>He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories, leaving
Harry and Hermione staring after him.</p>
<p>“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at
his shoulder. “I’ve got a message for you.”</p>
<p>“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.</p>
<p>“No . . . from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s heart sank.
“He says you’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do
your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you’ve
received. And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out rotten
flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and — and he says there’s
no need to bring protective gloves.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.”</p>
