<h4 id="chapter-fourteen">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h4>
<p>FELIX FELICIS</p>
<p>Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been
unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over
breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they
walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s
brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it
took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.</p>
<p>“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said Ron quietly, as they
took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that
formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their protective
gloves. “But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you all this. I
mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s the point?”</p>
<p>“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he says it’s all
important and it’ll help me survive.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It makes
absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else
will you find out his weaknesses?”</p>
<p>“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked her thickly through
the gum shield.</p>
<p>“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now putting on
protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit,
and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, but
he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog
Jones.”</p>
<p>“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles.
“The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought she was a bit
full of herself, but —”</p>
<p>“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly,
bustling over and looking stern. “You’re lagging behind, everybody else
has started, and Neville’s already got his first pod!”</p>
<p>They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip
and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an
unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.</p>
<p>“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, adding quietly, when
she had turned away again, “should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.”</p>
<p>“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as she always
did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his
spells. “Well, come on . . . we’d better get going. . . .”</p>
<p>She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep
breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.</p>
<p>It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out
of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione’s
hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in
trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in
the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm
bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry
and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open
again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a
pod just like Neville’s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside,
and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of
wood.</p>
<p>“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden
when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his
forehead and wiping sweat from his face.</p>
<p>“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm’s
length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a
look of disgust on her face.</p>
<p>“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re
fresh!” called Professor Sprout.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as
though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to
have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be able to
wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free
evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.”</p>
<p>Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in
the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as
hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another party just for
Slughorn’s favorites, is it?”</p>
<p>“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the greenhouse
glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout’s head and knocking
off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got
back, Hermione was saying, “Look, I didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’
—”</p>
<p>“‘Slug Club,’” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. “It’s
pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try hooking
up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug —”</p>
<p>“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some reason
had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask you to
come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!”</p>
<p>Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he
need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by
either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and
open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of;
unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.</p>
<p>“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a completely different
voice.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d rather I hooked
up with McLaggen . . .”</p>
<p>There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod
with a trowel.</p>
<p>“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice.</p>
<p>Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.</p>
<p>“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the
bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have
awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione looked flustered
and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees
of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron,
on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with
himself.</p>
<p>“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re
supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their
goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump.</p>
<p>It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he
wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an
inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how
he felt about it. . . . He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at
each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione
started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship
survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been
talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to
bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn’t split
up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became
excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut
out for good?</p>
<p>“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as
Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full
of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.</p>
<p>The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn’s
party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next
few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they
were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would
just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer
in Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime,
however, he had more pressing worries.</p>
<p>Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no prospect of
leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been
training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept
putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their
opening match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to
accept that she would not be back in time to play.</p>
<p>Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a
sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean
Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already
left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around
the room, all of Hermione’s creation; nobody else had succeeded in
conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.</p>
<p>“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?”</p>
<p>“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over Dean’s shoulder,
Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour.
One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask
Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other
hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown
Seamus at the tryouts.</p>
<p>“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice tonight,
seven o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t wait to tell
Ginny!”</p>
<p>He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together,
an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on
Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries whizzed over them.</p>
<p>Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie’s
substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact
that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry
had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was
not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing
to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor
won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had
criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team.
If they lost . . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse
mutterings. . . .</p>
<p>Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that
evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and
Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.</p>
<p>Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who
suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the
looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have
brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen
goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and
wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the
mouth.</p>
<p>“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” Ron shouted
after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood
everywhere. “I just —”</p>
<p>“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining
her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!”</p>
<p>“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing
his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny, don’t
call Ron a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team —”</p>
<p>“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone
should —”</p>
<p>Harry forced himself not to laugh.</p>
<p>“In the air, everyone, let’s go. . . .”</p>
<p>Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term,
though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they
were this close to the match.</p>
<p>“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” he said
bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking
reasonably happy with themselves.</p>
<p>“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a hollow voice
when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.</p>
<p>“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best Keeper I tried
out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.”</p>
<p>He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the
castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking
marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take
their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found
themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace
and kissing fiercely as though glued together.</p>
<p>It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in
Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his
brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge
to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard
Ron’s voice as though from a great distance away.</p>
<p>“Oi!”</p>
<p>Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around.</p>
<p>“What?” said Ginny.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!”</p>
<p>“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said
Ginny.</p>
<p>Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry
did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s
instant dismissal from the team.</p>
<p>“Er . . . c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the common
room. . . .”</p>
<p>“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear brother!”</p>
<p>Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the
scene.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and
glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight once and for all. It is none of
your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I want people
saying my sister’s a —”</p>
<p>“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, exactly?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny —” said Harry automatically, though
the monster was roaring its approval of Ron’s words.</p>
<p>“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just because he’s
never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever
had is from our Auntie Muriel —”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning
maroon.</p>
<p>“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen you with
Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it’s
pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you
wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!”</p>
<p>Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between
them.</p>
<p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying to get
a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her
with his arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do it in public —
!”</p>
<p>Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of
the way.</p>
<p>“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of
Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?”</p>
<p>“You —”</p>
<p>A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm and missed Ginny
by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid —”</p>
<p>“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded close to
tears now. “And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts
like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about
as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”</p>
<p>And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the
look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing
heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, appeared around the corner,
which broke the tension.</p>
<p>“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch’s shuffling feet reached
their ears.</p>
<p>They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. “Oi,
out of the way!” Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and
dropped a bottle of toadspawn.</p>
<p>Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt
disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something
like this. It’s just because she’s Ron’s sister, he told himself. You
just didn’t like seeing her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. . .
.</p>
<p>But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted
corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The monster in his
chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain
and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like “betrayal of trust”
. . . “supposed to be my friend” . . .</p>
<p>“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked abruptly, as they
approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his
imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he
and Ginny were quite alone —</p>
<p>“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh . . . er . . .”</p>
<p>The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to give it. However,
Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry’s face.</p>
<p>“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed
through the portrait hole into the common room.</p>
<p>Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they
barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence,
each absorbed in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his
four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny
were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like
brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and
having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now.
. . . It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that
he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb
for kissing her . . . No . . . he would have to control that particular
brotherly feeling. . . .</p>
<p>Ron gave a great grunting snore.</p>
<p>She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s sister. She’s
out-of-bounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything.
He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep
to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere
near Ginny.</p>
<p>Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a
series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by
midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one,
who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a
hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What
was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to
lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day
attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success;
finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off
to the boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened
first years for looking at him.</p>
<p>To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the
next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his
Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the
final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he failed to save
every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so
much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.</p>
<p>“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, who was about
two-thirds Ron’s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.</p>
<p>“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ron’s
direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of
the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of
hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself
together, you played really well today. Ron . . .” he waited until the
rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best
mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I’m going to
kick you off the team.”</p>
<p>He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then
something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom; all the
fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.”</p>
<p>“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said Harry fiercely,
seizing Ron by the front of his robes. “You can save anything when
you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!”</p>
<p>“You calling me mental?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe I am!”</p>
<p>They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head
wearily. “I know you haven’t got any time to find another Keeper, so
I’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off
the team.”</p>
<p>Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron’s
confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and
surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that
evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if
Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team
was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron
and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in
the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving,
attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than
encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.</p>
<p>Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want
to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he
was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not
yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in
the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . .
.</p>
<p>If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself
together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that
would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .</p>
<p>And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of
inspiration.</p>
<p>Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins
hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered
the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue
sky: a good omen.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry
and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and
shook his head.</p>
<p>“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be brilliant!”</p>
<p>Ron ignored her.</p>
<p>“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”</p>
<p>“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron’s recent
unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them,
paused on her way up the table.</p>
<p>“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on the
back of Ron’s head.</p>
<p>“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of
pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. Drink up.”</p>
<p>Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke
sharply.</p>
<p>“Don’t drink that, Ron!”</p>
<p>Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Ron.</p>
<p>Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her
eyes.</p>
<p>“You just put something in that drink.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron’s drink.
You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing the
little bottle hastily in his pocket.</p>
<p>“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said again, alarmed, but
Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing
me around, Hermione.”</p>
<p>She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear
her, she hissed, “You should be expelled for that. I’d never have
believed it of you, Harry!”</p>
<p>“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded anyone
lately?”</p>
<p>She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without
regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business
Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his
lips.</p>
<p>“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely.</p>
<p>The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the
stadium.</p>
<p>“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry asked Ron.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.</p>
<p>Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and
waiting in the changing room.</p>
<p>“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. “And guess what?
That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday
during their practice, and he’s too sore to play! And even better than
that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. “He’s ill?
What’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. “They’re
playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his
mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not
play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole
match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why
was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he
faking?</p>
<p>“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. “Malfoy not
playing?”</p>
<p>“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more animated. “And
Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal scorer, I didn’t fancy — hey!” he
said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keeper’s gloves
and staring at Harry.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I . . . you . . .” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared
and excited. “My drink . . . my pumpkin juice . . . you didn’t . . .
?”</p>
<p>Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, “We’ll be
starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.”</p>
<p>They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end
of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and
silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all
the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna
Lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat.</p>
<p>Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready
to release the balls from the crate.</p>
<p>“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by
the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. “Mount your brooms. On the whistle
. . . three . . . two . . . one . . .”</p>
<p>The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the
frozen ground, and they were away.</p>
<p>Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for
the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below
him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual
commentator’s started up.</p>
<p>“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to see the team
that Potter’s put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald
Weasley’s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off
the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain
does help. . . .”</p>
<p>These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin
end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the
commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was
standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been
Lee Jordan’s; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom
he heartily disliked.</p>
<p>“Oh, and here comes Slytherin’s first attempt on goal, it’s Urquhart
streaking down the pitch and —”</p>
<p>Harry’s stomach turned over.</p>
<p>“— Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, I
suppose. . . .”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as
he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some
hint of the elusive Snitch.</p>
<p>With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty
points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by
the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of
Gryffindor’s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering
loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked
them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.</p>
<p>“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said
Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle —”</p>
<p>“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but
Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper
instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was
pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its
mark.</p>
<p>It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again
they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron
saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when
the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the
old favorite “Weasley Is Our King,” he pretended to conduct them from on
high.</p>
<p>“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide
voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided
with him hard and deliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal . . .”</p>
<p>Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted
in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off.
His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back.
. . .</p>
<p>“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said Zacharias
Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, he’s certainly seen something Potter
hasn’t!”</p>
<p>Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he noticed them
collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky —
Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at
random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along
high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it
drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was
still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if
Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now Harper was feet
from it, his hand outstretched. . . .</p>
<p>“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much did Malfoy pay
you to come on instead of him?”</p>
<p>He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take;
he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right
past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and
caught it.</p>
<p>“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the
ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had
happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the
whistle that signaled the end of the game.</p>
<p>“Ginny, where’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had found himself
trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but
Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she
collided with the commentator’s podium. As the crowd shrieked and
laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under
which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny saying blithely
to an irate Professor McGonagall, “Forgot to brake, Professor,
sorry.”</p>
<p>Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny,
but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a cheering Ron on
the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the
pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to their supporters.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant.</p>
<p>“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled Dean exuberantly.
“C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!”</p>
<p>Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just
about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor
scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.</p>
<p>“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep breath. “You
shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded Ron.</p>
<p>“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to hang
up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.</p>
<p>“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermione
shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix
Felicis!”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.</p>
<p>“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there were
Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his
hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione
had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the
cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done
it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You
saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.”</p>
<p>He pocketed the potion again.</p>
<p>“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said,
astounded. “But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . .
I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on
Hermione, imitating her voice. “You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice
this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can save goals
without help, Hermione!”</p>
<p>“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given it
too!”</p>
<p>But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his
broomstick over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his
plan to backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party,
then?”</p>
<p>“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m sick of Ron at the
moment, I don’t know what I’m supposed to have done. . . .”</p>
<p>And she stormed out of the changing room too.</p>
<p>Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the
crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great
sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and
Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could
possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was
kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.</p>
<p>Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party,
which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping
greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people
congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers,
who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls
that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting
their eyelids, it was some time before he could try to find Ron. At
last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily
that she would like to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party with him. As he
was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny,
Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing
hopefully at her heels.</p>
<p>“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over there, the filthy
hypocrite.”</p>
<p>Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view
of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it
was hard to tell whose hands were whose.</p>
<p>“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said Ginny
dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got to refine his technique
somehow. Good game, Harry.”</p>
<p>She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his
stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer.
Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.</p>
<p>Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be
surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking
feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of
sight.</p>
<p>He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open
the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside seemed to be
deserted.</p>
<p>“Hermione?”</p>
<p>He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was
sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of
twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just
conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a
time like this.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just
practicing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . . they’re — er — really good. . . .” said Harry.</p>
<p>He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether
there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely
left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said,
in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron seems to be enjoying the
celebrations.”</p>
<p>“Er . . . does he?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. “He wasn’t exactly
hiding it, was — ?”</p>
<p>The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, Ron came in,
laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and
Hermione.</p>
<p>“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The
door swung shut behind her.</p>
<p>There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was
staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture
of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered where you’d got
to!”</p>
<p>Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds
continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like
a strange, feathery model of the solar system.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly.
“She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.”</p>
<p>She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at
Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.</p>
<p>“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.</p>
<p>Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her
expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of
fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his
hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh
they could reach.</p>
<p>“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury,
Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry
thought he heard a sob before it slammed.</p>
