<h4 id="chapter-twenty-one">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h4>
<p>THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM</p>
<p>Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the
nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did
increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book,
hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a
margin, as he had done so many times before.</p>
<p>“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on
Sunday evening.</p>
<p>“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the
Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting here now.”</p>
<p>“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year,” said
Hermione dismissively.</p>
<p>Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (“Sectumsempra!”)
scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was
itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione.
Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.</p>
<p>They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other
people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of
excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new
sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition
Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the
twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional
practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in
Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to
Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who
had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but
Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not
take the test whether ready or not.</p>
<p>“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. “You’ll have
no trouble come July!”</p>
<p>“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had finally managed
to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous
lesson.</p>
<p>Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was
now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that
Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to
receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the
best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory was
the most important thing to him now.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help
you with this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way
to force someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse,
which is illegal —”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the
book. “That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says
Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or
a spell. . . .”</p>
<p>“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can
get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade
Slughorn where other people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him a
potion, anyone could do that —”</p>
<p>“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his quill very
hard while staring at his parchment. “It can’t be B — U — M —”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay toward her. “And
‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G either. What kind of quill are you
using?”</p>
<p>“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones . . . but I think the
charm must be wearing off. . . .”</p>
<p>“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay,
“because we were asked how we’d deal with dementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and
I don’t remember you changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.”</p>
<p>“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. “Don’t say
I’ll have to write the whole thing out again!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the essay toward
her and taking out her wand.</p>
<p>“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing
his eyes wearily.</p>
<p>Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender
hear you saying that.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will . . . then
she’ll ditch me . . .”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho
just —”</p>
<p>“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron gloomily,
watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the
end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. “But the
more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like
going out with the giant squid.”</p>
<p>“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s
essay.</p>
<p>“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”</p>
<p>Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes
so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in
the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching
out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had
just closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his
freshly completed essay, and Harry said, “Kreacher!”</p>
<p>The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.</p>
<p>“Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is
doing, so Kreacher has come to give —”</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew.</p>
<p>“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he squeaked, casting
Kreacher a resentful look. “And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is
coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!”</p>
<p>“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden
appearances. “What’s going on, Harry?”</p>
<p>Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione
about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always
such a touchy subject with her.</p>
<p>“Well . . . they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he said.</p>
<p>“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher.</p>
<p>“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said Dobby proudly,
swaying where he stood.</p>
<p>Hermione looked indignant.</p>
<p>“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn’t tell him not
to —”</p>
<p>“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, you can sleep,
all right? But has either of you found out anything?” he hastened to
ask, before Hermione could intervene again.</p>
<p>“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,”
croaked Kreacher at once. “His features recall the fine bones of my
mistress and his manners are those of —”</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. “A bad boy who —
who —”</p>
<p>He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks
and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it; Harry, to
whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and
held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still finds it difficult
to speak ill of his old masters. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said
defiantly to Kreacher, “But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is
not a good master to a house-elf!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,”
Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been
going.”</p>
<p>Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy
eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he
attends his classes in a variety of —”</p>
<p>“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he
been going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”</p>
<p>“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining
in the firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can
discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making
regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students,
who keep watch for him while he enters —”</p>
<p>“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him.
“That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s doing . . .
whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why he’s been disappearing off the
map — come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on
there!”</p>
<p>“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If
you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.”</p>
<p>“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s
doing?” said Harry eagerly.</p>
<p>“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters
there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no
problem.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Malfoy
already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that
stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the
headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room
becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to
transform into.”</p>
<p>“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve
done brilliantly, Dobby.”</p>
<p>“Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but far from
looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked
at the ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will
pretend he cannot hear —”</p>
<p>“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last
deep bow and Disapparated. “You’d better go and get some sleep too,
Dobby.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and he too
vanished.</p>
<p>“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and
Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. “We know where Malfoy’s
going! We’ve got him cornered now!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the
sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay.
Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her
wand.</p>
<p>“But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of
students’?” said Hermione. “How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t
think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling
Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he
telling all these . . . all these . . .”</p>
<p>Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.</p>
<p>“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it?
There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve
nicked some any time during that lesson. . . .”</p>
<p>“Nicked what?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn
showed us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole
variety of students standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and
Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and
starting to pace in front of the fire. “They’re stupid enough to do what
they’re told even if he won’t tell them what he’s up to . . . but he
doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of
Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like
other people. . . . Those two girls I saw him with when he missed
Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed voice, “that that
little girl whose scales I repaired — ?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. “Of course!
Malfoy must’ve been inside the room at the time, so she — what am I
talking about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out,
because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the
toadspawn too! We’ve been walking past him all the time and not
realizing it!”</p>
<p>“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” guffawed Ron.
“Blimey . . . No wonder they don’t look too happy these days. . . . I’m
surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. . . .”</p>
<p>“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark Mark?”
said Harry.</p>
<p>“Hmmm . . . the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermione
skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay before it could come to any
more harm and handing it to him.</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” said Harry confidently.</p>
<p>“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching.
“But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be
able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s there
first. And I don’t think you should forget” — she heaved her bag onto
her shoulder and gave him a very serious look — “that what you’re
supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn.
Good night.”</p>
<p>Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to
the girls’ dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron.</p>
<p>“What d’you think?”</p>
<p>“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, staring at the
spot where Dobby had vanished. “I’d have that Apparition Test in the
bag.”</p>
<p>Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like
hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what
he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for
whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to
see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy’s . . .
what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A workshop?
Harry’s mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell
asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into
Slughorn, who turned into Snape. . . .</p>
<p>Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the
following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark
Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of
Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in
his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated
Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted
to.</p>
<p>“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the
Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her
from opening it and vanishing behind it. “I haven’t forgotten about
Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and
until I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s
doing?”</p>
<p>“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said
Hermione. “It’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or
Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around
outside the Room of Requirement” — she jerked the Prophet out from under
Harry’s hand and unfolded it to look at the front page — “you should go
and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.”</p>
<p>“Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the
headlines.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their
breakfast. “But it’s all right, he’s not dead — it’s Mundungus, he’s
been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an
Inferius during an attempted burglary . . . and someone called Octavius
Pepper has vanished. . . . Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has
been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was
under the Imperius Curse. . . .”</p>
<p>They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off
immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still
had to finish his conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and Harry for
the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the
tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.</p>
<p>Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty
passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination
he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting
inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least
his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of
Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of
Requirement’s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had
become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his
might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I
need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I need to see what
Malfoy’s doing in here. . . .</p>
<p>Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with
excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it —”</p>
<p>But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall.</p>
<p>He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained
solid and unyielding.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay . . . I thought the wrong thing. . .
.”</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed,
concentrating as hard as he could.</p>
<p>I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . I
need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . .</p>
<p>After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.</p>
<p>There was no door.</p>
<p>“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was a clear
instruction. . . . Fine . . .”</p>
<p>He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once
more.</p>
<p>I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy. . . .</p>
<p>He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his
patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop
into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering
of birds outside. He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>There was still no door.</p>
<p>Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of
first years running back around the corner, apparently under the
impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed
ghost.</p>
<p>Harry tried every variation of “I need to see what Draco Malfoy is
doing inside you” that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of
which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The
room simply did not want to open for him. Frustrated and annoyed, he set
off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility
Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went.</p>
<p>“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the
candlelit classroom. “Ten points from Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron;
half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing
their things; he could not be much later than any of them.</p>
<p>“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving
his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared
into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I hope for your
sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the
Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page — what is
it, Mr. Finnigan?”</p>
<p>“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you tell the
difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something
in the paper about an Inferius —”</p>
<p>“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice.</p>
<p>“But sir, I heard people talking —”</p>
<p>“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you
would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly
sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.”</p>
<p>“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered Harry
to Ron and Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest
—”</p>
<p>“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said Snape,
pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on
Harry. “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an
Inferius and a ghost.”</p>
<p>The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall
what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit
Slughorn.</p>
<p>“Er — well — ghosts are transparent —” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. “Yes, it is easy
to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted
on you, Potter. ‘Ghosts are transparent.’”</p>
<p>Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people
were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his
insides were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead
bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid —”</p>
<p>“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered Snape. “The
Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells.
It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s
bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the
imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth . . . and of course, as
Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.”</p>
<p>“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell
them apart!” said Ron. “When we come face-to-face with one down a dark
alley, we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t
we, we’re not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a
departed soul?’”</p>
<p>There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape
gave the class.</p>
<p>“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would expect
nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he
cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.”</p>
<p>“No!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his mouth
furiously. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in detention again,
leave it!”</p>
<p>“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said Snape,
smirking a little, “and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus
Curse. . . .”</p>
<p>Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at
the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione
mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape
hotly for his jibe about Ron’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely
irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’
bathroom with Harry.</p>
<p>“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after staring into a
cracked mirror for a minute or two. “I dunno whether it’s worth me
taking the test. I just can’t get the hang of Apparition.”</p>
<p>“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and
see where they get you,” said Harry reasonably. “It’ll be more
interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if
you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can
postpone the test, do it with me over the summ — Myrtle, this is the
boys’ bathroom!”</p>
<p>The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind
them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick,
white, round glasses.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.”</p>
<p>“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.</p>
<p>“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. “He
said he’d come back and see me, but then you said you’d pop in and visit
me too” — she gave Harry a reproachful look — “and I haven’t seen you
for months and months. I’ve learned not to expect too much from
boys.”</p>
<p>“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said Harry, who had
been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.</p>
<p>“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that doesn’t mean I
can’t visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once,
remember?”</p>
<p>“Vividly,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. “Maybe if you two
left, he’d come back again. . . . We had lots in common. . . . I’m sure
he felt it. . . .”</p>
<p>And she looked hopefully toward the door.</p>
<p>“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, sounding rather
amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old
tiled bathroom. “I mean he’s sensitive, people bully him too, and he
feels lonely and hasn’t got anybody to talk to, and he’s not afraid to
show his feelings and cry!”</p>
<p>“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry curiously. “A young
boy?”</p>
<p>“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron,
who was now definitely grinning. “I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, and
I’ll take his secret to the —”</p>
<p>“— not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The sewers, maybe
. . .”</p>
<p>Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing
water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed
to have put fresh heart into Ron.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his
shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide
about taking the test.”</p>
<p>And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the
sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a
fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go
into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a
particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen
in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt
another assault on the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p>“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron
and her in the entrance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s office and
try and get that memory from him.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He
had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to
corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast
that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his
office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion
he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old
gramophone.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been
trying to get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it
happen!”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing
his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few
steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the
caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed
the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to
devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p>Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s
Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself,
he tapped the map, murmured, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,”
and scanned it carefully.</p>
<p>As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their
various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in
another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the
basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered
around the library or up a corridor. . . . There were a few people out
in the grounds . . . and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was
Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry
was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the
room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore
sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner
into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very
same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so
kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind
her before bending very low and whispering, “Hello . . . you’re very
pretty, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into
the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound
of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor.
Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he
was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone
unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave
Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what
form of words he had not yet tried.</p>
<p>Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having
tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to,
the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond
belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not
the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing
his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.</p>
<p>“OUCH!”</p>
<p>He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped
on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.</p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter
astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently
strolled up this corridor.</p>
<p>“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his feet again; why
did she always have to find him lying on the floor?</p>
<p>“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks.</p>
<p>Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her
mouse-colored hair lank.</p>
<p>“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other side of
the castle, behind the gargoyle —”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s gone away
again.”</p>
<p>“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the
floor. “Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Tonks.</p>
<p>“What did you want to see him about?”</p>
<p>“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, apparently
unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. “I just thought he might know
what’s going on. . . . I’ve heard rumors . . . people getting hurt . .
.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. “That little
kid trying to kill his —”</p>
<p>“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, who didn’t seem
to be listening to him. “You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the
Order recently?”</p>
<p>“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said Harry, “not since
Sirius —”</p>
<p>He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean . . . I miss him, as
well. . . .”</p>
<p>“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. “Well .
. . I’ll see you around, Harry . . .”</p>
<p>And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving
Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the
Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room
of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling
in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be
back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to
Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to
come.</p>
<p>He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through
an early lunch.</p>
<p>“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he
caught sight of him. “I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam
Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near
Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved!”</p>
<p>“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione could
answer. “Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever
the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks
after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I’ll be
surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon —”</p>
<p>“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. “Have you been up
at the Room of Requirement all this time?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!”</p>
<p>“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. . . .”</p>
<p>“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his
conversation with Tonks, “she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve
after what happened at the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason looked very
concerned. “She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly
abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even
here?”</p>
<p>“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about
voicing it; this was much more Hermione’s territory than his. “You don’t
think she can have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?”</p>
<p>Hermione stared at him.</p>
<p>“What on earth makes you say that?”</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly crying when I
mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing
now. . . . I wondered whether it hadn’t become . . . you know . . .
him.”</p>
<p>“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still don’t know why
she’d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really
why she was here. . . .”</p>
<p>“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now
shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. “She’s gone a bit funny. Lost
her nerve. Women,” he said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily upset.”</p>
<p>“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt you’d
find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t
laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus
mimbletonia.”</p>
<p>Ron scowled.</p>
