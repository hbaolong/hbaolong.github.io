<h4 id="chapter-twenty-two">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h4>
<p>ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL FOR MAGICAL MALADIES AND INJURIES</p>
<p>Harry was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he did
not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on his dressing
gown, and pushed his glasses back onto his nose.</p>
<p>“Weasley, you ought to come too,” said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of
Neville, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral stairs
into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along the Fat
Lady’s moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside him might
spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore.
Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately, and what if
those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think “my fangs”) had been
poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon
them and hissed faintly, but Professor McGonagall said, “Shoo!”
Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had
reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s
office.</p>
<p>“Fizzing Whizbee,” said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split
in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward
like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped onto the moving
stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were moving
upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door
with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.</p>
<p>Though it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming from
inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though
Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker, and
the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off.
The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and
Ron inside.</p>
<p>The room was in half darkness; the strange silver instruments
standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and
emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did. The portraits of old
headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in
their frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size
of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he
leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid
out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered
purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but seemed
wide awake, his penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently upon
Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,”
said Professor McGonagall. “He says . . .”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a nightmare,” said Harry quickly.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.”</p>
<p>“I . . . well, I was asleep . . .” said Harry and even in his terror
and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly
irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his
own interlocked fingers. “But it wasn’t an ordinary dream . . . it was
real. . . . I saw it happen . . .” He took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad —
Mr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake.”</p>
<p>The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them,
slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore
leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked from
Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.</p>
<p>“How did you see this?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking
at Harry.</p>
<p>“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Harry, rather angrily — what did it
matter? “Inside my head, I suppose —”</p>
<p>“You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone.
“I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were positioned as you
watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim,
or else looking down on the scene from above?”</p>
<p>This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it
was almost as though he knew . . .</p>
<p>“I was the snake,” he said. “I saw it all from the snake’s point of
view . . .”</p>
<p>Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron,
who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is Arthur
seriously injured?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry emphatically — why were they all so slow on the
uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long
pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of
looking at him?</p>
<p>But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and addressed
one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Everard?” he said sharply. “And you too, Dilys!”</p>
<p>A sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch
with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed
to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes
immediately.</p>
<p>“You were listening?” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>The wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.”</p>
<p>“The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore. “Everard, you
will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people
—”</p>
<p>Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of
emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts),
neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of
dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. Harry noticed that
many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though
snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him under
their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they
had knocked.</p>
<p>“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts’s most celebrated Heads,”
Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron, and Professor
McGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch
beside the door. “Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging
in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to move
between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening
elsewhere . . .”</p>
<p>“But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Please sit down, all three of you,” said Dumbledore, as though Harry
had not spoken. “Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes.
. . . Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs . . .”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing
gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air,
straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz
armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing. Harry
sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumbledore was now
stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger. The phoenix awoke
immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high and observed
Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.</p>
<p>“We will need,” said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird, “a
warning.”</p>
<p>There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.</p>
<p>Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver
instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his
desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip of
his wand.</p>
<p>The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking
noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver
tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow
furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream
of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. . . . A serpent’s head
grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered
whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked eagerly at
Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look
up.</p>
<p>“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself,
still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of
surprise. “But in essence divided?”</p>
<p>Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke
serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling
and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction
Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: The
clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew faint,
became a formless haze, and vanished.</p>
<p>Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table;
Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with
their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily
pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange
silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout
from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had
reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore!”</p>
<p>“What news?” said Dumbledore at once.</p>
<p>“I yelled until someone came running,” said the wizard, who was
mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, “said I’d heard something
moving downstairs — they weren’t sure whether to believe me but went
down to check — you know there are no portraits down there to watch
from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. He doesn’t look
good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg’s portrait to
get a good view as they left —”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, “I take it
Dilys will have seen him arrive, then —”</p>
<p>And moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in her
picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, “Yes,
they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore. . . . They carried him
past under my portrait. . . . He looks bad . . .”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.”</p>
<p>“Of course . . .”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door; Harry cast
a sideways glance at Ron, who was now looking terrified.</p>
<p>“And Dumbledore — what about Molly?” said Professor McGonagall,
pausing at the door.</p>
<p>“That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout
for anybody approaching,” said Dumbledore. “But she may already know . .
. that excellent clock of hers . . .”</p>
<p>Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the
time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family
members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand must, even
now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late. . . .
Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. . . . And he
felt cold as he remembered Mrs. Weasley’s boggart turning into
Mr. Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his
face. . . . But Mr. Weasley wasn’t going to die. . . . He couldn’t. . .
.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron. He
emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed
carefully upon his desk. He raised his wand and murmured “Portus”; for a
moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light, then it
quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever.</p>
<p>Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a
clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing
the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so
deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore’s voice when he attempted to
rouse him.</p>
<p>“Phineas. Phineas.”</p>
<p>And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer
pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the
better to watch what was happening. When the clever-looking wizard
continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name too.</p>
<p>“Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!”</p>
<p>He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened
his eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Did someone call?”</p>
<p>“I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,” said
Dumbledore. “I’ve got another message.”</p>
<p>“Visit my other portrait?” said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a
long, fake yawn (his eyes traveling around the room and focusing upon
Harry). “Oh no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight . . .”</p>
<p>Something about Phineas’s voice was familiar to Harry. Where had he
heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the
surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.</p>
<p>“Insubordination, sir!” roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard,
brandishing his fists. “Dereliction of duty!”</p>
<p>“We are honor-bound to give service to the present headmaster of
Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognized as
Dumbledore’s predecessor, Armando Dippet. “Shame on you, Phineas!”</p>
<p>“Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?” called a gimlet-eyed witch,
raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.</p>
<p>“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand
slightly apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my picture
by now, he’s done most of the family —”</p>
<p>“Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said Dumbledore, and
Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas’s voice before:
issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld
Place. “You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been
gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter will be
arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming
to stay,” recited Phineas in a bored voice. “Yes, yes . . . very well .
. .”</p>
<p>He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from
view at the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred, George,
and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them
looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night things.</p>
<p>“Harry — what’s going on?” asked Ginny, who looked frightened.
“Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt —”</p>
<p>“Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order
of the Phoenix,” said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. “He has been
taken to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am
sending you back to Sirius’s house, which is much more convenient for
the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your mother there.”</p>
<p>“How’re we going?” asked Fred, looking shaken. “Floo powder?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dumbledore, “Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the
Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.” He indicated
the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. “We are just waiting for
Phineas Nigellus to report back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast
is clear before sending you —”</p>
<p>There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving
behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.</p>
<p>“It is Fawkes’s warning,” said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it
fell. “She must know you’re out of your beds. . . . Minerva, go and head
her off — tell her any story —”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.</p>
<p>“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumbledore;
the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin
banner. “My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests
. . .”</p>
<p>“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. “And
quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .”</p>
<p>Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore’s desk.</p>
<p>“You have all used a Portkey before?” asked Dumbledore, and they
nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle.
“Good. On the count of three then . . . one . . . two . . .”</p>
<p>It happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause
before Dumbledore said “three,” Harry looked up at him — they were very
close together — and Dumbledore’s clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey
to Harry’s face.</p>
<p>At once, Harry’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had
burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong,
there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant,
that he would like nothing better than to strike — to bite — to sink his
fangs into the man before him —</p>
<p>“. . . three.”</p>
<p>He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from
beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into
the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind,
the kettle pulling them onward and then —</p>
<p>His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled, the kettle
clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, “Back
again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying . . .
?”</p>
<p>“OUT!” roared a second voice.</p>
<p>Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in
the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place. The only
sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which
illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing
through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he
hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying toward them all, looking
anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes; there was also a
slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about him.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up.
“Phineas Nigellus said Arthur’s been badly injured —”</p>
<p>“Ask Harry,” said Fred.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,” said George.</p>
<p>The twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher’s footsteps had
stopped on the stairs outside.</p>
<p>“It was —” Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall
and Dumbledore. “I had a — a kind of — vision . . .”</p>
<p>And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so
that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake
attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes. . . . Ron, who
was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak. When
Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued to stare at him
for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but
he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks. Well, if they
were going to blame him for just seeing the attack, he was glad he had
not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time. . . .</p>
<p>“Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.</p>
<p>“She probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet,” said Sirius.
“The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could
interfere. I expect Dumbledore’s letting Molly know now.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,” said Ginny urgently. She looked
around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pajamas.
“Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything — ?”</p>
<p>“Hang on, you can’t go tearing off to St. Mungo’s!” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a
mulish expression, “he’s our dad!”</p>
<p>“And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked
before the hospital even let his wife know?”</p>
<p>“What does that matter?” said George hotly.</p>
<p>“It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that
Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles
away!” said Sirius angrily. “Have you any idea what the Ministry would
make of that information?”</p>
<p>Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the
Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent. Ginny
said, “Somebody else could have told us. . . . We could have heard it
somewhere other than Harry . . .”</p>
<p>“Like who?” said Sirius impatiently. “Listen, your dad’s been hurt
while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough
without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you
could seriously damage the Order’s —”</p>
<p>“We don’t care about the dumb Order!” shouted Fred.</p>
<p>“It’s our dad dying we’re talking about!” yelled George.</p>
<p>“Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank you
for messing things up for the Order!” said Sirius angrily in his turn.
“This is how it is — this is why you’re not in the Order — you don’t
understand — there are things worth dying for!”</p>
<p>“Easy for you to say, stuck here!” bellowed Fred. “I don’t see you
risking your neck!”</p>
<p>The little color remaining in Sirius’s face drained from it. He
looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when
he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. “I know it’s hard, but
we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. We’ve got to
stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?”</p>
<p>Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few
steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron,
who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, and they
sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took
seats on either side of Ginny.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Sirius encouragingly, “come on, let’s all . . .
let’s all have a drink while we’re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!”</p>
<p>He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying
toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the
debris of Sirius’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them.
They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the
crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the
table.</p>
<p>Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands. His
stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here
if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And it
was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured
that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable
business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first place.
. . .</p>
<p>Don’t be stupid, you haven’t got fangs, he told himself, trying to
keep calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking. You
were lying in bed, you weren’t attacking anyone. . . .</p>
<p>But then, what just happened in Dumbledore’s office? he asked
himself. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too. . . .</p>
<p>He put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant to,
so that it slopped over onto the table. No one took any notice. Then a
burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them
and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud
onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather.</p>
<p>“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s
not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your mother — here
—”</p>
<p>He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and read
aloud, “Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay
where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.”</p>
<p>George looked around the table.</p>
<p>“Still alive . . .” he said slowly. “But that makes it sound . .
.”</p>
<p>He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry too as
though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still
exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as
though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the parchment
out of George’s hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry,
who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it
more tightly to stop the trembling.</p>
<p>If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could
not remember it. Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but
without any real conviction, and the Weasleys’ looks of disgust were
answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the
candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, now and then
raising bottles to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to
wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure one another that if
there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs. Weasley must
long since have arrived at St. Mungo’s.</p>
<p>Fred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder.
Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry
could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his head
in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. And he
and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the
family grief, waiting . . . waiting . . .</p>
<p>And then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron’s watch, the door
swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She was extremely pale,
but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron, and Harry
half-rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be all right,” she said, her voice weak with
tiredness. “He’s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill’s
sitting with him now, he’s going to take the morning off work.”</p>
<p>Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George
and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother, and hugged her.
Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in
one.</p>
<p>“Breakfast!” said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet.
“Where’s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!”</p>
<p>But Kreacher did not answer the summons.</p>
<p>“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Sirius, counting the people in front
of him. “So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven . . . Bacon and eggs,
I think, and some tea, and toast —”</p>
<p>Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude
upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and he dreaded the moment when
Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had barely
taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them out of his
hands and pulled him into a hug.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you,
Harry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found Arthur
for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he’s
alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover story for
Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he would have
been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis . . .”</p>
<p>Harry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon
released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her
children through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have
been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as
Mr. Weasley was in hospital.</p>
<p>“Oh, Sirius, I’m so grateful. . . . They think he’ll be there a
little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course,
that might mean we’re here for Christmas . . .”</p>
<p>“The more the merrier!” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that
Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help with
breakfast.</p>
<p>“Sirius,” Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. “Can I
have a quick word? Er — now?”</p>
<p>He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble
Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had,
including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked
Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore
this?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry impatiently, “but he didn’t tell me what it meant.
Well, he doesn’t tell me anything anymore . . .”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,”
said Sirius steadily.</p>
<p>“But that’s not all,” said Harry in a voice only a little above a
whisper. “Sirius, I . . . I think I’m going mad. . . . Back in
Dumbledore’s office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple
of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar
really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore — Sirius, I wanted to
attack him —”</p>
<p>He could only see a sliver of Sirius’s face; the rest was in
darkness.</p>
<p>“It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all,” said
Sirius. “You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and
—”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It was like
something rose up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me —”</p>
<p>“You need to sleep,” said Sirius firmly. “You’re going to have
breakfast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see
Arthur after lunch with the others. You’re in shock, Harry; you’re
blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you
did witness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying . . .”</p>
<p>He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry
standing alone in the dark.</p>
<p>Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went up
to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while Ron
crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed,
hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself
deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze,
terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake
to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house
after one of the others. . . .</p>
<p>When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap
too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so
that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s. Everybody
except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of
their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted Tonks and
Mad-Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London, gleefully
laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal
his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was
short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the
underground.</p>
<p>Tonks was very interested in Harry’s vision of the attack on
Mr. Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any Seer blood in your family, is there?” she inquired
curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart
of the city.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling
insulted.</p>
<p>“No,” said Tonks musingly, “no, I suppose it’s not really prophecy
you’re doing, is it? I mean, you’re not seeing the future, you’re seeing
the present. . . . It’s odd, isn’t it? Useful, though . . .”</p>
<p>Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a
station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the
train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and
Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator,
Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted low and
one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his
wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him;
trying to deflect more questions about his dream he asked Mad-Eye where
St. Mungo’s was hidden.</p>
<p>“Not far from here,” grunted Moody as they stepped out into the
wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers.
He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind;
Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat.
“Wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon
Alley was big enough and we couldn’t have it underground like the
Ministry — unhealthy. In the end they managed to get hold of a building
up here. Theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in
with the crowd . . .”</p>
<p>He seized Harry’s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a
gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby
shop full of electrical gadgets.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” said Moody a moment later.</p>
<p>They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red brick department
store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air;
the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs
askew, standing at random and modeling fashions at least ten years out
of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read CLOSED FOR
REFURBISHMENT. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic
shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, “It’s never open, that
place . . .”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Tonks, beckoning them forward to a window displaying
nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eyelashes were
hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore dress.
“Everybody ready?”</p>
<p>They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave Harry another shove
between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close
to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, her breath
steaming up the glass, “Wotcher . . . We’re here to see Arthur
Weasley.”</p>
<p>For a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to
expect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of
glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the
racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that
dummies could not hear anyway. Next second his mouth opened in shock as
the dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned its jointed finger, and Tonks had
seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the
glass and vanished.</p>
<p>Fred, George, and Ron stepped after them; Harry glanced around at the
jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for
window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of them
seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in
front of them.</p>
<p>“C’mon,” growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back and
together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool
water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood.
They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where
rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking
perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of Witch Weekly, others
sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands
sticking out of their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the
street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar
noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the front row, who was
fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept
letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her
mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell
every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated horribly, so
that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the
rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge’s.
Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone,
crossed.</p>
<p>“Are they doctors?” he asked Ron quietly.</p>
<p>“Doctors?” said Ron, looking startled. “Those Muggle nutters that cut
people up? Nah, they’re Healers.”</p>
<p>“Over here!” called Mrs. Weasley over the renewed clanging of the
warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a
plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked INQUIRIES. The wall behind
her was covered in notices and posters saying things like A CLEAN
CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE
ANTI-DON’TS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER.</p>
<p>There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets
that was labelled</p>
<p>DILYS DERWENT</p>
<p>ST. MUNGO’S HEALER 1722–1741</p>
<p>HEADMISTRESS OF HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY,
1741–1768</p>
<p>Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party as though counting them; when
Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her
portrait, and vanished.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing
an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain
his predicament to the witch behind the desk.</p>
<p>“It’s these — ouch — shoes my brother gave me — ow — they’re eating
my — OUCH — feet — look at them, there must be some kind of — AARGH —
jinx on them and I can’t — AAAAARGH — get them off —”</p>
<p>He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot
coals.</p>
<p>“The shoes don’t prevent you reading, do they?” said the blonde witch
irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. “You want
Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the floor guide.
Next!”</p>
<p>The wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the Weasley
party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide:</p>
<p>ARTIFACT ACCIDENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ground

<p>If you are unsure where to go, incapable of normal speech, or unable
to remember why you are here, our Welcome Witch will be pleased to
help.</p>
<p>A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the
front of the queue now.</p>
<p>“I’m here to see Broderick Bode!” he wheezed.</p>
<p>“Ward forty-nine, but I’m afraid you’re wasting your time,” said the
witch dismissively. “He’s completely addled, you know, still thinks he’s
a teapot. . . . Next!”</p>
<p>A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by
the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large,
feathery wings that had sprouted right out the back of her romper
suit.</p>
<p>“Fourth floor,” said the witch in a bored voice, without asking, and
the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, holding
his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. “Next!”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk.</p>
<p>“Hello,” she said. “My husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to be
moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us — ?”</p>
<p>“Arthur Weasley?” said the witch, running her finger down a long list
in front of her. “Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai
Llewellyn ward.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Come on, you lot.”</p>
<p>They followed through the double doors and along the narrow corridor
beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by
crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking
like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked
in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted
into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they
heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the
“Creature-Induced Injuries” corridor, where the second door on the right
bore the words “DANGEROUS” DAI LLEWELLYN WARD: SERIOUS BITES. Underneath
this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten
Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus
Pye.</p>
<p>“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” Tonks said. “Arthur won’t want too many
visitors at once. . . . It ought to be just the family first.”</p>
<p>Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his
back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all
directions. Harry drew back too, but Mrs. Weasley reached out a hand and
pushed him through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, Harry, Arthur
wants to thank you . . .”</p>
<p>The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and
set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from more
shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The
walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather
vicious-looking wizard on the wall, captioned URQUHART RACKHARROW,
1612–1697, INVENTOR OF THE ENTRAIL-EXPELLING CURSE.</p>
<p>There were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed at
the far end of the ward beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and
relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading
the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed.
He looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was,
beamed.</p>
<p>“Hello!” he called, throwing the Prophet aside. “Bill just left,
Molly, had to get back to work, but he says he’ll drop in on you later .
. .”</p>
<p>“How are you, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss his
cheek and looking anxiously into his face. “You’re still looking a bit
peaky . . .”</p>
<p>“I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his
good arm to give Ginny a hug. “If they could only take the bandages off,
I’d be fit to go home.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t they take them off, Dad?” asked Fred.</p>
<p>“Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said
Mr. Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his
bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his
bedside to seat them all. “It seems there was some rather unusual kind
of poison in that snake’s fangs that keeps wounds open. . . . They’re
sure they’ll find an antidote, though, they say they’ve had much worse
cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a
Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,” he
said, dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in which a
man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. “Bitten by
a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.”</p>
<p>“A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. “Is he safe in
a public ward? Shouldn’t he be in a private room?”</p>
<p>“It’s two weeks till full moon,” Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly.
“They’ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, trying
to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I said to
him — didn’t mention names, of course — but I said I knew a werewolf
personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage
. . .”</p>
<p>“What did he say?” asked George.</p>
<p>“Said he’d give me another bite if I didn’t shut up,” said
Mr. Weasley sadly. “And that woman over there,” he indicated the only
other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, “won’t tell the
Healers what bit her, which makes us all think it must have been
something she was handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk
out of her leg, very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.”</p>
<p>“So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?” asked Fred, pulling
his chair closer to the bed.</p>
<p>“Well, you already know, don’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, with a
significant smile at Harry. “It’s very simple — I’d had a very long day,
dozed off, got sneaked up on, and bitten.”</p>
<p>“Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?” asked Fred, indicating
the newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.</p>
<p>“No, of course not,” said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile,
“the Ministry wouldn’t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got
—”</p>
<p>“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley warningly.</p>
<p>“— got — er — me,” Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite
sure that was not what he had meant to say.</p>
<p>“So where were you when it happened, Dad?” asked George.</p>
<p>“That’s my business,” said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile. He
snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, “I was just
reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest when you arrived. You know
Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer?
One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they found him
lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in —”</p>
<p>“When you say you were ‘on duty,’” Fred interrupted in a low voice,
“what were you doing?”</p>
<p>“You heard your father,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, “we are not
discussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur —”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t ask me how, but he actually got off on the toilet
charge,” said Mr. Weasley grimly. “I can only suppose gold changed hands
—”</p>
<p>“You were guarding it, weren’t you?” said George quietly. “The
weapon? The thing You-Know-Who’s after?”</p>
<p>“George, be quiet!” snapped Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, “this time Willy’s been
caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don’t think he’ll be
able to worm his way out of it because according to this article, two
Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo’s for emergency bone
regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it, Muggles in
St. Mungo’s! I wonder which ward they’re in?”</p>
<p>And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say You-Know-Who’s got a snake, Harry?” asked Fred,
looking at his father for a reaction. “A massive one? You saw it the
night he returned, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “Mad-Eye and Tonks are
outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can wait
outside,” she added to her children and Harry. “You can come and say
good-bye afterward. Go on . . .”</p>
<p>They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and
closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Fine,” he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, “be like that.
Don’t tell us anything.”</p>
<p>“Looking for these?” said George, holding out what looked like a
tangle of flesh-colored string.</p>
<p>“You read my mind,” said Fred, grinning. “Let’s see if St. Mungo’s
puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?”</p>
<p>He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable
Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around. Harry
hesitated to take one.</p>
<p>“Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the
right to eavesdrop on him it’s you . . .”</p>
<p>Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and
inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.</p>
<p>“Okay, go!” Fred whispered.</p>
<p>The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then
snaked under the door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing, then
he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right
beside him.</p>
<p>“. . . they searched the whole area but they couldn’t find the snake
anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur.
. . . But You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can
he?”</p>
<p>“I reckon he sent it as a lookout,” growled Moody, “’cause he’s not
had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he’s trying to get a clearer
picture of what he’s facing and if Arthur hadn’t been there the beast
would’ve had much more time to look around. So Potter says he saw it all
happen?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. “You know,
Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something
like this . . .”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the Potter
kid, we all know that.”</p>
