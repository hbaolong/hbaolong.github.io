<h4 id="chapter-thirty-three">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h4>
<p>THE DEATH EATERS</p>
<p>Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body.
His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed
his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were
slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness.
He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and
exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay
twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had
slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing.
Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a
deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he
raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and
thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot
of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his
scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>Wormtail’s robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the
stump of his arm in them.</p>
<p>“My Lord . . .” he choked, “my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did
promise . . .”</p>
<p>“Hold out your arm,” said Voldemort lazily.</p>
<p>“Oh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .”</p>
<p>He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.</p>
<p>“The other arm, Wormtail.”</p>
<p>“Master, please . . . please . . .”</p>
<p>Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left arm; he forced the
sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something
upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a
snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky
at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it
carefully, ignoring Wormtail’s uncontrollable weeping.</p>
<p>“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it . . .
and now, we shall see . . . now we shall know . . .”</p>
<p>He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail’s
arm.</p>
<p>The scar on Harry’s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and
Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from
Wormtail’s mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.</p>
<p>A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up,
threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.</p>
<p>“How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?” he
whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. “And how many
will be foolish enough to stay away?”</p>
<p>He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping
the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at
Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.</p>
<p>“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,” he
hissed softly. “A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother.
But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend
you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has
proved himself, in death. . . .”</p>
<p>Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him
as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass.</p>
<p>“You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there.
My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with
him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. . . . He
didn’t like magic, my father . . .</p>
<p>“He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even
born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised
in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged
myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . .
.”</p>
<p>Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.</p>
<p>“Listen to me, reliving family history . . .” he said quietly, “why,
I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family
returns. . . .”</p>
<p>The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves,
behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating.
All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward .
. . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes.
Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death
Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem
of his black robes.</p>
<p>“Master . . . Master . . .” he murmured.</p>
<p>The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching
Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and
standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle’s grave,
Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail.
Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people.
Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the
hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run
around the circle, as though it had shivered.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Death Eaters,” said Voldemort quietly. “Thirteen years . .
. thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it
were yesterday. . . . We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or
are we?”</p>
<p>He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils
widening.</p>
<p>“I smell guilt,” he said. “There is a stench of guilt upon the
air.”</p>
<p>A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it
longed, but did not dare, to step back from him.</p>
<p>“I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact — such
prompt appearances! — and I ask myself . . . why did this band of
wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore
eternal loyalty?”</p>
<p>No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground,
still sobbing over his bleeding arm.</p>
<p>“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they must have believed
me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies,
and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . .</p>
<p>“And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not
rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself
against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my
power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?</p>
<p>“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power
could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps
they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of
commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>At the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members of the circle
stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored
them.</p>
<p>“It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. .
. .”</p>
<p>One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle.
Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.</p>
<p>“Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!”</p>
<p>Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.</p>
<p>“Crucio!”</p>
<p>The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure
the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he
thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . .</p>
<p>Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the
ground, gasping.</p>
<p>“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You ask for
forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . .
. I want thirteen years’ repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here
has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?”</p>
<p>He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.</p>
<p>“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old
friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master . . . please . .
.”</p>
<p>“Yet you helped return me to my body,” said Voldemort coolly,
watching Wormtail sob on the ground. “Worthless and traitorous as you
are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . .
.”</p>
<p>Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A
streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand’s
wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a
gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared
downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail’s bleeding wrist.</p>
<p>Wormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged,
he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now
attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling
glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small
twig on the ground and crushed it into powder.</p>
<p>“My Lord,” he whispered. “Master . . . it is beautiful . . . thank
you . . . thank you. . . .”</p>
<p>He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort’s
robes.</p>
<p>“May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,” said Voldemort.</p>
<p>“No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .”</p>
<p>Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his
powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now
approached the man on Wormtail’s right.</p>
<p>“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him. “I am
told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you
present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a
spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me,
Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I
daresay . . . but might not your energies have been better directed
toward finding and aiding your master?”</p>
<p>“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s voice
swiftly from beneath the hood. “Had there been any sign from you, any
whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately,
nothing could have prevented me —”</p>
<p>“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it
into the sky last summer?” said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped
talking abruptly. “Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have
disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the
future.”</p>
<p>“Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. .
. .”</p>
<p>Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space — large enough
for two people — that separated Malfoy and the next man.</p>
<p>“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort quietly. “But they
are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather
than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will
be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they
are our natural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I
shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of
creatures whom all fear. . . .”</p>
<p>He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he
paused before others and spoke to them.</p>
<p>“Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic
now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon,
Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . .”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Master . . . thank you,” murmured Macnair.</p>
<p>“And here” — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures —
“we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not,
Crabbe? And you, Goyle?”</p>
<p>They bowed clumsily, muttering dully.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master . . .”</p>
<p>“We will, Master. . . .”</p>
<p>“The same goes for you, Nott,” said Voldemort quietly as he walked
past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle’s shadow.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful
—”</p>
<p>“That will do,” said Voldemort.</p>
<p>He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with
his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.</p>
<p>“And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my
service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I
believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and
one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered
my service.”</p>
<p>The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at
one another through their masks.</p>
<p>“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his
efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . .</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes
of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction. “Harry Potter has kindly
joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my
guest of honor.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail
stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the
mask.</p>
<p>“Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you
have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to
us. . . .”</p>
<p>“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort. “And it begins —
and ends — with my young friend here.”</p>
<p>He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the
whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to
circle.</p>
<p>“You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?”
Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn
so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. “You all know that on the
night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died
in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a
protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the
boy.”</p>
<p>Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close
to Harry’s cheek.</p>
<p>“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is
old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . .
. but no matter. I can touch him now.”</p>
<p>Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and
thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in
his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death
Eaters.</p>
<p>“I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by
the woman’s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . .
pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I
was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest
ghost . . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know . . .
I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to
immortality. You know my goal — to conquer death. And now, I was tested,
and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for
I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it.
Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and
without the means to help myself . . . for I had no body, and every
spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . .</p>
<p>“I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by
second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I
waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find
me . . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to
restore me to a body . . . but I waited in vain. . . .”</p>
<p>The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters.
Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.</p>
<p>“Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others.
But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that
the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited
animals — snakes, of course, being my preference — but I was little
better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill
adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their
lives; none of them lasted long. . . .</p>
<p>“Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed
assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and gullible — wandered across my
path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I
had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at Dumbledore’s school .
. . he was easy to bend to my will . . . he brought me back to this
country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise
him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not
manage to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone. I was not to be assured immortal
life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. . .
.”</p>
<p>Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the
yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in
their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.</p>
<p>“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as
ever I had been,” Voldemort continued. “I returned to my hiding place
far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn’t then fear that I
might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest
hour . . . I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to
possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters
cared what had become of me. . . .”</p>
<p>One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably,
but Voldemort took no notice.</p>
<p>“And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it
happened at last . . . a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had
faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those
he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He
sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . .
. helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a
curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little
friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that
they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths
by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . .</p>
<p>“But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For,
hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to
find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who
should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry
of Magic.</p>
<p>“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have
been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But
Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected
from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime
stroll. He overpowered her . . . he brought her to me. And Bertha
Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond
my wildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she became a
veritable mine of information.</p>
<p>“She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at
Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater
who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him.
She told me many things . . . but the means I used to break the Memory
Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful
information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair.
She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of
her.”</p>
<p>Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and
pitiless.</p>
<p>“Wormtail’s body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all
assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed.
However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard
though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him,
which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I
would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for
true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my own invention . . . a little
help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s red eyes fell upon the
continually circling snake, “a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and
the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost
human form, and strong enough to travel.</p>
<p>“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone anymore, for I
knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I
was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I
set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and
my old strength.</p>
<p>“I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the
potion that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful
ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not,
Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . .</p>
<p>“My father’s bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here,
where he was buried. But the blood of a foe . . . Wormtail would have
had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated
me . . . as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if
I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I
wanted Harry Potter’s blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had
stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering
protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. .
. .</p>
<p>“But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected
than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long
ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy’s future. Dumbledore invoked
an ancient magic, to ensure the boy’s protection as long as he is in his
relations’ care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course,
there was the Quidditch World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might
be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not
yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry
wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under
the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So
how could I take him?</p>
<p>“Why . . . by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of course. Use my
one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the
boy’s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to
ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard
Cup first — the Cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey,
which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore’s help and
protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you
all believed had been my downfall. . . .”</p>
<p>Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised
his wand.</p>
<p>“Crucio!”</p>
<p>It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very
bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his
eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to black
out . . . to die . . .</p>
<p>And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him
to the headstone of Voldemort’s father, looking up into those bright red
eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the
Death Eaters’ laughter.</p>
<p>“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could
ever have been stronger than me,” said Voldemort. “But I want there to
be no mistake in anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky
chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and
now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and
no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed
to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger.
Just a little longer, Nagini,” he whispered, and the snake glided away
through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching.</p>
<p>“Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.”</p>
