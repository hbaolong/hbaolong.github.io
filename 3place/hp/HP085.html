<h4 id="chapter-twenty-eight">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h4>
<p>THE MADNESS OF MR. CROUCH</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on
Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested,
whether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had
been so long since she’d had a job. When they had watched her fly out of
sight through the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to
give Dobby his new socks.</p>
<p>The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying
and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his
present.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked, wiping large tears
out of his enormous eyes.</p>
<p>“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,” said
Harry.</p>
<p>“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said Ron, who was
looking around at the beaming and bowing house-elves.</p>
<p>“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably, but a great
silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by
four elves.</p>
<p>“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,” Harry
muttered.</p>
<p>“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You couldn’t give
us a bit of extra food, could you?” he said to the surrounding elves,
and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.</p>
<p>“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was looking around.</p>
<p>“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby quietly, his ears
drooping slightly.</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky.</p>
<p>Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same
stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that
she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick
behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a
bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the
fire. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup.</p>
<p>“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,” Dobby whispered to
Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not strong, that stuff,” Harry said.</p>
<p>But Dobby shook his head. “’Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,” he
said.</p>
<p>Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her
disapproving looks as they returned to work.</p>
<p>“Winky is pining, Harry Potter,” Dobby whispered sadly. “Winky wants
to go home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and
nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her
master now.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Winky,” said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking
over to her, and bending down, “you don’t know what Mr. Crouch might be
up to, do you? Because he’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard
Tournament.”</p>
<p>Winky’s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She
swayed slightly again and then said, “M — Master is stopped — hic —
coming?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “we haven’t seen him since the first task. The
Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill.”</p>
<p>Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.</p>
<p>“Master — hic — ill?”</p>
<p>Her bottom lip began to tremble.</p>
<p>“But we’re not sure if that’s true,” said Hermione quickly.</p>
<p>“Master is needing his — hic — Winky!” whimpered the elf. “Master
cannot — hic — manage — hic — all by himself. . . .”</p>
<p>“Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,”
Hermione said severely.</p>
<p>“Winky — hic — is not only — hic — doing housework for Mr. Crouch!”
Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping
butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse. “Master is — hic —
trusting Winky with — hic — the most important — hic — the most secret
—”</p>
<p>“What?” said Harry.</p>
<p>But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down
herself.</p>
<p>“Winky keeps — hic — her master’s secrets,” she said mutinously,
swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed.
“You is — hic — nosing, you is.”</p>
<p>“Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!” said Dobby angrily.
“Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!”</p>
<p>“He is nosing — hic — into my master’s — hic — private and secret —
hic — Winky is a good house-elf — hic — Winky keeps her silence — hic —
people trying to — hic — pry and poke — hic —”</p>
<p>Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off
her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of
butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen
house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked
up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth
and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.</p>
<p>“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!” squeaked a nearby
elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. “We is hoping you will
not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!”</p>
<p>“She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated. “Why don’t you try and
cheer her up instead of covering her up?”</p>
<p>“Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf, bowing deeply again,
“but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be
done and masters to be served.”</p>
<p>“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Hermione cried. “Listen to me, all of you!
You’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You’ve got the
right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do
everything you’re told — look at Dobby!”</p>
<p>“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby mumbled, looking
scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves
around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she
were mad and dangerous.</p>
<p>“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and he
shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s arms.
“Good-bye!”</p>
<p>The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began
shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the
smalls of their backs.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called miserably from
the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was
Winky.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?” said Ron
angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. “They won’t want
us visiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky
about Crouch!”</p>
<p>“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You only like
coming down here for the food!”</p>
<p>It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron
and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common
room that he took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his
own.</p>
<p>Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the
mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech
owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd
carrying the large package between them, Harry leaned on the windowsill,
looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the
Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An
eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrid’s chimney;
it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight.
Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his
cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he were
making a new vegetable patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from
the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be
trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but
did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned
to the carriage shortly afterward.</p>
<p>Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and
Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the
darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake,
swooshing past him into the night.</p>
<p>By breakfast the next day Ron’s and Hermione’s bad moods had burnt
out, and to Harry’s relief, Ron’s dark predictions that the house-elves
would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione
had insulted them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite
as good as usual.</p>
<p>When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to
be expecting something.</p>
<p>“Percy won’t’ve had time to answer yet,” said Ron. “We only sent
Hedwig yesterday.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that,” said Hermione. “I’ve taken out a subscription to
the Daily Prophet. I’m getting sick of finding everything out from the
Slytherins.”</p>
<p>“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey,
Hermione, I think you’re in luck —”</p>
<p>A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed.
“It’s —”</p>
<p>But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate,
closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.</p>
<p>“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing
Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all
of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter
first.</p>
<p>“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray
owl, opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going
rather red.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”</p>
<p>She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten,
but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the
Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>You are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErves BeTteR. GO back wherE
you cAMe from mUGgle.</p>
<p>“They’re all like it!” said Hermione desperately, opening one letter
after another. “‘Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you.
. . .’ ‘You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn. . . .’ Ouch!”</p>
<p>She had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-green liquid smelling
strongly of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large
yellow boils.</p>
<p>“Undiluted bubotuber pus!” said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly
and sniffing it.</p>
<p>“Ow!” said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub
the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly
covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a
pair of thick, knobbly gloves.</p>
<p>“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said Harry as the owls
around Hermione took flight. “We’ll tell Professor Sprout where you’ve
gone. . . .”</p>
<p>“I warned her!” said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall,
cradling her hands. “I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at
this one . . .” He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind:
“‘I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false
and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse
by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’ Blimey, she’d
better watch out for herself.”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the
greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy
Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of
Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, “Potter, have
you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at
breakfast?”</p>
<p>Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of
knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.</p>
<p>Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with
unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of
open crates at his feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates —
surely not another skrewt hatching? — but when he got near enough to see
inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures
with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and
they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the
attention.</p>
<p>“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.
“Yeh find ’em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There
yeh go, look.”</p>
<p>One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy
Parkinson’s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.</p>
<p>“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily. “Thought
we’d have some fun with ’em today. See over there?” He pointed at the
large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from
the Owlery window. “I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve got a prize fer
whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus’ take off all yer
valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get ready ter set ’em loose.”</p>
<p>Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as
it didn’t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he picked
up a niffler. It put its long snout in Harry’s ear and sniffed
enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly.</p>
<p>“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, “there’s a spare
niffler here . . . who’s missin’? Where’s Hermione?”</p>
<p>“She had to go to the hospital wing,” said Ron.</p>
<p>“We’ll explain later,” Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was
listening.</p>
<p>It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical
Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though
it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it
and spitting gold into their hands. Ron’s was particularly efficient; it
had soon filled his lap with coins.</p>
<p>“Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?” he asked excitedly as his
niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes.</p>
<p>“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron,” said Hagrid, grinning. “They wreck
houses, nifflers. I reckon they’ve nearly got the lot, now,” he added,
pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive.
“I on’y buried a hundred coins. Oh there y’are, Hermione!”</p>
<p>Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands were very
heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching
her beadily.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s check how yeh’ve done!” said Hagrid. “Count yer coins!
An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal any, Goyle,” he added, his
beetle-black eyes narrowed. “It’s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few
hours.”</p>
<p>Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out
that Ron’s niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him an
enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across
the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle,
but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the
nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them
out of her carriage window.</p>
<p>“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said Hagrid, looking
concerned.</p>
<p>Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning,
and the envelope full of bubotuber pus.</p>
<p>“Aaah, don’ worry,” said Hagrid gently, looking down at her. “I got
some o’ those letters an’ all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou’ me mum.
‘Yeh’re a monster an’ yeh should be put down.’ ‘Yer mother killed
innocent people an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a lake.’”</p>
<p>“No!” said Hermione, looking shocked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin
wall. “They’re jus’ nutters, Hermione. Don’ open ’em if yeh get any
more. Chuck ’em straigh’ in the fire.”</p>
<p>“You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told Hermione as they headed
back toward the castle. “They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron?”</p>
<p>Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He
looked thoroughly put out about something.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “Wrong flavor?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Ron shortly. “Why didn’t you tell me about the gold?”</p>
<p>“What gold?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Ron. “The
leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why
didn’t you tell me it disappeared?”</p>
<p>Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was
talking about.</p>
<p>“Oh . . .” he said, the memory coming back to him at last. “I dunno .
. . I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand,
wasn’t I?”</p>
<p>They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great
Hall for lunch.</p>
<p>“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started
serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. “To have so much
money you don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.”</p>
<p>“Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said Harry
impatiently. “We all did, remember?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes,” Ron muttered. “I thought I
was paying you back. You shouldn’t’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat
for Christmas.”</p>
<p>“Forget it, all right?” said Harry.</p>
<p>Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it.
Then he said, “I hate being poor.”</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew
what to say.</p>
<p>“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. “I don’t
blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could.
Wish I had a niffler.”</p>
<p>“Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,” said Hermione
brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on,
Ron, it could be worse. At least your fingers aren’t full of pus.”
Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her
fingers were so stiff and swollen. “I hate that Skeeter woman!” she
burst out savagely. “I’ll get her back for this if it’s the last thing I
do!”</p>
<p>Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week,
and although she followed Hagrid’s advice and stopped opening it,
several of her ill-wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the
Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear.
Even those people who didn’t read Witch Weekly knew all about the
supposed Harry–Krum–Hermione triangle now. Harry was getting sick of
telling people that Hermione wasn’t his girlfriend.</p>
<p>“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just ignore it. .
. . People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time —”</p>
<p>“I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations when
she’s supposed to be banned from the grounds!” said Hermione
angrily.</p>
<p>Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager
to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection
that many of them were nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case
of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked
away from the class.</p>
<p>“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!” Hermione
panted five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the
entrance hall and pulling Harry’s hand away from one of his wiggling
ears so that he could hear her. “Moody says he didn’t see her anywhere
near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the
lake!”</p>
<p>“Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?” said
Ron.</p>
<p>“No!” said Hermione stubbornly. “I want to know how she heard me
talking to Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrid’s mum!”</p>
<p>“Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Bugged?” said Ron blankly. “What . . . put fleas on her or
something?”</p>
<p>Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording
equipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts: A History?”</p>
<p>“What’s the point?” said Ron. “You know it by heart, we can just ask
you.”</p>
<p>“All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity,
computers, and radar, and all those things — they all go haywire around
Hogwarts, there’s too much magic in the air. No, Rita’s using magic to
eavesdrop, she must be. . . . If I could just find out what it is . . .
ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her . . .”</p>
<p>“Haven’t we got enough to worry about?” Ron asked her. “Do we have to
start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to help!” Hermione snapped. “I’ll do it on my
own!”</p>
<p>She marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance.
Harry was quite sure she was going to the library.</p>
<p>“What’s the betting she comes back with a box of I Hate Rita Skeeter
badges?” said Ron.</p>
<p>Hermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue
vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful,
because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the
Easter holidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact that Hermione could
research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else
they had to do. He was working flat-out just to get through all their
homework, though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to
the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not
forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed notes
to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened,
and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.</p>
<p>Hedwig didn’t return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy’s
letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had
sent. Both Harry’s and Ron’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of
homemade toffee. Hermione’s, however, was smaller than a chicken egg.
Her face fell when she saw it.</p>
<p>“Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?”
she asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. “Gets it for the
recipes.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to see what Percy’s written?” Harry asked her
hastily.</p>
<p>Percy’s letter was short and irritated.</p>
<p>As I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr. Crouch is taking a
well-deserved break. He is sending in regular owls with instructions.
No, I haven’t actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my
own superior’s handwriting. I have quite enough to do at the moment
without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors. Please don’t bother me
again unless it’s something important. Happy Easter.</p>
<p>The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was
training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year,
however, it was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for
which he needed to prepare, but he still didn’t know what he would have
to do. Finally, in the last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him
back in Transfiguration.</p>
<p>“You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o’clock,
Potter,” she told him. “Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions
about the third task.”</p>
<p>So at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in
Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall,
Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room.</p>
<p>“What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry as they went
together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. “Fleur keeps
going on about underground tunnels; she reckons we’ve got to find
treasure.”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t be too bad,” said Harry, thinking that he would simply
ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him.</p>
<p>They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned
through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.</p>
<p>“What’ve they done to it?” Cedric said indignantly, stopping
dead.</p>
<p>The Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as
though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that
twisted and crisscrossed in every direction.</p>
<p>“They’re hedges!” said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.</p>
<p>“Hello there!” called a cheery voice.</p>
<p>Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and
Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the
hedges. Fleur beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude toward him
had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake.</p>
<p>“Well, what d’you think?” said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric
climbed over the last hedge. “Growing nicely, aren’t they? Give them a
month and Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high. Don’t worry,” he added,
grinning, spotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harry’s and
Cedric’s faces, “you’ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once
the task is over! Now, I imagine you can guess what we’re making
here?”</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment. Then —</p>
<p>“Maze,” grunted Krum.</p>
<p>“That’s right!” said Bagman. “A maze. The third task’s really very
straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the
maze. The first champion to touch it will receive full marks.”</p>
<p>“We seemply ’ave to get through the maze?” said Fleur.</p>
<p>“There will be obstacles,” said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls
of his feet. “Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there
will be spells that must be broken . . . all that sort of thing, you
know. Now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start
into the maze.” Bagman grinned at Harry and Cedric. “Then Mr. Krum will
enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But you’ll all be in with a fighting
chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles. Should be fun,
eh?”</p>
<p>Harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was
likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be
any fun at all. However, he nodded politely like the other
champions.</p>
<p>“Very well . . . if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go back up
to the castle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly. . . .”</p>
<p>Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of
the growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start
offering to help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>“Could I haff a vord?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, slightly surprised.</p>
<p>“Vill you valk vith me?”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry curiously.</p>
<p>Bagman looked slightly perturbed.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman,” said Harry, suppressing a smile, “I
think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.”</p>
<p>Harry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a
course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the
forest.</p>
<p>“What’re we going this way for?” said Harry as they passed Hagrid’s
cabin and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.</p>
<p>“Don’t vont to be overheard,” said Krum shortly.</p>
<p>When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way
from the Beauxbatons horses’ paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the
trees and turned to face Harry.</p>
<p>“I vant to know,” he said, glowering, “vot there is between you and
Hermy-own-ninny.”</p>
<p>Harry, who from Krum’s secretive manner had expected something much
more serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry, somehow
struck anew by how tall Krum was, elaborated. “We’re friends. She’s not
my girlfriend and she never has been. It’s just that Skeeter woman
making things up.”</p>
<p>“Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,” said Krum, looking
suspiciously at Harry.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor
Krum, the famous International Quidditch player. It was as though the
eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an equal — a real rival
—</p>
<p>“You haff never . . . you haff not . . .”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry very firmly.</p>
<p>Krum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds,
then said, “You fly very vell. I vos votching at the first task.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much
taller himself. “I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski
Feint, you really —”</p>
<p>But something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some
experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively
grabbed Krum’s arm and pulled him around.</p>
<p>“Vot is it?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d seen movement.
He slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.</p>
<p>Suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment,
Harry didn’t recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.</p>
<p>He looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his
robes were ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and
gray with exhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a
wash and a trim. His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way
he was behaving. Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be
talking to someone that he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of
an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That
man too had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had
seized Dudley’s hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle
Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would
like to do with beggars and vagrants.</p>
<p>“Vosn’t he a judge?” said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. “Isn’t he vith
your Ministry?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward
Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby
tree.</p>
<p>“. . . and when you’ve done that, Weatherby, send an owl to
Dumbledore confirming the number of Durmstrang students who will be
attending the tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will be
twelve. . . .”</p>
<p>“Mr. Crouch?” said Harry cautiously.</p>
<p>“. . . and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might
want to up the number of students she’s bringing, now Karkaroff’s made
it a round dozen . . . do that, Weatherby, will you? Will you? Will . .
.”</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch’s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree,
muttering soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to his
knees.</p>
<p>“Mr. Crouch?” Harry said loudly. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Crouch’s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum,
who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in
alarm.</p>
<p>“Vot is wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“No idea,” Harry muttered. “Listen, you’d better go and get someone
—”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore!” gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful
of Harry’s robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over
Harry’s head. “I need . . . see . . . Dumbledore. . . .”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Harry, “if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the
—”</p>
<p>“I’ve done . . . stupid . . . thing . . .” Mr. Crouch breathed. He
looked utterly mad. His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of
spittle was sliding down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost
him a terrible effort. “Must . . . tell . . . Dumbledore . . .”</p>
<p>“Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said Harry loudly and clearly. “Get up, I’ll
take you to Dumbledore!”</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.</p>
<p>“Who . . . you?” he whispered.</p>
<p>“I’m a student at the school,” said Harry, looking around at Krum for
some help, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.</p>
<p>“You’re not . . . his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking
about.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore’s?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch’s grip on
his robes, but it was too powerful.</p>
<p>“Warn . . . Dumbledore . . .”</p>
<p>“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,” said Harry. “Just let go,
Mr. Crouch, and I’ll get him. . . .”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a
cup of tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a
concert tonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.”</p>
<p>Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed
completely unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much
he didn’t notice that Crouch had released him.</p>
<p>“Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.s, most satisfactory,
yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that
memo from the Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to
draft a response. . . .”</p>
<p>“You stay here with him!” Harry said to Krum. “I’ll get Dumbledore,
I’ll be quicker, I know where his office is —”</p>
<p>“He is mad,” said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was
still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.</p>
<p>“Just stay with him,” said Harry, starting to get up, but his
movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who
seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the
ground.</p>
<p>“Don’t . . . leave . . . me!” he whispered, his eyes bulging again.
“I . . . escaped . . . must warn . . . must tell . . . see Dumbledore .
. . my fault . . . all my fault . . . Bertha . . . dead . . . all my
fault . . . my son . . . my fault . . . tell Dumbledore . . . Harry
Potter . . . the Dark Lord . . . stronger . . . Harry Potter . . .”</p>
<p>“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!” said Harry. He
looked furiously around at Krum. “Help me, will you?”</p>
<p>Looking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down
next to Mr. Crouch.</p>
<p>“Just keep him here,” said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch.
“I’ll be back with Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from
the forest and up through the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman,
Cedric, and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps,
through the oak front doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the
second floor.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing
halfway along an empty corridor.</p>
<p>“Lem — lemon drop!” he panted at it.</p>
<p>This was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore’s office
— or at least, it had been two years ago. The password had evidently
changed, however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump
aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry malevolently.</p>
<p>“Move!” Harry shouted at it. “C’mon!”</p>
<p>But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it;
he knew it was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps
Dumbledore was in the staffroom? He started running as fast as he could
toward the staircase —</p>
<p>“POTTER!”</p>
<p>Harry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just emerged
from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was
sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Potter?”</p>
<p>“I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry, running back up the
corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. “It’s
Mr. Crouch . . . he’s just turned up . . . he’s in the forest . . . he’s
asking —”</p>
<p>“What is this rubbish?” said Snape, his black eyes glittering. “What
are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Crouch!” Harry shouted. “From the Ministry! He’s ill or
something — he’s in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just give me
the password up to —”</p>
<p>“The headmaster is busy, Potter,” said Snape, his thin mouth curling
into an unpleasant smile.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to tell Dumbledore!” Harry yelled.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?”</p>
<p>Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry
the thing he wanted when he was so panicky.</p>
<p>“Look,” said Harry angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s — he’s out of
his mind — he says he wants to warn —”</p>
<p>The stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there,
wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression. “Is there a
problem?” he said, looking between Harry and Snape.</p>
<p>“Professor!” Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak,
“Mr. Crouch is here — he’s down in the forest, he wants to speak to
you!”</p>
<p>Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief,
Dumbledore did nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor
behind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking
twice as ugly.</p>
<p>“What did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?” said Dumbledore as they walked
swiftly down the marble staircase.</p>
<p>“Said he wants to warn you . . . said he’s done something terrible .
. . he mentioned his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins . . . and — and
Voldemort . . . something about Voldemort getting stronger. . . .”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried
out into the pitch-darkness.</p>
<p>“He’s not acting normally,” Harry said, hurrying along beside
Dumbledore. “He doesn’t seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like
he thinks Percy Weasley’s there, and then he changes, and says he needs
to see you. . . . I left him with Viktor Krum.”</p>
<p>“You did?” said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer
strides still, so that Harry was running to keep up. “Do you know if
anybody else saw Mr. Crouch?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “Krum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had just
finished telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we
saw Mr. Crouch coming out of the forest —”</p>
<p>“Where are they?” said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged
from the darkness.</p>
<p>“Over here,” said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the
way through the trees. He couldn’t hear Crouch’s voice anymore, but he
knew where he was going; it hadn’t been much past the Beauxbatons
carriage . . . somewhere around here. . . .</p>
<p>“Viktor?” Harry shouted.</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>“They were here,” Harry said to Dumbledore. “They were definitely
somewhere around here. . . .”</p>
<p>“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.</p>
<p>Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk,
illuminating the ground. And then it fell upon a pair of feet.</p>
<p>Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest
floor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of
Mr. Crouch. Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his
eyelids.</p>
<p>“Stunned,” he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the
wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.</p>
<p>“Should I go and get someone?” said Harry. “Madam Pomfrey?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dumbledore swiftly. “Stay here.”</p>
<p>He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of
Hagrid’s cabin. Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak
away through the trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over
Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, “Rennervate.”</p>
<p>Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he
tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him
lie still.</p>
<p>“He attacked me!” Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. “The
old madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone
and he attacked from behind!”</p>
<p>“Lie still for a moment,” Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came
panting into sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his
crossbow.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening. “Harry — what the
— ?”</p>
<p>“Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said Dumbledore.
“His student has been attacked. When you’ve done that, kindly alert
Professor Moody —”</p>
<p>“No need, Dumbledore,” said a wheezy growl. “I’m here.”</p>
<p>Moody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand
lit.</p>
<p>“Damn leg,” he said furiously. “Would’ve been here quicker . . .
what’s happened? Snape said something about Crouch —”</p>
<p>“Crouch?” said Hagrid blankly.</p>
<p>“Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!” said Dumbledore sharply.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah . . . right y’are, Professor . . .” said Hagrid, and he
turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,” Dumbledore told Moody, “but it
is essential that we find him.”</p>
<p>“I’m onto it,” growled Moody, and he raised his wand and limped off
into the forest.</p>
<p>Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the
unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying
along behind them. He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked
pale and agitated.</p>
<p>“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and
Dumbledore and Harry beside him. “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I vos attacked!” said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head.
“Mr. Crouch or votever his name —”</p>
<p>“Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge?”</p>
<p>“Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up,
clutching his furs around him, looking livid.</p>
<p>“Treachery!” he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. “It is a plot! You
and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses,
Dumbledore! This is not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter
into the tournament, though he is underage! Now one of your Ministry
friends attempts to put my champion out of action! I smell
double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore,
you, with your talk of closer international Wizarding links, of
rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here’s what I think
of you!”</p>
<p>Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet. In one swift
movement, Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff’s furs, lifted him into
the air, and slammed him against a nearby tree.</p>
<p>“Apologize!” Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid’s
massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.</p>
<p>“Hagrid, no!” Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.</p>
<p>Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff
slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a
few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head.</p>
<p>“Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore
sharply.</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster. . . .”</p>
<p>“You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,” Dumbledore repeated
firmly. “Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry — I want you
to stay there. Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want
to send — they can wait until morning, do you understand me?”</p>
<p>“Er — yes,” said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known
that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon
straight to Sirius, to tell him what had happened?</p>
<p>“I’ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,” Hagrid said, staring
menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree,
tangled in furs and tree roots. “Stay, Fang. C’mon, Harry.”</p>
<p>They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward
the castle.</p>
<p>“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. “How dare
he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore’d do anythin’ like that. Like
Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs’ place. Worried! I
dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he’s bin lately. An’
you!” Hagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken
aback. “What were yeh doin’, wanderin’ off with ruddy Krum? He’s from
Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn’ he? Hasn’
Moody taught yeh nothin’? ’Magine lettin’ him lure yeh off on yer own
—”</p>
<p>“Krum’s all right!” said Harry as they climbed the steps into the
entrance hall. “He wasn’t trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk
about Hermione —”</p>
<p>“I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said Hagrid grimly,
stomping up the stairs. “The less you lot ’ave ter do with these
foreigners, the happier yeh’ll be. Yeh can’ trust any of ’em.”</p>
<p>“You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,” Harry said,
annoyed.</p>
<p>“Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her!” said Hagrid, and he looked quite
frightening for a moment. “I’ve got her number now! Tryin’ ter get back
in me good books, tryin’ ter get me ter tell her what’s comin’ in the
third task. Ha! You can’ trust any of ’em!”</p>
<p>Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye
to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole
into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and
Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened.</p>
