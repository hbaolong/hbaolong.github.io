<h4 id="chapter-four">CHAPTER FOUR</h4>
<p>BACK TO THE BURROW</p>
<p>By twelve o’clock the next day, Harry’s school trunk was packed with
his school things and all his most prized possessions — the Invisibility
Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten
from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and
George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the
loose floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of
his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart
on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he
liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense.
The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was
making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked
downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be
arriving at five o’clock the very next day.</p>
<p>“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” he snarled at
once. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d better have the
decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or
Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call “normal.”
Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of
shabbiness. Harry wasn’t bothered about what the neighbors would think,
but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys
if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might
have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because
Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the
other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was
at last taking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his
last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with a curly pig’s tail poking
out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had
had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn’t
altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand
nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so
as not to present the same target to the enemy.</p>
<p>Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn’t even protest at the
food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn’t eating
anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she
seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious
diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.</p>
<p>“They’ll be driving, of course?” Uncle Vernon barked across the
table.</p>
<p>“Er,” said Harry.</p>
<p>He hadn’t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him
up? They didn’t have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once
owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts.
But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly
he would do the same today?</p>
<p>“I think so,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would
have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by
how big and expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle
Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.</p>
<p>Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn’t stand
watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few
seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros.
Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the
living room.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon
was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and
Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound
of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky
hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn’t take
the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the
hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement
and nerves.</p>
<p>But five o’clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring
slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the
street, then withdrew his head quickly.</p>
<p>“They’re late!” he snarled at Harry.</p>
<p>“I know,” said Harry. “Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or
something.”</p>
<p>Ten past five . . . then a quarter past five . . . Harry was starting
to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.</p>
<p>“No consideration at all.”</p>
<p>“We might’ve had an engagement.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they think they’ll get invited to dinner if they’re late.”</p>
<p>“Well, they most certainly won’t be,” said Uncle Vernon, and Harry
heard him stand up and start pacing the living room. “They’ll take the
boy and go, there’ll be no hanging around. That’s if they’re coming at
all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their kind don’t set much
store by punctuality. Either that or they drive some tin-pot car that’s
broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!”</p>
<p>Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door came the
sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the
room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking
terrified.</p>
<p>“What happened?” said Harry. “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>But Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his
buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried
into the living room.</p>
<p>Loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys’
boarded-up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of
it.</p>
<p>“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and
was staring, terrified, toward the fire. “What is it, Vernon?”</p>
<p>But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be
heard from inside the blocked fireplace.</p>
<p>“Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been some kind of mistake
— tell George not to — OUCH! George, no, there’s no room, go back
quickly and tell Ron —”</p>
<p>“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able to let us out
—”</p>
<p>There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric
fire.</p>
<p>“Harry? Harry, can you hear us?”</p>
<p>The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.</p>
<p>“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon. “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,” said Harry,
fighting a mad desire to laugh. “They can travel by fire — only you’ve
blocked the fireplace — hang on —”</p>
<p>He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.</p>
<p>“Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece said,
“Shh!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry . . . the fireplace has been blocked up. You
won’t be able to get through there.”</p>
<p>“Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice. “What on earth did they want to
block up the fireplace for?”</p>
<p>“They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.</p>
<p>“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly. “Eclectic, you say?
With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. . . . Let’s think . . . ouch,
Ron!”</p>
<p>Ron’s voice now joined the others’.</p>
<p>“What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically. “No, this is
exactly where we wanted to end up.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here,” said George, whose
voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.</p>
<p>“Boys, boys . . .” said Mr. Weasley vaguely. “I’m trying to think
what to do. . . . Yes . . . only way . . . Stand back, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved
forward.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment!” he bellowed at the fire. “What exactly are you going
to —”</p>
<p>BANG.</p>
<p>The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace
burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud
of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward
over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor,
and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair,
including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle.</p>
<p>“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long
green robes and straightening his glasses. “Ah — you must be Harry’s
aunt and uncle!”</p>
<p>Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand
outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt
Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in
white dust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look
as though he had just aged thirty years.</p>
<p>“Er — yes — sorry about that,” said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand
and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. “It’s all my
fault. It just didn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get out at
the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you
see — just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle
fireplaces aren’t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but I’ve
got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for
me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don’t worry. I’ll light a
fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before
I Disapparate.”</p>
<p>Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn’t understood a single
word of this. They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt
Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your trunk
ready?”</p>
<p>“It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.</p>
<p>“We’ll get it,” said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George
left the room. They knew where Harry’s bedroom was, having once rescued
him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George
were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from
Harry.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried
to find words to break the very nasty silence. “Very — erm — very nice
place you’ve got here.”</p>
<p>As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits
of brick, this remark didn’t go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle
Vernon’s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her
tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to actually say
anything.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with
Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television
and the video recorder.</p>
<p>“They run off eckeltricity, do they?” he said knowledgeably. “Ah yes,
I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,” he added to Uncle Vernon. “And
batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I’m
mad, but there you are.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever
so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he
thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.</p>
<p>Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of
his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out
of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with
terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and
father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon’s bulk, while sufficient to hide
bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr. Weasley, taking
another brave stab at making conversation.</p>
<p>“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.”</p>
<p>He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each
other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.
Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall
off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley’s
peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next
spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as
mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt
sympathy rather than fear.</p>
<p>“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.</p>
<p>Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his
massive backside.</p>
<p>Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry’s school
trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their
faces cracked into identical evil grins.</p>
<p>“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley. “Better get cracking then.”</p>
<p>He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry
saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.</p>
<p>“Incendio!” said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the
wall behind him.</p>
<p>Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though
they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag
from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw
it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than
ever.</p>
<p>“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“Coming,” said Fred. “Oh no — hang on —”</p>
<p>A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred’s pocket and the contents
were now rolling in every direction — big, fat toffees in brightly
colored wrappers.</p>
<p>Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave
the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the
fire, saying “the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp.
There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.</p>
<p>“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley, “you and the trunk.”</p>
<p>Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn
it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second
whoosh, George had cried “the Burrow!” and vanished too.</p>
<p>“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at
Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted “the Burrow!” and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.</p>
<p>“Well . . .’bye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.</p>
<p>They didn’t say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but
just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand
and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.</p>
<p>“Harry said good-bye to you,” he said. “Didn’t you hear him?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. “Honestly, I
don’t care.”</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“You aren’t going to see your nephew till next summer,” he said to
Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. “Surely you’re going to say
good-bye?”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught
consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room
wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley’s wand
was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon’s tiny eyes darted to it once,
before he said, very resentfully, “Good-bye, then.”</p>
<p>“See you,” said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green
flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however,
a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to
scream.</p>
<p>Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his
parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and
sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from
his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the
foot-long thing was Dudley’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee
wrapper lay on the floor before him.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the
end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth;
unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to
fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around,
and Mr. Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.</p>
<p>“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled, advancing on Dudley
with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever
and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately. “It’s a simple process —
it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s only
an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct
it —”</p>
<p>But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more
panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley’s
tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be
suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue;
and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure
from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who
ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.</p>
<p>“Now really!” said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. “I’m
trying to help!”</p>
<p>Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another
ornament.</p>
<p>“Harry, go! Just go!” Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon.
“I’ll sort this out!”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s second ornament
narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave
the situation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his
shoulder as he said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting glimpse of the
living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle
Vernon’s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of
Dudley, and Dudley’s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python.
But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys’
living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green
flames.</p>
