<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Men must endure</p>
<p>Their going hence, even as their coming hither:</p>
<p>Ripeness is all.</p>
<p>King Lear V ii</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF DEATH</p>
<p>One of Leo Tolstoy’s distant ancestors is likely to have been a large
man; the family surname is an adjective implying bulk. Generations
later, Leo came into the sturdily named dynasty having inherited every
last tendency to massiveness. He turned out to have a big, strong body -
he could lift 180lb (82 kilos) with one hand - a large ego, and a
colossal appetite for life and learning, along with a formidable
intellect. He lived a long life, fathering thirteen children and dying
in his eighty-third year, famous for having written, by common
acknowledgement, the biggest and best novel in the world. By then he was
also recognized across the globe as a titan of moral and spiritual
leadership. His Collected Works run to ninety large volumes; there isn’t
a delicate lyric among them. For Leo Tolstoy the only scale was
gargantuan. It comes as no surprise, therefore, to learn that when, at
the age of forty-one, he was afflicted with what we might now call a
mid-life crisis, it was an acute one.</p>
<p>The trouble started in the late 1860s as he finished War and Peace
(1869). Now, in his full maturity, at the zenith of his physical and
intellectual powers, bursting with vitality and nurtured by success,
Tolstoy should have been a happy man. But on the contrary, the sheer
goodness of living seems to have made him all the more obsessed with the
inevitability of death. What he had could be taken away, would be taken
away, and soon. His wife describes how he felt at this time: ’Often he
said his brain hurt, some painful process was going on inside it,
everything was over for him, it was time for him to die.’1 Some of the
pain came from what he was reading; during the summer of 1869 he was
immersed in the work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer,
whose poisonous pessimism was enough to make a happy man sad, and a sad
man suicidal.</p>
<p>In August Tolstoy set off for the distant province of Penza in the
hope of buying some land, and broke his journey in the small town of
Arzamas. During a sleepless night he was suddenly seized with dread. He
described the feeling to his wife as follows:</p>
<p>It was two o’clock in the morning. I was exhausted. I wanted to go to
sleep, and I felt perfectly well. But suddenly I was overwhelmed by
despair, fear and terror, the like of which I have never experienced
before … such an agonizing feeling … God preserve anyone else from
experiencing it.2</p>
<p>Eleven years later he recalled the occasion in an unfinished work of
fiction, Notes of a Madman:</p>
<p>I had hoped to get rid of the thing that was tormenting me in the
room. But it came out behind me and everything turned black. I became
more and more frightened. ‘This is ridiculous,’ I told myself. ‘What am
I afraid of?’</p>
<p>‘Me,’ answered Death. ’I am here.’3</p>
<p>Tolstoy’s spiritual agony at this time cannot be overstated. He never
fully recovered from this shocking encounter with death. His dark
thoughts on suffering, death and the meaningless of life itself stayed
with him and were reflected in much of his subsequent work, particularly
the last sections of Anna Karenina (1878) and the whole of A Confession
(1884). The multiple irony in the distressing circumstances of 1869 is
striking. First: within a few months of completing the world’s most
life-affirming novel he becomes obsessed with dying and death. Second:
Schopenhauer’s philosophy is so black that it sees life as nothing but
suffering, a constant striving without any satisfaction; death, then,
should be warmly anticipated as a welcome release. Yet the knowledge of
death, far from providing a soothing promise of relief, ruins what small
happiness can be found in living. Third: although Tolstoy couldn’t have
known it, at the time when he was being addressed so ominously by the
voice of death, his life was actually at its meridian. He had lived for
forty-one years, and had another forty-one still ahead of him. At that
time, incidentally, the expectation of life in Russia stood at forty-one
years.</p>
<p>DEATH IN THE MIDST OF LIFE</p>
<p>The Book of Common Prayer reminds us solemnly that ‘in the midst of
life we are in death’, and until recent times that used to be true in a
literal sense: all families experienced death repeatedly at first hand.
Tolstoy’s was one such. Death visited his home at regular intervals; for
instance, five of his children did not survive childhood, and in one
short period, 1873 — 5, five family members died. He saw men shot or
blown up on the battlefield, watched a man die under the guillotine
blade in France, and sat with his brother until he died from
consumption. All of this must have been very painful, but it is probably
more significant that Tolstoy’s own childhood was badly affected by the
death of his mother when he was two, his father when he was nine, a
devoted grandmother when he was ten, and his doting Auntie Tatyana when
he was thirteen. True, he was loved and protected throughout by family
members, but perhaps the early loss, one after the other, of four
parental figures instilled into him a particular sense of the fragility
of human life and a sharper than normal fear of death. Mortality would
become one of this writer’s most persistent themes, as he worked against
the idea attributed to Samuel Johnson that our fear of death is so great
that the whole of life is but keeping away the thought of it. All of the
stories in this volume are connected by this preoccupation, along with
the author’s simultaneous attempts to help us improve our lives.
However, far from being overt morality pieces, they are all gripping
narratives, and should be enjoyed as such before being examined for
lessons in living and dying.</p>
<p>But this volume is only a representative selection of Tolstoy’s
writing on the subject. The idea of death haunts his work from Childhood
in 1852 to Hadji Murat in 1904 and Alyosha the Pot in 1905. The
Sevastopol Stories (1855 — 6), transmitted straight from the Crimean
warfront, necessarily pile up the corpses of soldiers, many of which
Tolstoy saw with his own eyes on the battlefield. The vitality of The
Cossacks (1863) is undermined by the suffering of the story’s mortally
wounded hero, Lukashka. In War and Peace the deaths of old Count
Bezukhov, Lise, Hélène, Andrey, Count Rostov, Petya Rostov and Platon
Karatayev bring particular poignancy to the subject that has been
generalized in thousands on the field of war. And in Anna Karenina the
famous suicide of the heroine is hardly more moving than the death of
Nikolay, brother of the novel’s other protagonist Konstantin Levin,
which is itself a transcription from the real-life demise of Tolstoy’s
own brother. This occurs in Part Five, Chapter 21, the only one out of
the 734 chapters that make up the three longest novels of this author to
be given a title, Death. The Kreutzer Sonata (1889) examines sexual
passion that has culminated in a gruesome murder. ‘Master and Man’
(1893) ends in the self-sacrificing death of a man who has hitherto been
the epitome of calculating egoism. In Resurrection (1899) the story
hinges around another murder, the poisoning of a prostitute’s client. In
a play of 1886, The Power of Darkness, there is another poisoning,
though this is transcended in awfulness by a rare example of nothing
less than infanticide on stage. It is all there - death in every
conceivable guise: murder, accident, suicide and natural causes,
finishing off the young, the old and everyone in between. Even from this
kind of brief overview it is clear that Tolstoy’s obsession with death
and dying is something out of the ordinary; few serious writers come
near him in persisting with this difficult subject and presenting it
from so many different angles.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF IVAN ILYICH</p>
<p>It is ironical that The Death of Ivan Ilyich, one of the world’s most
penetrating fictional examinations of the sick room and the deathbed,
was handed to the author’s wife as a pleasant surprise on her birthday.
Far from being disturbed by the shocking content of the story, Sonya was
delighted. First, she welcomed this new work, handed to her when she
returned from a stay in Moscow, in 1882, because of its symbolic value.
According to her perceptions, her husband had been indulging himself
ever since Anna Karenina three years earlier by fiddling around with
second-rate works of philosophy, morality and religion that no one
wanted to read. The appearance of a new work of fiction, even if it had
death in its title, seemed more like a resurrection to her. Second, she
was a sensitive critic of her husband’s work, and she knew a masterpiece
when she saw it. Her husband may have been in his sixth decade, but he
was obviously not written out or even declining in literary ability.
Third, this piece would nicely enhance the Collected Works that she was
working on. Finally, practical woman as she was, Sonya could hardly have
been indifferent to the prospect of new royalties coming in.</p>
<p>There is something unusual about this story from the outset. The
title of the tale announces its ending. To emphasize this, we are barely
a hundred words into the narrative when we are told, ‘Gentlemen, Ivan
Ilyich is dead.’ So much for suspense. At no stage in the succeeding
pages are we going to entertain doubts about the protagonist’s fate,
which has been settled and sealed. Clearly, no time will be lost
worrying about whether a sick man is going to die or survive; the
interest must be elsewhere - in the process of dying, and the life that
is being left behind. And that is how things turn out; what is at stake
is the life of Ivan Ilyich. And by shifting the emphasis of his story
like this Tolstoy lays down a benefit for himself as narrator; he can
now allow himself to get right into the nasty details of dying, death
and decomposition without facing a charge of prurience. An author who
has renounced suspense cannot be said to be gratuitously milking
gruesome material for every last drop of horror.</p>
<p>The idea for this story came from real life. In Tula, the nearest
town to Tolstoy’s estate, a judge by the name of Ivan Ilyich Mechnikov
had died from stomach cancer the previous year (July 1881), young and in
mid-career. Tolstoy had been used to meeting some of the wretches
sentenced by him to long years in Siberia, sometimes for fairly trivial
reasons, and he had wondered about the kind of man who could sit in
judgement over them, dispatch them and then return to his family and
continue his happy lifestyle. Mechnikov’s brother told Tolstoy about the
judge’s death in some detail, and the general shape of the narrative
seemed obvious. A man of privileged background and good education,
accustomed to sentencing others, would find himself under sentence of
death; the reader would follow his struggle and be persuaded to look
with contempt at the empty life of the declining man. An early idea to
put this in diary form under the title Death of a Judge was abandoned as
too shallow a vessel for all the ideas that the author wanted to
include. In other respects there was no reason to depart from what had
happened in real life. For instance, even the man’s first names could be
kept, since they had a kind of Jack Robin-son ring to them, suggesting
ordinariness and general applicability. The surname of Tolstoy’s Ivan
Ilyich is Golovin, from the Russian word golova, meaning head, a rather
obvious indication of the man’s cerebral rather than spiritual attitude
to life and death.</p>
<p>Ordinariness is the currency Tolstoy chooses to deal in. We are
invited to see this man as unfortunately typical of most people -
small-minded, self-centred, materialistic. He has gone through law
school, drifted into marriage, acquired two children almost incidentally
and developed his career successfully, using every decent contact and
opportunity to better himself. Like many of the upwardly mobile, he
continually overreaches himself, but each promotion brings more money
and he reaches a stage where he can manage fairly well. As his family
life declines into indifference, because he and his wife are unsuited to
each other and their small stock of affection is soon used up, Ivan
Ilyich turns for satisfaction to his professional duties and to a small
circle of male friends who like to play cards for small stakes. And now,
on the brink of middle age, he is struck down by an illness that starts
out as something trivial, though we know from the title and the opening
that it is going to prove fatal.</p>
<p>Before looking at the illness itself it is worth considering the
lifestyle of Ivan Ilyich, which Tolstoy depicts, subtly but insistently,
as arid, unimaginative and useless, a matter for retrospective regret
and for contempt if viewed from outside by a thinking person. Many
people would object to this charge if it were put to them more directly.
The judge is a successful man rather than a nonentity, and he is
scrupulous in his dealings. He likes the feeling of power that he wields
over the miserable people who come before him, but he never exploits or
misuses it. He has made no serious mistakes and has no hidden crimes on
his conscience. He is good to his children and faithful to his wife.
Even his one besetting peccadillo, a penchant for cards, is kept under
control; only small amounts of money are at stake, and there is no
danger of addiction because the pleasure comes more from playing
skilfully and exploiting any good luck than from significant winnings.
This ‘weakness’ in the character of Ivan Ilyich is no worse than, say,
watching too much television in the present era, except that it has the
advantage of getting him out of the house and enjoying the company of
other people. All in all, there is nothing much for this man to be
ashamed of. No wonder he has few regrets when illness begins to make him
review his life. He knows that it has not worked out too well, but when
he starts to consider the reasons for this he cannot blame himself for
having got things seriously wrong. ‘How can that be when I did
everything properly?’ It is true that at the very end Ivan Ilyich
appears to grasp Tolstoy’s truth that a life lived wrongly is an
obstacle to an easy death. He does conclude that his only real happiness
was in childhood and just afterwards, and that there was something
disgustingly unsatisfactory about the second half of his life. Finally
he sees the light, and is permitted to die. But the purity of this
vision of an unhappy adulthood is subject to some doubt. Is this not a
fairly common experience, even without the promptings of severe illness?
Did not the author himself see his life as pointless at precisely the
same age (Ivan is also forty-one)? And, in any case, is he not suffering
from blurred perceptions because of the pain he has suffered and the
opium he is now being treated with?</p>
<p>This is to say that there is something amiss with Tolstoy’s moral
purpose here. But there is one thing we can be reasonably sure of: if a
miracle had occurred and he had survived, Ivan Ilyich would probably not
have gone on to live his life differently, soulfully, newly inspired by
his close encounter with death. He would have been more likely to return
to his fractious family life and his cards. The life of this man has
been trivial rather than despicable, and it is unfair of the author to
adopt such a disparaging attitude towards his protagonist. To accept
Tolstoy’s implied disparagement would be to condemn and dismiss the
lives of millions of people carrying on as best they can in a difficult
world without doing much harm to others. The idea implicit in this story
that we should emerge from reading it determined to reshape our
misguided lives is rather unrealistic.</p>
