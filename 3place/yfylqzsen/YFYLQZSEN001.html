ILYICH AND OTHER STORIES</h4>
<p>COUNT LEO TOLSTOY was born in 1828 at Yasnaya Polyana in central
Russia, and educated privately. He studied Oriental languages and law
(unsuccessfully) at the University of Kazan, then led a life of
dissipation until 1851, when he went to the Caucasus and joined an
artillery regiment. He took part in the Crimean War, and on the basis of
this experience wrote The Sevastopol Stories (1855 — 6), which confirmed
his tenuous reputation as a writer. After a period in St Petersburg and
abroad, where he studied educational methods for use in his school for
peasant children at Yasnaya Polyana, he married Sofya (Sonya) Behrs in
1862. The next fifteen years was a period of great happiness. The couple
had thirteen children; Tolstoy managed his estates, one in the Volga
steppeland, continued his educational projects, cared for his peasants
and wrote War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1878). A Confession
(1884) marked a spiritual crisis in his life; he became an extreme
moralist and in a series of pamphlets after 1880 expressed his rejection
of state and church, indictment of the weaknesses of the flesh and
denunciation of private property. His last novel, Resurrection (1900),
was written to earn money for the pacifist Dukhobor sect. His teaching
earned him many followers at home and abroad, but also much opposition,
and in 1901 he was excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church. He
died in 1910, in the course of a dramatic flight from home, at the small
railway station of Astapovo.</p>
<p>ANTHONY BRIGGS, Senior Research Fellow at Bristol University and
Professor Emeritus at Birmingham, has written, translated or edited many
books and articles on Russian and English literature. A leading
authority on Aleksandr Pushkin, he has also edited five volumes of
English poetry. His recent translation of War and Peace for Penguin has
been widely acclaimed.</p>
<p>DAVID MCDUFF was born in 1945 and was educated at the University of
Edinburgh. His publications comprise a large number of translations of
foreign verse and prose, including twentieth-century Russian and
Scandinavian works. He has translated a number of nineteenth-century
Russian prose works for the Penguin Classics series. These include
Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, The
Idiot, The House of the Dead and Poor Folk, Leo Tolstoy’s The Cossacks,
and Nikolay Leskov’s ‘Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk’. He has also translated
Isaak Babel’s Red Cavalry and Andrey Bely’s Petersburg for Penguin.</p>
<p>RONALD WILKS studied Russian language and literature at Trinity
College, Cambridge, after training as a Naval interpreter, and later
Russian literature at London University, where he received his Ph.D. in
1972. Among his translations for Penguin Classics are My Childhood,My
Apprenticeship and My Universities by Gorky, Diary of a Madman by Gogol,
filmed for Irish Television, The Golovlyov Family by Saltykov-Shchedrin,
How Much Land Does a Man Need? by Tolstoy, Tales of Belkin and Other
Prose Writings by Pushkin, and six other volumes of stories by Chekhov:
The Party and Other Stories, The Kiss and Other Stories, The Fiancée and
Other Stories, The Duel and Other Stories, The Steppe and Other Stories
and Ward No. 6 and Other Stories. He has also translated The Little
Demon by Sologub for Penguin.</p>
