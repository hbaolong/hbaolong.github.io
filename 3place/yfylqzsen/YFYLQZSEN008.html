<h4 id="the-forged-coupon">THE FORGED COUPON</h4>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Fyodor Mikhailovich Smokovnikov, the head of a government tax
department, a man of incorruptible integrity and proud of it, a gloomy
liberal who was not only a free-thinker but also a hater of every
manifestation of religious tendencies, which he considered a throwback
to the superstitions of earlier times, had come home from his office in
a very sour frame of mind. He had just received a most stupid memo from
the governor, and from it the inference could be drawn that Fyodor
Mikhailovich had acted in a dishonest fashion. Bitterly angry, Fyodor
Mikhailovich had immediately written the governor a stinging and caustic
reply.</p>
<p>When he got home it seemed to him as if everything were going against
him.</p>
<p>It was five to five. He had expected dinner to be served as soon as
he made his appearance, but it wasn’t ready yet. Fyodor Mikhailovich
banged the door and stalked off to his study. There was a knock. ‘Who
the devil is it now?’ he wondered, and he shouted: ‘Who is it now?’</p>
<p>Into his study came a fifth-form grammar school boy, his
fifteen-year-old son.</p>
<p>‘What do you want?’</p>
<p>‘It’s the first of the month today.’</p>
<p>‘Money, is it?’</p>
<p>They had an arrangement whereby on the first day of each month the
father gave his son an allowance of three roubles to cover the cost of
entertainments. Fyodor Mikhailovich made a sour face, took out his
wallet, searched inside it and extricated from it a
two-and-a-half-rouble bond coupon;1 then he fished out his small change
and counted out another fifty kopecks. His son said nothing and did not
take the money.</p>
<p>‘Papa, please let me have some more in advance.’</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t like to ask you, but I borrowed some money and promised on
my word of honour to pay it back. As a man of integrity, I can’t … I
have to have another three roubles, really I do, I wouldn’t ask you, or
at least, well … Please, Papa.’</p>
<p>‘You were told …’</p>
<p>‘I know, Papa. Look, it’s just this once …’</p>
<p>‘You get an allowance of three roubles, and still it’s not enough.
When I was your age I didn’t even get fifty kopecks.’</p>
<p>‘All my friends get more than I do now. Petrov and Ivanitsky get
fifty roubles a month.’</p>
<p>‘And I’m telling you that if you go on like this you’ll end up as a
swindler. That’s it, now, I’ve told you.’</p>
<p>‘So what if you have? You’ll never be able to put yourself in my
shoes; now I’ve got no alternative but to be a swindler. It’s all right
for you.’</p>
<p>‘Get out of here this instant, you idle good-for-nothing! Get
out!’</p>
<p>Fyodor Mikhailovich leapt to his feet and rushed towards his son.</p>
<p>‘Out! You ought to be given a good whipping!’</p>
<p>His son was overtaken by fear and a sense of bitter resentment; his
resentment, however, was greater than his fear. Bowing his head, he
walked quickly to the door. Fyodor Mikhailovich had no intention of
laying a finger on him, but he was enjoying his fit of anger, and he
continued to hurl abuse at his son for some considerable time, until the
latter had disappeared.</p>
<p>When the maid came in to say that dinner was served Fyodor
Mikhailovich rose to his feet.</p>
<p>‘At last,’ he said. ‘I don’t even feel hungry now.’ And with a black
scowl on his face he went to have dinner.</p>
<p>At the dinner table his wife started to talk to him, but so angrily
did he bark out his replies that she fell silent. His son, too, said
nothing, keeping his eyes steadily fixed on his plate. In silence they
continued to eat, and silently they rose from the table and went about
their separate tasks.</p>
<p>After dinner the grammar school boy went back to his room, where he
took the coupon and change out of his pocket and threw them on to his
writing desk; then he removed his school tunic and put on a jacket.
After he had spent some time poring over a tattered Latin grammar, he
got up, closed the door and fastened its hook, then swept the money off
the desk top and into a drawer. From the same drawer he took some
Russian cigarette papers with their cardboard holders, stuffed a
quantity of tobacco into one of them using a piece of cotton wool and
started to smoke.</p>
<p>He continued to pore over his grammar and his exercise books for a
couple of hours without taking anything in. Then he stood up and began
to pace to and fro in his room, stamping his heels as he recalled the
scene he had had with his father. All his father’s abusive talk and, in
particular, the malevolent expression there had been on his face, came
back to him as clearly as if it had all just been a moment ago. ‘You
idle good-for-nothing! You ought to be given a good whipping!’ And the
more of the scene he remembered, the more his anger at his father grew.
He remembered his father saying to him: ‘It’s easy to see what you’ll
end up as — a swindler. Just you wait.’ ‘He said I’d end up as a
swindler if I went on like this. It’s all right for him. He’s forgotten
what it’s like to be young. Anyway, what crime have I committed? All I
did was go to the theatre and because I didn’t have any money I borrowed
some off Petya Grushetsky. What’s wrong with that? Anyone else would
have shown some sympathy and given the matter some consideration, but
all he could do was bellow at me and think of himself. When he hasn’t
got something he wants he shouts the whole house down, but I’m a
swindler. No, even though he is my father, I don’t like him. Maybe all
fathers are like he is, but I still don’t like him.’</p>
<p>The maid knocked at his door. She had brought a note for him. ‘You’re
to reply to it at once,’ she said.</p>
<p>The note read: ‘This makes three times now that I’ve asked you to
return the six roubles you borrowed from me, but you always try to get
out of it. Men who are honest don’t behave like that. Please send the
money at once via bearer. I’m really broke myself. Surely you can get it
for me? Your — depending on whether or not you give me my money back -
respectful or contemptuous friend, Grushetsky.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t believe it. The greedy pig, he can’t wait. I’ll have another
go.’</p>
<p>Mitya went to see his mother. This was his last hope. She had a kind
heart and was never able to refuse him anything, and she would probably
have helped him on this occasion, too, except that she was in an anxious
state about the illness of two-year-old Petya, her youngest boy. She was
angry at Mitya for coming in and making a noise, and she turned down his
request point-blank.</p>
<p>He muttered something to himself under his breath, and went out of
the room. His mother immediately felt sorry for him and called him
back.</p>
<p>‘Wait, Mitya,’ she said. ‘I haven’t got it right now, but I’ll get it
for you tomorrow.’</p>
<p>But Mitya was still burning with resentment against his father.</p>
<p>‘What’s the good of waiting till tomorrow, when I need it today? I
may as well tell you that I’m going to ask one of my friends to lend me
it.’</p>
<p>He went out, finally this time, banging the door behind him. ‘There’s
nothing else for it. At least he’ll be able to tell me where I can pawn
my watch,’ he thought, fingering the watch in his pocket.</p>
<p>Mitya took the coupon and the change out of the desk drawer, put on
his coat and set off to visit his friend Makhin.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Makhin was a fifth-former with a moustache. He played cards, knew
women and always had money. He lived with his aunt. Mitya knew that
Makhin was a ne’er-do-well, but when he was with him he unconsciously
let him take the upper hand. Makhin was at home, getting ready to go to
the theatre: his grimy little room smelt of scented soap and
eau-de-Cologne.</p>
<p>‘That’s too bad,’ said Makhin, after Mitya had related his woes to
him, shown him the coupon and the fifty kopecks, and told him he needed
nine roubles more. ‘You can pawn your watch, of course, but you can do
better than that,’ said Makhin, giving him a wink.</p>
<p>‘How do you mean, better?’</p>
<p>‘It’s very simple.’ Makhin took the coupon. ‘If you insert a 1 before
the 2 r. 50 it’ll read 12 r. 50.’</p>
<p>‘But do coupons for that amount exist?’</p>
<p>‘Of course they do, on thousand-rouble bonds. I put one of them into
circulation myself once.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t believe it!’</p>
<p>‘All right then, shall we do it?’ said Makhin, taking a pen and
smoothing out the coupon with the index finger of his left hand.</p>
<p>‘But it’s not right.’</p>
<p>‘Rubbish.’</p>
<p>‘He was right,’ thought Mitya, remembering the things his father had
shouted at him. ‘A swindler. I’ll be a swindler now.’ He looked Makhin
in the face. Makhin was watching him with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>‘Well then, shall we?’</p>
<p>‘All right.’</p>
<p>Makhin painstakingly wrote in a figure 1.</p>
<p>‘Right, now we’ll go to a shop. There’s one on the corner here that
sells photographic supplies. It just so happens that I need a frame for
this lady.’</p>
<p>He produced a photograph of a round-eyed girl with vast tresses of
hair and magnificent breasts.</p>
<p>‘How do you fancy her, eh? Eh?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes. But how … ?’</p>
<p>‘It’s very simple. Come on.’</p>
<p>Makhin put on his coat, and they left the house together.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The bell in the entrance to the photographic supply shop gave a
tinkle. The two grammar school boys went inside and looked around the
deserted shop with its shelves of photographic equipment and its
counters on which stood showcases. From a doorway at the back of the
shop a plain woman with a kindly face emerged. Taking up her position
behind the counter, she asked them what they wanted.</p>
<p>‘A nice frame, miss.’</p>
<p>‘How much do you want to spend?’ asked the lady, running the
swollen-jointed fingers of her mittened hands swiftly and deftly over
various types of frames. ‘Those are fifty kopecks each, but these are a
little more expensive. This one here is very nice, it’s a new line,
priced at a rouble twenty.’</p>
<p>‘All right, I’ll take that one. But wouldn’t you let me have it for a
rouble?’</p>
<p>‘All our prices are fixed,’ said the lady, with dignity.</p>
<p>‘Oh, all right then,’ said Makhin, putting the coupon down on one of
the glass showcases. ‘But please hurry up and let me have my change. I
don’t want to be late for the theatre.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, you’re in plenty of time,’ said the lady, and she began to
examine the coupon with eyes that were obviously short-sighted.</p>
<p>‘She’ll look stunning in that frame, won’t she?’ said Makhin, turning
to Mitya.</p>
<p>‘Haven’t you any other money with you?’ asked the shop lady.</p>
<p>‘That’s just it, I’m afraid I haven’t. My father gave me this and
told me to get it changed.’</p>
<p>‘Are you sure you haven’t got a rouble twenty on you?’</p>
<p>‘I’ve got fifty kopecks. Anyway, what’s the matter, are you afraid
we’re trying to pass a forgery off on you?’</p>
<p>‘No, nothing like that.’</p>
<p>‘Then give me the coupon back, please. We’ll have it changed
somewhere else.’</p>
<p>‘How much change do I have to give you?’</p>
<p>‘Well, let’s see, it works out at eleven something.’</p>
<p>The shop lady flicked the beads on her abacus, unlocked the till,
took out a ten-rouble note and, running her hands through the change,
raked together six twenty-kopeck pieces and two five-kopeck bits.</p>
<p>I’d like it wrapped up, please,’ said Makhin, taking the money in a
leisurely fashion.</p>
<p>‘It won’t take a moment.’</p>
<p>The shop lady wrapped the frame and tied the parcel up with
string.</p>
<p>Mitya only dared to breathe again after the entrance bell had tinkled
and they were out on the street once more.</p>
<p>‘All right, here’s ten roubles for you; let me keep the rest. I’ll
give you it back.’</p>
<p>And Makhin went off to the theatre, while Mitya visited Grushetsky
and settled his debt.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>An hour after the two grammar school boys had left the shop, the
proprietor returned and started to count his day’s takings.</p>
<p>‘Oh, you idiot of a woman! You idiot!’ he shouted at his wife when he
saw the coupon and immediately spotted the forgery. ‘And what are you
doing accepting coupons, anyway?’</p>
<p>‘But I’ve seen you accept them, Zhenya, twelve-rouble coupons exactly
like this one,’ said his wife, who was by now confused, upset and on the
point of tears. ‘I don’t know how they managed to fool me,’ she said.
‘Grammar school boys, they were, too. One of them was such a handsome
young man, he seemed so comme il faut.’</p>
<p>‘I’ll comme ilfaut you, you idiot!’ shouted her husband, keeping up a
steady stream of abuse at her as he continued to count the takings.
‘When I accept a coupon I make sure I know what’s printed on it, but
you, all you can see is those boys from the grammar school with their
ugly mugs.’</p>
<p>This was too much for his wife, and she too flew into a rage.
‘There’s a man for you! All you can do is put the blame on other people;
I suppose losing fifty-four roubles at cards is neither here nor
there?’</p>
<p>‘That’s something else entirely.’</p>
<p>‘I’m not going to waste any more breath on you,’ said his wife, and
she went off to her room. There she started to remember how reluctant
her family had been to consent to her marriage, as they had considered
that her husband belonged to a lower social class than theirs, and how
she had had to insist; she remembered the child she had had who had
died, and her husband’s indifference to this loss, and she felt such
hatred for him that she wished it had been him that had died. This
thought frightened her, however, and she quickly put on her coat and
went out. When her husband got back to their apartment, she was gone.
Without waiting for him, she had taken her coat and set off alone for
the house of a teacher of French who had invited them to a soiree that
evening.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>At the home of the teacher of French — a Russian Pole - there was a
gala tea with sweet pastries. After it was over, everyone sat down at
several tables to play bridge.</p>
<p>The photographic supplier’s wife shared a table with the host, an
officer, and a deaf old lady in a wig who was the widow of a music shop
owner and had a passion for cards, which she was very good at. This
particular game seemed to be going in favour of the photographic
supplier’s wife; twice now she had made a grand slam. Beside her was a
plate that contained a bunch of grapes and a pear, and she was in the
best of spirits.</p>
<p>‘What’s keeping Yevgeny Mikhailovich?’ asked the hostess from another
table. ‘He’s supposed to be our fifth hand.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, he’s probably still doing his accounts,’ said Yevgeny
Mikhailovich’s wife. ‘Today’s the day he always pays the grocery and
firewood bills.’</p>
<p>And, remembering the scene she had had with her husband, she frowned,
and her mittened hands trembled with resentment towards him.</p>
<p>‘Talk of the devil,’ said the host, turning to greet Yevgeny
Mikhailovich, who had just walked in. ‘What held you up?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, various bits of business,’ replied Yevgeny Mikhailovich
cheerfully, rubbing his hands. Then, much to his wife’s astonishment, he
went over to her and said: ‘You remember that coupon? Well, I’ve managed
to pass it on.’</p>
<p>‘You have?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I gave it to a muzhik2 for some firewood.’</p>
<p>And with great indignation Yevgeny Mikhailovich proceeded to tell
everyone the story of how some dishonest grammar school boys had tricked
his wife, while his wife supplied the details.</p>
<p>‘Right, now let’s get on with it,’ he said at last, sitting down at
the table when his turn came and shuffling the cards.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Yevgeny Mikhailovich had indeed managed to pass the coupon on: he had
persuaded a peasant named Ivan Mironov to accept it in exchange for some
firewood.</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov made his living by buying up single loads of firewood in
the wood yards and then carting them for sale around the town; he split
the loads into five, and sold each part for what a quarter-load cost at
the wood yards. Early on the morning of this day that was to prove so
unlucky for him, Ivan Mironov had carted out an eighth-load and, having
quickly sold it, had brought out another eighth in the hope of selling
it, too. This time, however, he could not find a customer, and spent all
day until evening carting the load around in search of someone who might
possibly buy it. He kept running across canny townsfolk who were wise to
all the sharp practices of muzhik firewood salesmen, and were not so
credulous as to believe that he had brought the wood in from the
country, as he said he had. He was thoroughly famished, and felt chilled
to the bone in his worn sheepskin jacket and his ragged undercoat; by
evening the temperature had dropped to minus twenty; his horse, which he
had been driving without mercy, since he was about to sell it to the
knacker, refused to go any further. Ivan Mironov was even thinking of
selling the firewood at a loss when he encountered Yevgeny Mikhailovich,
who had gone out to buy some tobacco and was now on his way home.</p>
<p>‘Would you like to buy some firewood, sir? I’ll sell it to you cheap.
My horse won’t go any further.’</p>
<p>‘Tell me where you’re from first.’</p>
<p>‘From the country, sir. The wood’s all my own. It’s good, dry
stuff.’</p>
<p>‘I know your sort. Well, what do you want for it?’</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov named an exorbitant price, then started to reduce it,
and finally parted with the firewood at his normal price.</p>
<p>‘Just for you, sir, seeing it’s not far to deliver,’ he said.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Mikhailovich did not make too much fuss about the price. He
was pleased at the thought that now he would be able to pass on the
coupon. Pulling the cart along by his own efforts, Ivan Mironov somehow
managed to manoeuvre the firewood into the yard; he unloaded it and
stacked it in the shed himself. The yard-keeper was not on duty. At
first Ivan Mironov was unwilling to accept the coupon, but Yevgeny
Mikhailovich was so persuasive and seemed to be such an important
gentleman that in the end he agreed to take it.</p>
<p>As he entered the servants’ room through the tradesmen’s entrance,
Ivan Mironov crossed himself, wrung the icicles from his beard and,
turning back the lapel of his sheepskin jacket, produced a leather purse
from which he counted out eight roubles and fifty kopecks change. He
handed the money over, took the coupon, rolled it up in a piece of paper
and put it in his purse.</p>
<p>Having proffered his thanks, in a manner befitting the conclusion of
a transaction with a gentleman, Ivan Mironov proceeded to set the legs
of his doomed, frost-encrusted horse in motion, not with the lash of his
whip now, but with its handle, forcing it to drag the empty cart as far
as the local inn.</p>
<p>At the inn Ivan Mironov ordered eight kopecks’ worth of tea and
vodka. Once he had thawed out and even begun to perspire a bit, his mood
became thoroughly amiable, and he got into conversation with the
yard-keeper, who was sitting at his table. He really warmed to the
conversation and told the yard-keeper that he came from the village of
Vasilevskoye, some twelve versts3 outside town, that he had been given
his share of the family fortune and now lived independently of his
father and brothers with his wife and two sons, the elder of whom was
undergoing professional training and so was not yet able to help him
out. He told the yard-keeper that while he was in town he was staying in
lodgings, and that tomorrow he was going to the knacker to sell his old
jade, and might possibly buy a new horse. He said he had now managed to
save up the sum of twenty-five roubles and that half of the money was in
the form of a coupon. He took out the coupon and showed it to the
yard-keeper. The yard-keeper could neither read nor write, but he said
he had changed money like that for the tenants, that it was all right,
but that there were forgeries around and, for that reason, he advised
him to play safe and have it changed at the bar. Ivan Mironov gave the
coupon to the waiter and asked him to bring him the same amount in ready
cash. The waiter went off but did not return. Instead, the inn’s
bald-headed, shiny-faced manager appeared, clutching the coupon in his
pudgy hand.</p>
<p>‘Your money is no good,’ he said, indicating the coupon but not
returning it.</p>
<p>‘It’s perfectly good. I was given it by a gentleman.’</p>
<p>‘No, my fine fellow. This coupon’s been tampered with.’</p>
<p>‘Give it back to me, then.’</p>
<p>‘No, my fine fellow. You’ll have to be taught a lesson. You forged
this coupon yourself, you and your swindler friends.’</p>
<p>‘Give me my money back; you’ve got no right to do this.’</p>
<p>‘Sidor! Call the police!’ said the barman to the waiter.</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov was slightly the worse for the drink he had had. And
being slightly the worse for drink, he was also getting rather agitated.
He seized the manager by the collar and shouted: ‘Give me it back, I’ll
go and see the gentleman. I know where he lives.’</p>
<p>The manager tore himself free of Ivan Mironov’s grip, but as he did
so his shirt began to split.</p>
<p>‘Oh, so that’s how you want to play it! Take him!’</p>
<p>The waiter seized hold of Ivan Mironov and, at that very instant, the
local policeman appeared. As master of the situation, he listened to
both sides of the story and then brought the whole episode to a speedy
conclusion.</p>
<p>‘You’ve got to come down to the station!’</p>
<p>The policeman put the coupon into his own wallet, and then escorted
Ivan Mironov and his horse to the police station.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov spent the night in the cells at the police station,
together with the drunks and the pickpockets. Not until around noon the
following day was he summoned to appear before the station chief. The
station chief asked him a lot of questions and then told the policeman
to take him along for an interview with the proprietor of the
photographic supply shop. Ivan Mironov could remember the name of the
street and the number of the house.</p>
<p>When the policeman knocked on Yevgeny Mikhailovich’s front door and
confronted him with the coupon and with Ivan Mironov, who confirmed that
this was the gentleman who had given him the coupon, Yevgeny
Mikhailovich’s expression of astonishment was quickly replaced by one of
grim severity.</p>
<p>‘What? Have you taken leave of your senses? I’ve never seen this man
before in my life.’</p>
<p>‘Master, be sure your sins will find you out. One day we all must
die,’ said Ivan Mironov.</p>
<p>‘What’s the matter with him? You must be dreaming. It was someone
else you sold your firewood to,’ said Yevgeny Mikhailovich. ‘In any
case, wait a moment, I’ll go and ask my wife if she bought any firewood
yesterday.’</p>
<p>Yevgeny Mikhailovich went off and immediately summoned the
yard-keeper. The yard-keeper was a very strong, handsome, agile fellow
who seemed to be perpetually in a good mood, gave himself airs and went
by the name of Vasily. Yevgeny Mikhailovich instructed him that if
anyone should ask him where the last load of firewood had come from he
was to say they had got it from the wood yards, and that they never
bought firewood from the muzhiks.</p>
<p>‘There’s a muzhik here claiming I gave him a forged coupon. He’s a
stupid nitwit, talking a lot of nonsense, but you’re an intelligent
chap. You tell him we only ever buy our firewood at the wood yards. Oh,
by the way, I’d been meaning to give you this towards a new jacket,’
Yevgeny Mikhailovich added, giving the yard-keeper a five-rouble
note.</p>
<p>Vasily took the money and his eyes flashed from the note to Yevgeny
Mikhailovich’s face; he tossed back his hair and gave a little
smile.</p>
<p>‘It’s common knowledge they’re a stupid lot. Uneducated. Don’t you
worry, sir, I know what to say to the likes of him.’</p>
<p>No matter how tearfully Ivan Mironov beseeched Yevgeny Mikhailovich
to admit that the coupon was his, and the yard-keeper to confirm that
this was so, both men stuck to their story: they never bought firewood
off carts. And the policeman took Ivan Mironov back to the police
station, where he was charged with forging a coupon.</p>
<p>It was only by following the advice of his cell-mate, a drunken
office clerk, and slipping the station chief a five-rouble note, that
Ivan Mironov was able to procure his release from detention. Now he was
minus the coupon and had only seven roubles left out of the twenty-five
he had had the day before. Ivan Mironov spent three of these seven
roubles on drink. Dead drunk, looking utterly crushed, he crept back to
his wife.</p>
<p>His wife was in the last stages of a pregnancy and she was feeling
ill. She started to shout at her husband, he pushed her away, and she
began to pummel him with her fists. Making no attempt at retaliation, he
lay face down on the plank bed of the lodging house and wept loudly.</p>
<p>Not until the following morning did his wife discover what had
happened; believing her husband’s story, she spent a long time cursing
the fraudulent gentleman who had tricked her Ivan. And Ivan, who was now
sober, remembered what the factory hand with whom he had been drinking
the night before had advised him, and decided to find a lawyer and lodge
a complaint.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>The lawyer agreed to take on the case, not so much for any money he
could hope to receive as because he believed Ivan’s story and was angry
that anyone should so shamelessly defraud a poor muzhik.</p>
<p>Both parties attended the hearing, at which the yard-keeper Vasily
was the sole witness. The hearing was a repetition of all that had gone
before. Ivan Mironov made allusions to God, and to the fact that one day
we all must die. Yevgeny Mikhailovich, though troubled by an awareness
of what he was doing as both shabby and dangerous, was unable now to go
back on the testimony he had already given, and he continued to disclaim
all responsibility with an appearance of outward calm.</p>
<p>Vasily the yard-keeper pocketed another ten roubles and calmly
asserted that he had never set eyes on Ivan Mironov in his life before.
And when he was summoned to be sworn in, even though he quailed
inwardly, he none the less repeated the words of the oath after the old
priest who had been specially brought in for the occasion, and swore on
the crucifix and the Holy Gospel that he would tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.</p>
<p>The court proceedings ended with the judge rejecting the action
brought by Ivan Mironov and making him forfeit court costs to the tune
of five roubles, which Yevgeny Mikhailovich magnanimously paid for him.
Discharging Ivan Mironov, the judge cautioned him to be more careful in
future about bringing accusations against decent, law-abiding citizens,
and told him he should be grateful to the defendant for paying his court
costs for him, instead of prosecuting him for slander, an offence for
which he could have been sent to prison for at least three months.</p>
<p>‘I thank your honour kindly, sir,’ said Ivan Mironov, and he left the
chamber, shaking his head and sighing.</p>
<p>The whole episode seemed to have ended well for Yevgeny Mikhailovich
and Vasily the yard-keeper. But that was only the way it looked on the
surface. No one perceived what had really happened - something far more
grave than what could be discerned by human eyes.</p>
<p>It was getting on for three years now since Vasily had left his
village and gone to live in the town. With every year that passed he
gave less and less of what he earned to his father, and he had not sent
for his wife, since he did not need her. Here in the town he could have
as many women as he wanted, and they were no useless old hags like her.
With every year that passed Vasily forgot more and more of the country
laws and customs, and adapted himself more and more to the ways of the
town. Back there, life had been crude, cheerless, impoverished and
messy; here it was tasteful, comfortable, clean and luxurious —
everything had been taken care of. Increasingly he had grown convinced
that those countryfolk lived blindly, like beasts in the forest, while
all the real people were here. He read books by good authors, novels and
went to stage performances at the People’s House.4 One could never see
anything like that in the country, not even in one’s dreams. In the
village he had come from the old men had used to say: ‘Live with your
wife according to the law, work hard, don’t eat too much, don’t give
yourself airs.’ But here people were clever, educated — that meant they
knew what the real laws were - and they enjoyed life. Everything was
just perfect. Until the hearing concerning the coupon, Vasily had
refused to believe that the upper classes had no laws to govern the
conduct of their lives. He had thought they did have laws, but that he,
Vasily, did not know what they were. But after the hearing, and in
particular his perjury, which in spite of all his fears had had no
negative consequences for him and had indeed resulted in his being ten
roubles better off, he became fully persuaded that there were no laws
and that all one was supposed to do was to enjoy life. This he did and
this he continued to do. At first he merely fiddled a bit of money on
the purchases he made for the tenants, but this was not enough for all
his expenses, and he started, whenever he got the chance, to pilfer
money and valuables from the tenants’ apartments; once he even tried to
steal Yevgeny Mikhailovich’s wallet. Yevgeny Mikhailovich caught him in
the act, but did not bring proceedings against him in court: instead, he
saw to it that Vasily got the sack.</p>
<p>Vasily did not find the idea of going back to his village
particularly appealing, and he stayed on in Moscow with his mistress,
looking for work. He found a low-paid job as yard-keeper to the
proprietor of a small shop. Vasily started in the job, but in the very
second month of his employment he was caught stealing sacks. His
employer did not make an official complaint against him, but gave him a
beating and drove him off the premises. After that it was impossible for
Vasily to find work, his money was all spent, soon he had pawned most of
his clothes and in the end all he had left was a tattered coat, a pair
of trousers and some ragged footwear. His mistress left him. But Vasily
did not lose his cheerful, high-spirited disposition, and when spring
came round he set off home for his village on foot.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich Sventitsky, a thick-set little man who wore smoked
glasses (he had trouble with his eyes and was threatened by total
blindness), got up before dawn, as was his custom, and, after he had had
a glass of tea, put on his knee-length fleece coat, trimmed with
lambskin, and set off to make the rounds of his estate.</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich had been a customs officer and had managed to save
some eighteen thousand roubles of what he had earned. Almost twelve
years previously he had gone into retirement, not quite voluntarily, and
had bought the poky little estate of a young landowner who had
squandered his fortune. Pyotr Nikolayevich had married while he had
still been on government service. His wife was the poor orphan of an old
aristocratic family, a plump, attractive woman who had borne him no
children. Pyotr Nikolayevich was, in all his dealings, a man of
persistence and thoroughness. The son of a Polish gentleman, he had
known nothing about agriculture, yet so skilful at it had he proved to
be that the ramshackle, three-hundred-desyatina 5 estate had, within the
space of ten years, become a very model of perfection. All the
structures he put up, from the house itself to the granary and the
shelter over the firehose, were solid and reliable, covered by sheet
iron and given a coat of fresh paint whenever they needed it. In the
implement shed there was an orderly collection of carts, harrows and
wooden and iron ploughs. The horses’ harness was kept properly greased.
The horses themselves were medium-sized animals, nearly all from the
same stud — well-fed, sturdy greys, matched in pairs. The threshing
machine was operated in its own covered barn, the feed was kept in a
special shed, and the liquid manure flowed into a pit with a paved base.
The cows were likewise all of the same stock, medium-sized, but giving a
high milk yield. The pigs were the ‘English’ variety. There was a
poultry yard with several breeds of hen notable for their laying
properties. The fruit trees in the orchard were sprayed and coated, and
new ones had been planted. Wherever one looked there were signs of
thrift, reliability, cleanliness and good order. Pyotr Nikolayevich drew
a great deal of satisfaction from his estate, and was proud of the fact
that he had achieved all this not by making his peasants’ lives a misery
but, on the contrary, by exercising the most scrupulous fairness in
their regard. Even when mixing with the local nobility he tended to hold
to a middle-of-the-road point of view, one that was closer to a liberal
rather than a conservative position, and he always defended the common
people to the advocates of serf ownership. ‘Be good to them and they’ll
be good to you’ was his motto. It was true that he would not tolerate
slips and blunders on the part of those who worked for him, and
sometimes he would urge them along himself; he demanded that they work
hard for him, but on the other hand the accommodation and the food he
offered them were of the very highest quality, their wages were always
paid on time, and on holidays he treated them to vodka.</p>
<p>Stepping carefully over the melting snow - this was in February —
Pyotr Nikolayevich made his way past the farm hands’ stable to the
izba6where the farm hands lived. It was still dark; the fog made it even
darker than it might have been, but light was visible in the windows of
the izba. The farm hands were getting out of bed. His intention was to
hurry them up: this morning six of them were supposed to be taking the
cart over to the thicket to gather in the rest of the firewood.</p>
<p>‘What’s this?’ he thought, suddenly noticing that the door of the
stable was open.</p>
<p>‘I say, who’s in there?’</p>
<p>There was no answer. Pyotr Nikolayevich went into the stable.</p>
<p>‘Who’s in here, I say?’</p>
<p>Still there was no answer. It was dark, the ground under his feet
felt soft, and there was a smell of manure. A pair of young greys
occupied a stall to the right of the door. Pyotr Nikolayevich stretched
out his hand - but there was nothing there. He moved his foot forward.
Perhaps they had lain down. His foot met empty air. ‘Where have they
taken them?’ he wondered. They couldn’t have been taken for harness, the
sleigh was still out there. Pyotr Nikolayevich went back outside and
shouted, loudly: ‘Hey, Stepan!’</p>
<p>Stepan was the head farm hand. He was just coming out of the
izba.</p>
<p>‘I hear you!’ Stepan shouted back in a jovial voice. ‘Is that you,
Pyotr Nikolayevich, master? The lads are just coming.’</p>
<p>‘Why is the stable door open?’</p>
<p>‘The stable door? I don’t know, sir. Hey, Proshka, give us a
lantern.’</p>
<p>Proshka came running with a lantern. They went into the stable.
Stepan knew at once what had happened.</p>
<p>‘It’s thieves, Pyotr Nikolayevich. The lock’s been smashed.’</p>
<p>‘Never!’</p>
<p>‘They’ve taken them, the villains! Mashka’s not here. Neither’s
Yastreb. No, here’s Yastreb. It’s Pyostry that’s missing. And
Krasavchik.’</p>
<p>Three of the horses were missing. Pyotr Nikolayevich said nothing. He
was frowning and breathing heavily.</p>
<p>‘Just wait till I get my hands on them. Who was supposed to be
keeping watch?’</p>
<p>‘It was Petka, sir. Petka fell asleep.’</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich reported the theft to the police. He told the
chief constable about it, informed the leader of the zemstvo7 and sent
his men to comb the entire neighbourhood. The horses were not found.</p>
<p>‘Filthy peasants!’ said Pyotr Nikolayevich. ‘Look what they’ve done
to me. As if I hadn’t been good to them. Just you wait. Thugs and
villains, the lot of you. From now on I’m going to deal with you rather
differently.’</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>But meanwhile the horses - three greys - had been taken away to the
outlying districts. The raiders sold Mashka to the gypsies for eighteen
roubles, bartered Pyostry for the horse of a muzhik in a village forty
miles away, and rode Krasavchik until he dropped from exhaustion and
then slaughtered him, selling his hide for three roubles. The man who
organized the raid was Ivan Mironov. He had worked for Pyotr
Nikolayevich in the past, and knew his way around the estate, and he had
decided to recoup his losses by doing a little horse-stealing.</p>
<p>After his misfortune with the forged coupon, Ivan Mironov had spent a
long time drowning his sorrows, and indeed he would have drunk away
everything he possessed, had his wife not hidden his horse-collars, his
clothes and everything else he could have sold to buy vodka. During his
drunken binge Ivan Mironov never for a moment ceased to think not only
about the gentleman who had wronged him, but also about all the
gentlemen and not-so-gentle men who lived by milking his fellow
peasants. On one occasion Ivan Mironov happened to be drinking with some
muzhiks from the area around Podolsk. As they journeyed along, the
muzhiks told him the story of how they had made off with the horses that
had belonged to one of their number. Ivan Mironov began to chide these
horse thieves for wronging a muzhik in this manner. ‘It’s a sin,’ he
said. ‘A horse is like a brother to a muzhik, yet you took all his
horses from him. If you’re going to steal horses, then steal them from
the higher-ups. Those sons of bitches deserve it.’</p>
<p>As the conversation developed, the muzhiks from Podolsk said that you
had to be pretty crafty to be able to steal horses from the gentry. You
had to know your way around, and you needed the help of someone on the
inside. Then Ivan Mironov remembered about Sventitsky, on whose estate
he had once lived and worked as a farm hand; he remembered that
Sventitsky had once deducted one and a half roubles from his wages as
compensation for a broken coupling bolt, and he remembered the greys he
had used in his farm work.</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov went to call on Sventitsky, making it appear as though
he wanted Sventitsky to hire him, but really in order to spy out the
terrain and to familiarize himself with Sventitsky’s arrangements. Once
he had seen that there was no nightwatchman, and that in the stable the
horses were kept in separate stalls, he summoned the thieves and the
deed was done.</p>
<p>After he had split the proceeds with the muzhiks from Podolsk, Ivan
Mironov went home to his village with five roubles in his pocket. At
home there was no work he could do: he had no horse. And from that time
onwards, Ivan Mironov began to associate with horse thieves and
gypsies.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich Sventitsky spared no effort in attempting to track
down the thieves. He knew that the raid would not have been possible
without the connivance of one of his own employees. So he regarded them
all with suspicion, and tried to find out if any of them had been away
from the farm on the night in question. He discovered that there was one
such peasant. This was Proshka Nikolayev, a young lad who had just come
back from his military service. He was a handsome, agile fellow, and
Pyotr Nikolayevich employed him in place of a coachman, to look after
the horses and carriages and drive them on occasion. The chief constable
was a friend of Pyotr Nikolayevich’s, as were the district police
inspector, the leader of the local zemstvo and the investigating
magistrate. Each year all four were invited to Pyotr Nikolayevich’s
name-day festivities, and they were well acquainted with his delicious
liqueurs and pickled mushrooms - white, honey-agaric and milk-agaric.
Now they were sympathetic to him and tried to help him.</p>
<p>‘You see, that’s what you get for taking the side of the muzhiks,’
said the chief constable. ‘I wasn’t making it up when I told you they
were worse than wild animals. You won’t get anywhere with them if you
don’t use the whip and the rod. So you think it was Proshka, do you, the
chap who works as coachman for you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, it’s him.’</p>
<p>‘Let’s have him in here, then.’</p>
<p>Proshka was summoned, and they began to question him.</p>
<p>‘Where were you that night?’</p>
<p>Proshka shook his hair back, and his eyes flashed. ‘At home,
sir.’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean, at home? All the farm hands say you weren’t.’</p>
<p>‘As you please, sir.’</p>
<p>‘What I please has nothing to do with it. Where were you?’</p>
<p>‘At home, sir.’</p>
<p>‘All right, then. Constable, take this man into custody.’</p>
<p>‘As you please, sir.’</p>
<p>The reason why Proshka would not say where he had been on the night
of the theft was that he had spent it at the house of his girlfriend
Parasha, and had promised not to get her into trouble. There was no
evidence, and Proshka was released from custody. But Pyotr Nikolayevich
was convinced he had been responsible for the raid, and he conceived a
hatred for him. Once, when he had taken his carriage out with Proshka as
driver, he sent him off to buy some fodder. Proshka did what he usually
did and bought two measures of oats at a wayside inn, giving one and a
half measures to the horses and exchanging the remaining half for vodka.
Pyotr Nikolayevich found out about it, and made a complaint to the local
JP. The JP sentenced Proshka to three months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p>Proshka was a man of self-esteem. He considered himself a cut above
the rest, and had a degree of personal pride. His spell in prison was a
humiliating experience for him. No longer could he strut with pride
before his fellows, and his spirits sank at once.</p>
<p>Proshka went home from prison embittered not so much against Pyotr
Nikolayevich as against the whole world.</p>
<p>Everyone said the same thing: after he came out of prison, Proshka
went to pieces. He grew too lazy to work, took to drink, and was soon
caught stealing clothes from the tradesman’s wife. Once again he ended
up in prison.</p>
<p>As for the horses, all Pyotr Nikolayevich could find out about them
was that someone had discovered the hide of a grey-coated gelding which
he was subsequently able to identify as once having belonged to
Krasavchik. To an ever-increasing degree, he was infuriated by the
thieves’ impunity. Now he could not set eyes on a muzhik without a sense
of anger. The very mention of them was enough to make his blood boil,
and he tried whenever he could to make their lives a misery for
them.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that, once he had passed it on, Yevgeny
Mikhailovich had stopped thinking about the coupon, his wife, Marya
Vasilevna, could neither forgive herself for having been taken in, nor
her husband for all the unkind things he had said to her, nor - and this
was what rankled most — the two young louts for having so skilfully
deceived her.</p>
<p>From the day she had been tricked onwards, she kept a watchful eye on
every grammar school boy who came along. On one occasion she encountered
Makhin, but failed to recognize him because when he saw her he distorted
his features in a way that completely altered his appearance. When,
however, some two weeks after the event, she ran smack into Mitya
Smokovnikov on the street, she recognized him immediately. She allowed
him to go by and then, turning round, she set off in pursuit. When she
reached the entrance of the apartment where he lived, she took a note of
his parents’ name. Next day she went to the grammar school. In the
vestibule she encountered Mikhail Vvedensky, the school’s religious
instructor. He asked her if he could help. She said she wanted to see
the headmaster.</p>
<p>‘I’m afraid the headmaster isn’t here today; he’s unwell. Perhaps I
can deal with your inquiry, or at least take a message for him?’</p>
<p>Marya Vasilevna decided to tell the religious instructor
everything.</p>
<p>Father Vvedensky was a widower, a traditionalist and a man of
considerable personal vanity. The year before, he had met Smokovnikov’s
father at a soiree and had had a difference with him during a
conversation on the subject of religion, in the course of which
Smokovnikov had outmanoeuvred him on all counts and had made a laughing
stock of him. Father Vvedensky had resolved to single out the son of
this man for special attention. When he discovered that the son showed
the same indifference to religion as that displayed by his infidel
father, he began to persecute him and even failed him in an exam.</p>
<p>Father Vvedensky could not help feeling a certain satisfaction when
he heard from Marya Vasilevna what the young Smokovnikov had done, as he
saw in the incident a confirmation of his hypotheses concerning the
immorality of those who did not follow the guidance of the Church. He
decided that he would make use of the incident in order, as he tried to
persuade himself, to highlight the risk run by all who stray from the
Church and its teachings. His real reason for doing so was, however, to
take revenge on a man whom he considered to be a proud and
self-opinionated atheist.</p>
<p>‘Yes, very sad, very sad,’ said Father Mikhail Vvedensky, smoothing
with one hand the smooth edges of the confessional crucifix he wore at
his chest. ‘I’m so glad you’ve told me about this. As a servant of the
Church I shall of course endeavour not to leave the young man without
guidance; but I’ll also try to make his edification as painless as
possible.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I shall act in accordance with my vocation,’ said Father
Mikhail to himself, in the belief that he had completely forgotten the
hostility of Smokovnikov senior and desired nothing but the welfare and
salvation of the son.</p>
<p>During the Scripture lesson the following day Father Mikhail told his
pupils the whole episode of the forged coupon, and said this had been
done by one of the boys at the grammar school.</p>
<p>‘It was a vile, wicked thing to do,’ he said. ‘But not to own up is
even worse. I don’t believe it was one of you; but if it was, that boy
had better own up now and not try to hide behind others.’</p>
<p>As he said this, Father Mikhail gave Mitya Smokovnikov a fixed look.
The other pupils, following his gaze, turned round to look at Mitya,
too. Mitya turned red and began to sweat; at last he burst into tears
and ran from the classroom.</p>
<p>When Mitya’s mother learned of this, she made her son tell her the
whole story, and then hurried off to the photographic supply shop. She
paid the supplier’s wife back the twelve roubles fifty, and made her
promise to keep quiet about the grammar school boy’s identity. She
instructed her son to deny everything, and on no account to make a
confession to his father.</p>
<p>And indeed, when Fyodor Mikhailovich found out what had happened at
the grammar school, and his son, on being interviewed, denied all
knowledge of the matter, he went to see the headmaster and laid the
facts of the case before him, saying that the religious instructor had
behaved in a most reprehensible manner and that he, Fyodor Mikhailovich,
was not going to let the affair rest there. The headmaster sent for the
religious instructor and a heated exchange of opinions ensued.</p>
<p>‘First a stupid woman makes insulting and damaging accusations
against my son, and then withdraws them, yet all you can do is blacken
the name of an honest, truthful boy.’</p>
<p>‘I have blackened no one’s name, and I will not permit you to talk to
me like that. You forget my vocation.’</p>
<p>‘I spit on your vocation.’</p>
<p>‘Your mistaken ideas,’ said the religious instructor, his chin
quivering so that his beard trembled, ‘are familiar to the whole
town.’</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen, gentlemen,’ remonstrated the headmaster, trying to pacify
the two adversaries. This, however, proved to be impossible.</p>
<p>‘My holy calling imposes upon me the duty of concerning myself with
the moral and religious upbringing of the young.’</p>
<p>‘That’s enough of your hypocrisy. Do you think I don’t know you’ve
got no more religion than a common heathen?’</p>
<p>‘I consider it beneath my dignity to continue holding a conversation
with an individual such as yourself,’ said Father Mikhail, who had taken
particular offence at Smokovnikov’s last remark, as he knew it was
perfectly correct. He had gone through the complete course at the
theological academy, and so had long ago ceased to believe what he
practised and preached. All he believed now was that it was everyone’s
duty to compel themselves to believe the things he had compelled himself
to believe.</p>
<p>Smokovnikov was less incensed by the religious instructor’s behaviour
than he was by this illustration of the way the influence of the clergy
was beginning to manifest itself in Russian society, and he told all his
friends and acquaintances about this incident.</p>
<p>Father Vvedensky, on the other hand, saw in it yet one more
manifestation of the nihilism and atheism which were becoming
established not only among the younger generation, but among older
people as well, and which he believed it necessary to combat. The more
he censured the unbelief of Smokovnikov and of those like him, the more
convinced he was of the unshakeable solidity of his own faith, and the
less he felt the need to put that faith to the test or to make himself
live in accordance with it. His faith, recognized as it was by the world
at large, was his principal weapon in his struggle against its
repudiators.</p>
<p>These thoughts, engendered in him by his confrontation with
Smokovnikov, and by the unpleasant events at the grammar school that had
followed in the wake of that confrontation - namely the reprimand and
black-marking he had received from the school authorities - finally
induced him to do something that had been enticing him for a long time,
ever since the death of his wife, in fact: to become a monk, and thus
embark upon a career already chosen by several of his fellow students at
the academy, one of whom was already an archbishop, and another of whom
was the father superior of a monastery, in line for appointment as a
diocesan.</p>
<p>At the end of the academic year, Vvedensky relinquished his post at
the grammar school, took monastic vows and the name ‘Misail’, and was
very soon given the rectorship of a theological seminary in a town on
the Volga.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Meanwhile Vasily the yard-keeper had set out on foot down the high
road to the south.</p>
<p>By day he tramped, and at night a local gendarme would show him to
the lodgings that were always reserved for travellers. Wherever he put
in he was given bread, and sometimes people would invite him to sit down
at table and have supper with them. In one village in the province of
Oryol where he spent the night he was told that a merchant who had
leased an orchard from the local landowner was looking for able-bodied
nightwatchmen. Vasily had by this time had enough of the beggar’s
existence he had been leading. He did not, however, want to return to
his village, so he went to see the merchant who had leased the orchard
and got himself taken on as a nightwatchman for a wage of five roubles a
month.</p>
<p>Vasily found life in his watchman’s hut very pleasant, particularly
when the sweet apples had been picked, and the other watchmen brought
enormous bundles of straw that had been gathered from under the
threshing-machine in the master’s shed. He could lie all day long on the
fresh, fragrant straw beside the even more fragrant heaps of spring and
winter wind-fall apples, and all he had to do was keep a lookout to see
that none of the young lads tried to steal the apples that were on the
trees, whistle, and sing songs, which he was very good at, since he had
a fine singing voice. The peasant women and girls would come up from the
village in quest of apples. Vasily would tease them a bit, giving apples
to the ones that caught his fancy, or exchanging lesser or greater
quantities of apples for eggs, say, or a few kopecks - and then he would
lie back again, only getting up in order to have his breakfast, dinner
and supper.</p>
<p>Vasily only possessed the one shirt: it was made of pink cotton and
was full of holes. On his feet he wore nothing at all, but his body was
strong and healthy and, when the pot of kasha8was removed from the fire,
Vasily would eat enough for three men, to the perpetual astonishment of
the old head watchman. Vasily never slept at night, and either whistled
or called out from time to time in order to keep himself awake; he could
see a long way in the dark, like a cat. One night some big lads from the
village started climbing the trees and shaking the apples to the ground.
Vasily crept up and pounced on them; they tried to escape, but he
knocked them all to the ground, and then took one of them back to his
hut and handed him over to the master.</p>
<p>Vasily’s first hut was at the far end of the orchard, but his second,
into which he moved when the sweet apples were picked, was situated only
forty yards or so from the master’s house. Vasily found life in this hut
even more pleasant. All day long he could see the gentlemen and young
ladies playing games, going out for drives or taking walks together; and
later on, when it got dark, he would observe them playing the violin or
the piano, singing or dancing. He would see the students and the young
ladies sitting in the windows fondling one another, and later, some of
them walking together in the dark avenues of the lime trees, where the
moonlight only filtered through in stripes and patches. He would see the
servants running to and fro with refreshments, and would note how the
cooks, the laundresses, the managers, gardeners and coachmen were all
working for the sole purpose of supplying their masters and mistresses
with food, drink and entertainment. Sometimes the young gentlefolk would
drop by to see him in his hut, and he would pick out the best, juiciest
and reddest apples and give them to them; the young ladies would munch
them on the spot, praising them and saying a few words in French -
Vasily would understand that they were about him — and they would insist
that he sing for them.</p>
<p>Vasily viewed this way of life with admiration and, as he thought
back to the life he himself had led in Moscow, more and more did he grow
convinced that what mattered most of all in life was to have money.</p>
<p>Vasily began to spend more and more time trying to think how he could
quickly get his hands on a large sum of money. He remembered how he had
fiddled bits of money for himself on the side, and he decided that that
was not the way to go about it; it was not enough simply to attempt to
grab whatever lay in temptation’s way - one had to plan things in
advance, observe the lie of the land, and do the deed neatly, leaving no
loose ends.</p>
<p>When it was nearly Christmas, the last of the winter apples were
picked. The fruit-grower had made a handsome profit, and he paid off and
thanked all the watchmen, including Vasily. Vasily put on the coat and
hat the fruit-grower had given him, but he did not go home — the mere
thought of that brutish, peasant existence was enough to make him feel
positively ill. Instead, he went back to the town in the company of the
drunken ex-conscripts who had worked as watchmen with him. Once there,
he decided he would break into and burgle the shop where he had once
worked as yard-keeper, and whose proprietor had given him a beating and
driven him off the premises without giving him his wages. He knew the
place inside out, including where the money was kept. He stationed one
of the ex-conscripts outside the shop as a guard, smashed a window at
the rear, climbed inside and took all the money. It was all so skilfully
managed that no one was ever able to find out who had done it. Vasily
got away with three hundred and seventy roubles. He gave a hundred to
the man who had helped him, and took the rest to another town, where he
spent it on a wild binge with his mates and girlfriends.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ivan Mironov had become a skilled, fearless and successful
horse thief. Afinya, his wife, who previously had been critical of him
for his ‘bungling’, as she called it, was pleased with her husband and
proud of him because he now owned a sheepskin coat with a hood, and she
had a shawl and a new fur coat.</p>
<p>Everyone in the village and the surrounding district knew that there
was not one local instance of horse-stealing in which he was not somehow
involved, but they were all afraid to give evidence against him, and so
whenever the finger of suspicion pointed at him he came out as clean as
a whistle. His most recent raid had been on the night-grazing over at
Kolotovka. So far as he was able, Ivan Mironov tried to choose the
people he stole from, and his favourite victims were landowners and
merchants. It was also, however, more difficult to steal from them. So
when their horses seemed out of reach, he stole the muzhiks’ horses
instead. Thus, from the night-grazing at Kolotovka he stole as many as
he could get his hands on. He didn’t do the thieving himself, but
employed a smart young lad by the name of Gerasim to do it for him. Not
until daybreak did the muzhiks realize that their horses were missing;
then they took to the roads in a mad rush to look for them. By that
time, however, the horses were standing in a deep ravine in the middle
of the State forest. Ivan Mironov intended to keep them hidden there
until the following night, and then take them to a yard-keeper he knew
in a village forty versts away. Ivan Mironov visited Gerasim in the
forest, brought him pie and vodka, and then went home again by a forest
path on which he hoped he would not meet anyone. He was unlucky enough
to encounter one of the forest watchmen, an ex-conscript.</p>
<p>‘Been looking for mushrooms, have you?’ asked the ex-conscript.</p>
<p>‘I can’t find any today,’ replied Ivan Mironov, pointing to the
basket he had taken along with him just in case he did happen to find
any mushrooms.</p>
<p>‘Aye, it’s not the mushroom season yet,’ said the ex-conscript. ‘They
only start coming up after Lent.’ And he walked past.</p>
<p>The ex-conscript was aware that something here was not as it should
be. Ivan Mironov had no business to be walking through a State forest
that early in the morning. The ex-conscript went back the way he had
come and began to probe around in the forest. Near the ravine he heard
the snorting of horses. Silently he crept up to the place it had come
from. The floor of the ravine had been trampled by hooves, and there
were horse droppings everywhere. A little further off sat Gerasim,
eating something, and two horses stood tethered to a tree trunk.</p>
<p>The ex-conscript ran off to the village and fetched the elder, the
constable and two men to act as witnesses. From three sides they
approached the place where Gerasim was sitting, and then seized him.
Gerasim made no attempt to protest his innocence; being drunk, he
immediately confessed to everything. He told them that Ivan Mironov had
plied him with drink and put him up to the whole thing, and that he had
said he would come to the forest to fetch the horses that day. The
muzhiks left Gerasim and the horses in the forest, and set an ambush for
Ivan Mironov. When night fell, a whistle was heard. Gerasim whistled
back. As soon as Ivan Mironov started to come down the slope, the
muzhiks rushed at him and took him to their village.</p>
<p>The next morning a crowd assembled in front of the elder’s izba. Ivan
Mironov was led out and questioned. Stepan Pelageyushkin, a tall,
stooping, long-armed muzhik with an aquiline nose and a dour expression
was the first to question him. Stepan had done his military service and
now lived independently with his wife and children. It was only very
recently that he had moved out of his father’s house; just when he had
been starting to find his own feet, his horse had been stolen. By
working for two years in the mines he had managed to buy two new horses.
Both had now been stolen.</p>
<p>‘Tell me where my horses are,’ said Stepan, pale with anger, staring
from the ground to Ivan’s face and back at the ground again.</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov said he knew nothing about it. Then Stepan struck him in
the face, breaking his nose, from which blood began to trickle.</p>
<p>‘Tell me or I’ll kill you.’</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov said nothing, and inclined his head. Stepan struck him
once with his long arm. Then he struck him again. Ivan still would not
say anything, but merely swung his head from side to side.</p>
<p>‘Everyone stone him!’ said the elder.</p>
<p>And they all began to stone him. Ivan fell silently to the ground,
and then shouted: ‘Barbarians, devils, stone me to death! I’m not afraid
of you!’</p>
<p>Then Stepan took a stone from the pile he had ready and smashed Ivan
Mironov’s skull with it.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Ivan Mironov’s murderers were brought to justice. Stepan
Pelageyushkin was among those put on trial. The charge brought against
him was more serious than those that were brought against the other men,
because they all testified that he had been the one who had smashed Ivan
Mironov’s skull with a stone. Stepan made no attempt to conceal anything
at his trial. His explanation was that when his pair of horses had been
stolen he had gone to the police station to report the matter - it would
probably have been possible to track the horses down with the help of
the gypsies — but the constable had refused to see him, and had made no
effort to look for the animals.</p>
<p>‘What were we supposed to do with a man like him? He’d ruined
us.’</p>
<p>‘Why were you the only one to stone him?’ asked the prosecutor.</p>
<p>‘I wasn’t. We all stoned him; the mir9had sentenced him to death. I
just finished him off. What was the point of making him suffer
unnecessarily?’</p>
<p>The judges were shocked by Stepan’s expression of utter calm as he
told of what he had done, of how they had stoned Ivan Mironov, and how
he had finished him off.</p>
<p>Stepan really did not consider that the murder he had committed was
such a terrible act. During his military service he had taken part in a
firing squad, and then as now he had seen nothing wrong in this type of
killing. If you killed a man, you killed him. Today it was his turn;
tomorrow it might be yours.</p>
<p>Stepan was let off lightly. He was given one year in prison. His
muzhik’s clothes were taken away from him and locked away in the prison
stores under a numbered tag, and he was given a convict’s overall and
boots to wear.</p>
<p>Stepan had never had a great deal of respect for authority, but now
he was fully convinced that all the powers that be and all the nobility
except the Tsar, who alone took pity on the common people and was just
in his dealings with them, were nothing but robbers and bandits, sucking
the life blood of the poor. The stories of the deportees and hard labour
convicts with whom he associated in the prison confirmed him in this
view. One man had been sentenced to hard labour for exposing the
pilfering of some local officials, another for striking an official
because he had unlawfully confiscated the property of peasants, yet a
third for forging banknotes. The gentry and the merchants could get away
with anything, it seemed, while the poor muzhiks were sent to feed the
lice in prison for the slightest misdemeanour.</p>
<p>During the time that Stepan spent in prison he received visits from
his wife. Things had been bad enough for her with him gone from home,
but now she had become completely destitute and had had to go begging
with her children. His wife’s misfortunes made Stepan even more
embittered. He was viciously aggressive towards everyone in the prison,
and on one occasion he nearly killed one of the prison cooks with an
axe, for which he was given another year. During the course of that
second year he learned that his wife had died, and that his household
had ceased to exist …</p>
<p>When Stepan’s term was up, he was summoned to the stores and his
muzhik’s clothes were taken down from the shelf and handed back to
him.</p>
<p>‘Where am I to go now?’ he asked the quartermaster-sergeant as he put
his own clothes on again.</p>
<p>‘Home, of course.’</p>
<p>‘I haven’t got a home any more. I suppose I’ll just have to take to
the road and rob folk.’</p>
<p>‘If you rob folk you’ll be back to see us again.’</p>
<p>‘Well, that’s as may be.’</p>
<p>And Stepan went away. In spite of what he had said, he set off in the
direction of his home. There was nowhere else for him to go.</p>
<p>On his way there he stopped to spend the night at a roadside inn and
drinking house he knew.</p>
<p>The innkeeper was a fat tradesman from Vladimir. He knew Stepan, knew
that he had gone to prison as a result of misfortune, and agreed to let
him stay the night.</p>
<p>This rich tradesman had run off with the wife of a muzhik in the
neighbourhood, and she now lived with the tradesman both as spouse and
employee.</p>
<p>Stepan knew all about the episode - how the tradesman had injured the
muzhik’s honour, how this vile woman had left her husband and then grown
fat from overeating. Just at that moment she was treating her sweaty
personage to tea; charitably, she asked Stepan if he would like some.
There were no other guests at the inn. Stepan was allowed to sleep the
night in the kitchen. Matryona cleared away the dishes and went off to
her room. Stepan lay down on top of the stove, but he couldn’t sleep,
and kept snapping beneath his weight the lengths of kindling that had
been placed on the stove to dry. He could not for the life of him get
the tradesman’s fat belly out of his head; in his mind he saw it bulging
from the waist of his cotton shirt, which had been washed and rewashed
so many times that it had grown faded. Again and again the thought
recurred to him of slashing that belly with a knife and letting out the
fatty intestines. And of doing the same to the woman, as well. One
moment he would say to himself: ‘Oh, to hell with them, I’ll be gone
tomorrow,’ and the next he would remember Ivan Mironov and start
thinking once again about the tradesman’s belly and Matryona’s white,
sweaty throat. If he was going to kill, he’d better kill them both. The
second cockcrow sounded. If he was going to do it, he had better do it
now, or it would be daylight. The night before he had spotted a knife
and an axe that had been left lying out. He climbed down from the stove,
took the axe and the knife, and went out of the kitchen. Out in the hall
he heard the latch click on the other side of the door. The tradesman
opened the door and came out. This was not the way Stepan had been
planning it. The knife would be no good now, so he swung the axe and
split the tradesman’s head in two. The tradesman fell against the lintel
and slumped to the floor.</p>
<p>Stepan went into Matryona’s room. Matryona leapt up and stood on her
bed, dressed in nothing but her nightshirt. With the same axe Stepan
killed her, too.</p>
<p>Then he lit a candle, took the money from the till and fled.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In the chief town of a country district lived an old man who had once
been a civil servant, but had now taken to drink. He owned the house in
which he lived with his two daughters and son-in-law, and which stood
some way from the other buildings in the town. The married daughter also
drank and led a disreputable life, and it was the elder, widowed
daughter, Maria Semyonovna, a wrinkled, emaciated woman of fifty, who
kept them all on her pension of two hundred and fifty roubles a year.
The entire family lived on this money. Maria Semyonovna also did all the
housework. She looked after her drunken, enfeebled old father and her
sister’s baby, she cooked the meals and did the laundry. And, as always
happens in such cases, they each of them unloaded all their wants and
requirements on to her, yet never ceased to shout abuse at her; the
son-in-law would even beat her when he was drunk. She endured it all in
silence and humility and, as is also usual in such cases, found that the
more she was compelled to do, the more she was able to do. She even
offered assistance to the poor, leaving herself short; she gave away her
clothing and helped to look after the sick people in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On one occasion Maria Semyonovna hired the services of a crippled,
one-legged country tailor. He altered her father’s long overcoat and
re-covered her fur-lined jacket with new cloth so that she could wear it
when she went to market in winter.</p>
<p>The crippled tailor was an intelligent, observant man who had come
across a lot of people in the course of his work and whose disability
had compelled him to spend much of his life sitting down, and thus
predisposed to reflection. He had stayed for a week in Maria
Semyonovna’s household, and had been lost in wonderment at the life she
led. Once she came into the kitchen, where he did his sewing, in order
to wash some towels, and as she did them she talked to him about his
life - how badly his brother had treated him and how he had taken his
patrimony and left to live on his own.</p>
<p>‘I thought it would be better, but I’m poor just the same as I was
before.’</p>
<p>‘It’s better not to change, but to live in the way you’ve always
lived,’ said Maria Semyonovna.</p>
<p>‘That’s what I find so wonderful about you, Maria Semyonovna: you’re
always putting yourself out for others, yet you seem to get precious
little good back from them in return.’</p>
<p>Maria Semyonovna did not say anything.</p>
<p>‘You must have decided that it’s true what the Good Book says, and
you’ll get your reward in the world to come.’</p>
<p>‘We know nothing of that,’ said Maria Semyonovna. ‘All I know is that
it’s better to live that way.’</p>
<p>‘And is that what the Book says?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, it is,’ she said, and out of the Gospels she read him the
Sermon on the Mount. The tailor began to reflect. Even after he had been
paid and had set off home, he still continued to reflect on what he had
observed in the house where Maria Semyonovna lived, and on what she had
told him and read to him.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich had changed his attitude towards the common
people, and the common people had changed their attitude towards him.
Within the space of barely a year the local muzhiks had felled
twenty-seven of his oak trees and burned down a threshing-barn that had
not been insured. Pyotr Nikolayevich decided he could not go on living
among people such as these.</p>
<p>At about this time, a family called the Liventsovs were looking for a
manager to run their estate, and the marshal of nobility had recommended
Pyotr Nikolayevich as being the best farmer in the district. The
Liventsov estate was enormous, but it was failing to yield any profit
and the peasants were helping themselves to the land. Pyotr Nikolayevich
undertook to put everything to rights. He leased out his own estate and
went with his wife to live in the remote Volga province where the
Liventsov holdings were situated.</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich had always been a stickler for law and order, and
this made him all the more determined that these wild, uncivilized
muzhiks were not to be allowed to take illegal possession of land and
property that did not belong to them. He was glad of this opportunity to
teach them a lesson, and he set about his task with severity. He had one
peasant sent to prison for stealing timber, and another he flogged
personally and without mercy for not getting out of the way and doffing
his cap when he was supposed to. As for the meadows which were in
dispute, and which the peasants regarded as theirs, Pyotr Nikolayevich
let it be known that if they allowed their cattle on to them he would
have the beasts impounded.</p>
<p>Spring came, and the peasants, as they had done in previous years,
let their cattle out on to the manorial meadows. Pyotr Nikolayevich
called all the farm hands together and instructed them to drive the
cattle into the manorial stockyard. The muzhiks were out ploughing, and
so, in spite of the warning cries of the peasant women, the farm hands
were able to round up the cattle. When the muzhiks came back from work,
they gathered together and came over to the manorial stockyard to demand
the return of their animals. Pyotr Nikolayevich came out to meet them
with a rifle slung across his shoulder (he had just come back from
making a round of inspection) and told them he would only give them back
their cattle upon payment of a fine of fifty kopecks per cow or steer
and ten kopecks per sheep. The muzhiks began shouting that the meadows
were theirs, that they had belonged to their fathers and their
grand-fathers before them, and that he had no right to impound other
people’s cattle.</p>
<p>‘Give us our cattle or it’ll be the worse for you,’ said one old man,
advancing towards Pyotr Nikolayevich.</p>
<p>‘What did you say?’ exclaimed Pyotr Nikolayevich, his face drained of
colour. He went up to the old man.</p>
<p>‘Give us them back if you don’t want trouble, shark.’</p>
<p>‘What?’ howled Pyotr Nikolayevich, and he struck the old man in the
face.</p>
<p>‘You wouldn’t dare fight us. Lads, take the cattle by force.’</p>
<p>The crowd advanced. Pyotr Nikolayevich attempted to make his escape,
but they would not let him. He tried to force his way through, and his
rifle went off by accident, killing one of the peasants. A riot ensued,
in the process of which Pyotr Nikolayevich was crushed to death. Five
minutes after it was all over, his disfigured corpse was dragged down
into the ravine.</p>
<p>The murderers were tried by a military tribunal, and two of them were
sentenced to death by hanging.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In the village the crippled tailor hailed from, five of the
well-to-do peasants leased from the local landowner a hundred and five
desyatinas of rich, arable land as black as tar and distributed it among
the other muzhiks in exchange for payments of eighteen and fifteen
roubles per allotment. None of the allotments changed hands for less
than twelve roubles. So the well-to-do peasants made a good profit. They
each took five desyatinas for themselves, and these allotments cost them
nothing. One of these muzhiks died, and the others asked the crippled
tailor if he would like to come in on the deal with them.</p>
<p>When they began to divide the land up among themselves, the tailor
refused to drink vodka with them, and when they got round to discussing
who should get how much land, the tailor said he thought that everyone
should receive the same amount, and that no charge should be made, but
that everyone should receive according to his need.</p>
<p>‘Whoever heard of such an arrangement?’</p>
<p>‘Otherwise we won’t be acting as Christians. That’s all very well for
the higher-ups, but we’re peasants. We have to do things God’s way.
Follow the law of Christ.’</p>
<p>‘Where’s it written down, this law?’</p>
<p>‘In the Good Book, in the Gospels. Here, I tell you what, you come
over to my place on Sunday; I’ll read you a bit of it, and then we can
discuss it.’</p>
<p>Most of the peasants did not bother to go to the tailor’s house on
Sunday. Three, however, did, and the tailor began to read to them.</p>
<p>He read them five chapters of the Gospel according to St Matthew.
When he had finished, they proceeded to discuss what they had heard, but
only one man, a peasant called Ivan Chuyev, thought it made any sense.
So bowled over by it was he that he began to do everything according to
God’s law, and all his family followed suit. He refused to accept the
extra land and would only take what was his proper share.</p>
<p>Other people began visiting Ivan and the tailor, and gradually they
too were won over. They gave up smoking, drinking and swearing, and
started trying to help one another. They also stopped going to church,
and they took down their icons and gave them back to the village priest.
Eventually seventeen households — comprising sixty-five people in all -
were involved in this movement. The village priest was frightened, and
reported the matter to his bishop. The bishop wondered what he should
do, and finally decided to send for Father Misail, the former grammar
school religious instructor.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>The bishop asked Father Misail to sit down, and began to tell him
about the strange new goings-on in his diocese.</p>
<p>‘It’s all caused by ignorance and spiritual weakness. You’re a man of
learning. I’m relying on you. I want you to go down there, call them all
together and get the matter sorted out.’</p>
<p>‘With Your Grace’s blessing, I shall try,’ said Father Misail. He was
glad of this assignment, as he always was whenever he was given an
opportunity to demonstrate his faith. Converting others was the best
means he knew of persuading himself that he did in fact believe.</p>
<p>‘Please do the best you can. I’m really awfully worried about my
little flock,’ said the bishop, accepting in leisurely fashion a glass
of tea from the lay brother, with his white, pudgy hands.</p>
<p>‘Why have you only brought one sort of jam? Bring some others,’ he
told the lay brother. ‘I’m really most, most upset,’ he went on,
addressing Father Misail.</p>
<p>Father Misail was glad of this chance to show the stuff he was made
of. Being a man of modest means, however, he asked that his expenses be
paid and, anticipating the opposition he would encounter on the part of
the uncultured peasants, he also requested that the governor of the
province should instruct the local police to give him assistance in case
of need.</p>
<p>The bishop made all the necessary arrangements for him, and when
Father Misail had, with the help of the lay brother and the cook, got
together the hamper and provisions that were so essential when
travelling to the back of beyond, he set off for his destination. As he
set off on this mission, Father Misail had a pleasant sense of the
importance of his vocation; at the same time he ceased to have any
doubts concerning his own faith, and was on the contrary quite swept
away by a conviction of its authenticity.</p>
<p>His thoughts centred not on the substance of his faith — that he
considered an axiom - but on the refutation of these objections that
were being made to its outer forms.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>The village priest and his wife gave Father Misail a most respectful
welcome, and the day after his arrival they called all the peasants
together in the village church. Father Misail, attired in a new silken
surplice, wearing a confessional crucifix at his chest, his hair neatly
combed, walked up into the ambo.10 Standing by his side was the priest;
a little further away stood the deacons and the choirboys; a number of
policemen were stationed by the side doors. Some of the sectarians had
also arrived; they were dressed in dirty, ragged sheepskin coats.</p>
<p>After the public prayer, Father Misail delivered a sermon in which he
exhorted the apostates to return to the bosom of the Mother Church,
threatening them with the torments of hell and promising absolution to
those who repented.</p>
<p>The sectarians fell silent. When they were actually questioned,
however, they did make some reply.</p>
<p>To the question why they had broken away from the Church, they
replied that it had been because what people worshipped in the churches
were wooden, manmade gods; not only was this not indicated by the Holy
Scriptures, the prophecies actually forbade it. When Father Misail asked
Chuyev whether it was true that they called the holy icons ‘boards’,
Chuyev replied: ‘Well, you just turn any old icon round and see for
yourself.’ When it was inquired of them why they didn’t recognize the
priesthood, they replied that in the Scriptures it was written: ‘Freely
ye have received, freely give’, whereas the priests would only offer
their holy grace in exchange for money. All Father Misail’s attempts to
support his arguments by Holy Scripture were met with the calm but firm
rejection of Ivan and the tailor, who referred to that same Scripture,
which they knew inside out. Father Misail grew angry and threatened them
with the secular authorities. To this the sectarians replied that the
Scriptures said: ‘They will persecute you, even as they persecuted
me.’</p>
<p>Thus it all came to nothing, and all would have passed off
peacefully, had not Father Misail delivered, at Mass the following day,
a sermon about the harmful influence of false witnesses in which he said
that they deserved every form of punishment. As the peasants were
shuffling out of the church afterwards, they started talking about what
they could do to teach the atheists a lesson and prevent them from
stirring up any more trouble among the village folk. And that very day,
at the same time as Father Misail was nibbling smoked salmon in the
company of His Holy Reverence and an inspector who had arrived from a
nearby town, a riot broke out in the village. The orthodox believers had
gathered together in a crowd outside Chuyev’s izba and were waiting for
the sectarians to come out so they could beat them up. There were about
twenty sectarians, men and women. Father Misail’s sermon and now this
assemblage of orthodox believers with their threatening taunts had
aroused a malevolent spirit in the sectarians, one that had not been
there before. Evening approached, and it was time for the peasant women
to go and milk the cows, but the orthodox believers continued to stand
outside and wait. When a young lad ventured out of the izba, the crowd
started to lay about him and drove him back inside. The sectarians
discussed what they should do, but were unable to reach any agreement
among themselves.</p>
<p>The tailor said they ought just to put up with it and not fight back.
Chuyev, on the other hand, said that if they didn’t do anything they
would all be beaten up, and he grabbed a poker and went out into the
street. The orthodox believers hurled themselves upon him.</p>
<p>‘All right then, let’s do things according to the law of Moses!’ he
shouted, and started to lay about the orthodox believers with the poker,
putting one man’s eye out in the process. The rest of the sectarians,
meanwhile, slipped out of the izba and went back to their homes.</p>
<p>Chuyev was brought before the court for false witness and blasphemy,
and was sentenced to deportation.</p>
<p>Father Misail, on the other hand, received a reward and was made an
archimandrite.11</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Two years before all this happened, an attractive girl of healthy,
oriental appearance called Katya Turchaninova arrived in St Petersburg
from the territory of the Don Cossacks in order to take up her studies
at the university. There she met the son of the leader of the zemstvo in
Simbirsk province, a student by the name of Tyurin. Her love for him was
not the ordinary kind of female love that expresses itself in the desire
to become a man’s wife and the mother of his children, but was rather a
comradely affection which drew most of its strength from the couple’s
shared sense of outrage and hatred where the established social order
was concerned, from a similar animus towards the representatives of that
order, and from a consciousness of their own intellectual, educational
and moral superiority to them.</p>
<p>Turchaninova was a capable student. She had no difficulty in
memorizing her lecture notes and thus passed her examinations, managing
at the same time to devour enormous quantities of the most recently
published books. She was quite certain that her calling lay not in the
bearing and nurturing of children — she looked upon such a vocation with
disgust and contempt - but in destroying the existing social order,
which put shackles on the finest aspirations of the common people, and
in showing men and women the new way of life that had been revealed to
her by the most modern European writers. Full of figure, fair-skinned,
red-cheeked and attractive, with flashing black eyes and a thick tress
of black hair, she aroused in men feelings she did not intend to arouse
and indeed had no time for, so immersed was she in her labour of
agitation and propaganda. Nevertheless, she liked the fact that she
aroused these feelings and, although she never dressed to kill, she did
not neglect her appearance either. She liked the fact that she appealed
to men, as it meant she was able to show that she despised that which
was held in such esteem by other women. In her views on the methods to
be used in the struggle with the established order she went further than
Tyurin and the majority of her friends, maintaining that the end
justified any means whatsoever, including murder. Yet this same
revolutionary, Katya Turchaninova, was also a truly kind-hearted and
self-effacing woman who was forever putting herself out for the sake of
other people’s advantage, enjoyment and well-being, and who was always
genuinely glad of an opportunity to do favours, whether for children,
old people or animals.</p>
<p>Turchaninova spent the summer months in the principal town of one of
the Volga districts, where she stayed with a friend of hers who was a
country schoolmistress. Tyurin also spent the summer in this district
where his father owned a house. Turchaninova, her friend, Tyurin and the
local doctor often met, exchanged books, argued with one another and got
generally worked up about social issues. The Tyurins’ estate bordered on
the Liventsov holding where Pyotr Nikolayevich was now manager. As soon
as Pyotr Nikolayevich arrived and started to set the place in order,
young Tyurin, noticing that the Liventsovs’ peasants seemed to have
acquired a spirit of independence and a firm resolve to uphold their
rights, began to take an interest in them and often walked down to the
village to talk to them, trying to promote the theory of socialism among
them, with particular regard to the nationalization of the land.</p>
<p>When Pyotr Nikolayevich was murdered and the district sessions
arrived, the circle of revolutionaries in the district town had a
marvellous pretext for agitation in court, and they spoke out their
opinions in no uncertain terms. Unfortunately, however, Tyurin’s walks
to the village and his conversations with the peasants were alluded to
during the court proceedings. His house was searched, some revolutionary
pamphlets were discovered, and he was arrested and taken away to St
Petersburg.</p>
<p>Turchaninova followed him to St Petersburg and went to the prison to
try to see him, but was not permitted to have a private interview with
him; instead, she had to come on the public visitors’ day, and could
only catch a glimpse of him through two iron gratings. This meeting
increased her sense of outrage still further. Her indignation finally
reached its limit when, remonstrating with a handsome young officer of
the gendarmes, she discovered that he was willing to offer her some
concessions if she would agree to certain proposals he wished to make to
her. This sent her into a violent rage against representatives of
authority. She went to the chief of police in order to file a complaint.
The chief of police repeated what the gendarme had said, that there was
nothing they could do and that it was all in the hands of the Minister
of the Interior. She sent a petition to the minister, requesting an
interview with Tyurin; it was refused. Then she decided she would commit
an act of desperation, and bought a revolver.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>The minister received his visitors at the hour he usually set aside
for this purpose. Three of his petitioners he avoided; he had a few
words with the governor of a province and then went up to a pretty,
dark-eyed young woman who was standing with a document in her left hand.
A lecherous glint appeared in the minister’s eyes at the sight of such
an attractive petitioner but, remembering his status, he assumed a
serious countenance.</p>
<p>‘What can I do for you?’ he asked, drawing closer to her.</p>
<p>Without replying, she quickly produced her revolver from under her
cape and, pointing it at the minister, fired, but missed.</p>
<p>The minister tried to grab her arm, but she stumbled backwards and
fired a second shot. The minister took to his heels. The woman was
trembling all over, unable to say a word; then, suddenly, she burst into
hysterical laughter. The minister escaped without even a scratch.</p>
<p>It was Turchaninova. She was thrown into a cell to await trial.
Meanwhile the minister, who had received the compliments and
commiserations of those in the very highest places and even from the
Tsar himself, appointed a commission to investigate the plot that had
led to this attempt on his life.</p>
<p>There was, of course, no plot; but officials of both the civil and
the secret police forces zealously applied themselves to the search for
all the threads of the non-existent conspiracy, conscientiously earning
their salaries and their keep. Getting up early in the morning, before
it was light, they conducted search after search, copied documents and
books, read diaries and personal letters and made extracts from these in
beautiful handwriting on beautiful paper; they cross-examined
Turchaninova any number of times, confronting her with witnesses and
endeavouring to make her tell them the names of her accomplices.</p>
<p>The minister was a kindly man at heart and was really sorry for this
healthy, attractive Cossack girl, but he told himself that he had grave
responsibilities to the state which he must discharge, however painful
they might be. And when an old friend of his, who knew the Tyurin
family, met him at a court ball and started to ask him about Tyurin and
Turchaninova, the minister shrugged his shoulders, crinkling the red
ribbon that traversed his white waistcoat, and said: ‘Je ne demanderais
pas mieux que de lâcher cette pauvre fillette, mais vous savez - le
devoir.’</p>
<p>And all the while Turchaninova was sitting in her cell awaiting
trial, exchanging tapped signals with her fellow prisoners from time to
time and reading the books she had been given. On occasion, however, she
would suddenly give way to rage and despair, hammering on the walls,
screaming and laughing.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>One day, when Maria Semyonovna was on her way home from collecting
her pension at the paymaster’s office, she met a teacher she knew.</p>
<p>‘Hello, Maria Semyonovna, did you get your pension all right?’ he
shouted to her from the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>‘Yes, thank you,’ replied Maria Semyonovna. ‘It’ll be enough to fill
a few cracks, anyway.’</p>
<p>‘Well, you’ve got enough there, you can fill the cracks and still
have some over,’ said the teacher, and with a goodbye he walked on.</p>
<p>‘Goodbye,’ said Maria Semyonovna. As she watched him depart, she ran
straight into a tall man with very long arms, whose face wore a stern
expression. Approaching her house, she was surprised to see this same
long-armed man again. He watched her as she went into her house, stood
around for a while outside and then turned on his heels and left.</p>
<p>At first Maria Semyonovna felt a sensation of fear, but this soon
gave way to one of melancholy. None the less, once she was inside and
had given sweets to the old man and her scrofulous little nephew Fedya
and made a fuss over the dog Treasure, who yelped with joy to see her
return, she felt all right again and, giving the pension money to her
father, resumed the household chores with which she was never done.</p>
<p>The man she had bumped into had been Stepan.</p>
<p>After he had murdered the yard-keeper at the wayside inn, Stepan had
not gone home to Moscow. It was a strange thing: the recollection of the
murder was in no way disagreeable to him; indeed, he thought about it
several times a day. He liked the idea that he could do something of
this nature so cleverly and skilfully that no one would ever find him
out or prevent him from doing the same again to other people. As he sat
in an eating-house in a provincial town sipping tea and vodka, he looked
at all the customers with one thought in his head: how to murder them.
He went to the house of a man who came from his village and worked as a
drayman in order to ask him for a bed for the night. The drayman was
out. Stepan said he would wait, and sat talking to the drayman’s wife.
Then, when she turned her back to him, leaning over the stove, he had
the idea of killing her. Surprised at himself, he gave his head a shake,
then took his knife from his bootflap, threw the woman to the ground and
cut her throat. The children started to cry, so he killed them too and
left the town that same night. Once he was out of town he found a
village and slept the night at its inn.</p>
<p>The following day he came back to the market town, and while he was
walking along the street he overheard Maria Semyonovna’s conversation
with the teacher. Her gaze frightened him, but all the same he decided
he would break into her house and steal the money she had drawn. That
night he broke the lock and entered an upstairs room. The younger,
married daughter was the first to hear him. She cried out. Stepan
immediately cut her throat. The son-in-law woke up and grappled with
him. He seized Stepan by the throat and struggled with him for a long
time, but Stepan was too strong for him. When he had dealt with the
son-in-law, Stepan, agitated now and aroused by the fighting, went
behind the partition. In bed behind the partition lay Maria Semyonovna.
She sat up and looked at Stepan with meek, frightened eyes and made the
sign of the cross over herself. Once again Stepan found her gaze
intimidating. He lowered his eyes.</p>
<p>‘Where’s the money?’ he asked, without looking up.</p>
<p>She did not say anything.</p>
<p>‘Where’s the money?’ Stepan repeated, showing her the knife.</p>
<p>‘What are you doing? You can’t do this.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, can’t I?’</p>
<p>Stepan moved closer to her, getting ready to seize her arms so that
she could not stop him, but she offered no resistance and did not raise
her arms, merely pressed them to her bosom, gave a deep sigh and said
repeatedly: ‘Oh, what a terrible sin! What are you doing? Have mercy on
yourself. You think you’re harming others, but it’s your own soul you’re
ruining … O-oh!’ she screamed.</p>
<p>Stepan could stand her voice and her gaze no longer, and with a cry
of ‘I’m not going to waste my breath on you!’ he slashed her throat with
his knife. She sank back on to the pillows and began to wheeze, soaking
one of the pillows in blood. He turned away and walked through the
upstairs rooms, gathering the valuable items together. When he had taken
what he wanted, he lit a cigarette, sat down for a while in order to
brush down his clothes, and then left the house. He had thought that
this murder would pass off with ease, as the previous ones had done, but
before he had reached the place where he intended to lodge for the night
he suddenly felt so exhausted that he could hardly move a limb. He lay
down in a ditch and stayed there for the rest of that night, all the
following day and all the next night.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>As he lay in the ditch, Stepan kept seeing Maria Semyonovna’s meek,
emaciated and frightened face, and hearing her voice. ‘You can’t do
this,’ it kept saying in that peculiar, lisping, plaintive way. And each
time it spoke he relived what he had done to her all over again. He
began to grow really afraid, and he closed his eyes and flailed his head
from side to side in an effort to shake these thoughts and memories out
of it. For a moment he would succeed in freeing himself from the
memories, but they would be replaced first by one black devil, then by
another, followed in turn by yet more black devils, with glowing red
eyes, making dreadful faces, and all saying the same thing: ‘You killed
her - now kill yourself, or we won’t give you any peace until you do.’
And he would open his eyes and see her again and hear her voice, and he
would start feeling sorry for her and experiencing fear and revulsion at
himself. Once more he would close his eyes - and once more the devils
would appear.</p>
<p>Towards the evening of the second day he got up and walked to a
nearby inn. With much effort he got there, and began drinking. But no
matter how much he drank, he could not get drunk. He sat at a table in
silence, knocking back glass after glass of vodka. The village policeman
entered the inn.</p>
<p>‘Who might you be, then?’ asked the policeman.</p>
<p>‘Oh, I’m the one who slit everybody’s throats up at Domotvorov’s
place the night before last.’</p>
<p>They bound him hand and foot. After he had been held for a day in the
local police station, he was sent to the chief town of the province. The
warden of the prison there, recognizing him as the unruly inmate he had
once had to deal with in the past, gave him a sour reception.</p>
<p>‘You’d better not play any tricks on me now, mind,’ the warden said
hoarsely, knitting his eyebrows and making his lower jaw protrude. ‘At
the first sign of it I’ll have you flogged to death. You won’t escape
from my prison.’</p>
<p>‘What would I be doing trying to escape?’ retorted Stepan, looking at
the ground. ‘I gave myself up of my own free will.’</p>
<p>‘Don’t answer back when I’m around. And look up at a superior when
he’s addressing you,’ shouted the warden, and gave him a sock on the
jaw.</p>
<p>Just then Stepan was thinking once more about Maria Semyonovna and
hearing her voice inside his brain. He had not heard a word the warden
had been saying.</p>
<p>‘What?’ he asked, brought back to his senses with a start by the
sudden blow on his chin.</p>
<p>‘Come on, come on. Forward march. None of your nonsense, now.’</p>
<p>The warden had been expecting disorderly behaviour, machinations with
other convicts, escape attempts. But of all this there was none.
Whenever the orderly or the warden himself looked in through the
peephole in the door of Stepan’s cell, they would see him sitting on a
sack that had been stuffed with straw, his head propped in his hands,
constantly whispering something to himself. When he was questioned by
the court investigator he again behaved differently from other
prisoners. He seemed absent-minded, seemed not to hear the questions he
was asked or, if he did take them in, was so truthful in his replies
that the examining magistrate, who was used to battling with ingenuity
and subterfuge on the part of the defendants who appeared before him,
now experienced a feeling akin to that of someone climbing a flight of
stairs in the dark and suddenly putting his foot into empty space.
Knitting his eyebrows and fixing his eyes straight in front of him,
Stepan confessed to all the murders he had committed in the most
unaffected, business-like tone of voice, doing his utmost to remember
all the details: ‘He came out,’ said Stepan, describing the first
murder, ‘without any shoes or socks on, and stood in the doorway, so I
gashed him once, and he croaked, and then I went straight to work on his
missus …’ - and so it went on. When the public procurator made his
rounds of the prison cells and asked Stepan if he had any complaints to
make or if there was anything he lacked, Stepan answered that he had
everything he wanted and that no one had mistreated him. The procurator,
having gone a few steps down the stinking corridor, stopped for a moment
and asked the warden who was accompanying him what the behaviour of this
convict was like in general.</p>
<p>‘He baffles me,’ replied the warden, gratified that Stepan had
praised the treatment he had received. ‘He’s been with us nearly two
months now, and he’s been a model of good behaviour. All I’m scared of
is that he’s got something up his sleeve. He’s a plucky chap, and
incredibly strong.’</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>For the first month he spent in prison Stepan was incessantly
tormented by the same thing: he saw the grey wall of his cell, heard the
sounds of the prison - the buzz of voices in the communal cell below
him, the footsteps of the sentry in the corridor, and the ticking of the
clock - and in addition he saw her, with her meek gaze, the gaze that
had vanquished him the first time he had encountered her in the street,
with her scraggy, wrinkled throat which he had cut with his knife, and
her sweet, plaintive, lisping voice saying: ‘You think you’re harming
others, but it’s your own soul you’re ruining. You can’t do this!’ Then
the voice would die away and the three black devils would reappear. They
would reappear irrespective of whether his eyes were open or closed.
When they were closed, the devils appeared more distinctly. When they
were open, the devils would fuse with the doors and the walls and
gradually disappear, only to re-emerge from three different directions,
making leering faces and saying over and over again: ‘Kill yourself,
kill yourself. You can make a noose, you can start a fire.’ At this
point Stepan would begin to shiver, and he would start reciting what
prayers he knew - ‘Ave Maria’ and ‘Our Father’ - and initially this
seemed to help. As he said these prayers, he would begin to remember his
past life: he would remember his father and mother, his village, Wolf
the family dog, his grandfather lying on top of the stove, the upturned
benches on which he had tobogganed in the snow with the other boys; then
he would remember the girls and their songs, and then the horses, and
how they had been stolen, how they had caught the horse thief and how
he, Stepan, had finished him off with a stone. And then his first prison
term would come back to him, and he would remember the fat yard-keeper,
the drayman’s wife and her children, and then again he would remember
her. And he would feel hot all over, he would throw off his prison
dressing-gown, leap up from his bunk and begin to pace up and down his
cramped cell with rapid strides, like a wild beast in a cage, turning
abruptly whenever he reached the damp, sweating walls. And again he
would recite his prayers, only now they were to no avail.</p>
<p>On one of those long, autumn evenings, when the wind was howling and
whistling in the chimneys, he sat down on his bunk, having had enough of
pacing his cell, and knew that it was no use struggling any longer, that
the devils had won, and he submitted to them. For a long time now he had
had an eye on the stovepipe. If he were to wind some thin twine or thin
strips of cloth round it, it would hold. But it would have to be done
cleverly. He set to work and spent two days cutting long strips of cloth
from the sack he slept on (when the orderly came in he covered the bed
with his dressing-gown). He tied the strips together in double knots so
that they would support the weight of his body. While he was engaged in
this task, his mental anguish ceased. When everything was ready he made
a noose, put it round his neck, climbed on to the bed and hanged
himself. But his tongue had only just started to protrude when the
strips of cloth broke and he fell to the ground. The noise brought the
orderly running in. The medical orderly was sent for, and Stepan was
taken away to the hospital. By the next day he had fully recovered, and
he was discharged from hospital and taken, not to his solitary cell, but
to the communal one.</p>
<p>In the communal cell he lived with twenty other prisoners as if he
were alone: he saw no one, spoke to no one and suffered again from his
former mental anguish. He suffered particularly when all the men were
asleep except for him, and he would see her again as of old, hear her
voice, and then witness once again the appearance of the black devils
with their terrible eyes, mocking and tormenting him.</p>
<p>Once again, as formerly, he said his prayers, and once again they
were to no avail.</p>
<p>On one occasion when, after he had prayed, she appeared to him again,
he began to pray to her instead; he prayed to her soul, begging it to
let him go, to forgive him. And when, towards morning, he collapsed on
to his tattered sack, he fell fast asleep, and as he slept she appeared
to him again in his dreams with her scraggy, wrinkled, cut throat.</p>
<p>‘Please forgive me.’</p>
<p>She looked at him with her meek gaze and said nothing.</p>
<p>‘Won’t you forgive me?’</p>
<p>Three times he begged her to forgive him. But she said nothing, and
finally he woke up. From that time on he started to feel better, and it
was as if his eyes had been opened: he looked around him and for the
first time he began to make friends with his cell mates and to talk to
them.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>One of the men in Stepan’s cell was Vasily, who had been caught
stealing again and been sentenced to deportation; another was Chuyev,
who had also been sentenced to forcible settlement. Vasily spent his
time either singing songs in his magnificent voice or telling his cell
mates the story of his exploits. Chuyev, on the other hand, either
worked, mended some article of outer clothing or underwear, or read the
Gospels and the Psalms.</p>
<p>To Stepan’s query as to why he was being deported Chuyev replied that
it was because he was a true believer in Christ, because the deceiving
priests could not tolerate the strength of spirit of those who lived
according to the Gospels and thus laid bare their own sinfulness. When
Stepan asked him what the law of the Gospels was, Chuyev explained to
him that it consisted in not praying to manmade gods, but rather in
worshipping in spirit and in truth. And he described how they had
learned this true faith from a one-legged tailor when they had been
dividing up the land.</p>
<p>‘All right, so what’s the punishment for evil-doing, then?’ asked
Stepan.</p>
<p>‘It’s all written in the Gospels.’ And Chuyev read to him:</p>
<p>“’When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy
angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory:</p>
<p>“’And before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats:</p>
<p>“’And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the
left.</p>
<p>“’Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world:</p>
<p>‘ “or I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>
<p>“’Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in
prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p>‘ “Then shall the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we
Thee an hungred, and fed Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink?</p>
<p>‘ “When saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? or naked, and
clothed Thee?</p>
<p>‘ “Orwhen saw we Thee sick, or in prison, and came unto Thee?</p>
<p>‘ “And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
<p>‘ “Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me,
ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels:</p>
<p>‘ “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me no drink:</p>
<p>‘ “I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me
not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>
<p>‘ “Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee an
hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and
did not minister unto Thee?</p>
<p>‘ “Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</p>
<p>‘ “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
righteous into life eternal.” ’ (Matthew 25:31-46)</p>
<p>Vasily, who had squatted down on the floor opposite Chuyev in order
to listen to the Scripture reading, nodded his stately head in
approval.</p>
<p>‘That’s right,’ he said, emphatically. “‘Go ye accursed into eternal
torment, you never fed a poor man, but filled your own bellies instead.”
That’s what they deserve. Here, give me the book, I want to read a bit,
too,’ he added, anxious to show off his reading ability.</p>
<p>‘But won’t there be any forgiveness?’ asked Stepan, silently lowering
his shaggy head to listen.</p>
<p>‘Hang on a minute, and shut up,’ Chuyev said to Vasily, who was still
going on about how the rich had neither fed the poor wanderer nor
visited him in prison. ‘Hang on, will you?’ said Chuyev again, leafing
through the copy of the New Testament. When he found the place he
wanted, Chuyev smoothed out the pages with a large, strong hand that had
gone white from his long-term in prison.</p>
<p>“‘And there were also two other malefactors, led with him” — with
Christ, that is,’ Chuyev began, ’ — “to be put to death.</p>
<p>‘ “And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
and the other on the left.</p>
<p>‘ “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do. And they parted His raiment, and cast lots.</p>
<p>‘ “And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
derided Him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
<p>‘ “And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
vinegar.</p>
<p>‘ “And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
<p>‘ “And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS is THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>‘ “And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
<p>‘ “But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>
<p>‘ “And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds:
but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
<p>‘ “And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when Thou comest into
Thy kingdom.</p>
<p>“‘And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou
be with me in paradise.”’ (Luke 23: 32-43)</p>
<p>Stepan said nothing, but sat reflecting and, although he appeared to
be listening, he heard no more of what Chuyev was reading.</p>
<p>‘So that’s what the true faith is,’ he thought. ‘It’s only the people
that feed the poor and visit the prisoners who’ll be saved, all the
rest’ll go to hell. All the same, the thief didn’t repent until he was
on the cross, and he went to heaven.’ He saw no contradiction here. The
one circumstance seemed rather to confirm the other: the merciful would
go to heaven and the unmerciful would go to hell, and that meant that
everyone had better be merciful; the fact that Christ had pardoned the
thief meant that Christ too was merciful. All this was completely new to
Stepan; he only wondered why it had all been previously concealed from
him. And he spent all his free time with Chuyev, asking him questions
and listening to Chuyev’s replies. As he listened, the truth came home
to him. The overall meaning of the doctrine — that all men were brothers
and that they ought to love and have compassion for one another, and
that then everyone would be all right - was revealed to him. As he
listened, he perceived as something forgotten and familiar everything
that confirmed the overall meaning of this doctrine, and simply let slip
past his ears everything that did not confirm it, ascribing it to his
lack of understanding.</p>
<p>And from that time onwards, Stepan became a different man.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Even before this, Stepan Pelageyushkin had been a docile prisoner;
but of late, with the change that had taken place in him, he had become
a source of amazement to the warden, the orderlies and the other
prisoners. Without being told to, even when it was not his turn, he
performed all the most difficult and unpleasant tasks, including the
emptying and cleaning of the night pail. But in spite of this obedience,
his cell mates feared and respected him, knowing his will power and his
great physical strength; this was particularly so after an incident
involving two vagrants who attacked him, but whom he repulsed, breaking
the arm of one of them. These vagrants had set out to beat a well-to-do
young prisoner at cards, and had fleeced him of every penny he owned.
Stepan had interceded for him and had managed to get back from them the
money they had won. The vagrants had started to curse him and had then
tried to beat him up, but he had overpowered them both. When the warden
made an inquiry as to the cause of the quarrel, however, the vagrants
claimed it had been Stepan who had tried to beat them up. Stepan had
made no attempt to protest that he had been in the right, and had meekly
accepted his punishment, which had consisted of three days in the
punishment block and transfer to a solitary cell.</p>
<p>He found solitary confinement irksome because it separated him from
Chuyev and the Gospels, and also because he feared a return of his
hallucinations involving Maria Semyonovna and the devils. But the
hallucinations did not come back. His soul was entirely filled with a
new, joyful radiance. He would have been glad of his solitude if only he
had been able to read and had possessed a New Testament. The prison
authorities would have given him the latter, but he was unable to
read.</p>
<p>As a boy he had begun to learn the alphabet in the old-fashioned way
- az, buki, vedi12 — but because of his slow-wittedness he had got no
further than learning the individual letters, had never been able to
understand the way words were put together, and had remained illiterate.
Now, however, he resolved to try again, and he asked the orderly for a
New Testament. The orderly brought him one, and he set to work. He could
recognize the individual letters, but he could not for the life of him
work out how they were put together. No matter how hard he struggled to
understand the composition of the words, he could make no sense of it at
all. He was unable to sleep at nights, spent all his time thinking about
this problem, even went off his food. In the end he grew so depressed
that he had an attack of lice and could not get rid of them.</p>
<p>‘How’s it going then? Still can’t make it out, eh?’ the orderly asked
him one day.</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>‘I tell you what, do you know “Our Father”?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘Well, look, here it is; now you say it. There you are.’ And the
orderly showed him the text of the Lord’s Prayer in the New
Testament.</p>
<p>Stepan began to recite the Lord’s Prayer, fitting the familiar
letters together with the familiar words. And suddenly the mystery of
words was revealed to him, and he began to read. He was overjoyed. And
from that day forth he continued to read, and the meaning that little by
little emerged from the words which he composed with difficulty acquired
even greater import.</p>
<p>Stepan’s solitude was no longer a burden to him - it was a joy. His
whole life was filled with his task, and he was dismayed when he was
transferred back to the communal cell so that his solitary cell could be
made available to house one of the newly arrived political
prisoners.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Now it was often Stepan, not Chuyev, who read aloud from the Gospels
in the communal cell, and while some of the prisoners sang bawdy songs,
others would listen to what he read and what he had to say about it.
There were two men in particular who paid attention in this way:
Makhorkin the executioner, who was doing hard labour for murder, and
Vasily, who had been caught stealing and was being held in this prison
while he awaited trial. On two occasions during his stay in the prison,
Makhorkin had carried out his duties as an executioner, both times in
other towns where no one could be found to carry out the sentences
imposed by the judges. The peasants who had murdered Pyotr Nikolayevich
had been tried by a military tribunal, and two of them had been
sentenced to death by hanging.</p>
<p>Makhorkin was ordered to go to Penza to act as executioner in the
prison there. On previous occasions such as this, possessing a degree of
literacy that was above the average, he had immediately written a letter
to the governor, explaining that he had been called away to Penza to
carry out his duties and requesting the chief of the province to grant
him a regulation daily maintenance allowance; this time, however, he
declared, much to the astonishment of the warden, that he would not go
and said he would never carry out his official duties ever again.</p>
<p>‘Have you forgotten the whip?’ shouted the warden.</p>
<p>‘The whip’s as may be, but killing’s against the law.’</p>
<p>‘Been talking to our prison prophet Pelageyushkin, have you? Just you
wait.’</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>While all this was going on, Makhin, the grammar school boy who had
shown his friend how to forge a coupon, had left school, gone to
university and taken a degree at the Faculty of Law. Thanks to his
success with women, and in particular with an ex-mistress of an aged
cabinet minister with whom he was friendly, he had, at a remarkably
early age, become an examining magistrate. He was a dishonest man who
cheated on his debts, a seducer of women and a gambler, but he was also
clever and keen-witted, and had a retentive memory and a shrewd eye for
a case.</p>
<p>He was the examining magistrate in the district where Stepan
Pelageyushkin was being tried. Even at the first examination he was
taken aback by the simplicity, truthfulness and calm of Stepan’s replies
to his questions. Makhin sensed unconsciously that this man who stood
before him in fetters and shaven-headed, and who had been escorted to
the prison and placed under lock and key by two soldiers, was endowed
with a perfect freedom, and existed at a superior moral level that was
inaccessible to him, Makhin. So as he examined him, he had constantly to
keep rallying his spirits and egging himself on, so as not to lose face
and be put off his mark. He was astonished by the way Stepan talked
about what he had done as though it were something that had happened
long ago, and as though it had not been him but someone else who had
been involved.</p>
<p>‘And didn’t you feel sorry for them?’ asked Makhin.</p>
<p>‘No. I didn’t understand in those days.’</p>
<p>‘Well, how do you feel about them now?’</p>
<p>Stepan smiled sadly.</p>
<p>‘I wouldn’t do it now even if you were to roast me on the fire.’</p>
<p>‘Why not?’</p>
<p>‘Because now I know all men are brothers.’</p>
<p>‘What, do you mean to say you think I’m your brother?’</p>
<p>‘Of course I do.’</p>
<p>‘What, I’m your brother, and yet I’m having you put away?’</p>
<p>‘You’re only doing that because you don’t understand.’</p>
<p>‘What don’t I understand?’</p>
<p>‘You don’t understand, otherwise you wouldn’t be having me put
away.’</p>
<p>‘Oh all right, let’s get on with it. So where did you go after
that?’</p>
<p>Makhin was astonished most of all by what the prison warden told him
about Pelageyushkin’s influence on the executioner Makhorkin, who, at
the risk of receiving a flogging, had refused to carry out his official
duties.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>At a soiree in the house of the Yeropkin family, where there were two
rich marriageable daughters, both of whom Makhin was courting, the
singing of romances had just come to an end. Makhin was musically
gifted, and he particularly excelled in the performance of romances,
being both a fine singer and a fine accompanist. After the singing was
over, Makhin gave a very objective, faithful and detailed account - he
had an excellent memory - of the story of the strange criminal who had
converted an executioner to Christ. Makhin was able to remember and
describe everything so exactly because he was always totally uninvolved
with the people he had to deal with. He neither entered into nor knew
how to enter into the emotional condition of others, and this was why he
had such a good memory for all the things that happened to people, all
the things they said and did. Pelageyushkin, however, had awoken his
interest. He did not attempt to put himself in Stepan’s shoes, but he
found himself asking himself the question: ‘What’s going on inside his
head?’ Although he was unable to come up with any answer, he none the
less had a feeling that it must be something interesting, so at the
soiree he related the entire case: the executioner’s conversion, the
warden’s stories about Pelageyushkin’s strange behaviour, his reading of
the Gospels, and the powerful influence he exerted on his fellow
convicts.</p>
<p>Everyone took an interest in Makhin’s story; most interested of all,
however, was the Yeropkins’ younger daughter, Liza, who was eighteen
years old and had just completed her studies at a ladies’ institute. It
was only recently that she had woken up from the darkness and narrowness
of the false surroundings in which she had been reared, and had burst
like a swimmer to the surface, gulping in the fresh air of life. She
began to question Makhin about the details of the story, about how and
why it was that such a change had taken place in Pelageyushkin. Makhin
informed her of what Stepan had told him about his most recent murder,
and about how the meekness and docility of this extraordinarily
kind-hearted woman, who had known no fear of death but who had been his
victim none the less, had vanquished him and opened his eyes, and how
the reading of the Gospels had done the rest.</p>
<p>It took Liza Yeropkina a long time to get to sleep that night. For
several months now a struggle had been going on inside her between the
fashionable social life her sister had been trying to get her interested
in, and her love for Makhin, which in her was connected with a desire to
reform him. And now it was this latter pull that took over. She had
already heard something of the woman before she had been murdered. Now,
however, in view of the terrible manner of her death and what Makhin had
told her about the things Pelageyushkin had said, she inquired after all
the details of Maria Semyonovna’s history and was quite shaken at what
she learned.</p>
<p>Liza passionately longed to be another Maria Semyonovna. She was
rich, and she was afraid that Makhin was only interested in her for her
money. And so she decided she would give all her land away, and told
Makhin of her intention.</p>
<p>Makhin was glad of this opportunity of showing how disinterested he
was, and he told Liza that her money had nothing to do with his love for
her and that her decision, which he thought a very magnanimous one, had
touched him deeply. Meanwhile a struggle had developed between Liza and
her mother - the estate had been given to her by her father - who would
not allow her to give the land away. Makhin went to Liza’s aid. And the
more he acted in this way, the more he came to understand this new world
of spiritual aspiration, which he perceived in Liza and which until now
had been a complete mystery to him.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In the communal cell, all had grown quiet. Stepan was lying in his
berth on the plank bed, not yet asleep. Vasily went across to him and
tugged his foot, winking to him as a signal to get up and come over to
where he was standing. Stepan clambered down from the plank bed and
approached Vasily.</p>
<p>‘Now, my friend,’ said Vasily. ‘You see if you can’t help me.’</p>
<p>‘How can I help you?’</p>
<p>‘Escaping is what I have in mind.’</p>
<p>And Vasily told Stepan that he had made all the arrangements for an
escape.</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow I’ll start a bit of trouble with them’ - he pointed to the
prisoners lying asleep - ‘and they’ll complain to the orderlies. They’ll
take me to the cells upstairs, and from then on it’ll be plain sailing.
Only you’ll have to help to get me out of the mortuary.’</p>
<p>‘All right, then. But where’ll you go?’</p>
<p>‘I’ll go where fortune leads me. Do you think there’s any shortage of
villains out there?’</p>
<p>‘That’s true, Vasily, but it’s not for us to judge them.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I mean, it’s not as if I was a murderer, is it? I’ve never
killed a person in my life, and what’s stealing? What’s wrong about it?
Don’t they rob us poor blighters?’</p>
<p>‘That’s their business. They’ll have to answer for it.’</p>
<p>‘Well, and are we supposed to just stand still and watch? Look, I
burgled a church once. What harm did that do anyone? What I want to do
now is make one really big haul - not just break into some little shop
or other - and give the money away to them that need it.’</p>
<p>Just then one of the convicts sat up on the plank bed and began to
eavesdrop. Stepan and Vasily went their separate ways.</p>
<p>On the following day Vasily carried out his plan. He began
complaining about the bread, saying it was mouldy, and egged on the
convicts to send for the warden and make an official complaint. The
warden arrived, showered them with abuse and, discovering that Vasily
was the ringleader, ordered him to be locked up separately in one of the
solitary cells upstairs.</p>
<p>This was exactly what Vasily had wanted.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Vasily was well acquainted with the upstairs cell into which he had
been put. He knew how its floor was constructed and, as soon as he
arrived there, he started to take the floorboards up. When he was able
to wriggle under the floor, he prised open the planks on the ceiling of
the room that lay directly below, and jumped down. This room was the
prison mortuary; that day there was only one corpse on the mortuary
table. It was in this mortuary that the sacks used for making the
convicts’ straw mattresses were kept. Vasily knew this and was counting
on it. The padlock on the door of the room had been unlocked and pushed
inside. Vasily opened the door and went out along the corridor to its
far end, where a new latrine was under construction. In this latrine
there was a hole leading from the third floor down to the basement.
Feeling for the door, Vasily went back into the mortuary, removed the
shroud from the ice-cold corpse (his hand touched it as he pulled the
shroud away), then took some sacks, tied them together with the shroud
so as to make a long rope, and lowered the rope into the latrine hole;
then he tied the rope to a cross-beam and climbed down it. The rope was
not long enough to reach all the way down. How much of a gap was left,
he did not know, but there was nothing to be done about it now, so he
hung down as far as he could, and then jumped. He hurt his legs, but was
able to continue walking. There were two windows in the basement. They
were wide enough for him to crawl through, but were fitted with iron
gratings. One of the iron gratings would have to be dislodged. What
could he use to do that? Vasily began to rummage about. Lying in the
basement were some sections of boards. He found one section that had a
pointed end and began using it to force the bricks that held the grating
in place. This work took a long time. Second cockcrow came, but still
the grating held. At last one side of it came loose. Vasily shoved his
pointed section of board into the gap and heaved; the grating came away,
but a brick fell to the floor, making a noise. The sentries might hear.
Vasily froze. All was quiet. He climbed out of the window. He would have
to scale the prison wall in order to make his escape. In a corner of the
yard stood an outhouse. He would have to climb on to the roof of this
outhouse and get over the wall that way. He would have to take a section
of board with him, for otherwise he would not be able to get on to the
roof. He climbed back through the window, came out again with a section
of board and froze, listening for the sentry. As he had been counting
on, the sentry was marching on the other side of the courtyard square.
Vasily went over to the outhouse, placed his piece of board against it,
and started to climb. The board slipped and fell. Vasily was wearing
socks, but no shoes. He took off his socks so as to get a better grip
with his feet, positioned the board again, leapt on to it and seized the
roof gutter with his hand. ‘Oh God, don’t let me fall, keep me up,’ he
prayed. He hung on to the roof gutter, and then managed to get up on to
the roof by one knee. The sentry was coming. Vasily lay down and froze.
The sentry did not notice anything and continued on his rounds. Vasily
leapt to his feet. The iron roofing clattered under his feet. He took
one step, two. Then he was at the wall. He could reach it easily with
his hand. One hand first, and then the other, he stretched up, and there
he was, on the wall. All he had to do now was to be careful and not hurt
himself as he jumped down. He turned round, hung by both hands,
stretched to his full length, lowered one arm, then the other and -
praise the Lord! - he was on the ground. It was soft ground, too. His
legs were unharmed, and off he ran.</p>
<p>When he reached his house in the suburbs, Malanya opened the door for
him, and he crawled under the warm, patchwork quilt that was steeped in
the smell of sweat.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Pyotr Nikolayevich’s large and attractive wife, childless, forever
placid, and plump as a dry cow, stood at the window and watched her
husband being killed by the peasants and his body being dragged away
somewhere into the fields. The feeling of terror Natalya Ivanovna (such
was the name of Pyotr Nikolayevich’s widow) experienced at the sight of
this bloody deed was - as is generally the case - so powerful that it
blotted out all other feelings in her. When, however, the crowd of
peasants had disappeared from sight behind the garden fence and the
hubbub of voices had died away, and Malanya, the barefoot girl who
worked as a servant for them, came rushing in with her eyes sticking out
of her head as though she were about to relate some joyous event, to say
that Pyotr Nikolayevich had been murdered and his body thrown in the
ravine, Natalya Ivanovna’s feeling of horror was gradually supplanted by
another emotion: a sense of joy at her liberation from the despot in the
smoked eyeglasses who had kept her in slavery these past twelve years.
She was deeply shocked by this feeling, and tried not to acknowledge it
to herself, and even more not to tell anyone else about it. When his
yellow, hairy, disfigured corpse was washed and dressed and laid in its
coffin, she was filled with horror, and she wept and sobbed. When the
examining magistrate with special responsibility for serious cases
interrogated her as a witness, he confronted her, right there and then
in his office, with two peasants in fetters who had been charged with
being the principal culprits. One of them was quite old, with a long,
white curling beard and a face that was calm, stern and handsome; the
other was of gypsy appearance and was somewhat younger, with shining
black eyes and curly, dishevelled hair. Natalya Ivanovna thereupon
testified that to the best of her knowledge these were the same two men
who had been the first to seize Pyotr Nikolayevich by the arms, and even
though the peasant who looked like a gypsy flashed and darted his eyes
under his flickering eyebrows, and said reproachfully: ‘It’s a sin,
ma’am! We’ll all die some day, you know’ - even in spite of this, she
did not feel in the slightest sorry for them. On the contrary, during
the investigation a hostile feeling rose up in her, coupled with a
desire to take revenge on the murderers of her husband.</p>
<p>But when a month later the case, which had been transferred to a
military tribunal, ended in eight men being sentenced to penal servitude
and the two ringleaders - the white-bearded old man and the swarthy
‘gypsy’ as he was called - being sentenced to be hanged, she experienced
an unpleasant sensation. This soon disappeared, however, under the
influence of the solemn ritual of the court. If this was what the higher
authorities considered to be necessary, then it must be all right.</p>
<p>The executions were to be carried out in the village. And, returning
from Mass one Sunday, Malanya, wearing a new dress and new shoes, told
her mistress that a gallows was being put up, that an executioner was
expected to arrive from Moscow on Wednesday, that the two men’s
relatives were wailing without cease, and that the noise could be heard
all over the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Natalya Ivanovna stayed indoors so as not to see the gallows or the
people, and wished only for one thing: for it all to be over as soon as
possible. She took thought only for herself, and not for the condemned
men or their families.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>On the Tuesday, the chief constable, who was a friend of Natalya
Ivanovna’s, dropped in to see her. Natalya Ivanovna treated him to vodka
and her own pickled mushrooms. When the chief constable had sampled
both, he told her that there was to be no execution the following
day.</p>
<p>‘What? Why is that?’</p>
<p>‘It’s an odd story, really. We can’t find a hangman. There was one in
Moscow, but my son was telling me that he started reading the Gospels
and now says killing’s against his conscience. He got hard labour for
the murders he committed, but now all of a sudden he says he can’t kill
even if he’s got the law behind him. He was told he’d be whipped. Whip
me, he says, but I still won’t do it.’</p>
<p>Natalya Ivanovna suddenly blushed, and her thoughts even started to
make her perspire.</p>
<p>‘But can’t they be pardoned now?’</p>
<p>‘How can they be pardoned when they’ve been found guilty by a court
of law? Only the Tsar can pardon them.’</p>
<p>‘But how will the Tsar ever find out about them?’</p>
<p>‘They have the right to appeal for mercy.’</p>
<p>‘Anyway, it’s for my sake that they’re being executed,’ said Natalya
Ivanovna, who was not very intelligent. ‘And I forgive them.’</p>
<p>The chief constable laughed. ‘Why don’t you put in a petition for
them?’</p>
<p>‘Can I?’</p>
<p>‘Of course you can.’</p>
<p>‘But won’t it be too late now?’</p>
<p>‘You can send a telegram.’</p>
<p>‘To the Tsar?’</p>
<p>‘Of course, you can send a telegram even to the Tsar.’</p>
<p>The discovery that the executioner had refused to do his job and was
prepared to suffer rather than kill anyone caused a sudden upheaval
within Natalya Ivanovna; the sense of horror and compassion which had
already surfaced a few times in her now broke through and took
possession of her.</p>
<p>‘Dear Filipp Vasilyevich, please write the telegram for me. I want to
ask the Tsar to show mercy to them.’</p>
<p>The chief constable shook his head. ‘What if we were to be punished
for it?’</p>
<p>‘I’ll take the responsibility. I won’t mention you at all.’</p>
<p>‘There’s a kind woman,’ thought the chief constable. ‘A really kind
woman. If my wife was like her I’d be in clover now.’</p>
<p>And the chief constable wrote a telegram to the Tsar: ‘To His
Imperial Majesty the Sovereign Emperor. Your Imperial Majesty’s loyal
subject, the widow of the collegiate assessor Pyotr Nikolayevich
Sventitsky, murdered by peasants, prostrating herself at the sacred feet
of Your Imperial Majesty [the chief constable was especially proud of
this passage in the telegram] begs you to have mercy on the condemned
men, the peasants so-and-so, of such-and-such a village,
volost,13district and province.’</p>
<p>The chief constable dispatched the telegram himself, and Natalya
Ivanovna began to feel much happier. She felt that if she, the widow of
the murdered man, forgave his murderers and asked for mercy for them,
the Tsar could not refuse to grant her request.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Liza Yeropkina was living in a state of continuous exaltation. The
further she progressed along the Christian way of life that had been
revealed to her, the more convinced she became that this was the only
true way, and her heart grew lighter and lighter.</p>
<p>Now she had two immediate objectives: the first was to convert
Makhin, or rather, as she put it privately, to return him to himself, to
his good and beautiful nature. She loved him, and by the radiance of her
love she saw into the divine nature of his soul, which is common to all
human beings, seeing in this universal principle of life, however, a
goodness, tenderness and exaltedness that were peculiar to him alone.
Her other objective was to cease being rich. She wanted to get rid of
all her land, in the first place in order to put Makhin to the test, and
secondly for her own good, for the good of her soul - and she wanted to
do this according to the letter of the Gospels. She began by dividing up
the land and announcing her intention of giving it away, but she was
prevented from carrying out this plan in the first instance by her
father, but even more effectively by the deluge of personal and written
applications that flooded in on her. Then she decided to turn to an
elder who was noted for the holy life he had led, and asked him to take
her money and do with it whatever he thought fitting. When her father
found out about this, he was furious, and in the course of a heated
conversation with her called her a madwoman and a psychopath, and said
he was going to take steps to protect her from herself.</p>
<p>Her father’s angry, irritable tone of voice had its effect on her
and, before she was aware of it, she burst into resentful tears and said
insulting things to him, calling him a despot and even a shark.</p>
<p>She begged her father to forgive her; he said he was not angry, but
she could see that he was hurt and had not really forgiven her. She was
reluctant to tell Makhin about what had happened. Her sister, who was
jealous of her because of Makhin, shunned her completely. She had no one
to talk to about her feelings, no one to whom she could confide.</p>
<p>‘It’s God I must confide in,’ she told herself, and since it was Lent
she decided she would fast and take holy communion, and that during
confession she would tell the father confessor everything and ask his
advice as to what her future actions should be.</p>
<p>Not far from the city was the monastery where the elder lived, the
one who was renowned for his way of life and for the teachings,
prophecies and cures that were ascribed to him.</p>
<p>The elder had had a letter from Yeropkin senior, warning him of his
daughter’s arrival and of the abnormal, hysterical state of mind she was
in; the letter expressed his confidence that the elder would be able to
put her on the right track, the way of moderation and of the good,
Christian life, in harmony with existing circumstances.</p>
<p>Tired after a long succession of visitors, the elder received Liza
and quietly began to impress upon her the importance of moderation and
obedience to the existing circumstances of her life and to her parents.
Liza blushed, perspired and said nothing, but when he had finished she
began to remind him, timidly at first, with tears in her eyes, that
Christ had said: ‘Leave thy father and thy mother, and follow me,’ and
then, with an increasing degree of animation, went on to explain her
entire conception of Christianity. At first the elder just smiled and
made some routine points of dogma, but then he grew silent and began to
sigh, muttering ‘Oh God!’ to himself now and again.</p>
<p>‘Well, all right, then, come to me for confession tomorrow,’ he said,
and blessed her with his wrinkled hand.</p>
<p>The following day he heard her confession and, without continuing
their conversation of the day before, he sent her away, curtly refusing
to take upon himself the disposition of her property.</p>
<p>The purity of this girl, her fervour and complete subservience to the
will of God had made a deep impression on the elder. He had long wanted
to turn his back on the world, but the monastery needed his services, as
they brought in money. And so he had agreed to stay on, although he had
a vague awareness of the falsity of the position he was in. He had been
turned into a saint and worker of miracles, while really he was just a
weak man who had been carried away by his own success. And the soul of
this girl, which she had just revealed to him, had opened to him a
revelation of his own soul. He had seen how far he was from what he
wanted to be and from what his heart was drawing him towards.</p>
<p>Soon after Liza’s visit, he went into a retreat and it was not until
three weeks later that he came out into the church, conducted the
service and after it delivered a sermon in which he reproached himself
and castigated the world for its sinfulness and called it to
repentance.</p>
<p>Every two weeks he delivered a new sermon. Each time they were
attended by more and more people. His fame as a preacher spread further
and further afield. There was something unique, bold and sincere about
his sermons, and this was the reason for the powerful effect he had on
other people.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Meanwhile Vasily had been doing exactly as he pleased. One night with
some companions he broke into the house of Krasnopuzov, a rich man. He
knew that Krasnopuzov was miserly and debauched, and he broke open the
writing desk and took thirty thousand roubles from it. And he did what
he pleased. He even stopped drinking and gave the money away to poor
girls who wanted to get married. He provided dowries, paid off debts and
kept a low profile. All he worried about was how to distribute the money
fairly. He even gave some of it to the police, who as a result did not
spend much time looking for him.</p>
<p>His heart rejoiced. And when in the end he was arrested none the less
and brought to trial, he laughed and boasted, saying that the
pot-bellied Krasnopuzov’s money had been lying idle, that its owner had
not known its true value, while he, Vasily, had put it into circulation
and had used it to help good folk.</p>
<p>And indeed, so good-humoured and kind-hearted was his defence that
the jury almost acquitted him. He was sentenced to deportation.</p>
<p>He thanked the judge and told him in advance that he was going to
escape.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Sventitsky’s widow’s telegram to the Tsar produced no result
whatsoever. It was decided by the petitions office not even to report
the matter to His Majesty. One day, however, when the Tsar was having
lunch, the Sventitsky affair came up in the course of the table talk,
and the director of the petitions office, who was present, told him
about the telegram that had been received from the murdered man’s
wife.</p>
<p>‘C’est très gentil de sa part,’ said one of the ladies of the
Imperial family.</p>
<p>The Tsar merely sighed, shrugged his epauletted shoulders, and said:
‘The laws’s the law.’ Then he set up his glass, into which the valet
poured some sparkling Moselle. Everyone pretended to be overwhelmed by
the wisdom of the Tsar’s words. And after that there was no more mention
of the telegram. The two muzhiks - the older man and the younger fellow
- were hanged with the help of a cruel and bestial murderer, a Tartar
executioner who had been summoned especially from Kazan.</p>
<p>The old man’s widow had wanted to dress her husband’s corpse in a
white shirt, white foot-cloths and new shoes, but they would not let
her, and both men were buried in a common grave outside the wall of the
cemetery.</p>
<p>‘Princess Sofya Vladimirovna was telling me he’s the most marvellous
preacher,’ said the Tsar’s mother, the Dowager Empress, to her son one
day: ‘Faites le venir. Il peut precher a la cathédrale.’</p>
<p>‘No, it’d be better to have him preach at home,’ said the Tsar, and
gave orders that elder Isidor was to be summoned to court.</p>
<p>All the generals assembled in the court chapel. A new and
out-of-the-ordinary preacher was, after all, something of an event.</p>
<p>A little, grey-haired, emaciated old man came out and looked everyone
over: ‘In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost,’ he said, and began his sermon.</p>
<p>It started off all right, but the longer it went on, the worse it
became. “Il devenait de plus en plus aggressif’ was how the Empress
described it afterwards. He fulminated against everything and everyone,
spoke of the death sentence and ascribed its necessity to bad
government. Can it really be permissible, he asked, to kill people in a
country that is supposed to be Christian?</p>
<p>Everyone looked at one another, and everyone thought only of the
impropriety and of how displeased the Tsar must be, but no one said
anything. When Isidor said ‘Amen’, the Metropolitan approached him and
asked him to come and have a word with him.</p>
<p>After a talk with the Metropolitan and the Chief Procurator of the
Synod, the old man was immediately sent off to a monastery — not his
own, this time, however, but the one at Suzdal, where the Father
Superior and prison commandant was Father Misail.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Everyone pretended that there had been nothing untoward about
Isidor’s sermon, and no one made any mention of it. Even the Tsar felt
that the elder’s words had left no impression on him, although a couple
of times during the day he did find himself thinking about the execution
of the peasants, and Sventitsky’s widow’s telegram of intercession for
them. There was a parade that afternoon, followed by a drive through the
streets, then there was a reception of ministers, dinner, and in the
evening he went out to the theatre. As usual, the Tsar fell asleep as
soon as his head touched the pillow. That night he was awoken by a
terrible dream: in a field stood a gallows with corpses dangling from
it; the corpses’ tongues were protruding, sticking out further and
further. And someone was shouting: ‘It’s all your doing, it’s all your
doing!’ The Tsar woke up in a sweat and started to think. For the first
time in his life he began to think about the responsibility that rested
with him, and he remembered everything the old man had said …</p>
<p>But he could see the human being in himself only from afar, and he
could not give himself up to the demands of the human being because of
all the demands that are made on a tsar from every side; as for
admitting that the demands of the human being might be more binding than
the demands made on him as a tsar - he did not have the strength to do
that.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Proshka, that high-spirited, dandified, proud young lad came out from
his second term in prison completely broken. When he was sober he merely
sat around and did nothing, and, no matter how much his father shouted
at him, he lived as a parasite and did no work - not only that, he was
in the habit of stealing things and taking them down to the public house
to sell for drink. He slouched around, coughed, hawked and spat. The
doctor he visited auscultated his chest and shook his head.</p>
<p>‘What you need, my friend, is something you haven’t got.’</p>
<p>‘I know, it’s what I’ve always needed.’</p>
<p>‘Drink plenty of milk and don’t smoke.’</p>
<p>‘But it’s Lent, and anyway we haven’t got a cow.’</p>
<p>One night that spring he was unable to sleep; he felt depressed and
wanted to drink. There was no drink in the house. He put on his fur hat
and went out, making his way along the street until he came to the
houses where the clergy lived. There was a harrow leaning against the
fence outside the deacon’s house. Proshka went over, slung the harrow
over his shoulder and carried it off to Petrovna at the drinking house.
‘Maybe she’ll give me a bottle of vodka for it.’ He had not gone far
when the deacon came out on to his porch. It was already broad daylight,
and he could see that Proshka had taken his harrow.</p>
<p>‘Hey, what do you think you’re doing?’</p>
<p>The deacon’s servants came out, seized Proshka, and threw him in the
lock-up. The Justice of the Peace sentenced him to eleven months in
prison.</p>
<p>Autumn came. Proshka was transferred to the prison hospital. He could
not stop coughing, his chest was nearly bursting, and he could not keep
warm. Some of the patients must have been fairly healthy, for they at
least were not shivering. But Proshka shivered by day and by night. The
warden liked to economize on firewood, and did not start heating the
hospital until November of each year. Proshka suffered physical agonies,
but spiritually he suffered even worse. Everything disgusted him, he
hated everyone: the deacon, the warden who refused to heat the hospital,
the orderly and even one of the patients near him who had a red, swollen
lip. He also conceived an intense dislike of the new convict who had
just been brought in. This was Stepan. He had caught an inflammation of
the head, had been transferred to the hospital and had been put in a bed
next to Proshka. Although Proshka hated him at first, he subsequently
grew so fond of him that all he cared for was the chance of talking to
him. It was only after his conversations with him that Proshka’s intense
depression ever lifted.</p>
<p>Stepan was forever telling the other patients about his most recent
murder and about the effect it had had on him.</p>
<p>‘She didn’t yell or scream or anything,’ he would say. ‘She just
said: “Go on, then, cut my throat. It’s not me but yourself you ought to
feel sorry for,” she said.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I know, it’s a terrible business killing anything. I once
killed a sheep, but I wasn’t proud of myself for doing it. And here I
am, I haven’t killed a soul, but they’ve gone and ruined me anyway, the
rats. I’ve never harmed a living soul in all my life …’</p>
<p>‘Never mind, it’ll all be counted in your favour.’</p>
<p>‘Where, might I ask?’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean, where? Where’s your faith in God?’</p>
<p>‘You don’t see much of Him, somehow; you know, I don’t believe in
Him. I think you just die and the grass grows over you. That’s all.’</p>
<p>‘How can you say that? I’ve killed that many folk, but she was kind,
all she did was help people. Do you think we’ll get the same treatment,
she and I? No, you wait and see …’</p>
<p>‘So you think that when you die your soul stays alive?’</p>
<p>‘What else? It stands to reason.’</p>
<p>Death was not coming easily to Proshka, and he was gasping for
breath. But at the very last moment he suddenly felt at ease. He called
to Stepan.</p>
<p>‘Well, brother, farewell. I see it’s time for me to die now. I was
that scared, but now I can see there’s nothing to it. I just want it to
be over as soon as possible.’</p>
<p>And Proshka died in the hospital.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Meanwhile the affairs of Yevgeny Mikhailovich were going from bad to
worse. He had had to mortgage his shop. Business was bad. Another
photographic supply shop had opened in the town. The interest on his
mortgage was due. He had to borrow more money in order to pay off the
interest. And the upshot of it all was that the shop was earmarked for
sale, and all the goods in it as well. Yevgeny Mikhailovich and his wife
ran all over town, but nowhere could they raise the four hundred roubles
they needed in order to save their business.</p>
<p>They had had a faint hope that the merchant Krasnopuzov, whose
mistress was friendly with Yevgeny Mikhailovich’s wife, might help them.
But by now the whole town knew that an enormous amount of money had been
stolen from Krasnopuzov. It was said that the sum amounted to half a
million.</p>
<p>‘And who do you think stole it?’ said Yevgeny Mikhailovich’s wife.
‘It was Vasily, our old yard-keeper. They say he’s throwing the money
around like anyone’s business, and he’s even bribed the police with
it.’</p>
<p>‘He never was any good,’ said Yevgeny Mikhailovich. ‘Perjured himself
as easy as blinking that time, he did. I’d never have believed it of
him.’</p>
<p>‘They say he called by at our place one day. The cook said it was
him. She says he paid the dowries for fourteen poor girls who wanted to
get married.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, well, people do make things up, you know.’</p>
<p>Just then a strange-looking elderly man in a woollen jacket came into
the shop.</p>
<p>‘What can I do for you?’</p>
<p>‘There’s a letter for you.’</p>
<p>‘Who’s it from?’</p>
<p>‘It says on it.’</p>
<p>‘Well, they’ll want a reply, won’t they? Wait a moment.’</p>
<p>‘I can’t.’</p>
<p>And having handed over the envelope, the strange-looking man left in
a hurry.</p>
<p>‘Funny.’</p>
<p>Yevgeny Mikhailovich tore open the fat envelope and could hardly
believe his eyes: it contained hundred-rouble notes. There were four of
them. What on earth was this? And there was a badly spelled letter
addressed to Yevgeny Mikhailovich, which read: ‘The Gosspels tell us to
render good for evil. You cauzed me a lot of truble with that cupon and
a lot of truble to that muzhik as well, but I feel sory for you. Here’s
four undred for you, and remember your old yard-keeper Vasily.’</p>
<p>‘Well, isn’t that extraordinary!’ said Yevgeny Mikhailovich; he said
it both to his wife and to himself. And whenever he remembered this
subsequently or mentioned it to his wife, the tears would come to his
eyes and her heart would be filled with joy.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In the prison at Suzdal there were fourteen clergymen who had all
been sent there in the first instance for apostasy; this was where
Isidor too had been sent. Father Misail received Isidor according to the
instructions he had been given and, without interviewing him, ordered
him to be put in a solitary cell, as befitting a serious criminal. In
the third week of Isidor’s stay in the prison, Father Misail made the
rounds of the inmates. Going into Isidor’s cell, he asked if there was
anything he required.</p>
<p>‘There are a lot of things I require, only I can’t tell you what they
are in front of the other men. Let me have a private talk with you.’</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and Father Misail saw that he had nothing
to fear. He ordered Isidor to be brought to his retreat and, when the
two of them were alone, he said: ‘All right, go ahead, then.’</p>
<p>Isidor fell on his knees.</p>
<p>‘Brother!’ said Isidor. ‘What are you doing? Have mercy on your own
soul. You’re the worst villain alive, you’ve spat on everything that’s
holy …’</p>
<p>A month later Father Misail filed documents for the release, on the
grounds of penitence, not only of Isidor but also of seven other men,
with a request that he himself be allowed to retire to a monastery.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Ten years went by.</p>
<p>Mitya Smokovnikov had graduated from the technical institute and was
now an engineer on a large salary; he was engaged in gold prospecting in
Siberia. It was necessary for him to make an exploratory tour of the
area. The director of the project suggested that he take the convict
Stepan Pelageyushkin along with him.</p>
<p>‘One of the hard labour men? Won’t that be rather dangerous?’</p>
<p>‘He’ll not be any trouble. He’s a holy man. Ask anyone you like.’</p>
<p>‘What’s he in for?’</p>
<p>The director smiled. ‘He murdered six people, but he’s a holy man. I
promise you.’</p>
<p>And so Mitya Smokovnikov agreed to take Stepan, who was now a
balding, emaciated, weather-beaten old man, along with him, and they set
off together.</p>
<p>On the journey Stepan looked after Smokovnikov as if he were his own
child, and told him his whole story, and all the whys and wherefores of
his present existence.</p>
<p>And it was a strange thing. Mitya Smokovnikov, who until that time
had lived only in order to eat, drink, play cards and chase women, now
thought about life for the very first time. And these thoughts gave him
no peace; indeed, they gradually turned his soul upside down. He was
offered a very advantageous position. He turned it down and decided to
use the money he had in order to buy some property, get married and
serve the common people as best he could.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>And that was what he did. But first he went to see his father, with
whom he had been having difficulties on account of his father’s new
family. Now, however, he decided to make it up with his father. And so
he did. And his father, surprised, laughed at him at first, but later
recalled the many times he had been guilty with regard to him.</p>
