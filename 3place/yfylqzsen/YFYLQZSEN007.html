<h4 id="the-death-of-ivan-ilyich">THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH</h4>
<p>I</p>
<p>In the large law court building, during an adjournment of the
Melvinsky trial, the members of the Bench and the public prosecutor had
come together in the office of Ivan Yegorovich Shebek, and the
conversation touched on the celebrated Krasovsky case. Fyodor
Vasilyevich argued vehemently that it was beyond their jurisdiction,
Ivan Yegorovich had his own view and was sticking to it, while Pyotr
Ivanovich, who had kept out of the discussion at the outset and was
still not contributing, was perusing a copy of the Gazette which had
just been delivered.</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen!’ he said. ‘Ivan Ilyich is dead.’</p>
<p>‘Is he really?’</p>
<p>‘Here you are. Read it yourself,’ he said to Fyodor Vasilyevich,
handing him the paper, fresh off the press and still smelling.</p>
<p>There was an announcement within a black border: ‘It is with profound
sorrow that Praskovya Fyodorovna Golovina informs family and friends
that her beloved husband, Ivan Ilyich Golovin, Member of the Court of
Justice, passed away on the 4th of February this year, 1882. The funeral
will take place on Friday at I p.m.’</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich had been a colleague of the gentlemen assembled there,
and they had all liked him. He had been ill for several weeks, and the
word was that his illness was incurable. His post had been kept open for
him, but there was an understanding that in the event of his death
Alexeyev would step into his place, and Alexeyev’s place would be taken
by either Vinnikov or Shtabel. So, the first thought that occurred to
each of the assembled gentlemen on hearing the news of his death was how
this death might affect his own prospects, and those of their
acquaintances, for transfer or promotion.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure to get Shtabel’s job now, or Vinnikov’s,’ thought Fyodor
Vasilyevich. ‘They promised me ages ago, and a promotion like that would
give me another eight hundred roubles a year, plus expenses.’</p>
<p>‘I must apply to have my brother-in-law transferred from Kaluga,’
thought Pyotr Ivanovich. ‘My wife will be delighted. She won’t be able
to tell me I never do anything for her people.’</p>
<p>‘I had a feeling he wasn’t going to get better,’ said Pyotr
Ivanovich. ‘It’s sad.’</p>
<p>‘What was actually wrong with him?’</p>
<p>‘The doctors couldn’t decide. Well, they could, but they all decided
differently. The last time I saw him I thought he was going to come
through it.’</p>
<p>‘And I haven’t been to see him since Christmas. I kept meaning to
go.’</p>
<p>‘Was he all right financially?’</p>
<p>‘His wife had a bit of money, I think. Nothing very much.’</p>
<p>‘Well, we’ll have to go and see her. They live an awfully long way
away.’</p>
<p>‘For you they do. Where you live, everywhere’s a long way away.’</p>
<p>‘Look at that. He can’t forgive me for living across the river,’ said
Pyotr Ivanovich, smiling at Shebek. The conversation turned to the long
distances between the different parts of the city, and then they walked
back into session.</p>
<p>Apart from the speculations aroused in each of them by this death,
concerning the transfers and possible changes that this death might
bring about, the very fact of the death of someone close to them aroused
in all who heard about it, as always, a feeling of delight that he had
died and they hadn’t.</p>
<p>‘There you have it. He’s dead, and I’m not’ was what everyone thought
or felt. But his closest acquaintances, Ivan Ilyich’s so-called friends,
couldn’t help thinking that they would now have to fulfil some tedious
social obligations such as attending the funeral and calling on the
widow to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Closest of all were Fyodor Vasilyevich and Pyotr Ivanovich.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich was an old friend from law school, and he felt
indebted to Ivan Ilyich.</p>
<p>Over dinner he told his wife about the death of Ivan Ilyich and the
mooted possibility of her brother being transferred to their district,
and then, dispensing with his usual nap, he put on a dress-coat and set
off for Ivan Ilyich’s house.</p>
<p>At the entrance stood a carriage and two cabs. Downstairs in the
entrance hall, next to the coat stand, a coffin lid with silk brocade,
tassels and gold braid that had been powdered and polished stood propped
against a wall. Two ladies in black were taking off their fur cloaks. He
knew one of them, Ivan Ilyich’s sister, but not the other. His colleague
Schwartz was at the top of the stairs about to come down, but when he
saw Pyotr Ivanovich he stopped and gave him a wink that seemed to say,
‘Ivan Ilyich has messed things up — not what you or I would have
done.’</p>
<p>Schwartz’s face, with its English sidewhiskers and his lean figure in
formal dress, exuded, as always, an air of elegant solemnity and,
although the solemnity belied his playful personality, it was
particularly poignant here, or so it seemed to Pyotr Ivanovich.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich allowed the ladies to pass on ahead, and slowly
followed them upstairs. Instead of coming down, Schwartz stood waiting
at the top. Pyotr Ivanovich knew why; he clearly wanted to arrange a
game of whist somewhere that evening. The ladies proceeded upstairs to
see the widow, but Schwartz pursed his lips tightly with all
seriousness, though his eyes had a mischievous look as he twitched his
eyebrows, directing Pyotr Ivanovich off to the right and into the room
where the dead man lay.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich entered the room, and hesitated, as people always do
on these occasions, not knowing precisely what to do. The only thing he
was certain of was that in this situation you couldn’t go wrong if you
made the sign of the cross. Whether or not you should bow at the same
time he wasn’t sure, so he went for a compromise, crossing himself as he
walked in and giving a bit of a bow as he did so. At the same time, as
far as hand and head movements permitted, he glanced round the room. Two
young persons, nephews apparently, one of them a schoolboy, were
crossing themselves as they left the room. A little old woman was
standing there motionless. And a lady with curiously arched eyebrows was
whispering to her. A church reader in a frock-coat - a hearty character
of considerable spirit — was reading something out in a loud voice and a
tone that brooked no contradiction. Gerasim, the peasant who waited at
table, darted ahead of Pyotr Ivanovich, sprinkling something on the
floor. Seeing this, Pyotr Ivanovich instantly recognized a slight smell
of decaying flesh. When he had visited Ivan Ilyich for the last time he
had seen this peasant in Ivan Ilyich’s room, acting as a sick nurse, and
Ivan Ilyich had had a special fondness for him.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich kept on crossing himself, and aimed a slight bow
midway between the reader, the coffin and the icons on the corner table.
Then, when the business of crossing himself seemed to be going on too
long, he paused and took a close look at the dead man.</p>
<p>The dead man lay as all dead men lie, unusually heavy with his dead
weight, with rigid limbs sinking into the soft lining of the coffin and
his head bowed for eternity on the pillow, and he displayed what dead
people always display, a waxen yellow forehead (with bald patches over
his hollow temples) and a protruding nose that seemed to be pressing
down hard on his upper lip. He had changed a good deal; he was even
thinner than he had been when Pyotr Ivanovich had last seen him, but, as
with all dead bodies, his face had acquired greater beauty, or, more to
the point, greater significance, than it had had in life. Its expression
seemed to say that what needed to be done had been done, and done
properly. More than that, the expression contained a reproach, or at
least a reminder, to the living. The reminder seemed out of place to
Pyotr Ivanovich, or at least he felt it didn’t apply to him personally.
But an unpleasant feeling came over him, and he crossed himself again,
hurriedly — too hurriedly, he thought, the haste was almost indecent —
before turning and heading for the door.</p>
<p>Schwartz was waiting for him in the next room with his feet planted
wide apart and both hands fiddling with the top hat held behind his
back. One glance at his mischievous, immaculately elegant figure and
Pyotr Ivanovich felt restored. He could see that Schwartz was above all
this, and would be impervious to anything that might have been
depressing. His very appearance spoke volumes: in no way would the
occasion of Ivan Ilyich’s funeral serve as a reason for cancelling their
usual session; in other words, nothing would prevent them from breaking
open a new pack and riffling through the cards that evening while a
servant set up four new candles. There was, in fact, no reason to think
that this occasion should stop them having a good time that very
evening. He said so in a low voice to Pyotr Ivanovich as he walked past,
proposing that they meet for a game at Fyodor Vasilyevich’s.</p>
<p>But Pyotr Ivanovich was clearly not destined to play whist that
evening. Praskovya Fyodorovna, a short, plump woman whose body expanded
from the shoulders down despite her best efforts to the contrary, done
out in black, with a lace shawl over her head and the same curiously
arched eyebrows as the lady facing the coffin, emerged from her chambers
with some other ladies, showed them to the door of the dead man’s room,
and said, ‘The service is about to begin. Do go in.’</p>
<p>Schwartz made an indeterminate bow, and stood there without accepting
or rejecting this invitation. Praskovya, recognizing Pyotr Ivanovich,
gave a sigh, went straight up to him, took him by the hand, and said, ‘I
know you were a good friend to Ivan Ilyich …’ And she looked at him,
anticipating a suitable response. Pyotr Ivanovich knew that just as he
had had to cross himself in there, out here it was necessary to squeeze
her hand and say with a sigh, ‘Believe me …’ And that’s what he did.
Having done it, he felt that the desired effect had been achieved - he
had been touched, and she had been touched.</p>
<p>‘Let’s go in before they get started. I must have a word with you,’
said the widow. ‘Give me your arm.’</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich offered an arm and they made their way into the inner
rooms, walking past Schwartz, who gave Pyotr Ivanovich a gloomy wink.
‘No whist for you, then. You won’t mind if we find another partner. We
might make up a fivesome when you can get free,’ said his mischievous
glance.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich sighed even more deeply and plaintively, and
Praskovya showed her gratitude by squeezing his hand. Proceeding into
her drawing-room, which was done out in pink cretonne and lit by one
dismal lamp, they sat down near to a table, she on a sofa, he on a low
pouffe with broken springs that wobbled unevenly as he sat on it.
Praskovya had wanted to warn him off into another chair, but a warning
like that did not seem appropriate in the circumstances, so she thought
better of it. As he sat down on his pouffe, Pyotr Ivanovich remembered
the time when Ivan Ilyich had been decorating this room and had asked
his advice about this pink cretonne with the green leaves. On her way
past the table to sit down on the sofa — the room was crammed with
furniture and knick-knacks - Praskovya snagged the black lace of her
black shawl on the carved edge of the table. Pyotr Ivanovich rose
slightly to disentangle it, thus releasing the pouffe, which quivered
and pushed up at him. The widow began disentangling the lace herself, so
Pyotr Ivanovich sat down again, crushing the rebellious pouffe back into
submission. But the widow had not finished disentangling herself, so
Pyotr Ivanovich rose again, and so did the pouffe, rebellious and even
creaking. When this was all over, she took out a clean cambric
handkerchief and burst into tears. But Pyotr Ivanovich had cooled
somewhat after the episode with the lace and the battle with the pouffe,
and he sat there with a scowl on his face. The embarrassment was broken
when Sokolov, Ivan Ilyich’s footman, came in to report that the plot
which Praskovya had chosen in the cemetery was going to cost two hundred
roubles. She had stopped weeping, and she looked at Pyotr Ivanovich with
a victimized air as she told him in French how hard things were for her.
Pyotr Ivanovich made a silent gesture to acknowledge his absolute
conviction that it could not be otherwise.</p>
<p>‘Do smoke if you would like to,’ she said in a tone of voice that was
magnanimous yet flat with defeat, and she went on to discuss the cost of
the plot with Sokolov. As he lit his cigarette, Pyotr Ivanovich heard
that she had made detailed enquiries about the cost of various plots of
land before settling on the one she wanted. That was not all: once the
plot had been ordered, she went on to make arrangements for the choir.
Then Sokolov left.</p>
<p>‘I’m doing everything myself,’ she told Pyotr Ivanovich, pushing
aside some albums on the table. Noticing that the table was under threat
from the cigarette, she swiftly moved an ashtray across and spoke again.
‘I think it would be hypocritical to claim that I cannot manage
practicalities because of my grief. On the contrary, if anything can … I
won’t say console me, but … take my mind off things, it’s seeing to what
has to be done about him.’ She took out her handkerchief again as if on
the verge of tears, but suddenly she seemed to get a grip on her
feelings, snapped out of it and spoke calmly. ‘But there is one thing I
would like to discuss with you.’</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich bowed his head. The springs shifted under him, but he
did not let them have their way.</p>
<p>‘He suffered terribly those last few days.’</p>
<p>‘Did he really?’ asked Pyotr Ivanovich.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, terribly. The last few minutes, no, hours really, he never
stopped screaming. He screamed for three solid days without stopping for
breath. It was unbearable. I don’t know how I got through it. You could
hear him three rooms away. Oh, I’ve been through it all right!’</p>
<p>‘And was he conscious?’ asked Pyotr Ivanovich.</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ she whispered. ‘To the very end. He said goodbye a quarter of
an hour before he died, and he was still asking us to take Volodya
away.’</p>
<p>For all the disagreeable awareness of hypocrisy, his own and hers,
the thought of the suffering endured by a man he had known so well,
first as a happy young lad, then as a schoolboy, then as an adult
colleague, left Pyotr Ivanovich with a feeling of horror. Once again he
could see that forehead, the nose pressing down on the upper lip, and he
felt a pang of fear for himself.</p>
<p>‘Three days and three nights of horrible suffering, and then death.
Just think, it could happen to me any time, now,’ he thought, and he
felt that momentary pang of fear. But immediately he was saved, without
knowing how, by the old familiar idea that this had happened to Ivan
Ilyich, not him, and it could not and would not happen to him, and that
kind of thinking would put him in a gloomy mood, for which there was no
need, as Schwartz’s face had clearly demonstrated. Pursuing this line of
thought, Pyotr Ivanovich calmed down and began to show a close interest
in the details of Ivan Ilyich’s death, as if death was a chance
experience that may have applied to Ivan Ilyich but certainly didn’t
apply to him.</p>
<p>After giving a detailed account of the truly horrendous physical
agony that Ivan Ilyich had endured (details that Pyotr Ivanovich learned
only in terms of the distressing effect they had had on Praskovya), the
widow clearly saw that it was now necessary to get down to business.</p>
<p>‘Oh, Pyotr Ivanovich, it’s dreadful, absolutely dreadful.’ She burst
into tears again.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich gave a sigh, and waited for her to blow her nose.
When she had blown her nose, he said, ‘Believe me …’ Then she spoke out
again, and told him what must have been the main reason for consulting
him: it was all a matter of using the death of her husband to get some
money from the Treasury. She made it seem as if she was asking Pyotr
Ivanovich’s advice about getting a pension, but he could see that here
she knew more than he did, she knew the finest details of this subject
down to the last penny that could be screwed out of the Treasury in
terms of death benefits. What she wanted to know was whether there might
be some way of screwing a bit more out of them. Pyotr Ivanovich tried to
think of some way of doing this but, having given it some thought and
doing the decent thing by cursing the government for being so stingy, he
said he thought there was no more to be had. Upon which she gave a sigh,
and made no bones about getting rid of her visitor. He got the message,
stubbed his cigarette out, stood up, shook hands, and went out into the
hall.</p>
<p>In the dining-room with the clock that Ivan Ilyich had prided himself
on having acquired in an antique shop, Pyotr Ivanovich came across a
priest and a number of people that he knew, here for the funeral, and he
saw a pretty young lady whom he also knew, Ivan Ilyich’s daughter. She
was all in black. Her tiny waist looked tinier than ever. She looked
gloomy, assertive, almost truculent. She bowed to Pyotr Ivanovich in a
way that suggested he was to blame for something. Behind the daughter
stood a wealthy young man, also known to Pyotr Ivanovich, who looked no
less offended — he was an examining magistrate, her fiancé by all
accounts. Pyotr Ivanovich gave a gloomy bow in their direction and was
about to walk through into the dead man’s room when Ivan Ilyich’s
schoolboy son, the image of his father, appeared from behind the
stairwell. This was the little Ivan Ilyich that Pyotr Ivanovich
remembered from law school. His tear-filled eyes were those of a twelve-
or thirteen-year-old boy who has lost his innocence. Seeing Pyotr
Ivanovich, he looked embarrassed and scowled morosely. Pyotr Ivanovich
gave him a nod and walked into the dead man’s room. The funeral service
was soon under way — candles, moaning, incense, tears, sobbing. Pyotr
Ivanovich stood there with a frown on his face, staring at the legs of
those in front of him. Not once did he look at the dead man or succumb
to any feelings of weakness; he was one of the first to leave. There was
no one in the hall. Gerasim, the servant of peasant stock, darted out of
the dead man’s room, and sorted through all the fur coats with his big
strong hands before finding Pyotr Ivanovich’s coat and handing it
over.</p>
<p>‘Gerasim. How are you feeling, my boy?’ said Pyotr Ivanovich, who had
to say something. ‘A bit sad?’</p>
<p>“Tis God’s will, sir. ‘Twill come to us all,’ said Gerasim,
displaying an even white row of peasant’s teeth, and then, with the air
of a man with a lot of work to do, he wrenched the door open, called the
driver up and sprang back to the porch steps, wondering what else needed
to be done.</p>
<p>Pyotr Ivanovich found it particularly pleasant to inhale the fresh
air after the incense, the corpse and carbolic.</p>
<p>‘Where to, sir?’ asked the coachman.</p>
<p>‘It’s still quite early. I think I’ll drop in on Fyodor
Vasilyevich.’</p>
<p>And that’s where he went. And there they were, sure enough, finishing
the first rubber. He was just in time to make up a fifth.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The past history of Ivan Ilyich’s life had been straightforward,
ordinary and dreadful in the extreme.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich had died at forty-five, a member of the Court of Justice.
He was the son of an official who had worked his way through various
ministries and departments in Petersburg, carving out the kind of career
which brings people to a position from which, despite their obvious
incapacity for doing anything remotely useful, they cannot be sacked
because of their status and long years of service, so they end up being
given wholly false and fictitious jobs to do for which they receive
salaries that are anything but fictitious, anything from six to ten
thousand a year, and this enables them to live on to a ripe old age.</p>
<p>Such a man was Ilya Yefimovich Golovin, Privy Councillor, superfluous
member of various superfluous institutions.</p>
<p>He had three sons. Ivan Ilyich was the second son. The eldest had
carved out the same career as his father but in a different ministry,
and was now near to achieving the kind of seniority that confers
sinecure status. The third son was a failure. He had gone through a
series of jobs, ruining his prospects in all of them, and he now worked
for the railways. His father, his brothers and especially their wives
not only hated meeting him but forgot his existence unless compelled to
do otherwise. Their sister had married Baron Greff, a Petersburg
official cut from the same cloth as his father-in-law. Ivan Ilyich was
what they called le phénix de la famille. He was neither as cold and
starchy as the elder brother nor as profligate as the younger. He was
halfway between — an intelligent, lively, personable and decent man. He
had attended law school along with his younger brother. The younger
brother didn’t finish the course; he was expelled in the fifth grade,
whereas Ivan Ilyich passed with honours. As a student he was already the
kind of person he remained for the rest of his life, a capable man,
cheerful and kind, sociable and convinced of the need to follow the path
of duty — duty being anything so designated by higher authority. Boy and
man he had avoided toadyism, but from his earliest years he was like a
moth to the flame in being drawn towards people in authority, he assumed
their mannerisms along with their philosophy of life, and he was on good
terms with them. All the distractions of childhood and youth has passed
him by leaving scarcely a trace; he had succumbed to both sensuality and
vanity, and then in the top classes to liberal thinking, but always
within limits unerringly set by his own instinctive feelings.</p>
<p>In his student days he had done things that at first he thought of as
utterly revolting, things that made him feel disgusted with himself even
as he was doing them, but in later life, noticing that the same things
were being done by people of high standing without a qualm, although he
couldn’t quite bring himself to think they were good, he did manage to
dismiss them, and he felt no pangs of remorse when he recalled them.</p>
<p>When he graduated from law school, qualifying for the tenth grade of
the civil service, and received enough money from his father to buy his
basic necessities, Ivan Ilyich ordered a new set of clothes from
Scharmer‘s,1 hung a medallion on his watch chain inscribed with the
words Respice finem,2said goodbye to the prince and principal, dined at
Donon’s3 with his friends, and set off for one of the provinces with his
fashionable luggage, linen, clothes, shaving tackle, toiletries and
travelling rug, all ordered and purchased from the very best shops, to
take up a position arranged for him by his father as special assistant
to the governor.</p>
<p>In the provinces it did not take Ivan Ilyich long to arrange a
lifestyle that was as easy and agreeable as the one he had enjoyed at
law school. He did his work, pursued his career and at the same time
discreetly enjoyed himself. He went off now and then on official visits
to country districts, cutting a dignified figure with superiors and
inferiors alike, and he prided himself on carrying out his duties,
especially in matters concerning religious dissidents, with scrupulous
fairness and incorruptibility.</p>
<p>In his official duties, despite his youth and an attitude of some
frivolity, he was exceedingly conservative, bureaucratic and even
forbidding, but on the social side he was often amusing and witty, and
always pleasantly polite — what the governor and the governor’s wife
called a bon enfant, and with them he was like one of the family.</p>
<p>In the provinces he had an affair with a lady only too keen to liaise
with a smart young lawyer. There was also a milliner, and there were
drinking sessions with visiting aides-de-camp, as well as after-dinner
excursions to a certain street on the outskirts. There was a need to
work on the governor and even the governor’s wife in order to win them
over. But all of this bore the stamp of high respectability to such an
extent that no one could have called it by a bad name; all of it was
catered for by what the French describe as ‘youth having its fling’. All
of it was conducted with clean hands, in clean linen, in French phrases,
and — what mattered most — at the highest level of society, which meant
with approval from those in authority.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich spent five years in this kind of service, but the time
came for a career change. New legal institutions were opening up; new
men were needed.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich became one of the new men.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich was offered the post of examining magistrate, and he took
it, even though it meant moving to a new province, dropping all his old
contacts and establishing new ones. Ivan Ilyich was given a send-off by
his friends, who presented him with a silver cigarette case; they had a
group photograph taken, and off he went to his new job.</p>
<p>As an examining magistrate Ivan Ilyich was just as comme il faut and
respectable, just as capable of separating official duty from private
life and earning respect as he had been when working as a special
assistant to the governor. The new work itself struck Ivan Ilyich as far
more interesting and rewarding than his earlier job. Before, he had
quite liked strutting about in his Scharmer uniform, sauntering past
anxious petitioners and envious officials and walking straight into the
governor’s office, where he would sit down for a cup of tea and a smoke.
But not many people had been under his authority — only the rural police
chiefs and the religious dissidents that he came across on his
assignments — and he loved to treat these dependent people with a
courteous, almost comradely spirit, he loved to let them feel that
although he had the power to crush them he was being straight with them,
treating them like friends. There had not been many of them then, but
now that Ivan Ilyich was an examining magistrate he felt that everyone
without exception was in his power, even the most important and
self-satisfied of people; at a stroke from his pen on headed notepaper
any important or self-satisfied person could be brought before him as a
defendant or witness to answer questions and be kept on his feet if Ivan
Ilyich chose not to let him sit down. Far from abusing this power, he
did his best to play it down, but his consciousness of that power and
the very chance to play it down were what gave his new job its interest
and appeal. In the work itself, the process of investigation, Ivan
Ilyich soon mastered the technique of distancing himself from all
irrelevancies and reducing the most complicated cases to a version that
could be set down on paper in objective outline, excluding any personal
opinion on his part, while observing all the necessary formalities,
which was what mattered most. This was the new way of working, and he
was one of the first men to implement the reformed Legal Code of
1864.4</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich’s transfer to a new town and the post of examining
magistrate meant meeting new people and making new contacts; he also
struck a new attitude, and slightly changed his tone. The new attitude
involved distancing himself somewhat from the provincial authorities
while cultivating the best circles among the judiciary and the wealthy
gentry of the town, and the new tone entailed mild dissatisfaction with
the government, a degree of liberalism and a civilized man’s sense of
public duty. At the same time, without compromising the fastidiousness
of his dress sense, in his new situation he left his chin unshaven,
allowing his beard to grow as and where it wanted.</p>
<p>In his new town, too, Ivan Ilyich set himself up very nicely. The
section of society opposed to the governor was friendly and agreeable,
his pay had gone up, and one thing that made his life particularly
pleasurable was the playing of whist, which he now took to with the
enjoyment of a skilled card-player, astute, quick-thinking and almost
invariably a winner.</p>
<p>After two years working in the new town Ivan Ilyich met his future
wife. Praskovya Fyodorovna Mikhel was the most attractive, intelligent
and colourful young lady in the social circle frequented by Ivan Ilyich.
To the list of other distractions and relaxations from his work as an
examining magistrate Ivan Ilyich added a mild flirtation with
Praskovya.</p>
<p>When he had been an assistant on special commissions Ivan Ilyich had
been quite a dancer, but now he was an examining magistrate he took to
the floor much less frequently. When he danced it was only as if to say,
‘Look, I may be part of the reformed system, and I’ve got as far as
Grade 5, but if you want to see me on the floor I can show you that even
in dancing I can be the best.’ So, just occasionally, he would take to
the floor with Praskovya at the end of an evening, and it was actually
while dancing like this that he won her heart. She fell in love with
him. Ivan Ilyich had no clear and definite plans for marriage, but once
the girl fell in love with him he began to wonder. ‘When all’s said and
done, why shouldn’t I get married?’ he asked himself.</p>
<p>This young woman, Praskovya Fyodorovna, belonged to a good family,
and she was quite attractive. She also came with a little money. Ivan
Ilyich might have held out for a more brilliant partner, but she was
herself a decent catch. Ivan was earning good money, and he could count
on something similar from her. It would be a good match — she was a nice
girl, quite pretty and a thoroughly decent young woman. To claim that
Ivan Ilyich got married because he was in love with his bride, and saw
in her someone who shared his outlook on life, would have been no more
justifiable than to say that he married because the match met with the
approval of the society that he moved in. Ivan Ilyich married for both
reasons. He was pleasing himself by acquiring such a wife, but at the
same time he was appealing to his superiors and their sense of
propriety.</p>
<p>So, Ivan Ilyich got married.</p>
<p>The process of getting married, and the early days of married life,
with conjugal caresses, new furniture, new crockery, new linen,
everything up to his wife’s pregnancy, went very smoothly, to the extent
that Ivan Ilyich was beginning to think that marriage would not disrupt
his easy, agreeable and enjoyable lifestyle, which was decency itself,
approved of by society and something that Ivan Ilyich considered to be
part of life itself — and it might even improve it. But it was at this
stage, during the first months of his wife’s pregnancy, that something
happened, something new, unexpected, unpleasant, difficult and
disgusting, something that could not have been anticipated and could not
in any way be got rid of.</p>
<p>For no reason that Ivan Ilyich could fathom, other than what he
called gaîté de coeur,his wife did begin to disrupt the pleasant and
decent run of his life. She became jealous of him for no apparent cause,
demanded his closest attention, laid into him and started arguments that
were unpleasantly vulgar.</p>
<p>At first Ivan Ilyich hoped to escape the unpleasantness of his new
situation by relapsing into the same carefree but respectable way of
life that had stood him in good stead before — he tried to ignore his
wife’s moodiness and carry on in the easy, agreeable way that he had
formerly enjoyed, inviting friends round for a game of cards and trying
to get out and drive round to the club or visit people close to him. But
there came a time when his wife started shouting at him so furiously,
using such foul language, determined to keep on yelling at him when he
failed to do what she wanted, obviously with every intention of keeping
it up until he came to heel, stayed in and went through the same anguish
that she felt, that Ivan Ilyich was horrified. He realized that married
life — at least with his wife — didn’t always mean enjoyment and
decency, but, on the contrary, it often disrupted them, and it was
therefore necessary to guard against such disruptions. And Ivan Ilyich
began to seek ways of doing this. His work was the one thing that
impressed Praskovya, and it was through work and the commitments
associated with it that he took on his wife and asserted his own
independence.</p>
<p>When the baby was born, with the various difficulties with feeding,
the real and imaginary illnesses of mother and child, which demanded his
sympathetic involvement even though he understood nothing about them,
the need for Ivan Ilyich to safeguard his independence became even more
urgent.</p>
<p>As his wife grew more and more irritable and demanding, Ivan Ilyich
gradually shifted his life’s centre of gravity on to his work. He loved
his work more and more, and became more ambitious than he had been.</p>
<p>It didn’t take him long — no more than a year after his wedding-to
realize that although married life did provide some conveniences, it was
actually rather a complex and difficult business, and the path of duty,
which meant leading a decent life approved of by society, called for a
clearly defined attitude, as at work.</p>
<p>And Ivan Ilyich managed to establish such an attitude towards his
married life. He required of it whatever domestic conveniences it could
provide in terms of meals on the table, a good household and a bed and,
most important, the outward show of respectability that society
required. Beyond this, he required some enjoyment and pleasure, and if
he found this he was very thankful, but if he was met with rejection and
crabbiness he immediately took himself off into his own separate,
carefully guarded world, the world of work which gave him pleasure.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich was considered a good colleague, and within three years
he was promoted to assistant chief prosecutor. His new responsibilities,
the importance that they entailed, the opportunity of bringing people
before the court and sending them to prison, the publicity given to his
speeches, and the success enjoyed by Ivan Ilyich in these matters — all
of this made his work seem even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Other children were born. His wife was becoming more and more
bad-tempered and crabby, but the new attitude established by Ivan Ilyich
towards his home life made him all but impervious to her crabbiness.</p>
<p>After serving for seven years in the same town Ivan Ilyich was
transferred to another province, as public prosecutor. They moved, they
were short of money, and his wife didn’t like the town they had moved
to. His salary had gone up, but so had their living expenses. On top of
that, two of their children died, and family life became even more
unpleasant for Ivan Ilyich.</p>
<p>Praskovya blamed her husband for all the setbacks they were suffering
in their new place of residence. Most of the topics of conversation
between husband and wife, especially about bringing up the children, led
to questions that reminded them of past arguments, and new arguments
were liable to flare up at any moment. They were left with a few short
periods of amorousness that came over them as husband and wife, but
these did not last long. These were nothing more than little islands
where they could anchor for a while, only to plunge back into a sea of
hidden hostility as they grew further and further apart. This growing
apart might have upset Ivan Ilyich if he had thought there was anything
wrong with it, but now not only did he consider this state of affairs to
be quite normal, he saw it as the whole point of his role in the family.
His role was to distance himself increasingly from all the
unpleasantness and give it an air of harmless respectability; this he
achieved by spending less and less time with the family, and when he was
forced to be with them he sought to safeguard his own position by
ensuring the presence of others. But the main thing was that Ivan Ilyich
did have his work. It was in the world of his work that the whole
interest of his life came into focus. And this interest absorbed him
totally. The knowledge of the power that he wielded, the possibility of
ruining anyone that he fancied ruining, the gravitas (even if it was all
outward show) which could be sensed as he walked into court or dealt
with his subordinates, the success that he was enjoying with his
superiors and subordinates alike, and, above all, his masterly handling
of the cases — all of this gave him pleasure, and, along with chitchat
with colleagues, dinners and whist, filled his life to the full. And so,
life in general proceeded for Ivan Ilyich just as he thought it should
proceed — pleasantly and respectably.</p>
<p>He lived like this for about seven years. Their daughter, the eldest
child, was now sixteen, another child had died and their one remaining
son was the subject of strong disagreement. Ivan Ilyich wanted to send
him to law school, but Praskovya had defied him by putting him down for
the high school. The daughter was being educated at home, and was
developing nicely; the boy too was doing quite well at his studies.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>This was the course that Ivan Ilyich’s life had taken during the
seventeen years that followed his wedding. He was now a senior public
prosecutor who had turned down several transfers in the hope of securing
an even more desirable position, but then suddenly an unpleasant
circumstance arose which looked like completely disrupting the peaceful
progress of his life. Ivan Ilyich was expecting an appointment as
presiding judge in a university town, but Hoppe pipped him at the post
and got the job. Ivan Ilyich was livid, and he made some insinuations,
taking issue with Hoppe himself and his immediate superiors. He was met
with a chill rebuff, and was overlooked again when the next appointment
came up.</p>
<p>This was in 1880. That year was the hardest he ever lived through. It
was a year in which it transpired, for one thing, that they couldn’t
make ends meet financially, and, for another, that he was a forgotten
man and, whereas he saw himself as the victim of an outrageously cruel
injustice, everyone else thought it was just the way things went. Even
his father saw it as no duty of his to help out. He felt deserted by
everyone; they all thought that his situation, with a salary of three
thousand five hundred roubles, was perfectly normal, even fortunate. He
was the only person who knew that, with all the injustices that had been
visited upon him, with nothing but nagging from his wife, and the debts
that were now mounting up because he was living beyond his means — he
was the only one who knew that his position was anything but normal.</p>
<p>That summer, in order to cut costs, he took leave of absence and went
with his wife for a country holiday at her brother’s place. In the
country, with no work to occupy him, Ivan Ilyich had his first
experience of not just boredom but unbearable anguish. He decided he
couldn’t go on like this — definite steps must be taken.</p>
<p>During a sleepless night, the whole of which he spent pacing the
terrace, he decided he would go to Petersburg and make representations;
he would get his own back on those men who had underestimated him, by
changing ministries. Next morning he defied all the remonstrations from
his wife and brother-in-law, and left for Petersburg.</p>
<p>He went with one aim in mind: to get himself a position that would
bring in five thousand a year. By now he had no allegiance to any
particular ministry, faction or function. All he needed was a job, a job
that would bring in five thousand a year, in administration, in one of
the banks, with the railways, in one of the charitable institutions set
up by the Dowager Empress Maria,5 even in the customs service; all that
mattered was five thousand a year and an immediate transfer from the
ministry where he was so undervalued.</p>
<p>And his trip was crowned with unexpected, unbelievable success. At
Kursk, an acquaintance of his, F. S. Ilyin, got into his first-class
carriage, sat down and told him that the governor of the province had
just received a telegram informing him of a reshuffle in the ministry —
Pyotr Ivanovich was being replaced by Ivan Semyonovich.</p>
<p>The proposed reshuffle, whatever its impact on Russia at large, meant
something special to Ivan Ilyich: the emergence of Pyotr Petrovich, and
also apparently his friend, Zakhar Ivanovich, was very good news for
him. Zakhar Ivanovich was a colleague and friend.</p>
<p>The new development had been confirmed in Moscow; now, arriving in
Petersburg, Ivan Ilyich looked up Zakhar, who promised him a definite
position in his former department, the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>Within a week he was able to send the following telegram to his wife:
Zakhar replaces Miller. Appointment mine with first report.</p>
<p>Because of this change of staff Ivan Ilyich had suddenly achieved a
position in his former ministry which put him two grades higher than his
colleagues, with five thousand a year plus three thousand five hundred
roubles removal expenses. All the acrimony that he had felt towards his
enemies and the ministry in general was forgotten, and Ivan Ilyich was a
happy man.</p>
<p>He returned to the country feeling in high spirits, more contented
than he had been for a long time. Praskovya’s spirits had also picked
up, and a truce was declared between the two of them. Ivan Ilyich
described how honoured he had been in Petersburg, how his former enemies
had been put to shame and were now licking his boots, how people envied
him his new position, and, most of all, how popular he had been in
Petersburg.</p>
<p>Praskovya listened to all of this, pretending to believe it and not
querying anything, but her real interest was only in sketching out the
new way of life that they would lead in the city to which they were
moving. And Ivan Ilyich was delighted to see that her plans were his
plans, they were together as one, and that his life, having hit a bad
patch, was now getting back to its old way, its true path of happy
enjoyment and respectability.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich had not come back for long. He had to take up his duties
on the 10th of September, and before that he had to settle into new
surroundings, have all his things brought in from the provinces, buy in
and order up many more items - in other words he had set up home just as
he had worked things out in his own mind, which was almost exactly as
Praskovya had worked things out in her own heart.</p>
<p>And now that everything had been set up so successfully, and he and
his wife were agreed in their aims, having lived together so little of
late, they came together more closely than at any time since they were
first married. Ivan Ilyich had intended to move his family in
straightaway, but at the insistence of his sister-in-law and
brother-in-law, who were suddenly all over Ivan Ilyich and his family,
it was arranged for him to go on alone.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich set out on his journey. The happy feelings brought on by
his success and a rapprochement with his wife, each intensifying the
other, never left him. He found a delightful place, a dream apartment
for him and his wife. The spacious, high-ceilinged reception rooms with
their old-fashioned decor, the gracefully appointed and comfortable
study, the rooms for his wife and daughter, the classroom for his son -
all of it seemed to have been designed with them in mind. Ivan Ilyich
took it upon himself to organize the fittings and furnishings; he chose
the wallpaper, purchased furniture, predominantly of the old-fashioned
style which he considered to be comme il faut, the upholstery… and the
whole thing grew and grew, approaching the ideal that he had set
himself. Even halfway through the refurbishment, the whole thing
exceeded his expectations. He could see how elegant it would all be,
quite comme il faut and devoid of vulgarity, when it was completed. As
he went to sleep he would imagine what the large reception room was
going to look like. When he glanced into the half-finished drawing-room
he could envisage the fireplace, the screen, the whatnot and the little
chairs dotted about the room, the plates and dishes on the walls and the
bronze pieces, everything in its proper place. He enjoyed the thought of
surprising Pasha and Lizanka,6 who were not without taste themselves.
This was beyond their expectations. He had been particularly successful
in tracking down antiques and buying them at bargain prices; they now
gave the whole place an air of distinction. He deliberately understated
everything in his letters home so that they would be surprised. He was
so taken up with all of this that the work he loved so dearly interested
him less than he had thought it would. In court he found his mind
wandering; he would be miles away, wondering whether to have plain or
moulded cornices with his curtains. He became so involved that he often
did the work himself, rearranging the furniture and rehanging the
curtains. On one occasion, climbing a stepladder to show a dull-witted
upholsterer how to hang the draperies, he slipped and fell, though he
was strong and agile enough to hold on, and all he did was bump his side
on a window-frame knob. The bruised place hurt for a while but it soon
passed off. And all this time Ivan Ilyich felt particularly well and in
the best of spirits. ‘I seem to have shed fifteen years,’ he wrote home.
He had hoped to get it all finished by the end of September, but things
dragged on until mid-October. Still, it was magnificent, and he wasn’t
the only one to say so - everybody did.</p>
<p>But these were essentially the accoutrements that appeal to all
people who are not actually rich but who want to look rich, though all
they manage to do is look like each other: damasks, ebony, plants, rugs
and bronzes, anything dark and gleaming - everything that all people of
a certain class affect so as to be like all other people of a certain
class. And his arrangements looked so much like everyone else’s that
they were unremarkable, though he saw them as something truly
distinctive. When he met his family at the railway station, brought them
home and ushered them into his well-lit furnished apartment and a
footman wearing a white tie opened the door into the entrance hall
decorated with flowers, and then they went into the drawing-room and the
study, ooh-ing and ah-ing with delight, he was a very happy man, showing
them around everywhere, revelling in their praise and beaming with
delight. That evening, as they took tea, when Praskovya asked him
casually about his fall he gave a laugh and demonstrated how he had gone
flying and given the upholsterer a scare.</p>
<p>‘It’s a good job I’m athletic. Any other man would have killed
himself, but all I did was bruise myself a bit here. It hurts when you
touch it, but it’s getting better. It is only a bruise.’</p>
<p>And so they began life in their new abode, where, as always happens
with people who have recently settled in, they found themselves just one
room short, and their new income wouldn’t quite run to it, though it was
only a matter of five hundred roubles or so. Still, they were very
nicely off, especially during the early days when not everything was
finished and work was still to be done - things had to be bought,
ordered, rearranged, adjusted. There were one or two disagreements
between husband and wife, but both of them were so satisfied and so busy
that everything resolved itself without serious arguments. When there
was nothing more to be finished off they developed a feeling of dullness
and a sense of something missing, but by this time they had got to know
new people and formed new habits. Their lives had filled out.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich would return for lunch after a morning in court and in
those early days he tended to be in a good mood; any slight distress
that he suffered came from the apartment itself. (The slightest stain on
a tablecloth or upholstery, or a loose cord on the draperies annoyed
him; he had put so much effort into the furnishings that the slightest
disturbance upset him.) But, all things considered, Ivan Ilyich’s life
went along, as he saw it, just as life ought to go - easily, pleasantly,
decently. He rose at nine, drank some coffee, read the newspaper, then
put on his uniform and went to court. There, the collar that he worked
in had been worn into shape and he soon found that it fitted him well -
the petitioners, the enquiries received, the office, the public sessions
and the administrative meetings. In all of this the trick was to
eliminate the element of crude everyday life that always disrupts the
smooth flow of official business; no relationships should be entered
into beyond the official ones, the reason behind any relationship had to
be strictly official and the relationship itself had to be strictly
official. Say, for example, a person arrives wanting to know something.
This is not the responsibility of Ivan Ilyich; he can have no
relationship with such a person. But if this person were to approach him
in his capacity as a member of the judiciary and in a relationship that
can be set down on letterhead paper, within the terms of that
relationship Ivan Ilyich will do anything he can, and do it decisively,
while maintaining a semblance of friendly human relations - nothing more
than common courtesy. At the point where an official relationship breaks
off, everything else breaks off, too. The skill of compartmentalizing
the official side of things and keeping that apart from his own real
life was one that Ivan Ilyich possessed in the highest degree; long
practice and natural talent had enabled him to refine it to such a
degree that now he could act like a virtuoso performer, occasionally
allowing himself to mix human and official relationships by way of a
joke. He allowed himself this liberty because he felt strong enough
whenever necessary to reinstate the distinction between the official and
the human by discarding the latter. This was more than just an easy,
pleasant and decent thing for Ivan Ilyich to do - he was acting like a
virtuoso performer. During his breaks he would have a smoke, drink tea
and chat, exchange a word or two about politics, current affairs and
cards, and a whole lot more about who was in and who was out. And he
would go home tired, but feeling like a virtuoso performer, a first
violin in the orchestra, who has given of his best. At home his daughter
and his wife would either have been out visiting or would have
entertained someone at home, while his son, back from school, would have
had a session with his private tutors and gone on to cram whatever it is
they teach in schools. Everything was fine. After dinner, if there were
no guests, Ivan Ilyich sometimes read a book that people were talking
about, and later in the evening he sat down to do some work, reading
through papers, studying the law, comparing depositions and sorting them
by statute. This neither bored nor amused him. He found it boring when
he might have been playing whist, but if whist was off it was better
than just sitting there on his own or with his wife. What gave Ivan
Ilyich real pleasure, though, was having little dinner parties to which
he would invite ladies and gentlemen of good social standing and passing
the time with them precisely as such people invariably do pass the time,
in the way that his drawing-room was exactly like all the others.</p>
<p>One day they held an evening party with dancing. Ivan Ilyich enjoyed
it and everything went swimmingly, except for a big row between him and
his wife over the cakes and sweets. Praskovya had had her own ideas, but
Ivan Ilyich had insisted on bringing in an expensive caterer who had
provided too many cakes; the leftovers had caused the row when the
caterer’s bill came to forty-five roubles. The row was a big one, very
nasty, and it ended with Praskovya calling him a stupid fool while he
clutched his head and muttered something about divorce. But he still
enjoyed the party. The best people were there and Ivan Ilyich danced
with Princess Trufonova, whose sister had famously founded the charity
known as ‘Take Away My Sorrow’. Pleasure derived from work was
self-indulgence, pleasure derived from socializing tickled his vanity,
but real pleasure came to Ivan Ilyich only from playing cards. He was
prepared to admit that, at the end of the day, with any amount of
unpleasantness behind him, the one pleasure that outshone all others
like a beacon was to sit down and play whist with quiet-mannered
partners, good players, always in a foursome (sitting out was such a
bore when there were five, and you had to pretend not to mind), and
playing seriously and playing well (when you got a decent hand) before
going on to supper with a glass of wine. And after a game of cards,
especially if he had won a small amount (big winnings were not nice),
Ivan Ilyich would go to bed in the very best of spirits.</p>
<p>This was how they lived. They moved in the best of circles, receiving
people of quality, and the younger set.</p>
<p>In their attitude towards the circle of their acquaintances husband,
wife and daughter were of one mind. Without collusion, each of them in
the same way shrugged off and discarded all the shabby friends and
relatives who flocked around fawning on them in the drawing-room with
the Japanese plates on the walls. It wasn’t long before the shabby
friends stopped flocking around and left the Golovin family to the best
people in society and no one else. Young men were attracted to their
little Liza and one examining magistrate by the name of Petrishchev, the
son of Dmitriy Ivanovich Petrishchev and his sole heir, became so
attentive towards her that Ivan Ilyich mentioned this once or twice to
Praskovya and wondered whether they ought perhaps to take them out for a
ride in a troika or set up some private theatricals. This was how they
lived. This was how things went, nothing changed, and everything was
fine.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>They were all in good health. The fact that Ivan Ilyich sometimes
complained of a strange taste in his mouth and a funny feeling in his
left side didn’t count as ill health. But as it happened this funny
feeling began to get worse and turned into, if not pain exactly, a
constant dragging sensation in his side, which put him in a bad mood.
And this bad mood, which got worse and worse, began to spoil the
pleasant, easy-going and respectable way of life that the Golovins had
just set up for themselves. There were more and more quarrels between
husband and wife, the pleasant, easy-going way of life lapsed, and they
were hard put to keep up an appearance of decency. Once again scenes
became more and more frequent. They were left once again with nothing
more than those little islands, all too few of them, on which husband
and wife could come together without an explosion.</p>
<p>And now Praskovya began to say, not without justification, that her
husband was a hard man. With her usual capacity for exaggeration she
claimed that he had always been horrible like that and only her good
nature had enabled her to put up with it for twenty years. It was true
that all the arguments now began on his side. His jibes always started
just as they sat down to dinner, often over the soup. There was always
something - if it wasn’t chipped crockery or something wrong with the
food, he would go on about his son putting his elbow on the table or his
daughter’s hair. And it was always Praskovya’s fault. To begin with,
Praskovya would take issue with him and say something nasty, but on a
couple of occasions he flew into such a rage at the beginning of dinner
that she realized this was a pathological condition brought on by
consuming food, so she bit it all back, stopped objecting and got on
with her dinner as fast as she could. Praskovya took great pride in
biting things back. Convinced that her husband was a horrible man who
had made her life a misery, she was now sorry for herself. And the
sorrier she became, the more she hated her husband. She began to wish he
was dead, and then not to, because without him there would be no income.
All of which made her even more exasperated with him. She felt
thoroughly miserable at the thought that not even his death could rescue
her. She was exasperated, though she hid it, but her hidden exasperation
served only to strengthen his exasperation.</p>
<p>After one scene during which Ivan Ilyich had been particularly unfair
and after which, by way of explanation, he had admitted being
exasperating but claimed he was ill, she told him that if he was ill he
needed treatment and insisted that he must go and see a famous
doctor.</p>
<p>He did. The whole thing turned out just as he had expected, and as it
always does. He was made to wait, the doctor was full of his own
importance - an attitude he was familiar with because it was one that he
himself assumed in court - then came all the tapping and listening, the
questions with predetermined and obviously superfluous answers, the
knowing look that seemed to say, ‘Just place yourself in our hands and
we’ll sort it out, we know what we’re doing, there’s no doubt about it,
we can sort things out the same way as we would for anyone you care to
name.’ It was just like being in court. The way he looked at the accused
in court was exactly the way he was being looked at now by the famous
doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor was holding forth. Such-and-such demonstrates that in your
inside there is such-and-such, but if this is not confirmed by our tests
on this-and-that then you will need to go on to such-and-such. And if
you go on to such-and-such, then… and so on. As far as Ivan Ilyich was
concerned there was only one question that mattered: Is this condition
life-threatening or not? But the doctor treated this question as
irrelevant, and ignored it. From the doctor’s point of view it was a
pointless question not worthy of discussion; the only thing was a
balancing of probabilities - floating kidney, chronic colitis, problem
with the blind gut.7 The question of Ivan Ilyich living or dying didn’t
arise; there was just this conflict between the floating kidney and the
blind gut. And before his very eyes the doctor resolved the conflict at
a brilliant stroke in favour of the floating kidney, with the sole
proviso that new evidence might emerge from the urine test, and if that
happened the case would have to be reviewed. All of it from start to
finish was precisely what Ivan Ilyich himself had done to the accused a
thousand times and with no less brilliance. Brilliant indeed was the
doctor’s summing-up of the situation as he looked in triumph bordering
on delight over his glasses at his own prisoner in the dock. From the
summary Ivan Ilyich drew only one conclusion: he was in a bad way and
the doctor didn’t care, nobody cared probably, but he was in a bad way.
And this conclusion left Ivan Ilyich with a sickly feeling, filling him
with self-pity and great animosity towards the doctor who showed so much
indifference to such an important question.</p>
<p>But he said nothing about it. He got up, laid his money on the table
and said, with a sigh, ‘I’m sure that when we’re ill we ask a lot of
pointless questions. But, er, is it life-threatening or not…?’</p>
<p>The doctor glared at him through one eye over his glasses as if to
say, ‘Prisoner in the dock, if you will not confine yourself to
answering the questions put to you I shall have to arrange for you to be
removed from the courtroom.’</p>
<p>‘I have already told you what I consider necessary and appropriate.
Anything further will be determined by the tests.’ The doctor bowed.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich walked out slowly, climbed gloomily into his sledge and
drove home. All the way back he kept going over in his mind everything
the doctor had said, trying to translate his confusingly complex
technicalities into everyday speech and find in them an answer to one
question: am I in a bad way, a really bad way, or is it nothing to worry
about just now? And it seemed to him that the message from all that the
doctor had said was yes, you’re in a very bad way. Ivan Ilyich thought
the streets looked dismal. The drivers looked dismal, the houses looked
dismal, and so did the pedestrians and the shops. And in the light of
the doctor’s confusing pronouncements the pain, that dull, nagging pain
that never went away, was taking on a new and more serious significance.
It was with a new feeling of dejection that Ivan Ilyich focused on
it.</p>
<p>He reached home and started to tell his wife. His wife listened
closely, but halfway through his account their daughter came in wearing
a little hat - she and her mother were on their way out. She made an
effort to sit down and listen to his boring story, but she couldn’t
contain herself for long and her mother gave up listening.</p>
<p>‘Well, I’m very pleased,’ said his wife. ‘And now, you listen to me.
Make sure you take your medicine properly. Give me the prescription and
I’ll send Gerasim to the chemist’s.’ And she went off to get
dressed.</p>
<p>He had hardly paused for breath while she was in the room, and when
she went out he gave a deep sigh.</p>
<p>‘Oh well,’ he said. ‘Maybe that’s right. Nothing to worry about just
now …’</p>
<p>He started taking his medicine and following the doctor’s
instructions, though these were changed once the urine test results were
in. But at this point it turned out that there was some confusion over
the test itself and what was supposed to follow it. Without getting at
the doctor, it was becoming clear that what was going on was not what
the doctor had said. He must have overlooked something, or he had been
telling lies, or he was hiding something.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ivan Ilyich started to follow his instructions, and
from the process of doing so he derived some comfort for a while. Since
his visit to the doctor Ivan Ilyich had made it his main preoccupation
to follow all instructions to the letter in matters of hygiene, the
taking of medicine, focusing on his pain and monitoring all his bodily
functions. His main interests were in human sickness and human health.
When he overheard anyone talking about people who had fallen ill, died
or recovered, especially if the illness sounded like his own, he tried
to hide his agitation but he listened closely, asked lots of questions
and applied what he heard to his own illness.</p>
<p>The pain was not getting any less, but Ivan Ilyich made every effort
to make himself believe he was feeling better. And he was able to delude
himself as long as nothing upset him. But the moment he fell out with
his wife, or something went wrong at work or he got a bad hand at whist,
he felt the full force of his illness. Before this he had been able to
withstand setbacks like these, expecting to put things right before
long, to win through, succeed again, come out with a grand slam. But now
the slightest setback cut the ground from under him and left him in
despair. He would say to himself, ‘Look at that. I was just starting to
get better and the medicine was just beginning to work, and now this
damn thing comes up, this rotten luck…’ And he raged against his
misfortune or against those people who were causing his problems and
killing him off; he sensed that it was his own rage that was killing him
and he couldn’t control it. It ought to have been obvious to him that
raging against his situation and the people around him was only feeding
his illness and, because of that, he ought to ignore any unpleasant
developments, but he thought the exact opposite: he told himself he
needed peace of mind so he had to get on to anything that disrupted his
peace of mind, and the slightest disruption left him exasperated. His
situation was made worse by the fact that he had taken to reading
medical books and consulting doctors. The decline was so gradual that he
was able to delude himself by comparing one day with another and seeing
little difference. But the moment he consulted a doctor he thought he
was going downhill, and fast. Yet, despite this, he kept on consulting
the doctors.</p>
<p>That month he went to see another celebrity. This celebrity told him
more or less the same as the first one, but put things differently. And
the consultation with this celebrity served only to reinforce Ivan
Ilyich’s doubts and fears. A friend of a friend - a very good doctor -
diagnosed something entirely different and, even though he swore he
would get better, his questions and assumptions confused Ivan Ilyich
even more and deepened his suspicions. A homeopath produced yet another
diagnosis and gave him some medicine, which Ivan Ilyich took for a week
or so without telling anyone. But by the end of the week, feeling no
better and losing faith in every treatment that had been prescribed so
far including that one, he felt more despondent than ever. One day a
lady of his acquaintance talked to him about the curative powers of
icons. Ivan Ilyich caught himself listening closely to what she was
saying, and beginning to accept it as fact. This scared him. ‘Am I
really going weak in the head?’ he wondered. ‘Nonsense. It’s all
rubbish! I’m not falling for stupid ideas like that. I’d rather pick one
doctor and stick to what he says. That’s what I’m going to do. That’s
it. I’m going to stop thinking about it, and follow the treatment to the
letter until the summer. Then we’ll see. No more shilly-shallying.’ This
was easy to say but impossible to do. The pain in his side went on
wearing him down and seemed to be getting worse, nagging incessantly,
while the taste in his mouth got more and more peculiar and he began to
think that his breath smelt awful, and his appetite and strength fell
away. The time for fooling himself was over: something new and dreadful
was going on inside Ivan Ilyich, something significant, more significant
than anything in his whole life. And he was the only one who knew it;
the people around him didn’t know, or didn’t want to know - they thought
that everything in the world was going on as before. This was what
tormented Ivan Ilyich more than anything. He could see that his family -
especially his wife and daughter, whose visiting season was in full
swing - had no inkling; it annoyed them that he was not much fun and
asked so much of them - as if he was to blame. Despite their best
efforts to hide it, he could see that he was in their way. His wife had
developed an attitude to his illness and she was sticking to it whatever
he might say or do. Her attitude went like this: ‘You know what it’s
like,’ she would say to her friends. ‘Ivan Ilyich can’t be like other
people. He won’t stick to his treatment. One moment he takes his drops
and eats what he’s supposed to, and goes to bed when he should; the next
day, if I’m not watching him, he doesn’t take his medicine, he eats
sturgeon - which he’s not allowed - and he stays up playing whist until
one in the morning.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, come on,’ says Ivan Ilyich. ‘I did that once, with Pyotr
Ivanovich.’</p>
<p>‘What about yesterday, with Shebek?’</p>
<p>‘It made no difference. I couldn’t sleep with all that pain …’</p>
<p>‘Well, it doesn’t matter why. Only you’ll never get better like that,
and it’s getting us down.’</p>
<p>Praskovya’s attitude towards Ivan Ilyich’s illness, of which she made
no secret to other people or to him, was that it was all his fault; he
was making his wife’s life a misery yet again. Ivan Ilyich felt she was
doing this unconsciously, but that didn’t make things any easier for
him.</p>
<p>In court Ivan Ilyich noticed, or thought he noticed, the same strange
attitude towards him. There were times when he thought people were
watching him closely like a man who was about to give up his job; at
other times his associates would make friendly little jokes about the
way he worried over his health, as if this ghastly, fearful, unheard-of
thing that had got going inside him and was now incessantly gnawing at
him and inexorably taking him away was a good subject and a laughing
matter. The one who infuriated him most was Schwartz, with his
playfulness, joie de vivre and all-round respectability which recalled
the Ivan Ilyich of ten years before.</p>
<p>His friends have come round for a game of cards. They take their
places and deal, softening the new cards. He sorts his diamonds - seven
of them. His partner bids no trumps and supports him with two diamonds.
Couldn’t be better. This should be a wonderful, joyous moment - a grand
slam is on. But suddenly he feels that gnawing pain, that taste in his
mouth, and he is struck by the barbarity of rejoicing in a grand
slam.</p>
<p>He glances across at his partner, Mikhail Mikhaylovich, who is
tapping the table with an eager hand, politely and graciously holding
back from grabbing the tricks and pushing them towards Ivan Ilyich so
that he can enjoy the pleasure of raking them in without having to make
any effort or reaching very far. ‘Does he think I’m too weak to reach
out?’ thinks Ivan Ilyich, forgetting what are trumps and overtrumping
his partner with his own, which leaves them three tricks short of a
grand slam. And worst of all, he can see how upset Mikhail Mikhaylovich
is, and he doesn’t care. And it is awful to think why he doesn’t
care.</p>
<p>They can all see that he is distraught, and they say to him, ‘We can
stop if you’re feeling tired. Why don’t you have a rest?’ Rest? No, he’s
not tired. They finish the rubber. They are all gloomy and silent. Ivan
Ilyich senses that he has caused the gloom, and he cannot dispel it.
They have supper and go home, and Ivan Ilyich is left there alone with
the knowledge that his life has been poisoned and is poisoning other
people’s lives, and the poison is not wearing off, it is working its way
deeper and deeper into his very being.</p>
<p>And he has to take this knowledge to bed with him, along with the
physical pain and the terror, often to spend a near-sleepless night
because of the pain. And next morning he has to get up again, put on his
clothes, go to court, talk, write or, if he doesn’t go out, stay in with
every one of those twenty-four hours that make up a day and a night,
each one of them an agony. And he has to live like this on the edge of
destruction, alone, with nobody at all to understand and pity him.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>One month passed like this, then another. His brother-in-law came to
their town to stay with them for the New Year celebrations. Ivan Ilyich
was in court when he arrived. Praskovya was out shopping. On his return
Ivan Ilyich walked into his study and found his brother-in-law already
there, a strong, fit young man, busy unpacking his own suitcase. He
looked up when he heard Ivan Ilyich approaching and stared at him in
silence for a moment. That stare told Ivan Ilyich everything. His
brother-in-law opened his mouth to exclaim, but managed to restrain
himself. That movement confirmed everything.</p>
<p>‘I’ve changed, haven’t I?’</p>
<p>‘Well… you have rather.’</p>
<p>And after this, however hard Ivan Ilyich tried to raise the subject
of his appearance, his brother-in-law wouldn’t say a word. Praskovya
arrived home and her brother went to see her. Ivan Ilyich locked the
door and went to have a good look at himself in the mirror, full face,
then in profile. He picked up a photograph of himself with his wife and
compared his likeness with what he now saw in the mirror. The difference
was enormous. Then he pulled his sleeves up, looked at his arms, pulled
his sleeves back down and sat down on an ottoman, looking blacker than
night.</p>
<p>‘No, no. I mustn’t,’ he told himself. He jumped up and went to his
desk, where he opened a file and began to read, but he couldn’t go on.
He opened the door and went out into the hallway. The door into the
drawing-room was shut. He tiptoed over to it and started to listen.</p>
<p>‘No, you’re exaggerating,’ Praskovya was saying.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean, exaggerating? You can’t see it. He’s a dead man.
Look at his eyes - there’s no light in them. What is it he’s got
exactly?’</p>
<p>‘Nobody knows. Nikolayev [yet another doctor] said something, but I
don’t know what it was. Leshchetitsky [the celebrity] said the exact
opposite …’</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich walked away back into his room, lay down and started to
think things over. ‘Kidney, a floating kidney …’ He could remember
everything the doctors had told him about it becoming detached and
starting to wander. With an effort of his imagination he tried to catch
the kidney, stop it moving and fix it strongly. It seemed to take so
little effort. ‘No, I’m going back to Pyotr Ivanovich [the friend who
was the doctor’s friend].’ He rang the bell, ordered the carriage and
prepared to go out.</p>
<p>‘Jean,8where are you going?’ asked his wife, looking very gloomy but
uncharacteristically kind.</p>
<p>The uncharacteristic kindness infuriated him. He gave her a dark
look. ‘I’ve got to go and see Pyotr Ivanovich.’</p>
<p>He went to see the friend with the friend who was the doctor, and on
with him to the doctor himself, who was in. They had a long talk.</p>
<p>Going through the details of anatomy and physiology in terms of what
the doctor considered to be happening in his insides made everything
quite clear to him.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of something, a tiny little thing, in his
blind gut. It could all be put right. By raising the energy level in one
organ and lowering the activity of another, absorption could be achieved
and everything would be all right. He was a little late for dinner. He
talked cheerfully after dinner, but for some time he couldn’t bring
himself to go to his room and work. Eventually he did go off to his
study and he got straight down to it. He worked at the files for a
while, but he couldn’t shrug off the awareness that he had some
important unfinished personal business that would have to be attended to
in the end. When he had finished the files he remembered that this
personal business meant thinking about his gut. But instead of giving in
to this he went to take tea in the drawing-room. They had guests - there
was conversation, piano-playing and singing - and among them was the
examining magistrate who was such a good match for his daughter. As
Praskovya remarked, he enjoyed the evening more than usual, but never
for a minute did he forget that he had some important unfinished
thinking to do, about his gut. At eleven o‘clock he said goodnight and
went to his room. He had been sleeping alone since his illness began, in
a tiny little room next to his study. He went in, undressed and took up
a Zola novel, but instead of reading it he lapsed into thought. And in
his imagination the longed-for healing of his blind gut took place;
absorption was followed by evacuation and its proper function was
restored. ‘Yes, that’s how it goes,’ he said to himself. ‘All you have
to do is give nature a helping hand.’ He remembered his medicine, eased
himself up and took it, then lay on his back focusing on the good that
the medicine was doing and the way it was getting rid of the pain. ‘Keep
taking it regularly and avoid anything harmful. I feel a bit better
already, a lot better.’ He felt his side - no pain to the touch. ‘No,
there’s no feeling there. It really is getting a lot better.’ He put out
the candle and lay on his side …</p>
<p>Absorption; the blind gut was curing itself. Then suddenly he could
feel the same old dull gnawing pain, quiet, serious, unrelenting. The
same nasty taste in his mouth. His heart sank and his head swam. ‘O God!
O God!’ he muttered. ‘It’s here again, and it’s not going away.’ And
suddenly he saw things from a completely different angle. ‘The blind
gut! The kidney!’ he said to himself. ‘It’s got nothing to do with the
blind gut or the kidney. It’s a matter of living or … dying. Yes, I have
been alive, and now my life is steadily going away and I can’t stop it.
No. There’s no point in fooling myself. Can’t they all see - everybody
but me - that I’m dying? It’s only a matter of weeks, or days - maybe
any minute now. There has been daylight; now there is darkness. I have
been here; now I’m going there. Where?’ A cold shiver ran over him; he
stopped breathing. He could hear nothing but the beating of his
heart.</p>
<p>‘When I’m dead, what happens then? Nothing happens. So where shall I
be when I’m no longer here? Is this really death? No, I won’t have it!’
He jumped up, tried to light the candle, fumbling with trembling hands,
dropped the candle and the stick on the floor and flopped back down on
to his pillow. ‘Why bother? It doesn’t make any difference,’ he said to
himself, staring into the darkness with his eyes wide open. ‘Death. Yes,
it’s death. And not one of them knows, or wants to know. They have no
pity for me. Too busy playing.’ (Through the door he could hear the
distant sounds of a singing voice and the accompaniment.) ‘They don’t
care, but they’re going to die, too. Fools! Me first, then them, but
they’ve got it coming to them. And they’re enjoying themselves!
Animals!’ He was choking with spite. And he felt a wave of agonizing,
unbearable misery. It surely wasn’t possible that everybody everywhere
should be condemned to this awful horror. He sat up.</p>
<p>‘Something’s not right. I’ve got to calm down and think it through
from the beginning.’ And he began to think. ‘Yes, the beginning of the
illness. I banged my side, but I felt just the same that day and the
next. A bit of discomfort, then a bit more, then doctors, depression,
worry, more doctors, and all the time I was getting nearer and nearer to
the edge. Less and less strength. Nearer and nearer. And I’ve been
wasting away. No light in my eyes. Death is here, and I’ve been worrying
about my gut. Worrying about getting my gut better, and this is death.
Is it really death?’</p>
<p>Horror swept over him again, he gasped for breath, bent over and
groped for the matches, leaning with one elbow on the bedside table. It
was in his way, hurting him; he lost his temper with it, pressing down
on it even harder in exasperation, and knocked it over. Breathless and
in despair, he flopped down on to his back, expecting to die at any
moment.</p>
<p>By this time the guests were leaving. Praskovya was seeing them out.
She heard something fall, and came in.</p>
<p>‘What’s the matter?’</p>
<p>‘Nothing. I just dropped something.’</p>
<p>She went out and came back with a candle. He lay there, puffing and
panting heavily like a man who has just run a mile. His eyes settled on
her.</p>
<p>‘What’s the matter, Jean?’</p>
<p>‘No-thing. I … dropped it.’ (‘No use talking to her. She won’t
understand,’ he thought.)</p>
<p>And she didn’t. She picked up the candle and lit it for him, then she
hurried out of the room to say goodnight to another guest.</p>
<p>When she came back he was still lying there on his back, staring
upwards.</p>
<p>‘What’s wrong? Are you feeling worse?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>She shook her head and sat down.</p>
<p>‘Listen, Jean. I think perhaps we ought to ask Leshchetitsky to visit
you at home.’</p>
<p>This meant asking the celebrated doctor to come to them, whatever the
expense. He gave her a vitriolic smile and said no. She sat there for a
while, then came over and kissed him on the forehead.</p>
<p>He hated her with every fibre of his being while she was kissing him,
and it took all his strength not to push her away.</p>
<p>‘Goodnight. God willing, you’ll soon go to sleep.’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich could see that he was dying, and he was in constant
despair.</p>
<p>In the depths of his soul Ivan Ilyich knew he was dying but, not only
could he not get used to the idea, he didn’t understand it, couldn’t
understand it at all.</p>
<p>All his life the syllogism he had learned from Kiesewetter’s logic9 -
Julius Caesar is a man, men are mortal, therefore Caesar is mortal - had
always seemed to him to be true only when it applied to Caesar,
certainly not to him. There was Caesar the man, and man in general, and
it was fair enough for them, but he wasn’t Caesar the man and he wasn’t
man in general, he had always been a special being, totally different
from all others, he had been Vanya with his mama and his papa, with
Vitya and Volodya, with his toys, and the carriage-driver, then little
Katya,10 with all the delights, sorrows and rapture of childhood,
boyhood and youth. Did Caesar have anything to do with the smell of that
little striped leather ball that Vanya had loved so much? Was it Caesar
who had kissed his mother’s hand like that, and was it for Caesar that
the silken folds of his mother’s dress had rustled the way they did? Was
he the one who had rebelled at law school over the provision of snacks?
Had Caesar been in love like him? Could Caesar chair a session like
him?</p>
<p>Yes, Caesar is mortal and it’s all right for him to die, but not me,
Vanya, Ivan Ilyich, with all my feelings and thoughts - it’s different
for me. It can’t be me having to die. That would be too horrible.</p>
<p>These were the feelings that came to him.</p>
<p>‘If I had to be like Caesar and die, I would have been aware of it,
an inner voice would have told me, but there hasn’t been anything like
that on the inside. I’ve always thought - and all my friends have, too -
that we’re not the same as Caesar. And now look what’s happened!’ he
said to himself. ‘It can’t be. It can’t be, but it is. How can it be?
What’s it all about?’</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand, and he tried to banish the idea - it was
false, wrong and morbid - and replace it with proper, healthy thinking.
But the same thought - it wasn’t just a thought but something that
seemed like reality - kept coming back and facing him.</p>
<p>And in order to dispel these thoughts he started calling up different
thoughts one after another, hoping to get support from them. He tried to
get back to his earlier ways of thinking which had once protected him
from thinking about death. But, strange to say, everything that once had
protected him by hiding and eliminating any awareness of death was
unable to perform that function now. In these latter days Ivan Ilyich
spent most of his time trying to get back to the earlier ways of feeling
that had protected him from death. He would say to himself, ‘I must get
down to some work. When all’s said and done it’s what I’ve been living
for.’ And he would go off to court banishing all his doubts, get into
conversation with his colleagues and casually take his seat as he had
done so many times before, contemplating the crowd before him with a
pensive air and resting his wasted hands on the oaken arms of his chair,
leaning over in his usual way to exchange whispered words with a
colleague while toying with a file before raising his eyes suddenly and
sitting up straight in order to go through the familiar words and begin
the proceedings. But then suddenly there it was, the pain in his side,
irrespective of where they had got to in the proceedings, and it was
beginning to gnaw at him. Ivan Ilyich focused on it, drove the thought
of it away, but it continued to make itself felt. It kept coming back,
facing him and looking at him, while he sat there rigid, the fire went
out of his eyes and he began to wonder whether It was the only truth.
And his colleagues and subordinates looked on in distress, amazed that
he, a man of such brilliant and subtle judgement, was getting confused
and making mistakes. He would pull himself together, try to bring
himself round and somehow bring the session to a conclusion, only to
return home sadly aware that his judicial work could no longer hide him,
as it once had done, from what he wanted to conceal, that he could not
use his judicial work to rid himself of It. And the worst thing was that
It was distracting him not in order to make him do something but only to
get him to look It straight in the eye, just look at It and do nothing
but suffer beyond words.</p>
<p>And in order to escape from this situation Ivan Ilyich sought other
forms of consolation, other ways of screening it off; other screens
appeared and for a while they seemed to be the saving of him, but
immediately they were not so much destroyed as shone right through; it
was as if It could penetrate anything, no defence being any good.</p>
<p>Sometimes in these latter days he would go into the drawing-room that
he had furnished - the very room where he had had his fall, the room
which (it was bitterly amusing to reflect) he had given his life to
furnish, because he knew his illness had started with that bruise - he
would go in and notice a scratch on a lacquered table top left behind by
something sharp. Looking for the cause he would find it in the
decorative bronzework on an album with one edge bent up. He would pick
up the album, an expensive one which he had compiled with loving care,
annoyed at the carelessness shown by his daughter and her friends - it
was torn in places and some of the photographs were upside down. He
would go to a lot of trouble sorting it out and bending the bronzework
back into place.</p>
<p>Then it would occur to him to move this entire établissement of
albums over into a corner near the flowers. He would call the footman.
Either his wife or his daughter would come to help. They wouldn’t agree,
they would take issue with him, he would argue and lose his temper - but
none of this mattered because he had stopped remembering It. It was
nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>But once, when he was moving something himself, his wife said, ‘Let
the servants do that. You’ll hurt yourself again,’ and suddenly It
flashed through the screen - he saw It. It flashed at him and, even as
he longed for It to disappear, he couldn’t help focusing on his side -
still there, the same ache that would not be ignored, and It was staring
straight at him from behind the flowers. What was it all about?</p>
<p>‘And that’s the truth of it - I’ve lost my life here on this curtain,
my battleground. Have I really? How horrible and how stupid! It can’t
be! It can’t be, but it is.’</p>
<p>He would go into his study, lie down and find himself alone again
with It. Face to face with It. Nothing to be done about It. Only stare
at It and go cold.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>How it came about in the third month of Ivan Ilyich’s illness no one
could have said, because it came on imperceptibly, by stages, but it
happened that all of them - his wife, and daughter, and son, and the
servants, and their friends, and the doctors, and most importantly he
himself - everybody knew that the only interesting thing about him now
was whether it would take him a long time to give up his place, finally
release the living from the oppression caused by his presence, and
himself be released from his suffering.</p>
<p>He slept less and less. He was given opium and injected with
morphine, but this brought no relief. To begin with, the dull feeling of
anguish which he experienced in his semi-conscious state gave him a
sense of relief simply by being something new, but then it became just
as agonizing as the raw pain, perhaps more so.</p>
<p>They gave him special food cooked from recipes provided by the
doctors, but the food became more and more tasteless, more and more
repulsive.</p>
<p>For the call of nature he also had special arrangements, and each
time it was agonizing. The agony came from the dirtiness, the
unseemliness, the smell and also the knowledge that someone else had to
be involved in it.</p>
<p>But this most unpleasant business brought one consolation to Ivan
Ilyich. The person who came to take things away was Gerasim, the peasant
servant who waited on them at table.</p>
<p>Gerasim was a clean, fresh peasant lad, always bright and cheerful,
who had fattened up on city food. To begin with, Ivan Ilyich was
embarrassed to watch him, always so neatly dressed in his Russian
costume, performing such a distasteful service.</p>
<p>One day as he got up from the chamber pot not strong enough to pull
up his own trousers he collapsed into a soft armchair and looked down in
horror at his bared puny thighs with their starkly protruding
muscles.</p>
<p>Who should come in but Gerasim, wearing his thick boots and exuding
both their nice tarry smell and that of the fresh winter air, Gerasim
with his light but firm tread, sporting a clean hessian apron and a
clean cotton shirt, with his sleeves rolled up his bare strong young
arms, and without a glance at Ivan Ilyich - to spare the sick man’s
feelings he was clearly suppressing the joyful vitality that shone from
his face - he walked over to the pot.</p>
<p>‘Gerasim,’ said Ivan Ilyich feebly.</p>
<p>Gerasim started, clearly worried that he might have done something
wrong, and in one swift movement he presented to the sick man his fresh,
kind, open young face which was showing the first traces of a beard.</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir?’</p>
<p>‘This is not very nice for you, is it? You’ll have to forgive me. I
can’t help it.’</p>
<p>‘Please don’t worry, sir.’ And Gerasim’s eyes flashed as he bared his
young white teeth. ‘It’s no trouble. You’re a sick man.’</p>
<p>And with his quick strong hands he did his usual thing and walked out
with a light step. And five minutes later with the same light step he
came back in.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich was still sitting there in his armchair.</p>
<p>‘Gerasim,’ he said, when the lad had replaced the clean, freshly
washed chamber pot, ‘would you mind helping me? Over here.’ Gerasim came
across. ‘Lift me up, please. I can’t manage it on my own, and I’ve sent
Dmitriy away.’</p>
<p>Gerasim came over. In one movement that was as easy as his way of
walking, he put his strong arms gently round Ivan Ilyich, lifted him up
and held him with one hand, pulled up his trousers with the other, and
tried to settle him down. But Ivan Ilyich asked to be taken across to
the sofa. Effortlesly and apparently without tightening his grip,
Gerasim took him, almost carried him, to the sofa and settled him down
there.</p>
<p>‘Thank you. You do everything so … nicely. So well.’</p>
<p>Gerasim gave another smile and made as if to leave the room. But Ivan
Ilyich felt so comfortable with him that he didn’t feel like letting him
go.</p>
<p>‘That’s better … Would you mind moving that chair over here? No, that
one. Under my legs. It feels easier when my legs are up high.’</p>
<p>Gerasim brought the chair over, set it squarely on the floor without
banging it down, and lifted Ivan Ilyich’s legs up on to it. Ivan Ilyich
felt an easing of the pain as Gerasim raised his legs.</p>
<p>‘I feel better when my legs are up,’ said Ivan Ilyich. ‘Would you put
that cushion under me?’</p>
<p>Gerasim did so. He raised his legs again and put the cushion under
them. Again Ivan Ilyich felt better when Gerasim was holding his legs.
When he lowered them he felt worse.</p>
<p>‘Gerasim,’ he asked, ‘are you busy just now?’</p>
<p>‘Not in the slightest, sir,’ said Gerasim, who had learned from the
townspeople how to speak to the masters.</p>
<p>‘What do you have on at the moment?’</p>
<p>‘What do I have on? I’ve done everything there is to do - except chop
the firewood for tomorrow.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I’d like you to hold my legs up. Would you mind?’</p>
<p>‘Of course not. I don’t mind.’ Gerasim held his legs up, and Ivan
Ilyich could have sworn that in this position he couldn’t feel any
pain.</p>
<p>‘But what about the firewood?’</p>
<p>‘Don’t you worry about that, sir. We’ll manage.’</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich told Gerasim to sit down and hold his legs up. He struck
up a conversation and, strangely enough, he seemed to feel better with
Gerasim holding his legs.</p>
<p>After that Ivan Ilyich would send for Gerasim now and then and have
his legs held up on his shoulders. He liked it when they talked to each
other. Gerasim did all of this easily, willingly and with a kindliness
that Ivan Ilyich found moving. Health, strength and vitality in all
other people were offensive to Ivan Ilyich; only Gerasim’s strength and
vitality gave him comfort rather than distressed him.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich’s worst torment was the lying - the lie, which was
somehow maintained by them all, that he wasn’t dying, he was only ill,
and all he had to do was keep calm and follow doctor’s orders and then
something good would emerge. Whereas he knew that, whatever was done to
him, nothing would emerge but more and more agony, suffering and death.
And this lie was torture for him - he was tortured by their
unwillingness to acknowledge what they all knew and he knew; they wanted
to lie to him about his terrible situation, and they wanted him - they
were compelling him - to be a party to this lie. All this lying to him,
lie upon lie, on the eve of his death, lying that was inexorably
reducing the solemn act of his death to the same level as their social
calls, their draperies, the sturgeon for dinner … it was all a terrible
torment for Ivan Ilyich. And strangely enough, on many occasions when
they were acting out this farce in front of him, he was within a hair’s
breadth of screaming at them, ‘Stop all this lying! You know and I know
that I’m dying, so the least you can do is stop lying to me.’ But he
never quite had the nerve to do it. He could see that the awful,
terrible act of his dying had been reduced by those around him to the
level of an unpleasant incident, something rather indecent (as if they
were dealing with someone who had come into the drawing-room and let off
a bad smell), and this was done by exploiting the very sense of
‘decency’ that he had been observing all his life. He could see that no
one had any pity for him because no one had the slightest desire to
understand his situation. Gerasim was the only one who did understand
his situation, and he was sorry for him. This was why Ivan Ilyich felt
comfortable only with Gerasim. It was a comfort to him when Gerasim,
sometimes for nights on end, held his legs up and refused to go to bed,
saying, ‘Please don’t worry about it, Ivan Ilyich. I’ll catch up on my
sleep.’ Or else he would suddenly address him in familiar language and
add, ‘It’d be different if you weren’t ill, but with things the way they
are why shouldn’t I help you out?’ Gerasim was the only one who didn’t
lie to him; everything showed that he was the only one who understood
what was going on and saw no need to hide it. He just felt sorry for his
weak and emaciated master. Once, when Ivan Ilyich was dismissing him, he
put it quite bluntly: ‘We’ve all got to die one day. Why shouldn’t I
give you a hand?’ This was to say there was a good reason for not making
a fuss about helping out: he was doing it for a dying man and he hoped
that when his time came someone would help him out in the same way.</p>
<p>Apart from all this lying, or perhaps because of it, the most
tormenting thing of all for Ivan Ilyich was the fact that no one showed
him any pity in the way that he wanted them to. There were some moments,
after long periods of suffering, when what Ivan Ilyich wanted more than
anything else - however embarrassed he would have been to admit it -
what he wanted was for someone to take pity on him as if he were a sick
child. He wanted to be kissed and cuddled and have a few tears shed over
him in the way that children are cuddled and comforted. He knew he was a
big man and something of a greybeard, which made this impossible, but
nevertheless that is what he wanted. And his relationship with Gerasim
offered something close to this, which was why the relationship with
Gerasim gave him comfort.</p>
<p>Here is Ivan Ilyich wanting to weep, wanting to be cuddled and have
tears shed over him, when in comes his colleague Shebek and, instead of
weeping and getting some tenderness, Ivan Ilyich puts on a solemn and
serious face, looks thoughtful and from sheer habit not only comments on
the significance of a decision handed down by the Court of Cassation,11
but goes on to defend it strongly.</p>
<p>It was this living a lie, all around him and within him, that did
most to poison the last days in the life of Ivan Ilyich.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>It was morning. It was morning only because Gerasim had gone and
Pyotr the servant was there, putting out the candles, opening one
curtain and quietly tidying up. Morning or evening, Friday or Sunday -
it didn’t matter, it was all the same - grinding, agonizing pain, never
for a moment relenting; an awareness of life hopelessly slipping away
but not yet gone; the same terrible, relentless approach of hateful
death, the only reality; and still all that lying. With all of this,
what did the days, weeks and hours matter?</p>
<p>‘Can I get you some tea, sir?’</p>
<p>‘He likes good order. The masters must have their tea in the
morning,’ he thought, but all he said was, ‘No.’</p>
<p>‘Would you care to move over to the sofa, sir?’</p>
<p>‘He wants to tidy the room, and I’m in the way. I am dirt and
disorder,’ he thought, but all he said was, ‘No. Leave me alone.’</p>
<p>The servant went about his work again. Ivan Ilyich stretched out one
hand. Pyotr came over ready to help.</p>
<p>‘What can I do for you, sir?’</p>
<p>‘My watch.’</p>
<p>Pyotr took the watch, which was lying nearby, and handed it over.</p>
<p>‘Half-past eight. Are they still in bed?’</p>
<p>‘No, sir, they’re not. Master Vasily [his son] has gone to school and
madam asked me to wake her if you wanted her. Shall I do that?’</p>
<p>‘No. Don’t bother.’ Ivan Ilyich wondered whether to try some tea.
Yes. ‘Bring me some tea.’</p>
<p>Pyotr moved towards the door. Ivan Ilyich felt terrified at the
thought of being left alone. How could he stop him leaving? Oh yes,
medicine. ‘Pyotr, would you give me my medicine?’ Well, why not? The
medicine might help. He took a spoonful and swallowed it. No, it
wouldn’t help. It was all rubbish. Just pretending. He felt sure of this
as the old familiar taste returned, sickly and beyond hope. No, his
faith was gone. And the pain, the pain, why couldn’t it ease up just for
a minute? He gave a groan. Pyotr came back in.</p>
<p>‘No, carry on. Get me some tea.’</p>
<p>Pyotr left the room. Ivan Ilyich groaned, not really from the pain,
however terrible that was, but from anguish. It was the same thing all
the time, day and night, with no end to it. Make it soon. Make what
soon? Death, darkness. No, no. Anything was better than death!</p>
<p>When Pyotr came back in with the tea tray Ivan Ilyich looked at him
distractedly for some time, unable to work out who he was or what he was
doing there. Pyotr was embarrassed by the long look. The embarrassment
brought Ivan Ilyich to his senses.</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Tea … Good. Leave it there. But I’d like you to help
me get washed and put a clean shirt on.’</p>
<p>And Ivan Ilyich began to wash himself. With pauses for rest he washed
his hands and face, cleaned his teeth, combed his hair and then took a
look in the mirror. He was horrified. The most horrible thing was the
limp way his hair stuck to his pallid forehead.</p>
<p>As he had his shirt changed he knew it would be more horrible still
to glance down at his body, so he looked away. At last it was done. He
put on his dressing-gown, wrapped a rug around himself and sat down in
the armchair with his tea. For one moment he felt refreshed, but at the
first drink of tea there it was again, the same taste, the same pain. He
forced the tea down, then lay back and stretched out his legs. He lay
down and told Pyotr he could go.</p>
<p>The same thing again. One glittering drop of hope followed by a
raging sea of despair, and nothing but pain, more pain, more anguish,
always the same thing. It was depressing to be left alone, and he felt
like calling somebody in, but he knew in advance that to have other
people there would be even worse. Oh, for another dose of morphine - he
might lose himself in that. He must tell that doctor to think of
something else. ‘I can’t go on like this. I can’t.’</p>
<p>An hour goes by like this, then another. The bell rings in the hall -
could it be the doctor? Yes, it is the doctor, fresh and cheerful,
fleshy and hearty, with a look on his face that seems to say, ‘Well now,
you seem to have had a bit of a fright, but we’ll soon sort you out.’
The doctor knows that this look is out of place here, but he has assumed
it once and for all and he can’t get rid of it any more than a man who
has gone out visiting can get rid of the frock-coat he put on that
morning.</p>
<p>The doctor rubs his hands cheerfully, reassuringly.</p>
<p>‘Chilly out there. Thick frost. Give me a minute to get warmed up.’
His manner of speaking implies that he won’t take long, he just needs to
warm up and once he is warmed up he’ll put everything right.</p>
<p>‘Right then. How are you feeling?’</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich senses that the doctor feels like saying, ‘How’s tricks?’
but even he can see that this won’t do, so he says, ‘What sort of night
did you have?’</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich fixes the doctor with a look that seems to ask whether
anything would ever make him feel too ashamed to go on lying. The doctor
does not wish to understand.</p>
<p>So Ivan Ilyich says, ‘No change. Terrible. The pain won’t go. It’s
there all the time. There must be something you can do!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, it’s normal for patients like you to say that sort of thing.
Right then. I think I’m warm enough now. Your good lady is a stickler
for these things, but even she wouldn’t say I was too cold. So. Good
morning to you …’ And the doctor shakes him by the hand.</p>
<p>And now, dropping all the banter, the doctor adopts a serious
attitude and begins to examine the patient - pulse, temperature, tapping
and listening.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich knows full well - it is beyond doubt - that this is all
nonsense, an empty sham, but when the doctor goes down on his knees,
reaches across him, applies his ear higher up and lower down, and then
with the gravest look on his face performs a selection of gymnastic
contortions, Ivan Ilyich accedes to this just as he once acceded to
speeches from lawyers even when he was well aware that they were lying,
and why they were lying.</p>
<p>The doctor is still kneeling on the sofa, busily tapping away, when
from the doorway comes the rustling of a silk dress and Praskovya can be
heard reproaching Pyotr for not letting her know the doctor has
arrived.</p>
<p>She comes in, kisses her husband and immediately begins to make it
clear that she has been up for some time and only a little
misunderstanding has prevented her from being there when the doctor
arrived.</p>
<p>Ivan Ilyich looks at her searchingly, resenting everything about her,
the whiteness, fullness and cleanliness of her arms and neck, the sheen
of her hair and the light in her eyes that are so full of life. He
loathes her with every fibre of his being. Physical contact with her is
agony for him because it brings on a surge of loathing.</p>
<p>Her attitude towards him and his illness is still the same. Just as
the doctor has worked out an attitude towards his patients which he
cannot now get rid of, she has worked out a particular attitude towards
him - he is failing to do something he ought to do, and it’s his fault,
and she lovingly reproaches him for it - and she has not been able to
rid herself of this attitude towards him.</p>
<p>‘He just won’t do as he’s told! He forgets to take his medicine. And
the worst thing is he will lie there in a position that must be bad for
him - with his legs up.’</p>
<p>She described how he got Gerasim to hold his legs up for him.</p>
<p>The doctor gave a sweetly condescending smile. ‘Can’t be helped,’ he
seemed to be saying. ‘These sick people do sometimes have silly ideas.
We can’t blame them.’</p>
<p>When the examination was over the doctor consulted his watch and then
Praskovya informed Ivan Ilyich that, like it or not, she had invited a
celebrated specialist to visit them that day and, along with Mikhail
Danilovich (the name of the regular doctor), he would conduct an
examination and consultation.</p>
<p>‘Now please don’t argue with me. I’m doing this for myself,’ she said
sarcastically, implying that she was doing it all for him and this alone
deprived him of any right to refuse. He scowled and said nothing. He
felt that the lies that enveloped him were now so messy that he could
hardly make sense of anything.</p>
<p>Everything she did for him she was doing for herself, and she told
him she was doing for herself what she was actually doing for herself,
but she made it sound so implausible that he was forced to assume the
opposite.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at half-past eleven, the celebrated specialist arrived.
More soundings and grave consultations both in his presence and in the
next room concerning the kidney and the blind gut, with questions and
answers expressed with such an air of gravity that, instead of the real
life-and-death question which was the only one staring him in the face,
up came the question of his kidney and blind gut, which were not doing
quite what they should and which would shortly be set upon by Mikhail
Danilovich and made to work properly.</p>
<p>The celebrated specialist took his leave looking serious but not
hopeless. And in answer to the question put to him diffidently by Ivan
Ilyich, whose eyes were glistening with fear and hope, as to whether
there was any possibility of recovery, he replied that nothing could be
guaranteed but there was a possibility. The look of hope on Ivan
Ilyich’s face as he watched the doctor leave was so pathetic that when
she saw it Praskovya actually burst into tears as she walked out of the
study to give the celebrated specialist his fee.</p>
<p>The lifting of his spirits induced by the doctor’s words of
encouragement was short-lived. It was still the same room, the same
pictures, curtains, wallpaper, medicine bottles, and the same body, his
body, still suffering, racked with pain. And Ivan Ilyich began to moan,
so they gave him an injection and he lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>When he came to, it was getting dark. They brought him his dinner. He
forced down a little thin soup, then it was the same again, with another
night coming on.</p>
<p>When dinner was over, at seven o’clock, Praskovya came in dressed for
going out, with her ample breasts well supported and traces of powder on
her face. That morning she had reminded him that they were going to the
theatre. Sarah Bernhardt 12 was in town, and they had a box which they
had taken at his insistence. By now he had forgotten this, and he was
offended to see her dressed up. But he hid his feelings when he
remembered having insisted that they reserve the box and go, this being
an aesthetic experience of educational value for the children.</p>
<p>As she came in Praskovya had looked pleased with herself, if rather
guilty. She sat down on the edge of a chair and asked how he was
feeling, though he could see that she was asking for the sake of asking
rather than to find out, since she knew there was nothing to find out,
and then she launched into what she felt she had to say, that nothing
would have induced her to go out tonight, but the box had been reserved,
Hélène and her daughter were going and so was Petrishchev (their
daughter’s fiancé, the examining magistrate), and they couldn’t be
allowed to go alone. But for that, she would have preferred to stay in
with him. And he must be sure to follow the doctor’s orders while she
was out.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, and Fyodor [the fiancé] would like to come in. Do you mind?
And Liza.’</p>
<p>‘Let them come in.’</p>
<p>In came his daughter, dressed up to the nines, an exposed young body
- while his body was causing him so much suffering. And she was
flaunting it. Healthy and strong, obviously in love, she had no time for
the illness, suffering and death that were marring her happiness.</p>
<p>In came Fyodor Petrovich, also in evening dress and sporting an à la
Capoul hairstyle.13The veins stood out on his long neck which was
squeezed into its tight collar over a vast expanse of white shirtfront,
and his narrow black trousers were tightly stretched over his strong
thighs. One of his hands wore a close-fitting white glove and he carried
an opera hat.</p>
<p>Creeping in unobtrusively behind him came the schoolboy, wearing a
new uniform and gloves, poor chap, with terrible dark blue rings under
his eyes, the meaning of which was not lost on Ivan Ilyich.</p>
<p>He had always felt sorry for his son. And his frightened,
compassionate look was dreadful to behold. Apart from Gerasim, Ivan
Ilyich thought, Vasya was the only one who understood and felt sorry for
him.</p>
<p>They all sat down and asked how he was feeling. Then for a while no
one spoke. Liza asked her mother whether she had the opera glasses.
Mother and daughter had a little argument about who had put them where.
It ended nastily.</p>
<p>Fyodor asked Ivan Ilyich whether he had ever seen Sarah Bernhardt. At
first Ivan Ilyich didn’t quite catch what the question was, but then he
said, ‘No. Have you?’</p>
<p>’Yes. In Adrienne Lecouvreur.’14</p>
<p>Praskovya mentioned something she had been particularly good in. Her
daughter demurred. They were off into a conversation about her charm and
naturalism as an actress, the same old conversation that everybody else
has.</p>
<p>In the midst of it Fyodor looked across at Ivan Ilyich and suddenly
broke off. The others looked, and they stopped, too. Ivan Ilyich was
staring straight ahead, his eyes glittering, and he was obviously
furious with them. Things had to be put right, but there was absolutely
no way of putting things right. Somehow the silence had to be broken. No
one made a move, and everyone was becoming terrified that the living lie
demanded by propriety would somehow be shattered and seen by everyone
for what it was. It was Liza who made the first move. She broke the
silence. She wanted to cover up what everyone was feeling, but by
speaking out she revealed it.</p>
<p>‘Oh well, if we’re going it’s time we got started,’ she said,
glancing at her watch, a present from her father, and she smiled almost
imperceptibly at her young man to convey something known only to the two
of them as she got up, rustling her skirts.</p>
<p>They all got up, took their leave and drove off.</p>
<p>When they had gone Ivan Ilyich seemed to feel easier; the lie had
gone, gone away with them - but the pain was still there. That same
pain, that same feeling of dread made sure that nothing was harder,
nothing easier. Everything was worse.</p>
<p>Once again the minutes passed one after another, then the hours one
after another; it was always the same, endlessly, and the inevitable end
itself was all the more horrible.</p>
<p>‘Yes, send Gerasim in,’ he said in reply to a question from
Pyotr.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>It was late at night when his wife returned. She tiptoed into the
room, but he heard her; he opened his eyes and rapidly closed them
again. She wanted to dismiss Gerasim and sit with him herself. He opened
his eyes and said, ‘No. You go.’</p>
<p>‘Are you in a lot of pain?’</p>
<p>‘It doesn’t matter.’</p>
<p>‘Take some opium.’</p>
<p>He consented, and drank some. She went away.</p>
<p>Until about three in the morning he was in a state of excruciating
pain and delirium. He dreamt that somehow he was being forced, along
with his pain, into the depths of a narrow black sack, being forced
further and further in and not quite getting there. It was a harrowing,
agonizing process. And he was scared, he wanted to get through and out,
he was struggling, trying to help. Then suddenly he lost his hold and
fell, and woke up. Gerasim was still there, sitting at the foot of the
bed, dozing quietly, patiently. And he himself was lying there with his
withered stockinged legs raised up on Gerasim’s shoulders. The same
candle was there, with its shade, and the same unremitting pain.</p>
<p>‘Go away, Gerasim,’ he whispered.</p>
<p>‘I don’t mind, sir. I’ll just sit here for a bit longer.’</p>
<p>‘No, you go away.’</p>
<p>He lowered his legs, turned sideways on to one arm and felt sorry for
himself. He waited only for Gerasim to go out into the next room, and
then he could restrain himself no longer: he burst into tears like a
child. He was weeping because of his own helpless state, and his
loneliness, and other people’s cruelty, and God’s cruelty, and God’s
non-existence.</p>
<p>‘Why hast Thou done all of this? Why hast Thou brought me to this
point? Why oh why dost Thou torture me like this? …’</p>
<p>He was not expecting any answers; he was weeping because there were
not and could not be any answers. The pain struck him again, but he
didn’t move and didn’t call out. He said to himself, ‘Here it comes
again. Hit me then! But what’s it for? What have I done to Thee? What is
it for?’</p>
<p>Then he fell silent, and not only stopped crying, he stopped
breathing. Suddenly he was all ears; he seemed to be listening not to a
voice speaking in words but to the voice of his soul, the thoughts
welling up in his mind.</p>
<p>‘What do you want?’ was the first expressible concept that came to
him. ‘What do you want? What do you want?’ he repeated to himself. ‘What
is it?’</p>
<p>‘No more pain. Staying alive,’ came the answer.</p>
<p>And once again his concentration became so intense that not even the
pain could distract him.</p>
<p>‘Staying alive? How?’ asked the voice of his soul.</p>
<p>‘Oh, life like it used to be. Happy and good.’</p>
<p>‘Life like it used to be? Happy and good?’ came the voice.</p>
<p>And in his imagination he started to run through the best times of
his happy life. But what was strange was that all the best times of his
happy life no longer seemed anything like what they had been before.
Nothing did - except the first recollections of his childhood. There, in
his childhood, there was something truly happy that he could have lived
with if it returned. But the person living out that happiness no longer
existed; it was like remembering someone quite different.</p>
<p>At the point where he, today’s Ivan Ilyich, began to emerge, all the
pleasures that had seemed so real melted away now before his eyes and
turned into something trivial and often disgusting.</p>
<p>And the further he was from childhood, the nearer he got to the
present day, the more trivial and dubious his pleasures appeared. It
started with law school. That had retained a little something that was
still really good: there was fun, there was friendship, there was hope.
But in the last years the good times had become more exceptional. Then,
at the beginning of his service with the governor, some good times came
again: memories of making love to a woman. Then it became all confused,
and the good times were not so many. After that there were fewer still;
the further he went the fewer there were.</p>
<p>Marriage … an accident and such a disappointment, and his wife’s bad
breath, and all that sensuality and hypocrisy! And the deadliness of his
working life, and those money worries, going on for a year, two years,
ten, twenty - always the same old story. And the longer it went on the
deadlier it became.</p>
<p>’It’s as if I had been going downhill when I thought I was going
uphill. That’s how it was. In society’s opinion I was heading uphill,
but in equal measure life was slipping away from me … And now it’s all
over. Nothing left but to die!</p>
<p>‘So what’s it all about? What’s it for? It’s not possible. It’s not
possible that life could have been as senseless and sickening as this.
And if it has really been as sickening and senseless as this, why do I
have to die, and die in agony? There’s something wrong. Maybe I didn’t
live as I should have done?’ came the sudden thought. ‘But how can that
be when I did everything properly?’ he wondered, instantly dismissing as
a total impossibility the one and only solution to the mystery of life
and death.</p>
<p>‘So, what do you want now? To live? Live how? To live as you do in
court when the usher yells out, “The Court is in session!”’ ‘Court in
session, sessions in court,’ he repeated to himself. ‘Here comes
judgement! But I’m not guilty,’ he cried out angrily. ‘What is this
for?’</p>
<p>And he stopped crying, turned to face the wall and let his mind dwell
on one single question: ‘Why all this horror? What’s the reason for
it?’</p>
<p>But, for all his dwelling on it, he could find no answer. And
whenever the thought occurred to him - which it often did - that all
this was happening to him because he had been living the wrong kind of
life, he would instantly remember how proper his life had been and
dismiss such a bizarre notion.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Another two weeks went by. Ivan Ilyich no longer rose from his sofa.
He didn’t care to lie in bed, so he lay on the sofa. And lying there,
almost invariably facing the wall, he endured all the inexplicable agony
in solitude, and in solitude he brooded on the same inexplicable
question: ‘What is this? Can it really be death?’ And an inner voice
would reply, ‘Yes, that’s what it is.’ ‘What is this torture for?’ And
the voice would reply, ‘It’s just there. It’s not for anything.’ Above
and beyond this there was nothing.</p>
<p>From the very onset of his illness, since the first time he had
driven round to see the doctor, his life had divided itself into two
opposite and alternating moods: either despair and the anticipation of a
horribly incomprehensible death, or hope accompanied by an obsessive
fascination for the workings of his body. He had eyes for only two
things: either a kidney or blind gut that had temporarily stopped doing
what it should do, or a horribly incomprehensible death, which there was
no way to avoid.</p>
<p>These two moods alternated in him from the very outset of his
illness, but the further the illness progressed the more dubious and
preposterous his notions of a kidney became, and the more realistic was
his awareness of impending death.</p>
<p>All he had to do was remember what he had been like three months
before and what he was now, remember how steadily he had gone downhill,
and any possibility of hope was shattered.</p>
<p>In his last days of solitude, when he found himself lying there
facing the back of the sofa, solitude in the midst of a populous city
and his own friends and family — a solitude more complete than anything
anywhere, at the bottom of the sea or in the bowels of the earth - in
these last days of terrible solitude Ivan Ilyich lived only by
recreating the past. Images of his past life came back to him one after
another. This process always began with the most recent ones and
proceeded back to the most remote, to childhood, and there it lingered.
If Ivan Ilyich remembered the stewed prunes he had been offered for
dinner that day he would remember the raw and wrinkly French prunes of
his childhood, their special taste and how his mouth watered when he got
down to the stone, and along with the memory of that taste would come a
whole series of further memories of that time: his nurse, his brother,
his toys. ‘No, don’t, not that. It’s too painful,’ Ivan Ilyich would say
to himself, transporting himself back to the present: there it was - a
button of the back of the sofa, creases in the morocco. ‘Morocco is
expensive, and it doesn’t wear well. It started an argument. But that
was different morocco and a different argument - when we tore father’s
briefcase and got punished, and mother brought us some tarts.’ Once
again his thoughts were settling on his childhood, and again they were
too painful for Ivan Ilyich, so he tried to drive them away and think of
something else.</p>
<p>And once again, along with this train of recollections, another train
of recollections troubled his spirit - the way in which his illness had
grown and got worse. Here, too, the further back he went the more life
there was. More goodness in life, more of life itself. The two things
were merging. ‘It’s like the pain getting worse and worse - all of my
life has been getting worse and worse,’ he thought. There was one point
of light back there at the beginning of life, but after that everything
had been getting blacker and blacker. ‘In inverse proportion to the
square of the distance from death,’ he thought. And this image of a
stone accelerating as it flies down imprinted itself on his soul. Life,
a series of increasing sufferings, flies ever faster towards its end,
the most terrible suffering. ‘I’m flying somewhere…’ He would shiver and
shudder, trying to resist, but he knew by now that resistance was
impossible, and he would turn his eyes to the back of the sofa, eyes
that were weary of looking, but couldn’t stop looking, at what lay
ahead. And he was waiting, waiting for that terrible fall, shock and
annihilation. ‘Resistance is impossible,’ he would say to himself. ‘But
if only I could see what it’s all about! No, that’s impossible, too.
There would be an explanation if I could say I’ve been wrong in the way
I’ve lived my life. But you couldn’t say that. It’s not possible,’ he
would tell himself, recalling how fastidious he had been about the
propriety and respectability of his life. ‘You can’t say that. It’s not
possible,’ he would tell himself, twisting his lips into a smile as if
someone might see it and be taken in by it. ‘There is no explanation.
Agony and death… What for?’</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Two weeks went by like this. During those two weeks an event took
place that Ivan Ilyich and his wife had been hoping for: Petrishchev
made a formal proposal. It happened one evening. The next morning
Praskovya came in to see her husband, wondering how best to break the
news of Fyodor’s proposal, but during that night Ivan Ilyich’s condition
had taken another turn for the worse. Praskovya found him on the same
sofa, but in a different position. He was lying flat on his back,
moaning and staring ahead with a fixed look.</p>
<p>She started talking about his medicine. He transferred his gaze to
her. She didn’t finish what she had started to say; there was so much
enmity in that gaze, and it was levelled straight at her.</p>
<p>‘For Christ’s sake, let me die in peace!’ he said.</p>
<p>She made as if to leave the room, but at that moment in walked their
daughter, who came over to say good morning. He gave her the same look
he had directed at his wife, and in response to her enquiries about his
health he said drily that soon he would no longer be a burden to them.
Both of them sat on for a while, saying nothing, and then they left.</p>
<p>‘What have we done wrong?’ Liza asked her mother. ‘Anyone would think
it was our fault. I’m sorry for Papa, but why do we have to suffer?’</p>
<p>The doctor arrived at his usual time. Ivan Ilyich responded to him
with a yes and no, fixing him with a malevolent look, and finally he
said, ‘Look, you know you can’t help me. Just leave me alone.’</p>
<p>‘We can ease the pain,’ said the doctor.</p>
<p>‘You can’t. Leave me alone.’</p>
<p>The doctor went out into the drawing-room and told Praskovya that
things were very bad. Only one thing could help - opium. That might ease
the pain, which must be dreadful.</p>
<p>The doctor said that the physical pain must be dreadful, which was
true. But more dreadful than the physical pain was the suffering in
spirit, his greatest agony.</p>
<p>His spiritual suffering took the form of a thought that had suddenly
struck him that night as he looked at Gerasim’s sleepy-eyed,
good-natured face with its high cheekbones. ‘What if I really have been
wrong in the way I’ve lived my whole life, my conscious life?’</p>
<p>It occurred to him that what had once seemed a total impossibility -
that he had not lived his life as he should have done - might actually
be true. It occurred to him that the slight stirrings of doubt he had
experienced about what was considered good by those in the highest
positions, slight stirrings that he had immediately repudiated - that
these misgivings might have been true and everything else might have
been wrong. His career, the ordering of his life, his family, the things
that preoccupied people in society and at work - all of this might have
been wrong. He made an attempt at defending these things for himself.
And suddenly he sensed the feebleness of what he was defending. There
was nothing to defend.</p>
<p>‘But if it’s like that,’ he said to himself, ‘and I am leaving this
life knowing I have ruined everything I was given, and it can’t be put
right, what then?’ He lay on his back and started to go through his
whole life again in a different way. Next morning, when he saw his
servant, then his wife, then his daughter, then the doctor - their every
movement and every word bore out the terrible truth that had been
revealed to him during the night. In them he saw himself and all he had
lived by, and he could clearly see that it was all wrong; it was all a
gross deception obscuring life and death. This knowledge exacerbated his
physical suffering, making it ten times worse. He moaned and writhed,
and clutched at his clothing, which seemed to be choking and stifling
him. And he hated them for it.</p>
<p>After being given a heavy dose of opium he lost consciousness, but by
dinner time it had all begun again. He sent everyone away and lay there
tossing and turning.</p>
<p>His wife came to him and said, ‘Jean, darling, please do this for my
sake.’ (For her sake?) ‘It can’t do any harm, and it often helps. Look,
it’s nothing much. Even healthy people…’</p>
<p>He opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>‘What? Take communion? What for? I’m not doing that… Oh, I don’t know
…’</p>
<p>She burst into tears.</p>
<p>‘All right, my dear? I’ll send for our priest. He’s such a nice
man.’</p>
<p>‘All right. That’s fine,’ he said.</p>
<p>When the priest came and heard his confession, Ivan Ilyich relaxed,
feeling some relief from his doubts and therefore from his suffering,
and he experienced a moment of hope. His mind turned again to his blind
gut and the possibility of a cure for it. When he took communion there
were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>When he was laid down after taking communion he felt better for a
while; there was hope that he might live on. His thoughts turned to the
operation that he had been offered. ‘I want to live. I do want to live,’
he said to himself. His wife came in to greet him after communion. She
said the usual things, and then added: ‘You really do feel better, don’t
you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ he said, looking away.</p>
<p>Her clothes, her figure, the look on her face, the sound of her voice
- all said the same thing to him: ‘This is wrong. Everything you have
lived by, and still do, is a lie, a deception that hides life and death
away from you.’ And the moment this thought occurred to him, his hatred
welled up, and along with the hatred came physical suffering and agony,
and along with the agony came awareness of the inevitable destruction
that was now so close. There was something different about it: a
twisting, shooting pain, and constricted breathing.</p>
<p>The look on his face as he said ‘Yes’ had been dreadful. When he had
got the word out, looking straight at her, he wrenched himself over face
down remarkably quickly for one so weak, and roared at her: ‘Get out! Go
away! Leave me alone!’</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>From that moment on the screaming began. It went on unbroken for
three days, so terrible that people two rooms away were horrified to
hear it. At the moment when he had answered his wife he had realized he
was done for, there was no way back, the end was here, the absolute end,
and his unresolved doubts would remain as doubts.</p>
<p>‘Oh! Oh! Oh!’ he cried, varying the tone. He began by crying out, ‘Oh
no!’ and went on screaming the letter ‘o’. Throughout the three days,
during which time had ceased to exist for him, he struggled with the
black sack into which he was being crammed by an invisible, unstoppable
force. He resisted like a condemned man resisting his executioner,
knowing that he is not going to be spared, and with every minute that
passed he sensed that, despite all his fighting and struggling, he was
getting nearer and nearer to the thing that terrified him. He sensed
that the pain came from being thrust into that black hole and, what was
worse, not being able to get through. What was preventing him from
getting through was his insistence that his life had been a good one.
This vindication of his lifestyle was holding him down, preventing him
from moving on, and causing him the greatest suffering.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a strong jolt in his chest and side, and a further
constriction of his breathing. He was into the hole, and there at the
end of the hole a kind of light was shining. What was happening to him
was like when he had been in a railway carriage and you think you are
going forwards but you are really going backwards, and suddenly you know
what the right direction is.</p>
<p>‘Yes, it’s all been wrong,’ he told himself, ‘but that doesn’t
matter. It’s possible to do the right thing. But what is the right
thing?’ he wondered, and suddenly he was calm.</p>
<p>It was nearing the end of the third day, an hour before his death. At
that very moment his schoolboy son crept in to see his father and came
over to his bed. The dying man was still screaming desperately and
waving his arms about. His hand happened to catch the boy’s head. The
boy took hold of it, pressed it to his lips and burst into tears.</p>
<p>This was the very moment when Ivan Ilyich had fallen through and seen
a light, and it was revealed to him that his life had not been what it
should have been, but that it could still be put right. He was wondering
what the right thing was, and he had calmed down, listening. Now he
could feel someone kissing his hand. He opened his eyes and looked at
his son. He felt sorry for him. His wife came over. He looked at her.
With her mouth open and the tears not wiped away from her nose and cheek
she was looking at him in despair. He felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>‘Yes, I’m hurting them,’ he thought. ‘They feel sorry for me, but
they’ll be all right when I’m dead.’ He wanted to tell them this, but he
wasn’t strong enough to get the words out. ‘Anyway … no good talking.
Must do something.’ He looked at his wife, motioned to their son and
said: ‘Take him away … sorry for him … and you …’ He tried to say,
‘Forgive me,’ but it came out as, ‘For goodness …’ Too weak to correct
himself, he waved his hand knowing that he who needed to would
understand.</p>
<p>And suddenly everything was clear to him: what had been oppressing
him and would not go away was now going away, all at once, on two sides,
ten sides, all sides. He felt sorry for them, and he must do something
to stop hurting them. Set them free, and free himself from all this
suffering. ‘So nice, and so simple,’ he thought. ‘But what about the
pain?’ he wondered. ‘Where’s it gone? Hey, pain, where are you?’</p>
<p>He listened and waited.</p>
<p>‘Oh, here it comes. So what? Bring on the pain.’</p>
<p>‘What about death? Where is it?’</p>
<p>He was looking for his earlier, accustomed fear of death, but he
couldn’t find it. Where was death? What death? There was no fear
whatsoever, because there was no death.</p>
<p>Instead of death there was light.</p>
<p>‘So that’s it!’ he said suddenly, out loud. ‘Oh, bliss!’</p>
<p>All of this happened to him in a single moment, and the meaning of
that moment was not going to change. For those present, his agony went
on for another two hours. There was a rattling in his chest. His wasted
body shook. Then the rattling and the wheezing dwindled away.</p>
<p>‘He’s gone!’ said someone over him.</p>
<p>He caught these words and repeated them in spirit. ‘Death has gone,’
he told himself.</p>
<p>‘It’s gone.’</p>
<p>He took in some air, stopped halfway through a deep breath, stretched
out, and died.</p>
<p>AFTER THE BALL</p>
<p>A Tale</p>
<p>‘What you’re all saying, you see, is that on his own a person can’t
distinguish the good from the bad, that it all depends on his
environment, that a person’s a prey to his environment. But the way I
see it is that it’s all up to chance. Listen, I’ll tell you something
that happened to me personally …’</p>
<p>This was how our universally respected Ivan Vasilyevich began to
address us after a discussion we had been having on the subject of
whether all that was necessary in order to achieve individual perfection
was to alter the conditions under which people lead their lives. It
should be pointed out that none of us had actually said that on his own
a person cannot tell the good from the bad, but Ivan Vasilyevich had a
peculiar way of answering questions of his own that had occurred to him
in the course of the discussion, and of making these the pretext for
tales concerning episodes in his own life. Quite often he would
completely forget the point from which he had started, and would get
carried away by his stories, all the more so since he told them with a
high degree of sincerity and truthfulness.</p>
<p>It was no different on this occasion.</p>
<p>‘I’ll tell you what happened to me. The whole of my life’s been like
this; it hasn’t been influenced by my environment, but by something else
entirely.’</p>
<p>‘What?’ we all wanted to know.</p>
<p>‘Oh, it’s a long story. It’ll take quite a bit of telling if you’re
really to understand.’</p>
<p>‘That’s all right, go ahead and tell us.’</p>
<p>Ivan Vasilyevich thought for a moment, and then nodded his head.</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ he said. ‘The whole of my life changed as a result of one
night, or rather one morning.’</p>
<p>‘But what happened?’</p>
<p>‘What happened was that I’d fallen deeply in love. I’ve fallen in
love many times, but this was my deepest love. It’s all an age ago now:
she’s got married daughters nowadays. The girl’s name was B — , yes,
Varenka B — . [Ivan Vasilyevich mentioned the family’s name.] Even at
fifty she was a remarkably attractive woman. But when she was young,
eighteen years old, she was stunning: tall and graceful, with a lovely
figure - majestic, truly majestic. She always maintained an unusually
erect posture, as though she could not do otherwise, with her head
thrown slightly back, and this, together with her beauty and her tall
stature, and in spite of her thin, almost bony physique, gave her a
queenly appearance which would have been intimidating had it not been
for her lovely, joyous smile, her beautiful, shining eyes and her
overall charm and youthfulness.’</p>
<p>‘I say, hark at Ivan Vasilyevich’s description!’</p>
<p>‘No description could possibly tell you what she was really like …
but that’s not important. The events I’m going to tell you about took
place in the 1840s. In those days I was a student at a provincial
university. I don’t know whether it was a good thing or a bad one, but
at the time I was there our university contained no circles or theories
of any kind. We were simply young and we lived as the young do: pursued
our studies and enjoyed ourselves. I was a very jolly, lively fellow,
and I had money, too. I owned a magnificent pacer, went tobogganing with
the young ladies (skating had not yet come into fashion), and lived it
up with my companions (in those days we never drank anything but
champagne; if we were out of money we didn’t drink at all, and never
turned to vodka, as students do nowadays). But what I enjoyed most were
the soirees and balls. I was a good dancer, and was tolerably
good-looking.’</p>
<p>‘Come, come, you needn’t be so modest,’ said one of the ladies in our
company. ‘We know what you look like in your daguerreotype, don’t we?
You weren’t just tolerably good-looking, you were handsome!’</p>
<p>’That’s as may be, but it’s not important, either. The important
thing was that during this time, when my love for her was reaching its
highest point - the last day of Shrovetide, it was - I went to a ball at
the house of the local marshal of nobility,1 a good-natured old man who
was well off, liked throwing parties and was a gentleman-in-waiting at
the court. The guests were received by his wife, who was also very
good-natured, wearing a velvet dress, a diamond ferronière on her
forehead, her white, puffy, aged shoulders and breast exposed, as in the
portraits of the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna. It was a wonderful ball: a
fine big reception room, with choirs, an orchestra, famous in those
days, composed of the serfs of a landowner who was also an amateur
musician, a magnificent buffet and a veritable ocean of champagne.
Although I was fond of champagne, I didn’t drink any, as I was already
drunk, without need of wine, drunk on love; on the other hand, I danced
until I dropped: quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, all as far as possible
with Varenka, of course. She wore a white dress with a pink sash, white
kid gloves that reached almost to her thin, pointed elbows, and white
satin shoes. I had the mazurka poached from me by a really terrible
fellow called Anisimov, an engineer - I still haven’t forgiven him to
this day. He had asked her for this dance at the very moment she had
arrived, while I had been delayed by having had to go back to the
barber’s to fetch the gloves I had left there by mistake. So instead of
getting to dance the mazurka with Varenka, I had as my partner a young
German girl I’d once run after. I’m afraid I wasn’t very considerate to
her that evening, hardly spoke to her or looked at her and only had eyes
for that tall, shapely figure in the white dress with the pink sash, for
her flushed, radiant face with its dimples, and for her tender,
affectionate eyes. I wasn’t the only one: everyone was looking at her
and admiring her, men and women alike, even though she put them all in
the shade. It was impossible not to admire her.</p>
<p>‘Officially, so to speak, I had another partner for the mazurka, but
in reality I danced most of the figures with her. Without the slightest
embarrassment she would walk the whole length of the room and come
straight up to me, I would jump to my feet, not waiting to be asked, and
she would thank me with a smile for my quick-wittedness. When we were
led before her to choose one of us, she would give her arm to another
gallant, unable to guess my quality, shrug her thin shoulders and smile
to me as a sign of regret and consolation. When the figures of the
mazurka were being danced as a waltz, I waltzed with her for a long time
and, smiling and breathing fast, she said: “Encore!” And I waltzed and
waltzed, until I was no longer conscious of my body at all.’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean you weren’t conscious of it? I bet you were very
conscious of it when you had your arm around her waist, not only of your
body but of hers as well,’ said one of the guests.</p>
<p>Ivan Vasilyevich suddenly turned a deep red and in his anger almost
shouted: ‘Yes, there you are, there’s the youth of today for you! You
don’t see anything apart from the body. It wasn’t like that in our day.
The more deeply I fell in love, the more disembodied she became for me.
Nowadays you study their legs, their ankles and a bit more besides; you
undress the women you’re in love with. But for me, as Alphonse Karr2
used to say (he was a good writer, by the way), the object of my love
was always dressed in vestments of bronze. It wasn’t just that we didn’t
undress our women mentally; like the good sons of Noah, we tried to
conceal their nakedness. Well, you wouldn’t understand …’</p>
<p>‘Don’t pay any attention to him. Carry on with the story,’ said one
of us.</p>
<p>’Yes, all right. Well, there I was dancing with her, and I completely
lost track of the time. The musicians were strumming away at the same
old mazurka tune with a sort of desperate weariness - you know how it is
at the end of a ball - the mamas and papas had already risen from the
card tables and were waiting for supper to be served, the manservants
were running to and fro, carrying things. It was already after two a.m.
I would have to make the most of the last few minutes. Yet again I asked
her to dance with me and for the hundredth time we sailed through the
ballroom together.</p>
<p>“’May I have the quadrille after supper?” I asked her, as I took her
back to her seat.</p>
<p>“’Of course, if they haven’t taken me home by then,” she said with a
smile.</p>
<p>“’I won’t let them,” I said.</p>
<p>‘ “Give me back my fan,” she said.</p>
<p>‘ “It breaks my heart to do even that,” I said, as I returned her
inexpensive white fan to her.</p>
<p>‘ “Well, here you are, so your heart doesn’t break,” she said,
plucking a feather from her fan and giving it to me.</p>
<p>’I took the feather, and was only able to express my joy and
gratitude by the way I looked at her. I was not merely light of heart,
contented; I was blissfully happy, I overflowed with goodness, I was no
longer myself but some unearthly being that had no knowledge of evil and
was capable only of doing good. I hid the feather in my glove and
remained standing there, unable to summon up the strength to leave
her.</p>
<p>’“Look, they’re trying to get Papa to dance,” she said, pointing out
the tall, stately figure of her father, a colonel in silver epaulettes
who was standing in the doorway with the hostess and some other
ladies.</p>
<p>‘ “Varenka, come over here,” we heard the hostess, with her diamond
ferronière and empress shoulders, call in a loud voice.</p>
<p>’Varenka went over to the doorway. I followed her.</p>
<p>“’Ma chère, do try to talk your father into taking a round of the
floor with you. Come along now, please, Pyotr Vladislavych,” said the
hostess to the colonel.</p>
<p>’Varenka’s father was a very tall, stately, handsome, well-preserved
old man. His face had a rubicund complexion, he had a white, curly
moustache à la Nicolas3 which joined a pair of sidewhiskers, also white,
and his hair was combed forwards over his temples. A happy, affectionate
smile like that of his daughter played in his brilliant eyes and around
his lips. He was magnificently built, with his broad chest thrown
forwards, military style, and adorned with a tasteful clutch of medals,
his powerful shoulders and his long, elegant legs. He was a military
commander with the bearing of an old campaigner from the days of
Nicholas I.</p>
<p>’As we approached the doorway, the colonel was on the point of
refusing, saying that he had forgotten how to dance; none the less,
smiling and reaching with his right arm for his left side, he drew his
sword from its scabbard, gave it to an obliging young man and, putting a
suede glove on his right hand - “Everything according to regulations,”
he said, smiling - led his daughter out on to the dance floor, made a
quarter turn and waited for the mazurka tempo to begin.</p>
<p>’When it did, he stamped one foot smartly on the floor, put the other
one forward, and his tall, stout figure began, now quietly and smoothly,
now noisily and impetuously, to move around the ballroom with a thudding
of boot soles and of foot against foot. Beside him floated Varenka’s
graceful figure, imperceptibly lengthening or shortening the steps her
small feet took in their white satin shoes. All who were present in the
room followed each and every movement of the couple. Not only was I lost
in admiration as I watched them, I was filled with a moved, ecstatic
feeling. I was particularly moved by the colonel’s boots, which were
fastened by foot-straps - they were good, calf-leather boots, though not
of the pointed, fashionable kind, but with the old-style square toecaps
and without heels, obviously the work of a regimental cobbler. “In order
to bring out his favourite daughter and set her off he hasn’t bought
fashionable boots but is just wearing his ordinary, homemade ones,” I
thought, and those square toecaps continued to move me. It was evident
that he had once been an excellent dancer; now he had grown stout,
however, and his legs were no longer supple enough for the swift,
elegant dance steps he was trying to perform. All the same, he managed
to make two rounds of the floor with considerable dexterity. And when he
swiftly planted his feet apart and then rejoined them and fell to one
knee, albeit somewhat heavily, and when she, smiling and patting her
skirt where he had caught it, circled him gracefully, everyone burst
into loud applause. Getting to his feet again with a certain amount of
effort, he embraced his daughter tenderly and affectionately by the ears
and, kissing her forehead, led her over to where I stood, thinking that
I was dancing with her. I told him that I was not her escort.</p>
<p>“‘Well, never mind, you take her for this dance,’ he said, smiling
kindly and putting his sword away in its scabbard.</p>
<p>’Just as a single drop poured from a bottle is followed by the
gushing-forth of the entire contents, so my love for Varenka released
the entire amorous capacity of my soul. At that moment I embraced the
whole world with my love. I loved the hostess with her ferronière and
Empress Elizabeth bust, I loved her husband, her guests, her manservants
and even Anisimov, the engineer, who was now giving me a rather cool
look. As for her father, with his regimental boots and his affectionate
smile that was like hers, for him I felt an emotion that was composed of
enthusiasm and tenderness.</p>
<p>’The mazurka came to an end, the host and hostess asked the guests to
come in to supper, but Colonel B — refused, saying that he had to get up
early next morning, and he took his leave of them both. I was beginning
to worry that Varenka too would have to go, but she remained with her
mother.</p>
<p>’After supper I danced the quadrille with Varenka, as she had
promised, and, although my happiness already seemed infinite, it
continued to grow and grow. We said nothing on the subject of love. I
did not ask her, any more than I asked myself, whether she loved me. And
the only thing I was afriad of was that something might spoil my
happiness.</p>
<p>’When I got home I undressed and thought about sleep, and then
realized that sleep was quite out of the question. I was still holding
the feather from her fan and one of her gloves which she had given me as
she had been leaving (I had helped both her and her mother to get into
their carriage). I looked at these objects and, without closing my eyes,
saw her before me, now as she had been at the moment when, choosing
between two escorts, she had tried to guess which quality I represented,
and I had heard her charming voice say, “Pride? Yes?” - and had joyfully
given me her hand; and now as she had been at supper, taking little sips
from her goblet of champagne and looking at me with affectionate
mistrust. But most clearly of all I saw her together with her father,
circling around him and surveying the admiring spectators with pride and
joy both at him and at herself. And I found myself linking them both in
a single emotion of tender rapture.</p>
<p>’At that time I was living with my brother, who is dead now. In
general, my brother wasn’t much disposed towards society life and didn’t
go to balls; just then he was studying for his final-year university
exams and was leading a very regular life. He was asleep. As I looked at
his head, buried in the pillow and half-covered by a flannel blanket, I
felt sorry for him in a brotherly sort of way, sorry that he neither
knew nor shared the happiness I was experiencing. Our household serf
Petrusha came to meet me with a candle and wanted to help me undress for
bed, but I sent him away. I found the sight of his sleepy face and
tousled hair charmingly touching. Trying not to make any noise, I went
into my room on tiptoe and sat down on the bed. It was no good, I was
too happy, I would never be able to sleep. What was more, I found the
heated rooms far too warm and, without taking off my uniform jacket, I
went quietly into the hallway, put on my overcoat, opened the front door
and went out on to the street.</p>
<p>’It had been after four a.m. when I had left the ball; since my
arrival home two hours had passed, which I had spent sitting about; thus
it was already light when I emerged on to the street. It was real
Shrovetide weather - there was a fog, patches of snow saturated with
water were melting on the roads, and there was a steady dripping from
the roofs. In those days the B — s lived on the outskirts of town near a
large field, at one end of which there was a Shrovetide fair, and at the
other an institute for young ladies. I walked down the deserted lane
outside our house and came out on to the main road; here, even at this
hour, I began to meet pedestrians and draymen with firewood on their
sledge carts that grazed the road surface with their runners. Everything
— the horses rhythmically swaying their sopping heads under the glossy
shaft-bows, the cab-drivers, their shoulders covered in bast matting,
trudging along beside their cabs in enormous boots and, on either side
of the streets, the houses, which in the fog seemed extraordinarily tall
- for me it was all charged with a peculiar fascination and
significance. When I came to the field where their house was situated, I
saw at its opposite end, near the fairground, something large and black;
I could hear the sound of a fife and drum coming from over that way. My
head was still full of music, and every now and then I had been silently
hearing the tune of the mazurka. What filled my ears now, however, was
another kind of music, harsh and unpleasant.</p>
<p>‘ “I wonder what that is?” I thought, and made my way along the
slippery path that had been trampled across the middle of the field in
the direction the sounds were coming from. When I had gone about a
hundred yards or so, I began to be able to make out through the fog a
large number of people dressed in black. They were obviously soldiers.
“They must be on manoeuvres,” I thought and, together with a blacksmith
in a dirty apron and dirty sheepskin coat who was walking in front of
me, carrying something, I went closer. Black-uniformed soldiers were
standing perfectly still in two rows, their rifles at rest. Behind them
stood a drummer and a fifer who kept playing the same shrill, unpleasant
melody over and over again.</p>
<p>‘ “What are they doing?” I asked the blacksmith, who had stopped
beside me. “Giving a Tartar a hiding for desertion,” said the blacksmith
gruffly, his eyes trained on the far end of the rows of men.</p>
<p>’I followed his gaze and, between the rows, saw something terrifying
coming towards me. It was a man stripped to the waist and tied to the
rifles of the two soldiers who were escorting him. Beside him, in an
overcoat and peaked cap, walked a tall colonel who looked familiar to
me. His whole body twitching, his feet slapping on the melting snow, the
man who was being punished was moving towards me under a hail of blows
that descended on him from all sides, now throwing himself backwards —
whereupon the NCOs who were dragging him along on their rifles would
push him forwards - now falling forwards -whereupon the NCOs would pull
him backwards in order to keep him upright. And by his side, with a
firm, slightly quivering step, walked the tall colonel. It was her
father, with his rubicund face and his white moustache and
sidewhiskers.</p>
<p>’Each time he was struck, the man who was being punished turned his
face, which was contorted with suffering, in the direction from which
the blow had come, as if in surprise, and, baring his teeth, kept
repeating the same words. It was only when he was quite close to me that
I was able to make out what they were. In a voice that was more of a
sob, he was mouthing: “Have mercy on me, lads. Have mercy on me, lads.”
But the lads were not having any mercy on him and, when the procession
drew level with me, I saw the soldier standing opposite me take a
determined step forwards and bring his stick whistling down on the
Tartar’s back with a violent slash. The Tartar convulsed forwards, but
the NCOs restrained him, and another, similar blow landed on him from
the other side; this was followed by another from the side I was on,
then by a further one from the other side, and so it went on. The
colonel maintained his accompanying presence and, looking now at his
feet and now at the man who was being punished, he took deep gulps of
air, blowing out his cheeks and letting the air escape through his
protruding lips. When the procession had gone past me, I caught a
glimpse of the Tartar’s back through the ranks of men. It looked so
lurid, wet and unnaturally red that I could hardly believe it was a
man’s back.</p>
<p>‘ “Oh, Christ,” said the blacksmith, who was standing beside me.</p>
<p>’The procession began to move off into the distance, the blows
continued to rain down from both sides on the stumbling, writhing man,
the drum went on beating and the fife went on shrilling, and the tall,
stately figure of the colonel continued to move alongside the Tartar
with its firm step. Suddenly the colonel stood still. Then he went up to
one of the soldiers.</p>
<p>‘ “I’ll teach you to miss the mark,” I heard him say in an angry
voice. “Going to miss the mark, were you? Going to miss it, eh?”</p>
<p>’And I saw his powerful, suede-gloved hand strike a puny, frightened
little soldier in the face for not bringing his stick down on the
Tartar’s back hard enough.</p>
<p>‘ “Give them fresh sticks!” he shouted, and as he looked round he
caught sight of me. Pretending not to know me, he wasted no time in
turning away, frowning angrily and menacingly as he did so. I was so
embarrassed that, not knowing where to look, as though I had been caught
red-handed in the most shameful misdeed, I lowered my eyes and hurried
off home. All the way back I could hear either the beating of the drum
and the shrilling of the fife and the man sobbing, “Have mercy on me,
lads,” or the self-assured, angry voice of the colonel shouting, “Going
to miss the mark, were you? Going to miss it, eh?” And all the while I
was filled with an almost physical anguish that rose in me to the point
of nausea, and so powerfully that several times I had to stand still and
thought I was going to vomit up all the horror that this spectacle had
aroused in me. I don’t even remember how I managed to reach home and get
into bed. But no sooner had I fallen asleep than I heard and saw it all
over again, and I leapt out of bed.</p>
<p>‘ “He obviously knows something that I don’t,” I said to myself,
thinking of the colonel. “If I’d known what he knows, I’d have
understood what I was seeing and it wouldn’t have upset me.” But no
matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t imagine what it was the colonel
knew, and it was not until that evening that I was able to fall asleep,
and even then only after I had gone to the house of a friend and got
completely drunk with him.</p>
<p>‘Well, do you suppose I made up my mind then that what I had seen was
something sickening? Not a bit of it. “If it was done with such
assurance and everyone thought it was necessary, then they must have
known something I didn’t,” was what I thought, and I tried to find out
what it was. But I couldn‘t, no matter how hard I exerted myself. And
since I couldn’t, I couldn’t join the army as I’d planned to, and not
only did I not join the army, I couldn’t find a place for myself
anywhere in society, and ended up being no good for anything, as you can
see.’</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, we know all about how you’re no good for anything,’ said one
of us. ‘But tell us: how many men would be no good for anything if it
weren’t for the likes of you?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, come, that’s just plain stupid,’ said Ivan Vasilyevich with
unfeigned irritation.</p>
<p>‘Well, and what about that love of yours?’ we asked.</p>
<p>‘My love? Oh, from that day on it started to fade. Whenever she grew
pensive, with that smile on her face, as she often did, I’d immediately
find myself thinking about the colonel on the field, and I’d feel
awkward and unwell; so I started to see her less often. And my love for
her just disappeared. That’s the way it is with some affairs, and those
are the sort of events that change the course of a man’s entire life.
But you say …’ he concluded.</p>
