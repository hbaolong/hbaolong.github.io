<h4 id="three-deaths">THREE DEATHS</h4>
<p>1</p>
<p>It was autumn. Two carriages were bowling along the highway at a fast
trot. In the first carriage there were two women. One was a lady, thin
and pale. The other was her maid, with a shiny red face and a stout
figure; her short, dry hair kept straggling out from under her faded
bonnet, and she pushed it back fitfully with a red hand in a torn glove.
Her full bosom, covered by a thick cloth of carpet material, exuded good
health, and her black eyes were busy; one moment they were peering
through the window at the fields flashing by, then they would glance
across diffidently at the mistress, or watch the corners of the carriage
with some concern. In front of the maid’s nose dangled her mistress’s
bonnet, hanging from the rack, and on her knees lay a puppy. Her feet,
raised up on boxes standing on the floor, could just about be heard
drumming along with the creaking springs and the rattling of the
window-panes.</p>
<p>With her hands folded on her lap and her eyes shut the lady rocked
feebly against the cushions placed behind her back, frowned slightly and
gave a little cough from time to time. She wore a white nightcap on her
head, and a light blue scarf was wound round her delicate white neck. A
straight parting disappeared under her nightcap, dividing her remarkably
sleek, pomaded, light brown hair, and there was something deathly and
desiccated in the white skin that formed the parting. The withered,
yellowing skin hung loosely over the thin but beautiful contours of her
face, with crimson on her prominent cheekbones. Her lips were dry and
restless, her thinning eyelashes had no curl in them, and a cloth
travelling cloak lay in straight folds across her sunken chest. Even
though her eyes were shut, the lady’s face gave an impression of
weariness, irritation and continual suffering.</p>
<p>A footman, wedged into his seat with his elbows on the sides, was
dozing on the box. The coach driver drove his four big, sweating horses,
yelling them on and glancing back now and then at another driver calling
to him from a little open carriage behind them. Broad tyre tracks spread
themselves evenly in speeding parallel lines along the limy, muddy road.
The sky was grey and cold, and a damp mist was settling on the fields.
Inside the carriage it was stuffy, smelling of eau-de-Cologne and dust.
The invalid lady put her head back and opened her eyes. Her eyes were
splendidly dark, and glittering.</p>
<p>‘Again,’ she said, and her beautiful thin hand nervously pushed away
the hem of her maid’s cloak which was brushing lightly against her leg,
and her mouth was contorted with pain. Matryosha gathered up her cloak
with both hands, half-rose on her strong legs and shifted away. Her
fresh face was flushed bright red. The splendidly dark eyes of the
invalid lady followed the maid’s every movement. Her mistress gripped
the seat with both hands and also tried to lift herself and sit up
higher, but she couldn’t manage it. Her mouth contracted and her whole
face twisted itself into an expression of impotent, malevolent irony. ‘A
fat lot of help you are! Oh, don’t bother! I can do it myself, and you
needn’t shove all your bags behind me. Please don’t! No, don’t touch me.
You’ve no idea!’ The lady closed her eyes, then raised her eyelids again
sharply and glared at her maid. Matryosha looked back at her, biting her
red lower lip. A heavy sigh arose in the invalid’s bosom, but it was a
sigh that cut itself short as it turned into a cough. She looked away,
scowling, and clutched at her chest with both hands. When the coughing
spasm was over she closed her eyes again and sat there without moving.
The two carriages, one large and one small, drove into the village.
Matryosha reached out from under her cover and made the sign of the
cross.</p>
<p>‘What is it?’ asked her mistress.</p>
<p>‘A post station, madam.’</p>
<p>‘Why are you crossing yourself? That’s what I’m asking you.’</p>
<p>‘There’s a church, madam.’</p>
<p>The invalid turned towards the window and began crossing herself
slowly, her eyes widening at the sight of the country church that her
carriage was driving past.</p>
<p>The two carriages stopped together by the church. From the small one
two men emerged: the invalid lady’s husband and a doctor. They walked
over to the large carriage.</p>
<p>‘How are you feeling?’ asked the doctor, taking her pulse.</p>
<p>‘How are you, darling? Not too tired?’ asked her husband, in French.
‘Would you like to get out?’</p>
<p>Matryosha had scraped up her belongings and was squeezing back into
the corner so as not to interfere with their conversation.</p>
<p>‘Not too bad. Just the same,’ the sick woman replied. ‘I’m not
getting out.’</p>
<p>The husband stood there for a short while, then went into the station
building.</p>
<p>Matryosha skipped down from the carriage and ran tiptoeing in through
the gateway.</p>
<p>‘If I feel bad, that’s no reason for you to miss lunch.’ The sick
lady gave a feeble smile as she spoke to the doctor, who was standing by
her window.</p>
<p>‘They’re not bothered about me, any of them,’ she added, talking to
herself, as soon as the doctor had walked gently away and trotted up the
steps into the station house. ‘They’re all right, and that’s all that
matters. Oh! My God!’</p>
<p>‘Well then, Edward Ivanovich,’ said the husband, rubbing his hands
with a cheerful smile as he welcomed the doctor in. ‘I’ve told them to
bring the lunch basket in. How does that strike you?’</p>
<p>‘Not a bad idea,’ replied the doctor.</p>
<p>‘How is she doing, then?’ the husband asked with a sigh, lowering his
voice and raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>‘I’ve told you. She won’t make it, not to Italy. She’ll need God’s
grace to get to Moscow. Especially in this weather.’</p>
<p>‘What can we do, then? Oh, my God! My God!’ The husband buried his
face in one hand. ‘Put it down here,’ he said to the man who was
bringing in the lunch basket.</p>
<p>‘She should have stayed put,’ answered the doctor with a shrug.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, but what could I have done?’ the husband protested. ‘Look, I
did all I could to stop her. I told her how about the money involved,
leaving the children behind, my work. She just wouldn’t listen. She was
planning her life abroad as if she was well again. And telling her about
her condition - well, that would have been the same as killing her
off.’</p>
<p>‘She’s already been killed off. That’s what you must realize, Vasily
Dmitrich. A person cannot live without lungs, and lungs won’t grow back.
It’s sad, it’s hard to bear, but what can you do? Only one thing matters
for you and me - to give her the most peaceful ending we can. And for
that we need a priest.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, my God! You can imagine my situation, having to remind her about
her last wishes. Whatever happens, I’m not going to talk to her about
that. You know how good she is …’</p>
<p>‘Well, try and persuade her to wait until the roads are frozen over,’
said the doctor, with a meaningful shake of his head. ‘Otherwise
something nasty might happen out on the road …’</p>
<p>‘Aksyusha! Hey, Aksyusha!’ yelled the stationmaster’s daughter,
throwing a jacket over her head and stamping on the dirty back porch.
‘Let’s go and have a look at that Shirkin lady. She’s supposed to be
goin’ abroad with that disease in her chest. I ain’t never seen how it
is with them consumptives.’</p>
<p>Aksyusha skipped out on to the threshold, and both girls ran out
through the gate, linking hands. They slowed down, walked past the
carriage and took a look in through the lowered window. The sick lady
turned to face them, but when she saw their curiosity she scowled and
looked away.</p>
<p>‘Gosh!’ said the stationmaster’s daughter, whirling her head round.
‘She must have been a real beauty - and now look what’s happened to her.
It’s horrible. Did you see her, Aksyusha? Did you see her?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, all thin, wasn’t she?’ said Aksyusha, eager to back her up.
‘Let’s go and have another look, as if we’re going to the well. She
looked away, see, and I never got a good look. It’s such a pity,
Masha.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, but look at all this mud!’ said Masha, and they both ran back
in through the gate.</p>
<p>‘I must be a terrible sight,’ thought the invalid lady. ‘Must get
going, as soon as we can, go abroad. I’ll soon get better there.’</p>
<p>‘Now then, how are you feeling, my dear?’ said her husband, coming
over to the carriage and chewing as he came.</p>
<p>‘Always the same question,’ thought the sick woman, ‘but he’s
eating.’</p>
<p>‘So-so,’ she managed to get out, through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>‘Do you know what, my dear, I’m afraid you’re going to feel worse out
on the road in this weather, and Edward says the same. Don’t you think
we should go back home?’</p>
<p>Furious with him, she said nothing.</p>
<p>‘The weather might improve, the road could harden up, and you might
feel better. Then we could all travel together.’</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry. If I had stopped listening to you ages ago I’d be in
Berlin by now, and I’d be better again.’</p>
<p>‘We can’t help it, my angel. It just wasn’t possible, as you know.
And now, if you would just stay on for another month, you’d feel so much
better, I could get my business finished and we could bring the
children…’</p>
<p>‘The children are well. I’m not.’</p>
<p>‘Darling, you must understand. In this kind of weather, if you take a
turn for the worse out on the road… I mean, when you’re at home, at
least…’</p>
<p>‘What? What could I do at home? … Die there?’ The sick woman’s
response was venomous. But the word ‘die’ had clearly shaken her; she
looked at her husband imploringly, her eyes questioning. He looked down,
saying nothing. The woman’s mouth crumpled like a child’s, and tears
streamed from her eyes. The husband buried his face in a handkerchief,
and he walked away from the carriage without a word.</p>
<p>‘No, I’m going on,’ she said, raising her eyes to the heavens and
folding her arms. She began to whisper incoherently. ‘Oh my God, what’s
it all for?’ she said, her tears flowing faster than ever. For some time
she prayed, fervently, but her chest felt so painful and tight, the sky,
the fields and the road looked so steeped in their gloomy grey, and the
autumn mist never thickened and never thinned as it drizzled down in the
same old way on to the muddy road, the roofs, the carriage and the thick
coats of the drivers chatting to each other in ringing, cheerful voices
while they greased the wheels and got the horses ready for the
carriage.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The carriage was ready, but the driver was in no hurry. He had
disappeared into the drivers’ cabin. Inside it was hot and stuffy, dark
and oppressive, smelling of people, newly baked bread, cabbage and
sheepskins. There were one or two drivers there, a cook was fussing over
the stove, and on the stove-top itself a sick man lay stretched out on
some sheepskins.</p>
<p>‘Uncle Fedya! Hey, Uncle Fedya!’ said the young driver, still wearing
his top-coat and a whip in his belt, as he came in and spoke to the sick
man.</p>
<p>‘What’m you doin’ hangin’ about here askin’ after Fedya?’ responded
another driver. ‘Look, they’m waitin’ for you out in the carriage.’</p>
<p>‘I want to ask him about his boots. Mine are worn out,’ answered the
young man, tossing his hair back and straightening the mittens in his
belt. ‘Maybe he’s asleep. Hey, Uncle Fedya!’ he repeated, walking over
to the stove.</p>
<p>‘You what?’ came a feeble voice, and a thin, ruddy face bent down
from the stove-top. A broad, skinny, pale and hairy arm jerked a coat up
over a bony shoulder in a dirty shirt. ‘Give us something to drink, me
lad. What was you saying?’</p>
<p>The lad offered him some water in a dipper.</p>
<p>‘Well, Fedya, it’s… er … like this,’ he said, shifting from one foot
to the other, ‘I don’t imagine you needs new boots now. You could let me
’ave ’em. Seems as if you won’t be doing no walking.’</p>
<p>The sick man brought his weary head down to the shiny dipper, wetting
his thin, straggling whiskers in the dark water as he drank feebly but
thirstily. His matted beard was dirty, and his sunken clouded eyes
didn’t find it easy to look up at the young man’s face. Finishing with
the water, he tried to lift one hand to wipe his wet lips, but he
couldn’t manage it and he wiped himself on the coat sleeve. Saying
nothing, he breathed in heavily through his nose and looked the young
man straight in the eye, getting his strength up.</p>
<p>‘Maybe they’re already spoken for,’ said the young man. ‘If they are,
it doesn’t matter. The thing is - it’s wet out there, and I’ve got my
work to do, and I just thought I’d ask old Fedya about his boots - maybe
he don’t need them any more. Perhaps you do need them. Just tell me
…’</p>
<p>There was a rumbling and a gurgling in the sick man’s chest. He bent
double and started choking on a throaty cough that never really got
going.</p>
<p>‘How can he need them?’ the cook snapped unexpectedly, speaking
angrily to the whole cabin. ‘He ain’t been down off that stove for a
couple of months. You can hear him. Gives you a pain inside just to
listen to him. Can’t be needing no boots, can he? They’re not going to
bury him with new boots on. His time’s up, God forgive me, I’m a sinner.
You can see he’s cracking up. He ought be taken away into another hut or
somewhere else. What I’m saying is, there’s hospitals in town. And what
right has he got taking up all that corner? No two ways about it. Some
of us don’t have no room at all. And they keeps telling you to keep the
place clean.’</p>
<p>‘Hey, Sergey! Get yourself on board. The master and mistress is
waiting,’ called the post-controller from outside.</p>
<p>Sergey made as if to go, without waiting for a response, but the sick
man’s eyes signalled while he was coughing that he wanted to give him an
answer.</p>
<p>‘You can have my boots, Sergey,’ he said, stifling his cough. ‘But
listen,’ he added wheezily, ‘you buy me a stone when I’m dead.’</p>
<p>‘Thanks, Uncle. All right, I’ll take them. And I really will get you
a stone.’</p>
<p>‘That’s it, then. You heard that, lads.’ The sick man was finding it
hard to speak, and he bent double again, choking.</p>
<p>‘Sure, we heard,’ said one of the drivers. ‘Get going, Sergey, or the
boss’ll be back. That Shirkin lady’s not well, you know.’</p>
<p>Sergey slipped off his worn-out boots - they were too big for him -
and chucked them under the bench. Uncle Fyodor’s new boots fitted him
nicely, and Sergey looked down at them as he walked out to the
carriage.</p>
<p>‘Nice pair of boots! Let me grease them for you,’ said a driver with
a handful of axle grease as Sergey got up on his box and gathered the
reins. ‘Got ’em for nothing?’</p>
<p>‘Not jealous, are you?’ Sergey replied, half-rising and tucking the
bottom of his coat round his legs. ‘Forget it! Come on, me beauties!’ he
cried to the horses, cracking the whip, and the two carriages - one
large and one small, with their drivers, bags and baggage - disappeared
into the grey autumn mist, rocking as they sped away down the wet
road.</p>
<p>The sick driver was left behind on his stove in the stuffy hut.
Unable to stifle his coughing, he made a big effort, turned on to his
other side and lay there still and quiet.</p>
<p>The hut was busy until late in the day with people coming and going
and having their supper. Not a sound came from the sick man. As night
drew on, the cook climbed up on to the stove and reached across his legs
to get at her long coat.</p>
<p>‘Don’t moan at me, Nastasya,’ said the sick man. ‘I’ll soon make room
for you in this corner.’</p>
<p>‘All right. All right. Don’t go on about it. ’Taint nothing,’
muttered Nastasya. ‘Where’s ithurt, Uncle? You can tell me.’</p>
<p>‘It’s me insides. All gone wrong. God knows what.’</p>
<p>‘Throat giving you trouble, with all that coughing?’</p>
<p>‘It all hurts. Time for me to die - and that’s it. Oh, oh, oh …’
moaned the sick man.</p>
<p>‘Cover your feet up. ’Ere, like this,’ said Natasha, clambering down
and pulling his coat over him as she did so.</p>
<p>A night light burned feebly in the hut. Nastasya and a dozen drivers
were asleep on the floor or on benches, snoring loudly. Only the sick
man could be heard wheezing and coughing as he tossed and turned on the
stove. When morning came he was completely quiet.</p>
<p>‘I’ve had a fantastic dream,’ said the cook, stretching herself in
the half-light of a new morning. ‘Uncle Fyodor got down from the stove
and went out to chop some wood. “Come on, Nastasya,” he says. “Let me
give you some help.” And I says to him, “How can you go out chopping
wood?” but off he goes with the axe, chopping away like mad and the
chips flying everywhere. “What’s all this?” I says. “I thought you was
ill.” He says, “No, I’m all right now”, and he swings that axe round -
scared me stiff, he did. I shouted out and woke up. He’s not dead, is
he? Uncle Fyodor. Hey, Uncle!’</p>
<p>Fyodor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>‘I wonder if he has died. Ought to go and have a look,’ said one of
the drivers, who had just woken up.</p>
<p>The scrawny arm dangling down from the stove, covered in reddish
hair, was cold and pale.</p>
<p>‘Go and tell the boss it looks like he’s dead,’ said the driver.</p>
<p>Fyodor didn’t have any relatives - he came from miles away. They
buried him the next day in the new cemetery beyond the wood, and for
several days Nastasya went around telling everybody about her dream and
how she had been the first to find out Uncle Fyodor was dead.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>It was now spring. Gurgling rivulets of water ran down the wet city
streets, scurrying between frozen chunks of manure; people bustled about
in a bright display of colour and sound given off by their clothing and
their chatter. In little fenced-off gardens the buds had begun to swell
on the trees, and you could just catch the murmur of branches rocking in
the breeze. Limpid droplets dripped and trickled everywhere … Sparrows
squawked and twittered amidst a fluttering of tiny wings. On the sunny
side, on fences, houses and trees, everything shimmered and shone. Joy
and youth shone in the sky, and on earth and in the heart of man.</p>
<p>One of the main streets, outside a large house belonging to a member
of the gentry, had been strewn with fresh straw; inside, the lady who
had been rushing to travel abroad lay dying.</p>
<p>The sick lady’s husband and an elderly woman stood by the closed
doors of her room. On the sofa sat a priest with downcast eyes, holding
on to something wrapped in his stole. In one corner an old woman
reclined in a high-backed armchair - the sick lady’s mother - weeping
bitter tears. At her side, holding a clean handkerchief, stood a maid
waiting to be called; another maid was using some sort of cloth to
massage the old woman’s temples while she blew upon her grey head under
her cap.</p>
<p>‘Christ be with you, my dear,’ said the husband of an elderly lady
standing with him by the door. ‘She has so much faith in you, and you
know exactly how to talk to her. Try and persuade her, as nicely as you
can. Go in and see her.’</p>
<p>He was about to open the door for her, but she, a cousin of the
invalid, stopped him, pressed a handkerchief to her eyes several times,
and shook her head.</p>
<p>‘Now I don’t look as if I’ve been crying,’ she said, opening the door
herself and walking through.</p>
<p>The husband was in a state of extreme agitation; he looked
distraught. He set off towards the old woman, but within a few strides
he turned away and headed for the priest. The priest looked at him,
raised his eyebrows to Heaven and sighed. His thick beard, shot through
with grey, also raised and lowered itself.</p>
<p>‘My God, my God!’ said the husband.</p>
<p>‘What can we do?’ said the priest with another sigh, and once again
his eyebrows and his short beard were raised and lowered.</p>
<p>‘And her mother’s here!’ said the husband, on the verge of despair.
‘That will finish her off. So much love, so much love for her, and she…
oh, I don’t know. Maybe you could comfort her, Father, and get her to go
away.’</p>
<p>The priest got up and went to the old lady.</p>
<p>‘Quite so,’ he said. ‘No one can appreciate a mother’s heart. But God
is merciful.’</p>
<p>The old lady’s face suddenly started to twitch all over, and she was
retching with hysteria.</p>
<p>‘God is merciful,’ continued the priest once she was a little calmer.
‘I can tell you this. In my parish there was a man who was ill - much
worse than Marya Dmitrievna - and - do you know what? - he was cured in
no time by a tradesman with some herbs. And you’ll find that tradesman
alive in Moscow today. I was just saying to Vasily Dmitrievich that we
might give him a try. At least it would bring some comfort to the poor
woman. For God, all things are possible.’</p>
<p>‘No, she’s not going to live,’ put in the old woman. ‘It should be
me, but God’s taking her.’ And her hysterical retching came on so
strongly that she fell into a faint.</p>
<p>The invalid’s husband buried his face in his hands and rushed out of
the room.</p>
<p>Out in the passage the first person he ran into was a six-year-old
boy chasing a younger girl as fast as his legs would carry him.</p>
<p>‘What would you like me to do? Should I take the children in to see
their mother?’ asked the nanny.</p>
<p>‘No, she doesn’t want to see them. It will upset her.’</p>
<p>The boy stopped for a moment, looked his father straight in the face,
lashed out with his foot and ran off again yelling with delight.</p>
<p>‘She’s being a black horse, Daddy!’ cried the little boy, pointing to
his sister.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the next room the invalid’s cousin was sitting at her
side, conducting a forced conversation in which she was trying to
prepare her for death. The doctor stood by another window, stirring his
drink.</p>
<p>The sick woman was sitting up in bed, clad in a white dressing-gown
and beset with pillows on every side, watching her cousin in
silence.</p>
<p>‘Oh, my dear friend,’ she said, suddenly interrupting, ‘don’t prepare
me. Don’t treat me like a child. I’m a Christian. I know it all. I know
I haven’t got long to live, and I know that if only my husband had
listened to me I’d have been in Italy by now, and I might have been
better - I probably would have been. Everybody told him. But there’s
nothing we can do. It seems to have been God’s will. We all bear many
sins, I know that, but I trust in God’s mercy that all will be forgiven.
It must surely be that all will be forgiven. I am trying to come to
terms with myself. I too have borne many sins, my dear. But think how
much I have suffered. I’ve tried to bear my sufferings with
patience…’</p>
<p>‘So, should I tell the priest to come in? You’ll feel better when
you’ve taken communion,’ said her cousin.</p>
<p>The invalid inclined her head in agreement.</p>
<p>‘God forgive me, sinner that I am,’ she whispered.</p>
<p>Her cousin went out and winked at the holy father.</p>
<p>‘She’s an angel!’ she said to the husband with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>The husband burst into tears, the priest walked in through the door,
the old woman was still lost to the world, and in the room itself all
was completely quiet. Five minutes later the priest emerged from the
room, took off his stole and ran a hand through his hair.</p>
<p>‘Thank God she’s calmer now,’ he said. ’She wants to see you.</p>
<p>The cousin and the husband went in. The invalid was weeping softly,
looking at an icon.</p>
<p>‘Well done, my darling,’ said her husband.</p>
<p>‘Thank you! I feel so well now. I feel a kind of sweetness,’ said the
invalid, a gentle smile playing on her thin lips. ‘God is so merciful!
Isn’t that right? So merciful, and omnipotent.’ And she looked at the
icon again, her eyes brimming with tears and eager with
supplication.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she seemed to remember something. She beckoned her
husband closer. ‘You never want to do what I ask,’ she said in a feeble
and petulant voice.</p>
<p>Her husband craned his neck, listening submissively. ‘What’s that,
darling?’</p>
<p>‘How many times have I told you the doctors are ignorant? There are
folk healers, and they can cure people… The priest was telling me just
now… about a tradesmari … Send for him.’</p>
<p>‘Who?’</p>
<p>‘Oh God! You’re determined not to understand! …’ The invalid scowled
and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>The doctor came over and took her hand. Her pulse was getting
noticeably weaker and weaker. He winked at the husband. The invalid
noticed the gesture and looked round in alarm.</p>
<p>‘Don’t cry, and torment yourself or me,’ said the patient. ‘You’re
taking away my last consolation.’</p>
<p>‘You’re an angel!’ said her cousin, kissing her hand.</p>
<p>‘No. Kiss me here. Only dead people get kissed on the hand. Oh God!
Oh God!’</p>
<p>By that evening the patient had become a body, and the body lay in
its coffin in the biggest room in the large house. A deacon sat alone in
that great room with the doors wide open, intoning the Psalms in a nasal
voice. A bright waxy light fell from the tall silver candlesticks on to
the pallid face of the dead lady, the heavy waxen hands and the frozen
folds of her pall, which stuck up horribly at her knees and toes. The
deacon droned on, with no understanding of his words - words which rang
out and died away horribly. Now and then the sounds of children’s voices
and their rumpus floated in from a distant room.</p>
<p>‘Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled,’ ran the psalter. ‘Thou
takest away their breath, they die and return to their dust. Thou
sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created, and Thou renewest the face
of the earth. The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever.’</p>
<p>The face of the dead lady was stern, tranquil and majestic. Neither
on her clear cold brow nor on her tightly closed lips was there any
movement. She was all ears. But was she even now understanding those
solemn words?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>A month later a stone chapel had been erected above the dead lady’s
grave. Above the driver’s grave the stone had yet to appear; nothing
more than bright green grass came up from the mound that served as the
only indication of the past existence of a man.</p>
<p>‘It’ll be a sin on your conscience,’ said the cook one day at the
post station, ‘if you don’t buy a stone for Fyodor. You kept on saying,
“It’s winter. It’s winter,” but now it’s different - why don’t you keep
your promise? You know I witnessed it. He’s been back once to ask why
you haven’t bought it. Next time he’ll throttle you.’</p>
<p>‘What are you on about? Have I gone back on my word?’ Sergey
answered. ‘I’m going to buy him a stone, like I said, and I will. I’ll
shell out one and a half roubles. I haven’t forgotten, but it’s got to
be fetched. When I’m in town I’ll go and buy it.’</p>
<p>‘At least you ought to stick a cross up, that’s what I says,’ put in
an old driver. ‘ ’Tis just plain wrong if you don’t. You’m wearing his
boots.’</p>
<p>‘Where am I going to get a cross from? I can’t chop one out of a
log.’</p>
<p>‘Can’t chop one out of a log - what are you talking about? Take your
axe, get yourself out in the forest first thing, and you can cut one
there. Go on, cut a little ash tree down … and there’s your cross.
Either that or buy the forester a few drinks. Doesn’t mean you’ve got to
treat him for any old bit of rubbish. Couple of days ago when I broke me
splinter bar I cut meself a smashing new one, and nobody said nothing
about it.’</p>
<p>Early next morning at the crack of dawn Sergey took his axe and went
into the woods.</p>
<p>Everything was covered with a cold blanket of dew that was still
settling, untouched by the sun. The east was getting imperceptibly
brighter, reflecting its feeble light on the vault of heaven that was
still thinly veiled with clouds. Not a blade of grass below, not a leaf
on the topmost branches stirred. Only now and then the disturbing sounds
of wings flapping in the brushwood or a rustling on the ground intruded
on the silence of the forest. Then suddenly a strange noise, alien to
the world of nature, rang out and died away on the edge of the forest.
But the noise came again and repeated itself rhythmically at the bottom
of the trunk of one of the motionless trees. One of the treetops gave an
unusual shudder, its sappy leaves whispering, and a little robin who had
been sitting on one of its branches gave a chirrup and flitted about a
couple of times before cocking its tail and transferring to another
tree.</p>
<p>Down below, the ring of the axe sounded more and more muffled, sappy
white splinters flew down on to the dewy grass, and through the chopping
came a slight creaking sound. The tree shook throughout its whole body,
lurched over and quickly straightened up, wobbling with alarm upon its
roots. Everything was quiet for a moment, but then the tree lurched
again, another creak came from its trunk, and with its branches snapping
and its boughs dangling it crashed down crown first on to the damp
ground. The sounds of chopping and the footsteps stopped. The robin gave
a chirrup and fluttered up higher. Its wings snagged against a twig,
which shook for a moment or two before settling its leaves like all the
others. The trees revelled in the beauty of their branches all the more
joyously in the newly created space.</p>
<p>The first rays of the sun found their way through the thinning
clouds, shone out against the sky and ran across the ground and sky
together. Mist rolled down the valleys in waves, the dew glittered as it
toyed with the greenery, and limpid whitening cloudlets sped across the
azure firmament. Birds stirred in the thickets, twittering their happy
song for all they were worth. On high, the succulent leaves whispered in
peace and joy, and the boughs of the living trees slowly stirred
themselves, looking down in majesty on the dead tree that lay flat out
on the ground.</p>
