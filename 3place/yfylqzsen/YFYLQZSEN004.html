<h4 id="the-death-of-ivan-ilyich">THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH</h4>
<p>Yet there is no doubt about the devastating power of this harrowing
narrative. Its literary quality, founded on grim descriptive realism and
remarkable psychological insight, stands beyond dispute. Many people
have claimed this as Tolstoy’s finest work apart from the big novels,
and it has gained an international reputation. To take a well-known
example, among its many admirers was the French writer Guy de
Maupassant, for whom this was the last work of literature that he read
before he died, and after reading it he is reported to have signed off
with these unhappy words: ’I realize that everything I have done was to
no purpose and that my ten volumes are worthless.’4 The reasons behind
this widely acknowledged success are not far to seek.</p>
<p>The Death of Ivan Ilyich is an object lesson in style, construction
and the sensitive use of language (much of which is apparent even in
translation). The author has abandoned the rich, descriptive and
discursive style of his long novels. Here the pace and tone throughout
are brisk and businesslike; once the funeral is over (Chapter I) there
is nothing digressive, leisurely or poetic. The narrative process is one
of relentless compression, a steady tightening of resources until the
pressure becomes all but unbearable. Like life itself, the story begins
expansively, gradually narrows and then ends in small sections rapidly
falling away. The first six chapters decrease in size one by one, then
Chapters 7 and 8 open out again to slightly greater length, before
issuing in a swift succession of the very shortest chapters to end the
story. Even the paragraphs and sentences get shorter and shorter; time
shrinks, and the sense of gathering urgency is unmistakable.</p>
<p>Increasingly, as the illness progresses and Ivan’s understanding of
it develops, the author grinds out his agonizing story with forensic
efficiency. This is directed not at the illness itself, which remains a
mystery to us. One day, hanging curtains in his new flat, Ivan has a bit
of a fall and bumps his side. From this trivial accident he sustains an
illness that most commentators have taken to be cancer, though in our
era it is considered rare for physical trauma to have any such result,
just as some of the symptoms (such as a bad taste in the mouth) do not
seem particularly relevant. But the details do not matter, and in any
case Tolstoy held the medical profession in such contempt that he would
have been delighted to defy any of their theories or pronouncements.
This story loses no opportunity to excoriate the doctors with bitter
satire. Tolstoy’s clinical exactitude is directed at the progress of
Ivan’s condition and its effect on the sufferer, an inexorable
progression from bemusement through panic to a crescendo of intolerable
pain as this terrible affliction crushes the sufferer simultaneously in
body and mind.</p>
<p>Terrible contrasts sharpen our perception of what is going on: the
wholesome past versus the unhealthy present; young flesh compared with
an ageing and decaying body; large swathes of hypocrisy and indifference
set against spontaneous love emanating (rather unrealistically) from
only two people, Ivan’s servant Gerasim and his son Vasya; the turning
of the tables as Ivan Ilyich Golovin changes from arbiter to supplicant
when faced with a doctor:</p>
<p>It was just like being in court. The way he looked at the accused in
court was exactly the way he was being looked at now by the famous
doctor.</p>
<p>The judge is judged; the sentencer is being sentenced. The power of
such writing does justice to the awful importance of its theme. This
story stands as one of the most effective memento mori statements in
world literature. And the real reason for this is that, for all his
implicit condemnation of Ivan Ilyich’s way of living, Tolstoy warms to
his man as he dies. Far from transmitting a sense of individual
schadenfreude, he writes with the kind of compassion that unites us all
in confronting the terrible predicament of our mortality.</p>
<p>THREE DEATHS AND MORE</p>
<p>The reason for the success of The Death of Ivan Ilyich is that its
didactic purpose (an instruction for us to reappraise our lives and to
promote love as the only standard to live by) is thoroughly integrated
into a compelling narrative. Tolstoy varies in his ability to pull off
this trick, as is demonstrated by the other stories in this collection.
All of them are strong in narrative interest, all of them have an inner
message to convey, but the emphasis changes from story to story. An
early tale, ‘Three Deaths’ (1859), has very little purpose other than to
tell us how to die. An aristocratic lady, an old peasant and a tree
perform this deed for us, and the message is clear: stay close to nature
and the dying will be easy; deathbed agony awaits the educated
sophisticates of modern society who have left nature behind. This is
Tolstoy at his most simplistic, but the tale has its positive qualities
- striking portraiture, natural dialogue, touching descriptions of the
natural world, a succinct style of writing - and they make for a half
hour of pleasurable reading.</p>
<p>Two other early stories, ‘The Raid’ (1853) and ‘The Woodfelling’
(1855), foreshadow later works by Tolstoy that will look realistically
at warfare and cast doubts on its glory; the former is particularly
strong in its depiction of soldiers doing what they are paid to do,
which includes killing and being killed. These tales have a painfully
enduring relevance because they describe military events in an area on
the border between Europe and Asia which for generations has known
nothing but a feuding and tribal conflict that is still alive today. The
region was then, and is now, also at the interface been two great
religions, Islam and Christianity. We are speaking of Chechnya, that
arid, mountainous enclave which could be a beautiful homeland to take
pride in, but for the warring antagonism that no one seems able to
transcend or dispel. The military town of Grozny, a fearful name even in
today’s newspapers, was at the centre of things in Tolstoy’s two
stories, though they both take place in the same nearby countryside. In
each case an order is received by a military detachment, which marches
off to do its duty, taking with it a shrewd and articulate observer who
will give us the atmosphere and tell us what happens. The assignment is
achieved, but at severe cost; lives are lost on both sides, and
particularly poignant are the deaths of two young men, Alanin in the
former story and Velenchuk in the latter. The individualized tragedies
of these youngsters, so poignantly described, are more eloquent than the
piles of corpses littering the field on Tolstoy’s broader military
canvases (The Sevastopol Stories and War and Peace). These small
narratives are among his masterpieces. They both tell a compelling
story, filling it out with topographical detail from mountains to
midges, warm portraiture based on close psychological observation, and a
modicum of gently delivered moral instruction. There are strong
underlying contrasts between brutality and civilization, youth and
maturity, simple local people and more sophisticated intruders, the
beauty of the natural scene and the horrors of soldiery, but these are
not pressed upon us by too earnest a teacher. You will take pleasure
from the telling of the story, but you will probably also be persuaded
to think over some serious ideas, about honour and glory,
self-dramatization and sincerity, egoism and courage - the whole meaning
of going to war, and how it affects both the guiding political minds and
the lads who do the fighting and dying. Our present-day war
correspondents still tell the same tales, some of them set in the same
region.</p>
<p>The preoccupation with violence and death shown in these early
stories is still in Tolstoy’s mind half a century later, as we can see
in two very late works, ‘After the Ball’ (1903) and ‘The Forged Coupon’
(1905). The first of these is a remarkable story that was written in a
single day. The critic A. N. Wilson ranks it with the very greatest
things Tolstoy ever wrote.5 Its power is drawn from the shocking
contrast between two opposite personalities displayed by an elderly
colonel, seen first at a ball dancing serenely with his daughter and
charming the company, and then, the following morning, enthusiastically
directing a gruesome ceremony in which an army deserter is made to run
the gauntlet, and beaten so viciously that his death seems certain.
Needless to say, the narrator’s love for the colonel’s daughter does not
long survive this ghastly experience. ‘The Forged Coupon’ is a morality
piece with strong narrative interest, in which a small transgression -
the forging of a banknote — leads inexorably to a series of much more
serious crimes, including multiple murder, and then, less convincingly,
to salvation for the main characters. The neatness of construction and
the simplicity of Tolstoy’s writing are strong features of this work; it
has been disregarded not for any real faults, but because its posthumous
publication went largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>One of Tolstoy’s most accomplished and moving novellas is Polikushka,
written in 1863, at the end of the long literary apprenticeship that was
about to produce two of the world’s greatest novels. It tells the story
of Polikey (also known as Polikushka), a peasant horse doctor given to
drunkenness and petty crime, who reforms himself with great effort and
is rewarded by his mistress when she excuses him from the military
conscription that he seems to deserve. But he then loses a large sum of
money entrusted to him, and the results are catastrophic. The build-up
of suspense in this tale is painful because there is so much at stake
for so many people. The village is required to provide men for military
service, and Polikey ought to be sent because he has a bad record. But
the mistress supports him, so they must send someone else. The choice is
an agonizing one: conscripts could be retained for long periods, up to
twenty years, and many never returned. So we have two things to worry
about: whether Polikey will continue to withstand temptation and become
a good member of the community, and how the conscription problem will be
solved. The stakes are high, the characters — mostly from the peasant
class — are among Tolstoy’s most memorable portraits, and the undeserved
outcome has a terrible twist of ironic inevitability. Best of all,
Tolstoy has built up a powerful case against warfare, conscription and
violence, without our really noticing what he has been up to. This is
one of his short masterpieces.</p>
<p>THE DEATH OF LEO NIKOLAYEVICH</p>
<p>Considering the time and effort expended by this famous man in an
effort to confront death and prepare himself for the end, the death of
Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy was a disastrous shambles. The apostle of love
and charity ran away from his devoted wife in a spirit of bitter
malevolence and fell ill at a railway station, where he died a few days
later, surrounded by six doctors, a police chief, government officials
and an elder from the nearby monastery, even though he had rejected all
the institutions they represented. His wife was excluded from the
company until the very end, when he was unconscious. One or two of his
hardline disciples were present, but they failed to carry through an
experiment which Tolstoy had thought up in anticipation of a lingering
death. Ten years before, he had written in his diary, ’When I am dying I
should like to be asked whether I still see life as … a progression
towards God, an increase of love. If I should not have the strength to
speak, and the answer is yes, I shall close my eyes. If it is no I shall
look up.’6 They knew of this, but no one asked him.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that, throughout his life, Tolstoy wanted to tell us
all how we should conduct our lives, how we should love other people as
a first priority, and how we should learn to die well. But the only way
to do any of this would be to treat his life story like one of his
cautionary tales, as an object lesson in how not to love and how not to
prepare for death. On the subject of love, he behaved like Ivan
Karamazov, Dostoyevsky’s rationalist ideologue who found it easy to love
the whole of humanity but had great difficulty in loving his next-door
neighbour. Tolstoy’s uncharitable treatment, over many years, of his
wife and of all those close to him (except a few devoted disciples)
remains as a stain on his reputation. On the subject of death, his
oblique and unintended lessons are that we should not become obsessed
with dying and death as he did, and that there is little point in raging
incessantly against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>However, his art is so powerful that it frequently achieves a
didactic purpose by dispersing it in a strong solution of distracting
entertainment. At its (frequent) best, Tolstoy’s writing sharpens our
sense of being alive, even if our lives are rather ordinary ones. This
accords with his claim (in a letter of 1865) that the first aim of art
is to make people love life in its countless manifestations, which
applies even when the subject matter is death. At the same time he
persuades us also to consider the deeper issues that interest him, thus
raising our perceptions and aspirations. It may not be quite what the
master wanted, but we remain thankful for his existence and achievement,
first because of the wonderful storytelling and portraiture, and then
the thoughtful provocation and the inspiring affirmation of the life
spirit as presented in War and Peace, Anna Karenina and a broad range of
Tolstoy’s stories, some of the best of which are represented in this
volume.</p>

<p>THE RAID</p>
<p>A Volunteer’s Story</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>On July 12th Captain Khlopov came through the low door of my mud hut,
complete with epaulettes and sabre. This was the first time I had seen
him in full dress uniform since my arrival in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>‘I’ve come straight from the colonel’s,’ he said in reply to my
quizzical look. ‘Our battalion is moving out tomorrow.’</p>
<p>‘Where to?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘To N — . All the forces are to assemble there.’</p>
<p>‘And from there they’ll make some sort of attack, will they?’</p>
<p>‘I think so.’</p>
<p>‘But in which direction? What do you think?’</p>
<p>‘What should I think? I’m telling you what I know. Last night a
Tartar galloped over from the general with orders for the battalion to
move out with two days’ biscuit rations. As to where, why and for how
long - well, we don’t ask such questions, my friend. Orders are orders
and that’s that.’</p>
<p>‘But if you are taking rations for only two days, that means the
troops won’t be away longer than that, doesn’t it?’</p>
<p>‘No, it doesn’t mean a thing …’</p>
<p>‘Why not?’ I asked, very surprised.</p>
<p>‘Because that’s how it is here. When we went to Dargo we took a
week’s rations, but we were there almost a month!’</p>
<p>‘Can I go with you?’ I asked, after a brief silence.</p>
<p>‘Yes, you can, but I wouldn’t advise it. Why run risks?’</p>
<p>‘Well, please allow me to ignore your advice. I’ve been waiting here
a whole month just for the chance of seeing some action and you want me
to miss it!’</p>
<p>‘You must do as you think fit, but in my opinion you should stay
behind. You could do a spot of hunting while you’re waiting for us,
while we would go and do what we have to. That would be splendid for
you!’</p>
<p>He spoke with such conviction that for a moment I really did think it
would be splendid. But then I bluntly told him that nothing would induce
me to stay behind.</p>
<p>‘But what do you expect to see there?’ the captain went on, still
trying to dissuade me. ‘If you really want to know what battles are
like, read Mikhaylovsky-Danilevsky’s Description of War1 — it’s a fine
book and you’ll find all you want there, where each corps was
positioned, how battles are fought.’</p>
<p>‘But it’s just that kind of thing that doesn’t interest me!’ I
replied.</p>
<p>‘What does interest you, then? Want to see how people are killed? In
1832 there was a civilian here, like you … I think he was a Spaniard. He
accompanied us on two expeditions and wore a kind of blue cloak … well,
the poor fellow got killed. But that’s nothing new here, my friend.’</p>
<p>However humiliated I felt at the captain’s misinterpretation of my
motives I did not start arguing with him.</p>
<p>‘Was he a brave man?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘God knows! He was always riding out in front and where the fighting
was, there he’d be!’</p>
<p>‘So he must have been brave,’ I said.</p>
<p>‘No. Poking your nose in where you’re not wanted isn’t what I’d call
brave.’</p>
<p>‘Then what would you call brave?’</p>
<p>‘Brave? Brave?’ the captain repeated with the air of someone asking
the question for the very first time. ‘The man who behaves as he ought
to is brave,’ he replied after some thought.</p>
<p>I remembered that Plato had defined bravery as the knowledge of what
should and what should not be feared and, despite the looseness and
vagueness of the captain’s definition, I felt that in their basic ideas
the two definitions were not so different as they might appear and that
the captain’s was even more accurate than the Greek philosopher’s since,
had he been able to express himself as well as Plato, he would most
probably have said that the brave man is the one who fears only what
ought to be feared, and not what should not be feared.</p>
<p>I wanted to explain my idea to the captain. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘it seems
to me that in every danger there is a choice, and the choice that
springs from a sense of duty, for example, is courage, while a choice
made under the influence of base feelings is cowardice. Therefore, the
man who risks his life from vanity, curiosity or greed cannot be called
brave. Conversely, the man who avoids danger from an honest sense of
responsibility to his family, or simply out of conviction, cannot be
called a coward.’</p>
<p>The captain looked at me with rather a strange expression as I spoke.
‘Well, I’m not much good at arguing about such things,’ he said, filling
his pipe, ‘but there’s a cadet here who’s fond of philosophizing. Go and
have a chat with him. He writes poetry too.’</p>
<p>It was only when I was in the Caucasus that I got to know the
captain, but I had heard about him before I left Russia. His mother,
Marya, has a small estate less than two miles from mine. Before I left
for the Caucasus I visited her. The old lady was absolutely delighted
that I would be seeing her Pashenka (her pet name for the elderly,
grey-haired captain) and that, like a ‘talking letter’, I could tell him
all about her and deliver a small parcel. After treating me to some
excellent pie and smoked duck, she went to her bedroom and returned with
a rather large black leather pouch containing an amulet with a black
silk ribbon attached to it.</p>
<p>‘This is the icon of our Lady of the Burning Bush,’ she said,
crossing herself and kissing the icon as she handed it to me. ‘Please
give it to him. You see, when he left for the Caucasus I said prayers
for him and vowed if he remained alive and unharmed I would have this
icon of the Mother of God made for him. For eighteen years Our Lady and
the saints have been merciful to him: not once has he been injured - and
when I think of the battles he’s taken part in! What Mikhailo, who was
with him, told me was enough to make one’s hair stand on end! You
understand - all I know about him is only through others. The dear boy
never writes back about his campaigns for fear of frightening me.’</p>
<p>(Later in the Caucasus I found out — not through the captain, however
— that he had been severely wounded four times but, needless to say, had
not written one word to his mother either about wounds or
campaigns.)</p>
<p>‘So, let him wear this holy image now,’ she continued. ‘My blessing
goes with it. May the Holy Mother of God protect him! Especially in
battles — that’s when he must never forget to wear it. Please tell him,
dear sir, that those are his mother’s wishes.’</p>
<p>I promised to do exactly as she asked.</p>
<p>‘I know you’ll like my Pashenka,’ the old lady went on. ‘He’s a
wonderful man. Why, he never lets a year go by without sending me money.
And he’s a great help to my daughter Annushka, too. And all he has is
his army pay! I shall always be so thankful to God for giving me such a
son,’ she concluded with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>‘Does he write often?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Rarely. Perhaps a few words once a year, when he sends me money, but
not otherwise. “If you don’t hear from me,” he writes, “that means I’m
alive and well. But should anything happen to me, God forbid, they’ll be
sure to let you know!”’</p>
<p>When I gave the captain his mother’s present (it was in my quarters)
he asked me for some paper, carefully wrapped it and put it away. I told
him a great deal about his mother’s life, but he said nothing. When I
had finished, he retired to one corner of the room and took what
appeared to be ages to fill his pipe.</p>
<p>‘Yes, she’s a fine old lady,’ he said from over there in a rather
muffled voice. ‘Will God ever let me see her again?’</p>
<p>In those simple words there was much affection and sadness.</p>
<p>‘Why do you serve here?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘One has to,’ he replied with conviction. ‘The double pay means a lot
for poor devils like me.’</p>
<p>The captain lived frugally: he did not play cards, rarely went out
drinking, and he smoked very cheap tobacco which, for some reason, he
was too proud to call shag, giving it some obscure brand name instead. I
had taken to the captain from the start: he had one of those simple,
calm Russian faces that are easy and pleasant to look straight in the
eye. After this conversation I felt deep respect for him.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Next morning at four o’clock the captain came for me. He wore an old
threadbare coat without epaulettes, wide Caucasian trousers, a sheepskin
cap which once had been white but which was now yellow and tattered; a
rather inferior Asiatic sabre was strapped around his shoulder. His
small white horse ambled along, its head hung low and its thin tail
swinging. Although the good captain’s appearance had nothing
particularly martial or handsome about it, it expressed such equanimity
towards everything around that it could only inspire respect.</p>
<p>I did not keep him waiting, but immediately mounted my horse and
together we rode out of the fortress gates.</p>
<p>The battalion was about five hundred yards ahead of us and resembled
some dense swaying black mass. One could tell that it was the infantry
only from the bayonets, which looked like a bunch of tightly packed
needles, and from the snatches of songs, the beating of a drum and the
delightful voice of the Sixth Company’s second tenor (I had often
admired it back in the fortress) which occasionally reached us. The road
ran along a deep and wide ravine by the side of a small stream in full
spate. Flocks of wild pigeons circled over it, settling on its rocky
banks or turning, swiftly wheeling and disappearing from sight. The sun
was not yet visible, but the top of the right slope of the ravine was
just beginning to brighten. Grey and whitish pebbles, yellow-green moss,
dew-covered Christ’s Thorn bushes, dog-wood and dwarf elm could all be
seen with extraordinary clarity in the limpid, golden light of dawn. But
the other side of the ravine and the valley, which was shrouded in
drifting, smoky layers of dense mist, were damp and gloomy and presented
an elusive medley of colours — pale lilac, shades of black, dark green
and white. Directly in front of us rose the dazzling white masses of
snowy mountains, strikingly clear against the deep azure of the horizon,
their shadows and outlines fantastic but graceful in every detail.
Crickets, dragonflies and myriads of other insects awoke in the tall
grass and filled the air with their clear incessant sounds: it was as if
countless numbers of tiny bells were ringing in our ears. The air
smelled of water, grass, mist — all the scents of a beautiful early
summer’s morning. The captain struck a flint and lit his pipe. I found
the smell of his cheap tobacco and tinder extremely pleasant.</p>
<p>We rode along the side of the road to catch up more quickly with the
infantry. The captain seemed more pensive than usual, never took his
Daghestan pipe from his mouth and at every step prodded his little horse
with his heels. Swaying from side to side, the horse left barely
perceptible, dark green tracks in the tall wet grass. A pheasant flew
out from under its hoofs with that cry and whirr of wings that makes
every huntsman involuntarily start, and then slowly rose into the sky.
The captain didn’t take the slightest notice of it.</p>
<p>We had almost caught up with the infantry when we heard the thud of
hoofs behind us and a very handsome young man in officer’s uniform and
tall white sheepskin cap galloped past, nodding at the captain and
flourishing his whip … I only had time to notice the unique grace with
which he sat in the saddle and held the reins, his beautiful black eyes,
his fine nose and the first signs of a moustache. What I particularly
liked about him was the way he could not stop smiling when he saw us
admiring him. The smile alone showed that he was indeed very young.</p>
<p>‘Where does he think he’s dashing off to?’ the captain muttered with
a dissatisfied look, his pipe still in his mouth.</p>
<p>‘Who is he?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Ensign Alanin, a subaltern from my company. He arrived from the
Cadet Corps only last month.’</p>
<p>‘So this is the first time he’s seen action, is it?’</p>
<p>‘Yes — that’s why he’s so pleased!’ the captain replied, thoughtfully
shaking his head. ‘Youth!’</p>
<p>‘But why shouldn’t he be pleased? I can imagine how interesting it
must be for a young officer.’</p>
<p>For a couple of minutes the captain did not reply.</p>
<p>‘That’s just what I mean by youth!’ the captain continued in his deep
voice. ‘Why be pleased when you haven’t even seen the real thing? When
you’ve seen it a few times you’re not so pleased! Now, I reckon there’s
about twenty officers going into action today and you can bet your life
that someone or other will be killed or wounded. Today it might be me,
and him the day after. So what’s there to be pleased about?’</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The moment the bright sun appeared above the hill and began to light
up the valley through which we were passing, the rolling layers of mist
lifted and it grew hot. The infantry, rifles and kitbags on their backs,
slowly marched along the dusty road. Now and then laughter and the sound
of Ukrainian could be heard in their ranks. A few old campaigners in
white tunics — mostly non-commissioned officers — were walking by the
roadside smoking their pipes and in solemn conversation. Heavily laden
wagons, each drawn by three horses, trundled along, raising clouds of
dust that hung motionless in the air. The officers rode in front. Some
of them were dhzigiting,2 as they say in the Caucasus. That is, they
kept whipping their horses to make them perform three or four leaps and
then jerked their heads backwards to bring them to an abrupt halt.
Others were busy with the singers who untiringly sang song after song,
in spite of the stifling heat.</p>
<p>About two hundred yards ahead of the infantry a tall handsome officer
in Caucasian costume rode with the mounted Tartars on a white stallion.
Renowned in the regiment for his reckless daring, he was not afraid to
tell anyone what he thought of them, no matter who that person was. He
wore a black quilted jacket trimmed with gold lace, leggings to match,
new tight-fitting soft Caucasian boots that were also trimmed with gold,
a yellow Circassian coat and a tall sheepskin cap that was tilted
backwards. Over his chest and back were silver straps, to which a powder
flask and pistol were fastened. Another pistol and a silver-mounted
dagger hung from his belt. Above them was a sword in a red morocco
sheath and a rifle in a black case was slung over his shoulder. From the
way he dressed, his posture in the saddle, his general bearing and
movements, it was obvious that he was trying to look like a Tartar. He
even said something to the Tartars with whom he was riding in a language
I did not understand and I gathered from the bewildered mocking looks
the Tartars gave each other that they did not understand either. He was
one of those young, daredevil officers who model themselves on
Marlinsky’s or Lermontov’s heroes. These young men view the Caucasus
only through the prism of these Mullah Nurs3 and Heroes of Our Time4 and
in everything they do are guided by the example of these models and not
by their own inclinations.</p>
<p>The lieutenant, for example, may well have liked the company of
well-bred women, of high-ranking men such as generals, colonels,
aides-de-camp, and I do not doubt for one moment that he doted on such
company, for he was extremely conceited. Nevertheless, he considered
that it was his solemn duty to show all important people his rough side,
although always in moderation. For example, whenever a lady appeared at
the fortress he considered it his duty to parade beneath her window with
his Tartar friends, wearing only a red shirt and slippers over his bare
feet, shouting and swearing at the top of his voice. But his intention
was not so much to cause offence as to show the lady what fine white
legs he had and how easy it would be for her to fall in love with him,
had he so wished. He would make frequent excursions into the hills with
two or three of his Tartar friends to lie in ambush by the roadside and
kill a few hostile passing Tartars. And although his heart told him more
than once that there was nothing very daring in this, he felt that he
must cause suffering to those who disappointed him for some reason, or
whom he professed to hate or despise. There were two things he always
carried — a large icon which hung round his neck and a dagger which he
wore over his shirt, even in bed. He genuinely believed that he had
enemies and convincing himself that he must take revenge on someone and
wash away some insult with blood brought him the greatest pleasure. He
was quite certain that hatred, vengeance and contempt for the human race
were the noblest and most poetic of emotions. But his mistress (a
Circassian girl, of course), whom I happened to meet later, maintained
that he was the kindest and gentlest of men, and that every evening he
would enter his melancholy thoughts in a diary, draw up his accounts on
ruled paper, and then go down on his knees to pray. And how that man
suffered, just to appear in his own eyes the way he wanted to appear,
for his fellow officers and the soldiers could never see him the way he
wanted to be seen.</p>
<p>Once, during one of those nocturnal expeditions on the road with his
Tartar friends, he happened to wound a hostile Chechen in the leg with a
bullet and took him prisoner. For seven weeks after that incident the
Chechen lived with the lieutenant, who nursed and looked after him as
though he were a bosom friend and then, when he had recovered, loaded
him with presents and let him go. Not long afterwards, during an
engagement, when the lieutenant was retreating with his men, firing as
he went, he heard an enemy soldier call out his name and the Chechen he
had wounded rode out and motioned to him to do the same. The lieutenant
rode out to his Chechen friend and shook hands. The other Chechens kept
their distance and did not shoot, but the moment the lieutenant turned
his horse several of them fired at him and one bullet grazed the small
of his back. Another time, at night, when a fire broke out in the
fortress and two companies of soldiers tried to put it out, I suddenly
saw the tall figure of a man on a black horse, lit up by the red glow,
appear in the crowd. Forcing his way through, he rode right up to the
fire, leapt from his horse and ran into a house, one side of which was
burning. Five minutes later he emerged with singed hair and his arm
badly burnt around the elbow, carrying in his bosom two pigeons he had
rescued from the flames.</p>
<p>His name was Rosenkrantz, but he would often speak of his ancestry,
somehow tracing his origins back to the Varangians,5 thus clearly
proving that he and his ancestors were pure Russians.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>The sun had run half its course and cast its fiery rays through the
glowing air on to the dry earth. The dark blue sky was perfectly clear;
only the foot of the snowy mountains was beginning to be cloaked by
pale, lilac clouds. The motionless air seemed filled with a kind of
transparent dust and the heat was becoming unbearable. When the troops
reached a small stream</p>
<ul>
<li>the halfway stage — they halted. The soldiers stacked rifles and
rushed to the water. The battalion commander sat down on a drum in the
shade. Demonstrating the importance of his rank by the expression on his
face, he prepared to have a snack with his fellow officers. The captain
lay down on the grass under his company’s wagon. The intrepid Lieutenant
Rosenkrantz and some other young officers sat on their outspread cloaks,
intending to make merry, judging from all the bottles and flasks around
them and from the peculiar animation of the singers who stood before
them in a semicircle, whistling and singing a Caucasian dance-song:</li>
</ul>
<p>Shamil thought he would rebel,</p>
<p>In bygone years …</p>
<p>Tra-ra, ra-ta-tai …</p>
<p>In bygone years.</p>
<p>Among these young officers was the young ensign who had overtaken us
that morning. He was extremely amusing — his eyes sparkled, his speech
was rather muddled and he wanted to kiss and declare his love for
everyone … Poor young man! As yet he had no idea that he might look
ridiculous or that the frankness and affection which he lavished on
everyone might arouse only ridicule, and not the affection he greatly
yearned for. Nor did he realize how exceptionally appealing he looked
when, with flushed face, he threw himself at last on to his cloak,
rested on one elbow and tossed back his thick black hair.</p>
<p>Filled with curiosity, I listened to the soldiers’ and officers’
conversations and closely studied their expressions. But I could find
absolutely no trace in any of them of the nervousness I was feeling:
their jokes and laughter, the stories they told — all this was
indicative of their high spirits and their indifference to impending
danger. It was as though it was unthinkable that some of them were fated
never to return by that road.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>After six o’clock that evening, dusty and tired, we passed through
the wide fortified gates of the fortress at N — . The sun was setting
and cast slanting rosy rays on the picturesque batteries, on the gardens
surrounding the fortress, with their tall poplars, on yellow wheat
fields and on the white clouds that hung low over the snow-covered
mountains: as if imitating them, they formed a range that was no less
fantastic and beautiful. On the horizon the new moon was like a tiny
translucent cloud. A Tartar was calling the faithful to prayer from the
roof of a hut in the village just by the fortress gates. Our singers
burst into song again with renewed vigour and energy.</p>
<p>When I had rested and tidied myself up I went to see an aide-de-camp
I knew to ask if he would convey my intentions to the general. On the
way from the suburb where I was billeted I saw things in the fortress of
N — that I had not at all been expecting to see. I was overtaken by a
handsome two-seater carriage in which I caught sight of a fashionable
bonnet and from which I could hear the sound of French. The strains of
some ‘Liza’ or ‘Katenka’ polka played on an out-of-tune piano came from
the open window of the commandant’s house. I passed a tavern where some
clerks with cigarettes in their hands were sitting over glasses of wine
and I could hear one saying to the other, ‘Look here, old chap, when it
comes to politics, Marya Grigorevna is first and foremost amongst the
ladies here.’ A hunchbacked sickly faced Jew in a threadbare coat was
dragging a wheezy old barrel-organ and the whole suburb echoed to the
finale from Lucia. Two women in rustling dresses with silk kerchiefs on
their heads and brightly coloured parasols in their hands glided past me
on the wooden pavement. Two young girls, one in a pink dress, the other
in a blue, stood bareheaded outside a low-roofed cottage and broke into
shrill, forced laughter, evidently to attract the attention of passing
officers. As for the officers, they swaggered up and down the street in
new uniforms, with white gloves and glittering epaulettes.</p>
<p>I found my acquaintance on the ground floor of the general’s house. I
scarcely had time to explain my wish and to hear that there was no
problem in carrying it out when the same handsome carriage I had seen
earlier rattled past the window where we were sitting and stopped at the
entrance. A tall, well-built man in an infantry major’s uniform climbed
out and went into the house.</p>
<p>‘Please excuse me,’ said the aide, getting up. ‘I must go and
announce them to the general immediately.’</p>
<p>‘Who is it?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘The countess,’ he replied, buttoning his uniform as he rushed
upstairs. A few minutes later a short but extremely good-looking man in
a frock-coat without epaulettes and with a white cross in his buttonhole
went out on to the front steps, accompanied by two other officers. The
general’s gait, his voice, his every movement, showed that here was a
man fully conscious of his own worth.</p>
<p>‘Bonsoir, Madame la Comtesse,’ he said, offering his hand through the
carriage window.</p>
<p>A small hand in a kid glove pressed his and a pretty, smiling face in
a yellow bonnet appeared at the window. All I could hear of their
conversation, which lasted several minutes, was the smiling general
saying as I passed, ‘Vous savez que j’ai fait voeu de combattre les
infidèles; prenez donc garde de le devenir.’</p>
<p>Laughter came from the carriage.</p>
<p>‘Adieu donc, cher General.’</p>
<p>‘Non, au revoir,’ said the general as he went up the steps.
‘N’oubliez pas que je m’invite pour la soirée de demain.’</p>
<p>The carriage clattered off down the street.</p>
<p>Now there’s a man, I thought as I walked home, who possesses all that
Russians strive after: rank, wealth, family. And the day before a battle
that could finish God knows how, he can joke with a pretty woman and
promise to have tea with her the next day, just as if they had met at a
ball!</p>
<p>Later, at the aide-de-camp’s house, I met someone who surprised me
even more. He was a young lieutenant from K — Regiment, a man of almost
feminine gentleness and timidity, who had called on the aide to give
vent to his bitterness and annoyance towards certain people who had
apparently intrigued against him to stop him taking part in the
forthcoming action. He maintained that it was very caddish of them, not
the decent thing at all, that he would not forget it, and so on. The
more I scrutinized his face and listened to his voice, the more
convinced I became that he was not play-acting, that he was deeply
resentful and distressed at not being allowed to go and shoot
Circassians and expose himself to their fire. He was as upset as an
unfairly beaten child … I was completely mystified by it all.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>The troops were to move out at ten that night. At half-past eight I
mounted my horse and rode to the general’s house, but on the assumption
that the general and his aide would be busy I stopped in the street,
tied my horse to a fence and waited for him to come out.</p>
<p>The heat and glare of the sun had already given way to the coolness
of night and the soft light of the new moon which was just setting — a
pale, shimmering crescent against the dark, starry sky. Lights appeared
in the windows of the houses and shone through chinks in the shutters of
the mud huts. Beyond those whitewashed moonlit huts with their
rush-thatched roofs, the graceful poplars seemed even taller and darker
on the horizon.</p>
<p>The long shadows of houses, trees and fences formed pretty patterns
on the bright, dusty road … From the river came the incessant, resonant
call of frogs.6 In the streets I could hear hurried footsteps and
voices, a galloping horse. Now and then the sound of the barrel-organ
playing the song ‘The Winds are Gently Blowing’ or some ‘Aurora’ waltz
drifted over from the suburb.</p>
<p>I shall not say what I was thinking about then, firstly because I am
too ashamed to admit to the succession of gloomy thoughts that kept
nagging at me while all around there was only joy and gaiety, and
secondly because they would be quite irrelevant to my narrative. I was
so deep in thought that I did not even notice when the bell struck
eleven and the general rode past me with his suite. I hurriedly mounted
my horse and raced off to catch up with the detachment.</p>
<p>The rearguard was still inside the fortress and I had great
difficulty crossing the bridge, with all those guns, ammunition wagons,
supply carts, and officers shouting out orders. Once through the gates I
trotted past the line of soldiers which stretched in a line almost a
mile long and who were silently moving through the darkness, and finally
I caught up with the general. As I passed the guns drawn out in single
file and the officers riding between them I suddenly heard a voice call
in a German accent, ‘A linshtock, you schwein!’ which struck a jarring,
discordant note amid the quiet solemn harmony, followed by a soldier
hurriedly shouting, ‘Shevchenko! The lieutenant wants a light!’</p>
<p>Most of the sky was overcast with long, dark grey clouds, with only a
few dim stars twinkling here and there. The moon had disappeared behind
the black mountains on the near horizon to the right and shed a faint,
trembling light on their peaks, in sharp contrast to the impenetrable
gloom enveloping their foothills. The air was so warm and still that not
one blade of grass, not one cloud moved. It was so dark that it was
impossible to make out even the closest objects: by the side of the road
I thought I could see rocks, animals, strange people and it was only
when I heard them rustle and smelled the fresh dew that lay on them that
I realized they were only bushes.</p>
<p>Before me I could see a dense, heaving black wall, followed by
several dark spots: this was the cavalry vanguard, and the general and
his suite. Behind us was a similar dark mass, lower than the first: this
was the infantry.</p>
<p>The whole detachment was so quiet that I could distinctly hear all
the mingling sounds of night, so full of enchanting mystery: the
mournful howling of distant jackals, now like a despairing lament, now
like laughter; the sonorous, monotonous song of crickets, frogs, quails;
a rumbling noise whose cause baffled me and which seemed to be coming
ever nearer; and all of Nature’s barely audible nocturnal sounds that
defy explanation or definition and merge into one rich, beautiful
harmony that we call the stillness of night. And now that stillness was
broken by — or rather, blended with — the dull thud of hoofs and the
rustle of the tall grass as the detachment slowly advanced.</p>
<p>Only occasionally did I hear the clang of a heavy gun, the clatter of
clashing bayonets, hushed voices, or a horse snorting. Nature seemed to
breathe with pacifying beauty and power.</p>
<p>Can it be that there is not enough space for man in this beautiful
world, under those immeasurable, starry heavens? Is it possible that
man’s heart can harbour, amid such ravishing natural beauty, feelings of
hatred, vengeance, or the desire to destroy his fellows? All the evil in
man, one would think, should disappear on contact with Nature, the most
spontaneous expression of beauty and goodness.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>We had been on the move for more than two hours. I began to feel
shivery and drowsy. In the darkness I could still catch glimpses of
vague shapes: not far ahead was that same black wall and those same
little moving dots. Close by I could make out the rump of a white horse
swishing its tail, with its hind legs wide apart; the back of a white
Circassian coat with a rifle in a black case swinging against it and a
white pistol butt in an embroidered holster; the glow of a cigarette
lighting up a fair moustache, a beaver collar and a hand in a kid glove.
Every now and then I leant forward over my horse’s neck, closed my eyes
and forgot myself for a few minutes. But then the familiar tramping of
hoofs and rustling would suddenly bring me to my senses and I would
glance round, feeling that I was standing still and that the black wall
in front was moving towards me, or had stopped and I was about to ride
straight into it. At one such moment I was even more conscious of the
unbroken rumbling that I had been unable to explain and which was
drawing nearer. What I had heard was in fact the sound of water. We were
entering a deep gorge and approaching a mountain torrent that was in
full spate at this time of year.7</p>
<p>The roar grew louder, the damp grass became thicker and taller; there
were more bushes and the horizon gradually closed in. Now and then
bright lights flared up here and there in the dark mountains and
immediately vanished.</p>
<p>‘Please tell me what those lights are,’ I whispered to a Tartar
riding beside me.</p>
<p>‘Don’t you know?’ he replied.</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>‘It’s the mountain tribesmen. They tie bundles of straw to poles,
light them and wave them around.’</p>
<p>‘Why are they doing that?’</p>
<p>‘To warn everyone the Russians are coming. They must be running
around like mad in the villages now,’ he added, laughing. ‘Everyone will
be dragging his belongings down into the gorge.’</p>
<p>‘Surely they can’t already know from right up there, in the
mountains, that a detachment is coming?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, they know all right! They always know. We Tartars are like
that!’</p>
<p>‘So Shamil8 too is preparing for action?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘No,’ he replied, shaking his head. ‘Shamil himself won’t be taking
part — he’ll send his henchmen while he watches from up there through a
telescope.’</p>
<p>‘Does he live far away?’</p>
<p>‘No, not very far. About eight miles away, over to the left.’</p>
<p>‘How do you know?’ I asked. ‘Have you been there?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. All our people have been there.’</p>
<p>‘And did you see Shamil?’</p>
<p>‘No! It’s not for the likes of us to see Shamil! He’s always
surrounded by his bodyguards — a hundred, three hundred, perhaps a
thousand of them, with Shamil himself somewhere in the middle!’ he added
with an expression of servile respect.</p>
<p>When I looked up I saw that the sky had cleared and it was growing
brighter in the east, while the Pleiades were sinking towards the
horizon. But it was damp and gloomy in the gorge through which we were
advancing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, not far ahead, several lights flashed in the darkness and
almost instantaneously some bullets whistled past. The shots rang out in
the silence, together with a loud shrill cry from the enemy’s advance
picket, made up of Tartars, who whooped, fired at random and
scattered.</p>
<p>When all was quiet again, the general summoned his interpreter. The
Tartar in the white Circassian coat rode up and had a long talk with
him, gesticulating and whispering.</p>
<p>‘Colonel Khasanov! Tell the men to advance in open order,’ the
general drawled, softly but audibly.</p>
<p>The detachment advanced towards the river, leaving the towering dark
sides of the gorge behind. It began to grow light. The sky immediately
above the horizon, where a few pale stars could just be seen, seemed
higher. The dawn glowed brightly in the east, while from the west blew a
fresh, piercing breeze; shimmering mist rose like steam over the rushing
river.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Our scout showed us the ford and the cavalry vanguard, followed by
the general and his suite, started crossing the river. The water, which
came up to the horses’ chests, rushed with tremendous force between the
white boulders which appeared here and there above the surface, and
foamed and eddied around the animals’ legs. Startled by the noise, the
horses lifted their heads and pricked up their ears, but they stepped
carefully and steadily against the current, over the uneven riverbed.
The riders lifted their feet and weapons; the infantry, in literally
nothing but their shirts, and holding above the water their rifles, to
which their clothes were tied in bundles, linked arms in groups of
twenty and struggled bravely against the current, the enormous strain
clearly showing in their faces. The mounted artillerymen gave a loud
shout and drove their horses into the water at a trot. Now and then the
water splashed over the guns and green ammunition wagons whose wheels
rang against the bottom. But the sturdy little horses all pulled
together, churning the water, until finally they clambered up on to the
opposite bank with dripping manes and tails.</p>
<p>Immediately the crossing was completed, the general’s face suddenly
became thoughtful and serious. He turned his horse and trotted off with
his cavalry down the broad glade which opened out in the middle of the
forest before us; a cordon of Cossacks spread out around the edges.</p>
<p>In the forest we spotted a man on foot dressed in a Circassian coat
and a tall sheepskin cap … then a second … and a third … One of the
officers said, ‘They’re Tartars’, and at that moment a puff of smoke
appeared from behind a tree, followed by the report, then another. Our
rapid fire drowned the enemy’s and only occasionally did a bullet come
flying past with a sound like the slow buzz of a bee, as if to show us
that not all the shots were ours. First the infantry, at the double,
followed by the field guns at a trot, joined the cordon. I could hear
the guns booming, then the metallic sound of flying grapeshot, the hiss
of rockets, the crackle of rifles. All over the broad glade could be
seen cavalry, infantry and artillery. Puffs of smoke from the guns,
rockets and rifles mingled with the dewy verdure and the mist. Colonel
Khasanov galloped over to the general and sharply reined in his
horse.</p>
<p>‘Your Excellency,’ he said, touching his cap, ‘shall I order the
cavalry to charge? The enemy’s colours are in sight.’ And he pointed
with his whip at some mounted Tartars headed by two men on white horses
bearing poles decorated with bits of red and blue cloth.</p>
<p>‘Carry on — and good luck!’ the general replied.</p>
<p>The colonel turned his horse on the spot, drew his sabre and shouted,
‘Hurrah!’</p>
<p>‘Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!’ echoed from the troops and the cavalry flew
after him.</p>
<p>Everyone watched with great enthusiasm as one colour appeared, then a
second, a third, fourth, fifth …</p>
<p>Without waiting for us to attack, the enemy hid in the forest from
where they opened fire with their rifles. The bullets flew thicker.</p>
<p>‘Quel charmant coup d’oeil!’ the general remarked, rising slightly,
English-style, in the saddle of his slim-legged black horse.</p>
<p>‘Charrmant,’ replied the major, rolling his r’s and striking his
horse as he rode over to the general. ‘C’est un vrrai plaisirr que la
guerre dans un aussi beau pays,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘Et surtout en bonne compagnie,’ the general added, pleasantly
smiling. The major bowed.</p>
<p>Just then, an enemy cannon ball flew past with a nasty hiss and
struck something. Behind us we heard the moan of a wounded soldier. This
moan had such a peculiar effect on me that the spectacle immediately
lost all its charm. However, I seemed to be the only one to notice it —
the major was laughing with great gusto; another officer was repeating
with the utmost composure what he had just been saying; and the general
was looking the other way and saying something in French with the most
tranquil of smiles.</p>
<p>‘Shall we return their fire?’ the artillery commander asked,
galloping up.</p>
<p>‘Yes, let’s give them a fright!’ the general replied nonchalantly,
lighting a cigar.</p>
<p>The battery took up position and the firing began. The earth groaned
under the shots, lights continually flashed and my eyes were blinded by
the clouds of smoke through which it was almost impossible to make out
the gun crews at work.</p>
<p>The village was bombarded and Colonel Khasanov galloped up once more
and then rode off to it at the general’s command. The war cry rang out
again and the cavalry disappeared in clouds of dust. It was a truly
magnificent scene. But the one thing that spoilt the general impression
for me, an inexperienced onlooker, who had not taken part, was all that
movement, animation and shouting, which seemed quite superfluous. I
could not help comparing it to a man swinging an axe to cut only thin
air.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Our troops had occupied the village, in which not one of the enemy
was left by the time the general arrived with his suite, to which I had
attached myself. The long clean huts with their flat earthen roofs and
pretty chimneys were scattered over small stony hillocks, through which
flowed a stream. On one side were green sunlit gardens with enormous
pear and plum trees, while on the other were the strange shadows cast by
the tall, erect headstones in the cemetery and the long poles with balls
and multicoloured flags fixed to their ends which marked the graves of
the dhzigits, the bravest warriors.</p>
<p>The troops were drawn up outside the gates.</p>
<p>A few moments later dragoons, Cossacks and infantrymen poured down
the crooked lanes with evident delight and the deserted village
immediately sprang to life. Somewhere a roof came crashing down, an axe
rang out against a strong wooden door. Somewhere else a haystack, a
fence and a hut were set on fire and a thick column of smoke rose into
the clear air. A Cossack dragged a sack of flour and a carpet along; a
soldier emerged from a hut, gleefully carrying a tin basin and some bits
of old cloth. Another, with outstretched arms, was trying to catch two
hens that were cackling and beating their wings by a fence. A third
soldier, who had found a huge pot of milk, drank some and then threw it
down with loud guffaws.</p>
<p>The battalion with which I had left N — fortress was also in the
village. The captain sat on the roof of a hut smoking his cheap tobacco
and sending streams of smoke from his short pipe with such a casual air
that when I saw him I forgot that I was in an enemy village and felt
quite at home.</p>
<p>‘Ah, so you’re here, too,’ he said when he saw me.</p>
<p>The tall figure of Lieutenant Rosenkrantz flitted around the village.
He gave one order after the other and seemed to have a lot to do. I saw
him emerge from one hut with a triumphant expression, followed by two
soldiers leading an old Tartar whose hands were tied. This old man,
whose only clothing was a gaily coloured but ragged coat and
much-patched trousers, looked so frail that his bony arms, tightly bound
behind his hunched back, seemed about to part company with his
shoulders, and he could hardly drag his bare crooked feet along. His
face, and even part of his shaven head, was deeply furrowed; his
misshapen, toothless mouth with a close-cut grey moustache and beard
around it, was always moving, as if he were chewing. But there was still
a gleam in those red, lashless eyes which quite clearly expressed an old
man’s indifference to life.</p>
<p>Rosenkrantz asked him, through the interpreter, why he had not gone
with the others.</p>
<p>‘Where could I have gone?’ he replied, quietly looking away.</p>
<p>‘Where the others have gone,’ someone suggested.</p>
<p>‘The dhzigits have gone off to fight the Russians, but I’m an old
man.’</p>
<p>‘Aren’t you afraid of the Russians?’</p>
<p>‘What can they do to me? I’m an old man,’ he repeated, nonchalantly
surveying the circle that had formed around him.</p>
<p>Later, when I was returning, I saw that same old man bumping along
behind a Cossack’s saddle, bound and bareheaded, still looking around
with the same indifferent expression. They needed him for an exchange
with Russian prisoners.</p>
<p>I climbed up on to the roof and sat beside the captain.</p>
<p>‘It seems there weren’t very many of the enemy,’ I told him, wishing
to find out his opinion of the raid.</p>
<p>‘The enemy?’ he repeated in surprise. ‘But there wasn’t any enemy! Do
you call that the enemy? Just you wait until this evening when we leave
- they’ll be simply pouring out from over there to speed us on our
way!’</p>
<p>He pointed with his pipe at the small wood through which we had
passed that morning.</p>
<p>‘What’s that?’ I asked anxiously, interrupting the captain and
pointing to a group of Don Cossacks who had gathered around something
not far from us.</p>
<p>Something like a baby’s cry came from there and the words, ‘Hey, stop
… don’t cut it … they’ll see. Got a knife, Yevstigneich? Give it me
…’</p>
<p>‘They’re up to something, the devils,’ the captain calmly remarked.
But just then the handsome ensign, his face flushed and frightened, ran
out. Waving his arms he dashed over to the Cossacks.</p>
<p>‘Don’t touch it! Don’t hurt it!’ he cried in a childlike voice. The
moment they saw the officer, the Cossacks stepped aside and released a
little white kid. The young ensign seemed quite confused, kept muttering
something and stood before them with an embarrassed look. When he saw
the captain and myself on the roof he blushed even deeper and skipped
over to us. ‘I thought they were killing a child,’ he said with a timid
smile.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The general and the cavalry left the village, while the battalion
with which I had come from the fortress formed the rearguard. Captain
Khlopov’s and Lieutenant Rosenkrantz’s companies withdrew together.</p>
<p>The captain’s prediction proved perfectly correct: the moment we
entered the narrow strip of woodland he had mentioned, hostile hillsmen
suddenly appeared everywhere, on both sides of us, mounted and on foot,
and they were so close that I could quite plainly see some of them
running from tree to tree, stooping and with rifles in their hands. The
captain took off his cap, piously crossed himself and some of the older
soldiers followed suit. From the woods we could hear them whooping and
calling, ‘Watch out, Russkies!’ Short, dry rifle shots rang out in quick
succession and bullets whizzed past on both sides. Our men silently
volleyed back at them - only occasionally did I hear shouts from their
ranks such as, ‘It’s all right for him9 in the trees. We ought to use a
gun …’</p>
<p>Finally the guns were brought out and after a few salvoes of
grapeshot the enemy seemed to weaken. But a moment later, with every
step our men advanced, the firing and whooping intensified.</p>
<p>We had withdrawn barely six hundred yards from the village when enemy
cannon balls began to whistle overhead. I saw a soldier killed by one.
But why go into detail over a terrible scene I would give anything to
forget?</p>
<p>Lieutenant Rosenkrantz kept firing incessantly, shouting hoarsely at
his men and galloping at top speed from one end of the line to the
other. He looked rather pale, which perfectly suited his belligerent
face. ‘We’ll beat them back,’ he said convincingly. ‘Oh yes, no doubt
about it!’</p>
<p>‘It’s not necessary,’ the captain replied softly. ‘What we must do is
retreat.’</p>
<p>The captain’s company was holding the edge of the forest and his men
were firing at the enemy in lying position. The captain, in his shabby
coat and crumpled cap, sat on his white horse, the reins held loosely,
his knees bent in the short stirrups. He stayed silent and still: the
soldiers knew their job too well to need any orders. Only now and then
did he raise his voice to shout at anyone who exposed his head.</p>
<p>There was nothing very martial about the captain’s appearance, but it
had much in it that was sincere and natural, which greatly impressed me.
‘Now, there’s a truly brave man,’ I couldn’t help thinking.</p>
<p>He was exactly the same as I had always seen him: those calm
movements, the same even voice, that same ingenuous expression on his
plain but honest face. Only his eyes, which were brighter than usual,
showed the concentration of a man quietly doing his job. It is easy
enough to write that he was ‘the same as always’, but how many different
shades of character had I observed in the others - one trying to appear
calmer than usual, another sterner, a third more cheerful. But the
captain’s face showed that he did not see why he should appear other
than his normal self.</p>
<p>The Frenchman who said at Waterloo, ‘La garde meurt, mais ne se rend
pas’, along with other - particularly French - heroes who uttered such
memorable sayings, were brave and did in fact produce unforgettable
phrases. But there was this difference between their courage and the
captain’s: even if a memorable phrase had stirred in my hero’s heart,
whatever the circumstances, I am quite convinced that he would never
have uttered it. Firstly, because by uttering some memorable phrase he
would have been afraid of spoiling some great deed; and secondly,
because when a man feels he has the strength to perform a great deed,
there is no need for words. In my opinion, this is the distinctive and
noble characteristic of Russian valour. If this is so, then how can a
Russian heart help aching when our young warriors utter trite phrases
that claim to imitate antiquated French chivalry?</p>
<p>Suddenly a rather disjointed and weak ‘Hurrah!’ came from the side
where our handsome young ensign was standing with his platoon. When I
looked round I saw about thirty soldiers with kitbags over their
shoulders and rifles in their hands running over a ploughed field with
very great difficulty. They kept stumbling, but still they ran on,
shouting as they went. In front galloped the young ensign, sabre in
hand. They all disappeared into the forest …</p>
<p>After a few minutes’ whooping and crackling, a frightened horse ran
out of the forest and some soldiers appeared bearing the dead and
wounded. Among the latter was the young ensign. Two soldiers supported
him under the arms. He was as white as a sheet and his handsome face now
showed only a faint shadow of that eagerness for the fray which had
enlivened it a minute earlier. His head had sunk horribly between the
shoulders and dropped on his chest. There was a small bloodstain on the
white shirt beneath his unbuttoned coat.</p>
<p>‘Oh, what a pity!’ I could not help saying as I turned away from that
sad sight.</p>
<p>‘Of course it’s a pity,’ said an old soldier who was standing near
me, mournfully leaning on his rifle. ‘He’s not afraid of anything - how
can anyone go on like that?’ he added, staring at the wounded officer.
‘He’s stupid, too - and now he’s paid for it.’</p>
<p>‘Aren’t you afraid?’</p>
<p>‘What do you think?’</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Four soldiers bore the ensign on a stretcher. Behind them a medical
orderly led a thin, broken-down horse with two green cases of medical
equipment on its back. As they waited for the doctor, a few officers
rode over to the stretcher and tried to comfort and cheer up their
wounded comrade.</p>
<p>‘Well, Alanin old man, it’ll be some time before you go dancing
again!’ Lieutenant Rosenkrantz said with a smile.</p>
<p>He probably thought that these words would help to raise the ensign’s
spirits, but they did not have the desired effect, judging from the
latter’s cold sad look.</p>
<p>Then the captain rode up. He took a close look at the wounded man and
his normally icily indifferent face took on a expression of genuine
sympathy.</p>
<p>‘Well, dear Anatoly,’ he said in a voice of tender concern that I
never expected from him, ‘it seems it was God’s will.’</p>
<p>The wounded man looked round and a sad smile passed over his pale
face. ‘Yes, I disobeyed you.’</p>
<p>‘Let’s say it was God’s will,’ the captain repeated.</p>
<p>The doctor, who had now arrived, took some bandages, a probe and
another instrument from the orderly. Then he rolled up his sleeves and
went over to the ensign with an encouraging smile.</p>
<p>‘Well, it seems they’ve given you a hole where you didn’t have one
before!’ he said in a light-hearted, jocular tone. ‘Let’s have a
look.’</p>
<p>The ensign let the doctor examine him, but the look he gave that
cheery man was of surprise and reproach, which the latter did not
notice. The doctor probed and examined the wound from every angle, but
then the wounded man could stand no more and he pushed the doctor’s hand
away with a deep groan.</p>
<p>‘Leave me,’ he said, barely audibly. ‘I’m going to die anyway.’</p>
<p>With these words, he fell back and five minutes later, when I went
over to the group standing around him and asked one of them, ‘How’s the
ensign?’ the reply was, ‘Passing away.’</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It was late when the detachment, drawn up in a wide column and
singing as it went, approached the fortress.</p>
<p>The sun was hidden behind the snowy mountain ridge and cast its dying
pink rays on a long thin cloud that hung motionless over the clear
horizon. The snow-covered mountains were becoming enveloped in a lilac
mist and only the highest peaks stood out, amazingly distinct against
the crimson glow of sunset. A transparent moon, long risen, was growing
pale against the deep azure of the sky. The green of the grass and the
trees darkened and became covered with dew. Dark masses of troops
marched with measured tread over the lush meadow. The sound of
tambourines, drums and cheerful songs came from various directions. The
second tenor of the Sixth Company was singing vigorously, and the sound
of his pure, sonorous voice, full of power and feeling, carried far and
wide in the limpid air of evening.</p>
<p>THE WOODFELLING</p>
<p>A Cadet’s Story</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>In the midwinter of 185-, a section of our battery was stationed with
an advance detachment in the Great Chechnya District.1 On the evening of
February 14th, when I learnt that the platoon I was commanding in the
absence of a regular officer had been detailed to fell wood the
following day, I retired earlier than usual to my tent after I had
received and transmitted all necessary orders. Since I did not have the
bad habit of heating my tent with charcoal, I lay down without
undressing on my bed, which stood on small pegs above the ground, pulled
my fur cap over my eyes, wrapped myself in my fur coat and fell into
that mysterious, deep and heavy sleep that usually comes over one in the
anxious, nerve-racking hours before imminent danger. Anticipation of
tomorrow’s action had put me in this state of mind.</p>
<p>At three o’clock in the morning, when it was still pitch dark,
someone pulled away my warm sheepskin coat and a candle’s crimson flame
glared unpleasantly in my sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>‘Please get up, sir,’ a voice said.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes again, half-consciously pulled up my sheepskin coat
again and fell asleep. ‘Please get up, sir!’ Dmitry repeated, cruelly
shaking my shoulder. ‘The infantry’s leaving.’</p>
<p>I suddenly came to my senses, shuddered and leapt to my feet. After a
hurried glass of tea and a wash in icy water I crept out of my tent and
went to the artillery park. It was dark, misty and cold. The faint
crimson light of the bonfires, glowing here and there in the camp and
illuminating the figures of drowsy soldiers sitting around them only
seemed to intensify the darkness. Nearby I could hear a regular, gentle
snoring and from further off came the voices and clatter of the bustling
infantrymen’s rifles as they prepared to move. There was a smell of
smoke, dung, fuses and mist; the early morning cold sent shivers down my
spine and my teeth chattered involuntarily.</p>
<p>Only from the snorting and occasional stamping of hoofs was it
possible to tell the position of the limbers to which the horses were
harnessed and the ammunition boxes in the impenetrable darkness, and
only from the shining points of linstocks where the guns were. To the
words ‘God be with us’ the first gun moved off with a clang, an
ammunition wagon rumbled after it and the platoon followed. We all
doffed our caps and crossed ourselves. After taking up a position
between the ranks of infantry, the platoon halted and waited a quarter
of an hour for the whole column to assemble and for the commanding
officer to ride out.</p>
<p>‘One man’s missing, Nikolay Petrovich,’ said a black figure coming up
to me and whom I recognized as Artillery-Sergeant Maximov only from the
voice.</p>
<p>‘Who?’</p>
<p>‘Velenchuk, sir. He was there all right when they were harnessing -
saw him with my own eyes, I did. Now he’s disappeared.’</p>
<p>Since the column was not likely to move off immediately, we decided
to send Lance-Corporal Antonov to look for him. Shortly after, a few
officers trotted past in the dark - the commander and his suite. Then
the head of the column stirred and moved off, until finally it was our
turn. But still there was no Antonov or Velenchuk. However, we had
hardly gone a hundred paces when both of them caught up with us.</p>
<p>‘Where was he?’ I asked Antonov.</p>
<p>‘Sleeping in the artillery park.’</p>
<p>‘Oh - had he been drinking?’</p>
<p>‘No, sir.’</p>
<p>‘Then why did he fall asleep?’</p>
<p>‘Don’t know, sir.’</p>
<p>For about three hours we slowly advanced, in silence and darkness,
over unploughed, snowless fields and through clumps of low bushes that
crackled under the gun-carriage wheels. Finally, after crossing a
shallow but extremely fast-flowing stream, we were ordered to halt and
bursts of rifle fire came from the vanguard. As always, these sounds had
a most stimulating effect on everyone. The whole detachment seemed to
wake up; the ranks were full of voices, movement, laughter. Two soldiers
wrestled with each other; another hopped from foot to foot; others
chewed dry biscuits or shouldered and grounded arms to while away the
time. Meanwhile, the mist was growing noticeably whiter in the west. One
could feel the damp more now and surrounding objects gradually began to
emerge from the gloom. I could already distinguish the green gun
carriages and ammunition boxes, the brass of guns wet with mist, the
familiar figures of my men whom I could not help studying down to the
last detail, bay horses and ranks of infantrymen with gleaming bayonets,
kitbags, ramrods and mess tins on their backs.</p>
<p>We were soon moved on again and were led to a spot a few hundred
yards off the road. To the right we could see the steep bank of a
meandering stream and the tall wooden posts of a Tartar cemetery; to the
left and in front a black strip showed through the mist. The platoon
unlimbered. The Eighth Company, which was covering us, stacked arms, and
a battalion with rifles and axes marched into the forest.</p>
<p>Within five minutes fires were crackling and smoking all around. The
soldiers spread out to bring up branches and logs and then fanned the
fires with their hands and feet. The forest echoed incessantly to the
sound of hundreds of axes and falling trees.</p>
<p>The artillerymen, with a certain feeling of rivalry towards the
infantry, made their fire, and although it was already blazing so
fiercely that it was impossible to come within two paces of it, and
dense black smoke was pouring through the frozen branches which hissed
as they were piled on to the fire by the soldiers, and although the wood
underneath was turning to charcoal and the deathly pale grass was
thawing all around, this still did not satisfy them. They dragged great
logs up, pushed weeds under them and fanned the flames even higher.</p>
<p>When I went to the fire to light a cigarette, Velenchuk, who was the
bustling type and who now, having a guilty conscience, was busying
himself more than the others around the fire, pulled a burning coal from
the heart of the fire in a fit of zeal, with his bare hand, tossed it a
couple of times from one hand to the other and then let it fall to the
ground.</p>
<p>‘Light one of them twigs for him,’ said one of the soldiers.</p>
<p>‘Get him a linstock, lads!’ said another.</p>
<p>I finally managed to light my cigarette without the assistance of
Velenchuk, who was again attempting to pick out a live coal. He rubbed
his burnt fingers on the flaps of his sheepskin coat and, most probably
for want of something to do, lifted a huge piece of plane-tree wood and
with a mighty swing hurled it on to the fire. When at last he felt that
he was entitled to a rest, he went right up to the fire, flung open his
coat, which he wore like a cloak, parted his legs, thrust out his big
black hands, twisted his mouth slightly and frowned. ‘Damn! I’ve
forgotten my pipe. What a nuisance, lads!’ he said after a brief
silence, not addressing anyone in particular.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>There are three main types of soldier in Russia according to which
men from all the armed forces can be classified, whether they serve in
the line, in the Caucasus, the Guards, infantry, cavalry, artillery and
so on.</p>
<p>These three main types (with many subdivisions and permutations)
are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the submissive</p></li>
<li><p>the domineering</p></li>
<li><p>the reckless</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The submissive can be further subdivided into:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the coolly submissive</p></li>
<li><p>the fussily submissive</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The domineering can be subdivided into:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the sternly domineering</p></li>
<li><p>the diplomatically domineering</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The reckless can be subdivided into:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>reckless humorists</p></li>
<li><p>reckless libertines</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The commonest type in the army - the most likeable and, for the most
part, endowed with the noblest Christian virtues, meekness, piety,
patience and devotion to God’s will - is, broadly speaking, the
submissive. The distinctive trait of the coolly submissive type is
imperturbable calmness and contempt for all the reverses of fortune that
might befall him. The distinctive trait of the submissive drunkard is
his gentle romantic nature and sensibility; that of the fussily
submissive is his limited mental capacity, combined with undirected zeal
and industry.</p>
<p>The domineering type is most commonly found in the higher ranks of
ordinary soldiers - lance-corporals, non-commissioned officers and so
forth. In the first subdivision of the sternly domineering we find
exceptionally high-minded, energetic, pre-eminently military types who,
nevertheless, are not lacking in lofty romantic impulses (Lance-Corporal
Antonov, with whom I intend acquainting the reader, was this type). The
second subdivision comprises the diplomatically domineering, whose
numbers have been increasing considerably of late. The diplomatically
domineering type is invariably highly articulate, literate, wears pink
shirts, does not eat from the common bowl, occasionally smokes expensive
Musatov tobacco, considers himself immeasurably superior to the rank and
file and is rarely such a good soldier as the sternly domineering type
of the first subdivision.</p>
<p>The reckless, like the domineering types, are good soldiers if they
belong to the first subdivision - the humorists, characterized by
unshakeable cheerfulness, tremendous versatility, rich personality and
daring - but in the second subdivision (the libertines) tend to be
thoroughly disreputable. However, to the glory of the Russian army, they
are very rare and where they do appear are usually ostracized by the
soldiers themselves. The main characteristics of this section are
godlessness and a certain bravado in their debauchery.</p>
<p>Velenchuk was the fussily submissive type. He was Ukrainian, had
already served for fifteen years and, although he was a rather
insignificant-looking, blundering soldier, he was simple-hearted, kind,
extremely zealous (although this zeal tended at times to be misdirected)
and extraordinarily honest. I say extraordinarily honest, because
something happened the previous year where he showed this characteristic
very clearly. Here I must point out that almost every soldier knows a
trade, the most common being tailoring and boot-making. Velenchuk had
learnt the first of these and, judging by the fact that none other than
Sergeant-Major Mikhail Dorofeich ordered clothes from him, had attained
a certain degree of skill. The previous year, in camp, Velenchuk had
undertaken to make a fine coat for Mikhail Dorofeich but, on the very
night he cut the cloth, measured the trimmings and hid everything under
his pillow in his tent, disaster struck: the cloth, which had cost seven
roubles, vanished during the night. With tears in his eyes and pale,
trembling lips, suppressing his sobs, Velenchuk reported the theft to
the sergeant-major. Mikhail Dorofeich was furious. In the first moments
of anger he issued the tailor with dire threats. But then, as he was
well off and a reasonable man, he forgot all about it and did not ask
Velenchuk to pay for the material. No matter how much fuss that busy
Velenchuk made, no matter how many tears he shed as he told of his woes,
the thief was not found. Although a certain Chernov (one of the reckless
libertines) who slept in the same tent was strongly suspected, there was
no conclusive evidence. As Mikhail Dorofeich (the diplomatically
domineering type) was well off, being engaged in various business
activities with the quartermaster and mess caterer - the aristocrats of
the battery - he soon completely forgot the loss of his civilian coat.
Velenchuk, however, could not forget his misfortune. The soldiers said
at the time that they feared he might do away with himself or run off
into the mountains, so shattering was the effect of the disaster on him.
He would not drink or eat, could not even work and was always crying.
Three days later he went to see Mikhail Dorofeich. White as a sheet and
with trembling hands he took a gold rouble from under his cuff and
handed it to him. ‘I swear that’s all I have, Mikhail Dorofeich, and I
even had to borrow that from Zhdanov,’ he sobbed. ‘But I promise to pay
back the other two roubles as soon as I’ve earned them, I swear by God I
will! He [who “he” was even Velenchuk did not know] made me a crook in
your eyes. He, the rotten bastard, has squeezed the last breath out of
his own comrade … and I’ve been fifteen years in the army …’ But it
should be said, to Mikhail Dorofeich’s credit, that he would not accept
the two roubles, although Velenchuk brought them two months later.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Besides Velenchuk, five other soldiers from my platoon were warming
themselves by the fire.</p>
<p>Maximov, the platoon gun-sergeant, was sitting on a wooden bucket in
the best place, protected from the wind, smoking his pipe. His posture,
his whole bearing and expression - not to mention the wooden bucket on
which he was sitting, an emblem of authority at stopping places, and his
nankeen-covered coat - clearly showed that he was used to giving orders
and highly conscious of his own dignity.</p>
<p>When I went up to him he turned his head, but his eyes remained fixed
on the fire and only followed his head movement much later. Maximov came
from a family of small landowners, had money and had been given a rating
at military training school where he had acquired a great deal of
knowledge. He was awfully well off and awfully learned, in the words of
the soldiers. I remember how once, as we were practising plunging fire
with a quadrant, he explained to a group of soldiers around him that a
spirit level is ‘nothing other as it occurs, than atmospheric mercury
possessing its own motion’. In actual fact, Maximov was far from stupid
and really knew his job. But he had the unfortunate habit of sometimes
deliberately speaking in such a way that it was impossible to understand
him. I am convinced that he himself did not understand what he was
saying either. He had a particular passion for the words ‘occurs’ and
‘continuing’, and whenever he said either of them I knew in advance that
I would be unable to understand anything of what followed. On the other
hand, the soldiers, as far as I could make out, loved to hear those
‘occurs’ and were convinced that this word had some profound
significance, although, like me, they did not understand a word he said.
However, they ascribed their lack of comprehension to their own
stupidity and respected Fyodor Maximov all the more. In brief, Maximov
was the diplomatically domineering type.</p>
<p>The second soldier by the fire, who was putting his sinewy red feet
into a pair of boots, was Antonov - that same Bombardier Antonov who, in
1837, when he was one of three left to man an exposed gun, had fired
back at a powerful enemy and had continued to stand by his gun and
reload it - with two bullets in his thigh. ‘He would have been made a
sergeant long ago if it weren’t for that temper of his,’ the soldiers
used to say. And he really did have a strange character. When he was
sober there was no one more docile, quiet and well behaved, but after a
few drinks he became a completely different person. He would defy all
authority, fight and brawl and become a useless soldier. Only a week
before, on Shrove Tuesday, he had got drunk and, despite all manner of
threats and warnings - even being tied to a gun - he had persisted in
his drunken brawling until the following Monday. Throughout Lent,
although the entire detachment was under orders to eat meat as normal,
he ate nothing but dry rusks and in the first week even refused the
regulation cup of vodka. However, one just had to see his short, steely,
bandy-legged figure, his shiny, whiskered face when, under the
influence, he would take a balalaika in his sinewy hands, casually
glance round and strike up ‘The Young Maiden’; or when he strolled down
the street, his coat thrown over his shoulders, his medals dangling, his
hands in the pockets of his blue nankeen trousers; one only had to see
that expression of soldierly pride and contempt for all things
non-soldierly to realize how impossible it was for him to resist a fight
with any batman, Cossack, infantryman, settler - with anyone, in fact,
who was not an artilleryman, who had been rude to him or had just
happened to cross his path. He fought and brawled not so much for
personal satisfaction as for the morale of all the soldiers, whose
representative he considered himself to be.</p>
<p>The third soldier squatting by the fire, with one earring, bristly
whiskers, a bird-like face and a clay pipe between his teeth was Chikin,
a driver. ‘Old Chikin’, as the soldiers called him, was a humorist.
Wherever he was - in a biting frost, up to his knees in mud and having
gone two days without food, marching, on parade or at drill, that dear
man would always pull funny faces, twist his legs comically or crack
jokes that had the whole platoon rolling with laughter. The young
soldiers would always crowd round Chikin at stopping places or in the
camp, and he would play filka2 with them, tell them stories about the
crafty soldier and the English lord, mimic Tartars and Germans, or
simply say funny things which had them splitting their sides. In fact,
his reputation as the battery humorist was so firmly established that he
had only to open his mouth or wink to produce guffaws from everyone. But
that man really had a flair for the unexpected. He was able to discover
something unusual in everything, that others would never dream of. But,
most of all, this ability to see the funny side of everything was never
affected by any kind of ordeal or misfortune.</p>
<p>The fourth soldier was an unattractive young lad, recruited the
previous year and on active service for the first time. He was standing
in the middle of the smoke, so close to the fire it seemed his shabby
sheepskin coat would burst into flames at any moment, but, judging from
the way his coat was flung open, his calm, complacent pose with thighs
out-thrust, he was obviously deriving a great deal of pleasure from
it.</p>
<p>The fifth and last soldier, who was sitting some way from the fire,
whittling away at a stick, was ‘Grandpa’ Zhdanov. He had served longer
than any other soldier in the battery and had known all the others as
young recruits, all of whom called him ‘Grandpa’ out of force of habit.
It was said that he never drank or smoked, never played cards or used
foul language. He spent all his free time making boots, went to church
on holidays, whenever he could, or would light a cheap candle before his
icon and open his psalm book - the only book he could read. He rarely
mixed with the other soldiers and to those who were his senior in rank
but junior in years he was icily polite. As he never drank, he had
little chance of keeping company with his equals. But he had a
particular liking for recruits and young soldiers, always taking them
under his wing, admonishing them when necessary and frequently helping
them. The whole battery considered him a capitalist, as he had about
twenty-five roubles which he would willingly lend to anyone in real
need. That same Maximov who was now a gun-sergeant told me that when he
first arrived as a recruit ten years before and had drunk away all his
money with the old, hardened drinkers, Zhdanov saw the dreadful mess he
was in, called him over, severely reprimanded him for his behaviour,
even beat him, lectured him on the good soldier’s life and sent him away
with a shirt on his back (Maximov had none left by then) and a
half-rouble. ‘He made a man of me,’ Maximov always said of him with
respect and gratitude. He also helped Velenchuk, whom he had protected
ever since he was a recruit, at the time of the stolen cloth disaster.
And there were so many others whom he had helped during his twenty-five
years in the army.</p>
<p>One could not have wished for a soldier who knew his job better, who
was braver or more conscientious. But he was too meek and self-effacing
to be promoted to gun-sergeant, although he had been a bombardier for
fifteen years. Zhdanov’s sole joy, his passion even, was singing,
although he himself didn’t sing. There were a few songs he particularly
loved and he was always collecting a choir from the young soldiers. He
would stand with them, stuff his hands in his coat pockets, screw up his
eyes and show how deeply affected he was. I cannot explain why, but for
me there was something extraordinarily expressive about that regular
movement of his jawbones just beneath the ears which seemed uniquely
his. His snow-white hair, blackened moustache and wrinkled, bronzed face
gave him at first sight a stern, forbidding look. But if one inspected
his big eyes more closely, especially when they smiled (he never smiled
with his lips), one was immediately struck by something exceptionally
meek and almost childlike.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>‘Blow, I’ve forgotten my pipe. What a nuisance, lads!’ Velenchuk
repeated.</p>
<p>‘Then you should smoke siggars, old chap,’ Chikin said, twisting his
mouth and winking. ‘When I’m at home I always smoke siggars - they’re
sweeter!’</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone burst out laughing.</p>
<p>‘So you forgot your pipe, did you?’ Maximov chimed in, ignoring the
general mirth and imperiously knocking his pipe against the palm of his
left hand. ‘Where did you get to this morning, Velenchuk? Tell me.’</p>
<p>Velenchuk half-turned towards him and was about to raise his hand to
his cap but let it drop.</p>
<p>‘It seems like you had a lot to sleep off if you couldn’t keep awake
standing up! Your comrades won’t thank you for that.’</p>
<p>‘You can strike me down dead, Fyodor Maximovich, if one drop passed
my lips. I just don’t know what came over me,’ Velenchuk replied. ‘What
do you think I could have had to celebrate?’</p>
<p>‘That may well be, but one of us has to carry the can for you and
it’s a real disgrace the way you go on,’ remarked the eloquent Maximov,
in a calmer voice.</p>
<p>‘It was a miracle, lads,’ Velenchuk continued after a moment’s pause,
scratching the back of his neck and addressing no one in particular. ‘It
was like a miracle. I’ve been sixteen years in the army and nothing like
this has ever happened to me. When we were ordered to form up, I formed
up and felt fine. But when I was in the artillery park it suddenly
grabbed me and threw me to the ground, and that was that! I didn’t even
know what was happening. I just dropped off, lads! Must have been the
sleeping sickness,’ he concluded.</p>
<p>‘I had a terrible job waking you up, I can tell you!’ Antonov said,
pulling on his boot. ‘I had to shake you, push you, but you were
sleeping like a log.’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ observed Velenchuk, ‘but it would have been different if I’d
been drunk …’</p>
<p>‘Reminds me of an old woman back home,’ Chikin joined in. ‘She didn’t
budge from over the stove for two years. One day they tried to wake her,
thinking she was just asleep. But she was dead! She was always dropping
off - just like you, old chap!’</p>
<p>‘Come on, Chikin, tell us about the time you started cutting a dash
when you were on leave,’ Maximov said, smiling and glancing at me as if
to say, ‘Would you like to hear what this clown has to say?’</p>
<p>‘What d’ye mean, cutting a dash?’ Chikin replied, giving me a
fleeting, sidelong glance. Well, I naturally told them exactly what the
Corkersuss is like.’</p>
<p>‘Come on, don’t be so modest … tell us how you instructed them.’</p>
<p>‘You know very well how I instructed them. They asked me what life’s
like here,’ Chikin replied in a rapid patter, like a man who has told
the same story many times. ‘I told them we live well here. Loads of grub
- a cup of chockolad morning and night for every soldier and barley
broth fit for a lord at midday. And instead of vodka a glass of Modeera
- to cheer us all up!’</p>
<p>‘That’s a good one, Modeera!’ Velenchuk exclaimed, roaring with
laughter louder than anyone else. ‘I’ll give you Modeera!’</p>
<p>‘What did you tell them about the Hazians?’ Maximov asked when the
general laughter had somewhat subsided.</p>
<p>Chikin leant over the fire, fished out a small piece of charcoal with
his stick, put it to his pipe and for a long time silently puffed at his
cheap shag, as if completely unaware of the mute curiosity he had
aroused in his audience. When at last he had worked up enough smoke he
threw the charcoal away, pushed his cap even further back and after a
slight twitch and a faint smile continued. ‘They also asked what the
Circassians and Turks were like down here in the Corkersuss, if they
were fierce warriors. So I told ’em there’s different sorts of
Circassians, that they come in all shapes and sizes. There’s the
Daghestanians who live up in the mountains and eat stones instead of
bread. They’re as big, I told ‘em, as tree trunks, with one eye in their
forehead and they wear red caps - flaming red like yours, me lad!’ he
added, turning to the young recruit, who was in fact wearing an
extremely comical cap with a red top.</p>
<p>At this unexpected remark the recruit suddenly squatted, slapped his
knees and laughed and coughed so violently he was barely able to gasp,
‘So that’s what the Daghestanians are really like!’</p>
<p>‘And there’s the Gapers,’ Chikin went on, shaking his cap on to his
forehead with a toss of the head. ‘They’re different - they’ re little
people, always going around in pairs, hand in hand, and they run so fast
you couldn’t even catch ’em up on a horse.‘ Then, in a deep throaty
voice, attempting to imitate a country yokel, he continued, ‘So they ask
me, “Is those Gapers born loike that, hand in hand?” Why yes, I say,
they go round like that from the day they were born. And if you try and
cut ‘em apart the blood just gushes out, same as a Chinaman - if you
take his hat off he’ll start bleeding. And then they ask, “Are they
fierce fighters?” Well, I say, when they catch you they slit yer belly
open and twist yer guts round yer arm. There they are, twisting away and
you can’t stop laughing - yes, you laugh yourself to death, you do!’</p>
<p>‘Did they really believe all that, Chikin?’ Maximov said with a faint
smile, while the others were splitting their sides.</p>
<p>‘That strange lot’d believe anything, Fyodor Maximov. Oh yes! But
when I told ’em that the snow doesn’t melt all summer on Mount Kizbeck3
they laughed their heads off! “What’s so special about that?” they say.
“It’s a high mountain, so of course the snow never melts! When there’s a
thaw here the snow on any little hillock melts first, but it lingers on
in the hollows.” Now, who would have thought there were such folk!’
Chikin winked in conclusion.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The bright orb of the sun shining through the milky-white mist was
now quite high. The violet-grey horizon was gradually widening and,
although now much further away, was marked just as sharply by a
deceptive white wall of mist.</p>
<p>Beyond the felled trees quite a large clearing opened up before us.
Smoke from the fires - black, milky-white or violet - spread over the
clearing from all sides and white layers of mist drifted past in the
weirdest shapes. In the far distance groups of Tartars on horseback
appeared now and then, and the occasional sound of fire from our rifles
and guns could be heard.</p>
<p>‘That wasn’t what you call action, only a bit of fun!’ as good
Captain Khlopov would say.</p>
<p>The commander of the Ninth Company of Chasseurs, which had been
escorting us, came up to our guns and pointed to three Tartar horsemen
riding along the edge of the forest about a mile away, and with that
love of artillery fire so typical of infantry officers he asked me to
fire a ball or shell at them.</p>
<p>‘Can you see that?’ he asked with a kind, persuasive smile as he
stretched his arm over my shoulder. ‘There’s one of them in front of
those two large trees on a white horse and in a black cloak. The other
two are behind. Can you see them? Couldn’t you? … please …’</p>
<p>‘And there’s another three skirting the forest,’ added Antonov, who
was renowned for his astonishingly keen eyesight, as he came up to us
and hid the pipe he had been smoking behind his back. ‘The one in front
has drawn his rifle - you can see them clear as daylight, sir!’</p>
<p>‘Look - he’s fired, lads! There’s the white smoke,’ remarked
Velenchuk, who was standing in a group of soldiers just behind us.</p>
<p>‘He must have been firing at our line, the devil!’ another
observed.</p>
<p>‘Just look at all that lot pouring out of the forest. They must be
looking for somewhere to put a gun,’ added a third.</p>
<p>‘If we dropped a shell in the middle they wouldn’t like it!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, we could just about reach them from here, couldn’t we?’ Chikin
asked.</p>
<p>‘It’s only about twelve or thirteen hundred yards,’ Maximov replied
coolly, as though talking to himself, although, like the others, he was
obviously dying to open fire. ‘At an angle of forty-five degrees our
Unicorn4 could hit them plumb in the middle!’</p>
<p>‘Well, you really couldn’t miss if you sent a shell into that crowd!
Yes, now’s the moment, while they’re all bunched. Please give the order
to fire at once,’ the company commander kept begging me.</p>
<p>‘Shall we take aim?’ Antonov suddenly asked in a jerky bass voice and
with a rather sullen, spiteful look.</p>
<p>I must confess I was longing to fire, so I gave orders for them to
aim number two gun.</p>
<p>Hardly had I given the order when the shell was ready charged and
loaded into the gun, while Antonov, clinging to the side-plate of the
gun carriage and holding his chubby fingers to the back-plate, was
already aligning the trail.</p>
<p>‘A trifle to the left … a fraction to the right … a bit more … that’s
it!’ he said, proudly walking away from the gun.</p>
<p>One by one, the infantry officer, Maximov and I peered through the
sights and each of us gave our different opinions.</p>
<p>‘I’m positive it will overshoot!’ Velenchuk said, clicking his
tongue, although he had only just looked over Antonov’s shoulder and
therefore did not have the slightest grounds for this assumption. ‘God,
I bet you’ll overshoot, lads, and hit that tree!’</p>
<p>‘Fire number two!’ I ordered.</p>
<p>The crew moved away to the guns. Antonov ran to one side to watch the
flight of the shell. There was a flash and the sound of ringing brass.
At that moment we were enveloped in gunpowder smoke and the resounding
boom was followed by the metallic hum of the shell receding at the speed
of lightning and dying away in the distance.</p>
<p>Just behind the group of riders a puff of white smoke appeared and
the Tartars galloped away in all directions. Then the sound of the
explosion reached us.</p>
<p>’Great! That made ’em gallop all right. Those devils don’t like it!‘
Chuckles and murmurs of approval came from the ranks of artillery and
infantry.</p>
<p>‘If only we’d aimed a fraction lower we’d have hit them,’ Velenchuk
remarked. ‘I told you we’d hit a tree and that’s what we’ve done - it
carried too far to the right.’</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>After I had left the soldiers to discuss how the Tartars had galloped
away when they saw the shell, what they were doing there in the first
place and whether there were many still left in the forest, I took a few
steps with the company commander and sat down under a tree waiting while
the meatballs he had offered me were warmed up. Company Commander
Bolkhov was one of the officers nicknamed ‘Bonjour’ in the regiment. He
was well off, had served in the Guards and spoke French. Despite this,
his comrades were fond of him. He was quite intelligent and had
sufficient tact to wear a St Petersburg-style frock-coat, to dine well
and to speak French without causing too much offence to his fellow
officers. After we had chatted about the weather, military operations
and mutual officer friends and had satisfied ourselves, by means of
question and answer, that each other’s ideas were acceptable, we
involuntarily turned to more intimate topics. When people from the same
social circle meet in the Caucasus, the question ‘Why are you here?’
even if unspoken, invariably arises, and I had the feeling that my
companion wanted to reply to this unasked question.</p>
<p>‘When will this action ever finish?’ he said lazily. ‘I find it so
boring.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t,’ I replied. ‘After all, it’s even worse at
headquarters.’</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, it’s ten thousand times worse at headquarters,’ he said
irritably. ‘No, I mean, when will all this be over for good?’</p>
<p>‘What do you want to be over?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Everything. And for good! … Well now, are those meatballs ready,
Nikolayev!?’ he asked.</p>
<p>‘Then why did you come here in the first place if you dislike the
Caucasus so much?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘I’ll tell you why,’ he replied with uncompromising candour. ‘It’s
all because of some tradition. In Russia they really do believe that the
Caucasus is some kind of Promised Land for all sorts of unfortunate
people.’</p>
<p>‘I’d say that’s true, roughly. Most of us …’</p>
<p>‘Yes, but the main thing is, all of us who follow tradition and come
to the Caucasus are terribly mistaken in our calculations. For the life
of me I cannot see why, because of some unhappy love affair or financial
trouble one should opt for the Caucasus rather than Kazan or Kaluga. In
Russia, you know, people visualize the Caucasus as such a magnificent
place, with eternal virgin ice, raging torrents, daggers, felt cloaks,
Circassian maidens, but basically there’s nothing very cheerful about
it. If only these people at least knew that we never go anywhere near
virgin ice, and if we did we wouldn’t be very amused by it, and that the
Caucasus is divided into many different provinces - Stavropol, Tiflis
and so on.’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ I laughed. ‘Living in Russia we view the Caucasus quite
differently. Have you ever felt that? It’s really like reading poetry in
a language you don’t know very well - you imagine it’s much better than
it really is -’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know, to tell you the truth,’ he interrupted, ‘but I detest
the Caucasus.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I like it here now, but in a different way …’</p>
<p>‘Oh, perhaps it’s all right,’ he continued rather irritably, ‘but all
I know is, I don’t like it.’</p>
<p>‘Why is that?’ I asked, for the sake of saying something.</p>
<p>‘Firstly, because it’s deceived me. All that I came to the Caucasus
(following tradition) to be cured of has followed me here and the only
difference is that previously it was all on the grand scale and here it
is on a small and pretty sordid one. Wherever I go I’m besieged with
millions of trivial worries, dirty tricks and insults at every step.
Secondly, because I feel myself declining morally every day. But the
main reason is that I don’t consider myself fit to serve here: I cannot
endure danger … to put it in a nutshell, I’m not brave …’ He stopped to
look at me. ‘I’m not joking.’</p>
<p>Although I was startled by this unsolicited confession, I did not
contradict my companion, as that was what he apparently wanted. Instead,
I waited for him to retract his words, as always happens in such
cases.</p>
<p>‘Do you know,’ he continued, ‘this is my first taste of action and
you just cannot imagine how I felt yesterday. When the sergeant-major
came with the order that my company was to join the main column I went
as white as a sheet and was too nervous to speak. And what a night I had
- if you only knew! If it’s true that people go grey from fear, then my
hair should be completely white now, since no condemned prisoner can
have suffered as much as I did in one night. Even now, although I’m
rather more relaxed than during the night, this is what happens inside
me,’ he added, twisting his fist in front of his chest. ‘And the funny
thing is,’ he continued, ‘that the most awful tragedy is being enacted
while here we sit scoffing meatballs and onions, persuading ourselves
that it’s all very jolly. Is there any wine, Nikolayev?’ he said,
yawning.</p>
<p>Just then we heard a soldier cry out in alarm, ‘They’re there, lads!’
whereupon all eyes turned to the edge of the distant forest.</p>
<p>Far off a bluish cloud of smoke was growing ever larger, drifting
upwards as the wind carried it. When I realized that the enemy was
firing at us, everything before me suddenly took on a new and majestic
character. The stacks of rifles, the bonfire smoke, the blue sky, the
green gun carriages, Nikolayev’s sunburnt, whiskered face - all this
seemed to be telling me that the ball which had now left the muzzle and
was flying through space at that very moment could well be aimed
straight at my chest.</p>
<p>‘Where did you get that wine?’ I lazily asked Bolkhov, while deep
down inside me two equally distinct voices were speaking: one was
saying, ‘Lord receive my soul in peace,’ and the other, ‘I hope I won’t
duck and will keep smiling when that ball comes flying over.’ And that
instant something terribly nasty whistled over my head and a cannon ball
fell with a thud about two paces from where we were standing.</p>
<p>‘Now, if I had been Napoleon or Frederick the Great,’ Bolkhov said,
turning to me with the greatest composure, ‘I would doubtless have paid
you a compliment.’</p>
<p>‘But you just have,’ I replied, finding it difficult to conceal the
panic that the danger (now past) had stirred in me.</p>
<p>‘Well, so what? No one will write it down.’</p>
<p>‘Iwill, though.’</p>
<p>‘But if you write it down it will only be to criticize, as
Mishchenkov says,’ he added, smiling.</p>
<p>‘Damn and blast you!’ Antonov called out behind us, angrily spitting.
‘Within a whisker of grazing my leg!’</p>
<p>After this ingenuous remark all my efforts to appear calm and
collected, all our smart talk, struck me as impossibly stupid.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>The enemy had in fact positioned two guns just where the Tartars had
been riding around and every twenty or thirty minutes fired at our
woodfellers. My platoon was moved forward into the clearing and ordered
to return their fire. A puff of smoke appeared at the edge of the
forest, then we would hear a report and a whistling sound and then a
cannon ball would fall behind or in front of us. The enemy’s shots were
very much off target and no losses were sustained.</p>
<p>As always, our artillerymen were splendid, swiftly loading and
diligently aiming whenever they saw puffs of smoke and calmly joking
among themselves. Nearby, awaiting its turn in silent inactivity, was
our infantry escort. The woodfellers carried on with their work and the
forest was filled more and more with the sound of axes. Only when a
cannon ball whistled overhead did everything go quiet and in the deathly
silence rather anxious voices would ring out, ‘Watch it, lads!’ and all
eyes would be fixed on the ball ricocheting among the fires and lopped
branches.</p>
<p>By now the mist had completely cleared and was turning into clouds
that gradually disappeared in the dark blue sky. The sun came out and
shone brightly, gleaming cheerfully on the steel bayonets, the brass
guns and the thawing earth spangled with hoar frost. In the air one
could feel both the freshness of the morning frost and the warmth of the
spring sun. Thousands of different shades and colours mingled in the dry
forest leaves and the tracks of wagon wheels and horseshoe nails could
be seen quite distinctly on the even, shiny path.</p>
<p>The exchanges between the two forces were growing fiercer and louder
on all sides. Puffs of bluish smoke appeared more often now. The
dragoons rode on, the pennants on their lances streaming; songs came
from the infantry companies and a train of carts laden with firewood was
drawn up in the rear. A general rode over to our platoon and ordered us
to withdraw. The enemy had positioned himself in the bushes opposite our
left flank and was harassing us with heavy rifle fire. A bullet came
humming out of the forest to the left and struck a gun carriage,
followed by another, and a third … The infantry who were nearby covering
us noisily got up, took their rifles and formed a line. The firing
intensified and more and more bullets began to fly. The withdrawal
began, which meant (as is always the case in the Caucasus) that the real
action had begun.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the artillerymen disliked bullets just as much as
the infantry disliked cannon balls. Antonov frowned. Chikin mimicked the
bullets and cracked jokes about them - but he clearly did not like them.
‘That one’s in a hurry!’ he said of one, calling another ‘little bee’. A
third, which screeched slowly and plaintively over our heads, he called
‘poor little orphan’, which made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>Unused to bullets, the young recruit leant his head to one side and
bent his neck every time a bullet flew past, which also made the
soldiers laugh. ‘Bowing because they’re friends of yours?’ they asked.
Velenchuk, usually so indifferent to danger, was now quite agitated.
Evidently he was annoyed that we weren’t firing case shot in the
direction of the bullets. Several times he remarked in a disgruntled
voice, ‘Why do we let them fire and get away with it? If we turned a gun
on them and peppered them with case shot that would soon quieten them
down!’</p>
<p>It was in fact high time we did this, so I ordered the men to fire a
last shell and then load the gun with case shot.</p>
<p>‘Case shot!’ Antonov shouted, jauntily walking through the smoke to
his gun with his linstock as soon as the shell had been fired.</p>
<p>Just then, not far behind me, I heard the rapid hum of a bullet
suddenly end in a dull thud. My heart sank. ‘One of ours has been hit,’
I thought, too afraid to look around, from a feeling of grim foreboding.
And in fact the thud was followed by the sound of a body falling heavily
and the heart-rending ‘O-oh!’ of a wounded soldier. ‘They’ve got me,
lads!’ a familiar voice just managed to say. It was Velenchuk. He was
lying on his back between limber and gun. The bag he had been carrying
was thrown to one side. His forehead was covered with blood and over his
right eye and his nose flowed a thick, red stream. He had been wounded
in the stomach, but there was hardly any blood there - he had smashed
his forehead against a tree stump in falling.</p>
<p>I only discovered all this much later and at first I could only make
out some vague heap and what appeared to be a dreadful amount of
blood.</p>
<p>None of the soldiers who had loaded the gun said a word, except for
the young recruit, who kept muttering something that sounded like ‘God,
just look at all that blood!’ while Antonov frowned and grunted angrily.
But it was clear that the thought of death had run through everyone’s
mind. Everyone got on with their work with renewed energy. The gun was
charged in a moment and the gunner, who brought up some case shot,
walked about two feet away from the spot where the wounded Velenchuk
lay, still moaning.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen action must surely have experienced that strange,
illogical but none the less powerful feeling of revulsion for the place
where a soldier has been killed or wounded. The soldiers under my
command evidently yielded to this feeling when they should have lifted
Velenchuk and carried him to a cart which had come up. Zhdanov angrily
went over to the wounded man and, although it made him scream all the
more, lifted him by the armpits.</p>
<p>‘What are you standing there for? Get hold of him!’ he shouted.
Velenchuk was immediately surrounded by about ten helpers - more than
was needed. But the moment he was moved, Velenchuk started struggling
and screaming horribly.</p>
<p>‘Why are you screaming like a hare?’ Antonov said gruffly as he held
his leg. ‘If you don’t stop we’ll leave you here.’</p>
<p>And the wounded soldier in fact quietened down, only muttering
occasionally, ‘Oh, I’m dying! I’m dying, lads!’</p>
<p>When he was placed in the cart he even stopped groaning and I could
hear him telling one of his comrades something in a soft, but audible
voice: no doubt words of farewell …</p>
<p>No soldier likes to see a wounded comrade and as I instinctively
hurried to escape that sight I gave orders for him to be immediately
rushed to the dressing station and then returned to the guns. But a few
minutes later I was told that Velenchuk was calling for me, so I went
back to the cart.</p>
<p>The wounded man was lying at the bottom of the cart, gripping the
sides with both hands. Within a few minutes his broad, healthy face had
completely changed: he seemed to have grown thinner and to have aged
several years. His pale, thin lips were pressed together with obvious
strain. A bright, serene glow had replaced the dull restless look of his
eyes and the stamp of death already lay on his bloody forehead and
nose.</p>
<p>Although the slightest movement caused him the most appalling pain,
he asked for the small purse that was tied like a garter around his left
leg to be removed. The sight of that bare, white and healthy leg when
they took off his boot and untied the purse aroused the most oppressive
feeling in me.</p>
<p>‘There’s three and a half roubles in it,’ he told me as I took the
purse. ‘Look after them.’</p>
<p>The cart was about to move off when he told them to stop.</p>
<p>‘I was making an overcoat for Lieutenant Sulimovsky. He … he gave me
two roubles. I spent one and a half on buttons and there’s another half
rouble with the buttons in my kitbag. Give them to him.’ ‘Of course, of
course,’ I said. ‘Now you get better, old man.’ He did not answer, the
cart moved off and he started groaning and moaning in the most dreadful
heart-rending way. It was as though, having tidied up his earthly
affairs, he could find no more reason to exercise any self-control and
considered it quite permissible to let himself go now.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>‘Where do you think you’re going? Come back!’ I shouted at the young
recruit who, as calmly as could be, with his spare linstock under one
arm and some sort of stick in his hands, set off after the cart bearing
the wounded soldier. But the recruit merely glanced back lazily,
muttered something and carried on, so that I had to send someone after
him.</p>
<p>He doffed his red cap and smiled stupidly at me.</p>
<p>‘Where were you going?’</p>
<p>‘Back to camp.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘Because Velenchuk’s been wounded, of course,’ he said, smiling
again.</p>
<p>‘And what’s that got to do with you? You must stay here.’</p>
<p>He looked at me in amazement, then nonchalantly turned round, put on
his cap and went back to his post.</p>
<p>On the whole, the operation was successful. We heard that the
Cossacks had carried out a glorious attack and returned with three dead
Tartars; that the infantry had stocked up with firewood and had only six
wounded; that in the artillery only Velenchuk and two horses had been
put out of action. But then about two square miles of forest had been
felled and the area cleared beyond recognition: in place of the dense
row of trees of before, a vast clearing had now opened up along the
forest edge, covered with smoking fires, and cavalry and infantry
returning to camp. Although the enemy continued pursuing us with
artillery and rifle fire right up to the graveyard and the stream we had
crossed in the morning, the withdrawal was successfully carried out. I
was already beginning to dream of the cabbage stew and side of mutton
with buckwheat porridge that were waiting for me in the camp when news
came that the general had ordered a redoubt to be built by the side of
the stream and that the Third Battalion of K — Regiment and a platoon
from the Fourth Battery were to stay there until morning. Carts laden
with firewood and wounded, Cossacks, artillery, infantry bearing rifles
and with firewood on their backs, all passed us with a great deal of
noise and singing. Everyone’s face expressed animation and contentment,
stimulated by the thought that the danger was past and by the prospect
of a rest. Only we and the Third Battalion would have to wait until
morning before we could entertain such pleasant thoughts.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>While we artillerymen were busy with the guns, parking the limbers
and ammunition wagons and tethering the horses, the infantry had already
stacked their rifles, made fires, built small shelters from branches and
maize straw and were now cooking their buckwheat porridge.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. Bluish rain clouds drifted across the sky. The
mist had turned into a fine drizzle, soaking the earth and the soldiers’
coats. The horizon seemed to contract and the whole area took on a
sombre hue. The damp, which I could feel through my boots and on my
neck, the incessant motion and conversations in which I took no part,
the sticky mud over which my feet slid and my empty stomach all put me
in a thoroughly miserable mood after a day of physical and moral
exhaustion. I could not get Velenchuk out of my mind. The whole simple
story of his soldier’s life kept haunting my imagination.</p>
<p>His last moments had been as bright and calm as his whole life. He
had lived too honestly, too simply, for his unquestioning faith in the
heavenly life to come to falter at the moment of truth.</p>
<p>‘Your Honour,’ Nikolayev said, coming up, ‘the captain would like you
to have tea with him.’</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to pick my way through stacks of rifles and
bonfires and followed Nikolayev to Bolkhov’s quarters, relishing the
prospect of a glass of hot tea and some cheerful conversation to dispel
my gloomy thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Well, did you find him?’ came Bolkhov’s voice from a straw hut where
a small light was burning.</p>
<p>‘Yes, I’ve brought him, Your Honour,’ Nikolayev replied in his deep
voice.</p>
<p>Bolkhov was sitting on his dry felt cloak, his coat unbuttoned, and
without his fur cap. By his side a samovar was on the boil and there was
a drum with food on it. A bayonet with a candle on the end was stuck
into the ground. ‘Well, what do you think?’ he proudly asked, casting
his eye over his comfortable quarters. In fact it was so pleasant in the
hut that as we drank our tea I completely forgot the damp, the darkness
and Velenchuk’s wound. We talked about Moscow and things that had
nothing at all to do with the war and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>After one of those silent moments which occasionally punctuate even
the most lively conversations, Bolkhov smiled at me.</p>
<p>‘I think our talk this morning must have seemed very odd to you,’ he
said.</p>
<p>‘No, why should it? Only I felt that you were rather too frank -
there are things all of us know but which we should never divulge.’</p>
<p>‘Why not? No! If I had the slightest chance of exchanging this life
for the poorest, most wretched existence - as long as there was no
danger of military service - I wouldn’t hesitate for one moment.’</p>
<p>‘Then why don’t you return to Russia?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Why?’ he asked. ‘Oh, I’ve been thinking about it for a long time
now, but I can’t go to Russia until I receive the Anna or Vladimir
medal5 - an Anna round my neck and a major’s rank were precisely why I
came here in the first place.’</p>
<p>‘But why don’t you go back if, as you say, you feel unfit for service
here?’</p>
<p>‘I feel even more incapable of returning to Russia the same as when I
left it. It’s just one more of those legends in Russia, confirmed by
Passek,6 Sleptsov7 and others, that one only has to come to the Caucasus
to be showered with decorations. Everyone expects it of us, demands it
of us. But I’ve been here two years, taken part in two expeditions and
received nothing. For all that, I’ve so much pride that I won’t leave
this place until I’m a major, with an Anna or a Vladimir round my neck.
I’ve reached the point where it really rankles when some Gnilokishkin is
decorated and I’m not. What’s more, how could I look my elder in the
face again, or merchant Kotel’nikov to whom I sell grain, or my aunt in
Moscow and all those fine gentlemen in Russia, if I return after two
years in the Caucasus with nothing to show for it? No, I don’t want to
know those gentlemen and I’m sure that they couldn’t care less about me.
But such is man’s nature that although I couldn’t give a damn about them
they’re the reason why I’m ruining the best years of my life, my
happiness and whole future.’</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>At that moment the battalion commander called from outside, ‘Who’s
that you’re talking to, Nikolay Fyodorych?’</p>
<p>Bolkhov told him my name, whereupon three officers came into the hut:
Major Kirsanov, a battalion adjutant and Company Commander Trosenko.</p>
<p>Kirsanov was a shortish, stout man with a black moustache, red cheeks
and sensuous little eyes. These eyes were his outstanding feature and
when he laughed all that remained of them was two moist little stars.
These, together with his tight lips and arched neck, sometimes made him
look extraordinarily stupid. Kirsanov behaved and bore himself better
than anyone else in the regiment: his subordinates never said a bad word
about him and his superiors respected him, although he was generally
thought to be very dense. He knew the army, was industrious, diligent,
always had money, kept a carriage and cook and was good at pretending to
be proud with great naturalness.</p>
<p>‘What are you discussing, Nikolay?’ he asked as he entered.</p>
<p>‘Oh, only the pleasures of army life here.’</p>
<p>Just then Kirsanov spotted me, a mere cadet, and to make me aware of
his importance he stared at the drum and asked, ‘What’s wrong, Nikolay?
Tired?’ as if he hadn’t heard Bolkhov’s reply.</p>
<p>‘No, we were just -’ Bolkhov began.</p>
<p>But again it was probably the sense of self-importance of a battalion
commander that made him interrupt and ask another question: ‘A splendid
engagement today, wasn’t it?’</p>
<p>The battalion adjutant was a young ensign, recently promoted from the
cadets. He was a modest, quiet lad with a shy, good-natured expression.
I had seen him at Bolkhov’s before and he often dropped in on him. He
would bow, sit in one corner without saying a word for several hours,
roll cigarettes and smoke them, after which he would get up, bow and
leave. He was a typical poor Russian gentleman’s son who had chosen a
military career as the only possible one for someone with his education
and who considered an officer’s rank the most precious thing in the
world. He was the simple-hearted and likeable type, despite those
comical accessories invariably associated with it - the tobacco pouch,
the dressing-gown, the guitar, the toothbrush moustache. In the regiment
he was said to have boasted that he was fair but strict with his batman.
‘I rarely punish him,’ he had claimed, ‘but when I’m driven to it, then
God help him!’ Once, when his batman was drunk and had robbed him, even
sworn at him, he had taken him to the guardhouse and ordered him to be
flogged, but when he saw the necessary preparations he was so upset that
he could only murmur, ‘Well, you see, I can if I want to …’ and then he
lost his head, ran back to his quarters and ever since was afraid to
look Batman Chernov in the eye. His fellow officers did not give him a
moment’s peace, teased him unmercifully and more than once I heard that
simple-hearted youth make excuses, blushing furiously as he assured them
that what they had heard was not true, but in fact quite the
contrary.</p>
<p>The third officer, Captain Trosenko, was an old Caucasian in every
sense of the word: that is, he was a man for whom the company he
commanded had become his family, the fortress where the headquarters
were his home and the songs sung by the soldiers his only pleasure. He
was a man for whom everything that was not the Caucasus was beneath
contempt and almost inconceivable. He really thought that everything
that was the Caucasus was divided into halves - ‘ours’ and ‘theirs.’ He
loved the first and hated the second with all his heart. Above all, he
was a coolly courageous, battle-hardened soldier, exceptionally kind to
his comrades and inferiors, but dreadfully brusque and even downright
rude towards adjutants and ‘Bonjours,’ whom he detested for some reason.
As he entered the straw hut he nearly put his head through the roof,
suddenly sank down and sat on the ground.</p>
<p>‘Well, what’s new?’ he asked, suddenly stopping when he saw my
unfamiliar face and fixing his dull, staring eyes on me.</p>
<p>‘What were you talking about?’ the major asked, taking out his watch
and looking at it, although I was quite sure there was no need to do
this.</p>
<p>‘Well, this gentleman’s been asking why I’m serving here.’</p>
<p>‘Nikolay obviously wants to distinguish himself and then make tracks
for home.’</p>
<p>‘Come on, Abram Ilich, you tell us why you want to serve in the
Caucasus.’</p>
<p>‘Firstly, you know, because each of us must do his duty … What?’ he
added, although no one had said anything. ‘Yesterday I had a letter from
Russia, Nikolay Fyodorych,’ he continued, obviously wanting to change
the subject. ‘They write that … well, they ask such peculiar
questions.’</p>
<p>‘What kind of questions?’ asked Bolkhov.</p>
<p>He burst out laughing.</p>
<p>‘Very strange questions … They ask if there can be jealousy without
love … What?’ he asked, looking at all of us.</p>
<p>‘You don’t say!’ Bolkhov laughed.</p>
<p>‘Yes, you know life is good in Russia,’ he went on, as if everything
he said followed quite logically from the previous remark. ‘In 1852,
when I was in Tambov, everyone received me as if I was the Tsar’s
aide-de-camp. Would you believe it - at the governor’s ball - I was
given a very warm reception when I went in. The governor’s wife herself,
you know, talked to me and asked about the Caucasus, and they were all
so … I don’t know what … They looked at my gold sabre as if it were some
rarity and asked why I had been awarded it - and the Order of Anna and
the Vladimir, and I told them … What? That’s what the Caucasus is good
for, Nikolay Fyodorych!’ he continued, without waiting for a reply. ‘In
Russia they have a high opinion of us Caucasians. A young man, you know,
a staff officer with the Orders of Anna and Vladimir - it all carries a
lot of weight in Russia … What?’</p>
<p>‘I really think you did a little bit of boasting there, Abram Ilich!’
Bolkhov said.</p>
<p>‘Hee-hee!’ Kirsanov laughed his stupid laugh. ‘It was necessary, you
know! How superbly I dined for those two months!’</p>
<p>‘So, life is good up north in Russia, is it?’ Trosenko asked, as if
he were talking about China or Japan.</p>
<p>‘I should say so! When I think of the champagne we drank in those two
months - gallons of the stuff!’</p>
<p>‘Come off it! It was probably lemonade,’ Trosenko said.</p>
<p>‘Now I’d have shown them how we can knock it back here and made
myself famous! I’d have showed them - eh, Bolkhov?’</p>
<p>‘But you’ve been in the Caucasus more than ten years, old man,’
Bolkhov said. ‘And you remember what Yermolov8 said. Abram Ilich has
been here only six . . .’</p>
<p>‘I’ll give you ten - it will soon be sixteen!’</p>
<p>‘Bolkhov, let’s have some sage vodka. Brrr! It’s damp in here!’ he
added, smiling. ‘Let’s have a drink, Major!’</p>
<p>But the major, already unhappy with the way the old captain had first
addressed him, now winced visibly and sought refuge in his own grandeur.
He hummed something as he again looked at his watch.</p>
<p>‘So, I’ll never go back there,’ Trosenko continued, ignoring the
frowning major. ‘What’s more, I’ve lost the habit of walking and
speaking as they do in Russia. They’d ask, “What kind of freak is this?
Something that blew in from Asia!” Isn’t that so, Nikolay Fyodorych? And
what is there for me in Russia? Anyway, some day I’ll be shot here and
then they’ll ask, “Where’s old Trosenko?” “Shot,” will be the answer.
And what would you do with the Eighth Company then, eh?’ he added,
addressing all these remarks to the major.</p>
<p>‘Send the battalion officer on duty!’ Kirsanov shouted, without
replying to the captain, although once again I was convinced that there
was no need for any orders.</p>
<p>‘As for you, young man, I bet you’re pleased to be on double pay
now,’ the major told the adjutant after a few minutes’ silence.</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir. Very pleased.’</p>
<p>‘I think the pay’s very good these days, Nikolay Fyodorych,’ he
continued. ‘A young man can live quite decently on it and even permit
himself a few small luxuries.’</p>
<p>‘No, Abram Ilich!’ the adjutant replied timidly. ‘Although it’s
double I can only just make ends meet … One has to keep a horse …’</p>
<p>‘What’s this you’re telling me, young man? I was an ensign once
myself and I know. Believe me, you can live very well on it. Go on, add
it up,’ he said, crooking the little finger of his left hand.</p>
<p>‘We’re always paid in advance, so that’s all you need to count,’
Trosenko commented, emptying a glass of vodka.</p>
<p>‘That may well be … but … What?’</p>
<p>Just then a head with white hair and a flat nose poked through an
opening in the hut and a shrill voice said in a German accent, ‘Are you
there, Abram Ilich? The duty officer’s looking for you.’</p>
<p>‘Come in, Kraft,’ Bolkhov said.</p>
<p>A tall figure wearing a general staff officer’s coat squeezed through
the door and shook everyone’s hand with the utmost fervour. ‘Ah, my dear
Captain, so you’re here, too,’ he said, turning to Trosenko.</p>
<p>In spite of the gloom the new guest managed to find his way over to
him and, to the captain’s extreme amazement and displeasure (or so it
seemed to me), kissed him on the lips.</p>
<p>‘Just a German trying to be a really good chap,’ I thought.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>My assumption was immediately confirmed. Captain Kraft asked for
vodka and gave a dreadful grunt as he tossed back his head and emptied
the glass.</p>
<p>‘Well, gentlemen, we had a very pleasant outing today, cavorting over
the plains of Chechnya,’ he began, but when he spotted the duty officer
he immediately stopped so that the major could give his orders.</p>
<p>‘Did you go round the lines?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
<p>‘Have the listening posts been set up?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
<p>‘Then go and order the company commanders to be on the alert.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
<p>The major screwed up his eyes and thought deeply.</p>
<p>‘And tell the men they can make their porridge now.’</p>
<p>‘They already are.’</p>
<p>‘Good. You may go.’</p>
<p>Turning to us with a condescending smile, the major continued, ‘Well,
now, we were trying to work out how much an officer needs. Let’s see.
There’s your uniform and a pair of trousers - right?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
<p>‘Let’s say that comes to fifty roubles over two years, which makes
twenty-five per annum on clothes. Then about fifty kopecks a day for
food - right?’</p>
<p>‘Perhaps not as much as that.’</p>
<p>‘Well, let’s just suppose, for the moment. You need thirty roubles
for a horse, there’s saddle repairs - that’s all. So, that makes
twenty-five, plus one hundred and twenty, plus thirty - one hundred and
seventy-five. So you’re left with about twenty for luxuries such as tea,
sugar, tobacco. There - do you see? Aren’t I right, Nikolay
Fyodorych?’</p>
<p>‘I’m afraid not, Abram Ilich!’ the adjutant timidly replied. ‘You
wouldn’t have enough for tea or sugar. You can reckon a uniform will
last you two years, but with all these campaigns you’ll never have
enough trousers to see you through. And what about boots? I wear out a
pair almost every month. Then there’s underclothes, shirts, towels,
leggings - all that has to be paid for, sir. Add it up and you’ll find
you won’t have a kopeck left. It’s true, Abram Ilich!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, it’s lovely wearing leggings,’ Kraft suddenly remarked after a
minute’s silence, pronouncing ‘leggings’ with particular affection. ‘All
this is so very Russian!’</p>
<p>‘Let me tell you,’ Trosenko said, ‘however you add it up you’ll find
that we should all really be starving. But in actual fact we manage to
survive, smoke our tobacco and drink our vodka. If you’ve been serving
in the army as long as I have,’ he continued, turning to the ensign,
‘then you’ll learn how to get by. Do you know how this officer treats
his batman, gentlemen?’</p>
<p>Trosenko almost died with laughter as he told us the whole story of
the ensign and his batman, although we had heard it a thousand
times.</p>
<p>‘And why are you sitting there looking like a rosebud, old chap?’ he
continued, still addressing his remarks to the ensign who could not stop
blushing, sweating and smiling - so much so, one felt really sorry for
him. ‘Don’t worry, lad, I was like you once, but you can see for
yourself what a fine fellow I am now! When those young hotheads first
come here from Russia - we know their sort all right - they get spasms
and rheumatism. But here am I, snug as a bug. This place is my house, my
bed - everything ! You see …’</p>
<p>He downed another glass of vodka.</p>
<p>’What?’he said, staring right into Kraft’s eyes.</p>
<p>‘Now, there’s a man I respect! A real Caucasian! Allow me to shake
your hand.’ Kraft pushed us all aside as he made his way over to
Trosenko, grasped his hand and shook it with deep feeling.</p>
<p>‘Yes, we can rightly say we’ve gone through everything here,’ he
continued. ‘In ’45 - yes, you were there, Captain, weren’t you? Do you
remember the night of the twelfth, when we were knee-deep in mud and
then attacked the enemy next morning? In those days I was attached to
the commander-in-chief and we captured twenty enemy positions in one
day. Do you remember, Captain?’</p>
<p>Trosenko nodded, stuck out his lower lip and screwed up his eyes.</p>
<p>‘You see,’ Kraft went on, extremely excited and making quite
inappropriate gestures as he turned to the major. But the major, who
must have heard the story many times, suddenly gave the other such a
dull, glazed look that Kraft turned away and addressed Bolkhov and me,
looking at each of us in turn. He did not look at Trosenko once during
the whole narrative.</p>
<p>‘So, you see, when we came out that morning the commander-in-chief
told me, “Kraft! Capture those barricades!” Well, you know how it is in
the army - no arguing. You salute and get on with it. “Yes, Your
Excellency!” I said - and off I went. The moment we reached the first
defences I turned round and told my men, “Now, lads, no retreating. Keep
your eyes open. If anyone lags behind I’ll chop him to pieces myself!”
Well, you can’t mince words with Russian soldiers. And then, suddenly, a
shell landed … and I could see one soldier, a second, a third … then
bullets … Eeee-eeee-eeee! I called out, “Come on, lads, follow me!” But
the moment we got there I saw a … you know what it’s called … ?’ At this
point the narrator waved his arms as he tried to find the right
word.</p>
<p>‘A ditch?’ Bolkhov ventured.</p>
<p>‘No … Ach, what on earth is it called? Why yes … a ditch!’ he said
quickly. ‘So, rifles at the ready … Hoorah! Ta-ra-ta-ta! But there
wasn’t a soul to be seen. We were all surprised, you know. So far so
good! On we went towards the second position. Now, that was quite a
different proposition. All of us were burning for action! We moved
closer, you know, and I took a good look at the second position and saw
it was impossible to go on - there was a … what do you call it? Ach,
what’s it called?’</p>
<p>‘Another ditch?’ I suggested.</p>
<p>‘No, nothing like it,’ he continued irritably. ‘No, not a ditch … oh,
what do you call it?’ And he made an inane gesture with his hand. ‘Ach,
what on earth is it called?’</p>
<p>He was obviously suffering so much that one could not help prompting
him.</p>
<p>‘A river, perhaps?’ Bolkhov said.</p>
<p>‘No, just a ditch. We were about to go over when, would you believe
it, they opened up with such intense fire it was sheer hell!’</p>
<p>At that moment someone outside the hut asked for me. It was Maximov.
As I had heard the eventful story before and knew that there were still
thirteen barricades to go, I eagerly seized the opportunity of returning
to my platoon. Trosenko came out with me.</p>
<p>‘What a load of rot!’ he said when we were a few yards from the hut.
‘He was never anywhere near any barricades,’ he added, laughing so
heartily that I too had to laugh.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>The dark night had closed in and only dim bonfires lit the camp when
I finished my duties and went off to join my men. A large stump was
smouldering on the coals and only three soldiers were sitting around it:
Antonov, who was turning a tin of riabko9 on the fire; Zhdanov, who was
pensively raking the embers with a long dry branch; and Chikin with his
pipe that was always out. The others had already lain down to sleep,
some under the ammunition wagons, some in the hay, some by the fires. In
the feeble light of the coals I could distinguish familiar backs, legs,
heads. Among those around the fire was the young recruit, who lay very
close and seemed asleep already. The all-pervading smell of mist and the
smoke from the damp firewood made my eyes smart and the same fine
drizzle fell from the dreary sky.</p>
<p>Nearby could be heard the regular sound of snoring, the crackle of
twigs in the fire, soft voices and the occasional rattle of infantry
rifles. All around fires were burning, lighting up the dark shapes of
the soldiers within a small radius. Just by the nearest fires, where the
light was strongest, I could make out the bare figures of soldiers
waving their shirts right over the flames. Many soldiers were still
awake, moving around and talking within an area of about sixty square
yards. But that melancholy, deathly night lent a peculiar, mysterious
air to every movement, as if the men were affected by the dismal silence
and were afraid to disturb its peace and harmony. Whenever I spoke I
felt that my voice sounded different and I could read the same mood on
the face of every soldier sitting by the fire. Before I arrived I
thought that they had been discussing their wounded comrade. Not a bit
of it: Chikin was telling everyone about receiving goods in Tiflis and
about the schoolboys there.</p>
<p>Everywhere I have been, and especially the Caucasus, I have always
noted the peculiar tact shown by the Russian soldier, who, in times of
danger, passes over in silence anything that could have a bad effect on
his comrades’ morale. The spirit of the Russian soldier, unlike that of
southern nations, is not based on easily inflammable but rapidly waning
enthusiasm: it is as difficult to rouse him to action as to demoralize
him. He needs no special effects - speeches, war-cries, songs or drums.
On the contrary: he needs order, and calm, and a complete lack of
pressure. In the Russian - the true Russian - soldier, one will never
encounter boasting, any kind of bravado or the desire to stupefy or
excite himself in times of danger. On the contrary: humility, modesty
and the ability to see in danger something quite different from danger
are the distinctive features of his character. I once saw a soldier with
a leg wound, whose first thoughts were of the hole in his sheepskin
coat, and a cavalry-man who crawled out from under his horse that had
just been killed and unbuckled the girths to save the saddle. Who can
ever forget that incident during the siege of Gergebil, when the fuse of
a live bomb caught fire in a laboratory and the gun-sergeant ordered two
soldiers to run and throw it into a ravine. But they did not get rid of
it at the nearest point, which was just by the colonel’s tent, on the
edge of the ravine, but ran further away with it lest they wake the
gentlemen asleep in the tent and as a result were both blown to bits. I
can still remember the time when, during the campaign of 1852, a young
soldier happened to comment, during some action, that the platoon didn’t
have a hope in hell of getting out alive, whereupon the entire platoon
furiously attacked him for such a cowardly remark, which they could not
even bring themselves to repeat. And now, when everyone’s thoughts must
have been of Velenchuk, when Tartars might creep up on us and fire a
volley any moment, everyone listened to Chikin’s lively tale and no one
mentioned either the day’s action, or the impending danger, or the
wounded comrade, just as if it had all happened God knows how long ago,
or not at all. But it did strike me that their faces were somewhat
gloomier than usual: they did not pay much attention to Chikin’s story
and even Chikin felt that they were not listening. All the same, he
carried on.</p>
<p>Maximov came over to the fire and sat beside me. Chikin made room for
him, stopped talking and started sucking his pipe again.</p>
<p>‘The infantry have sent to the camp for some vodka,’ Maximov said
after a rather long silence. ‘The sergeant said that he saw our
Velenchuk there.’</p>
<p>‘Well, is he alive?’ Antonov asked, turning his mess tin.</p>
<p>‘No, he died.’</p>
<p>The young recruit suddenly raised his small head with its red cap
above the fire, stared at Maximov and me for a minute or so and then
quickly lowered it again and wrapped himself tighter in his
greatcoat.</p>
<p>‘So, you see, death didn’t call on him for nothing this morning when
I had to wake him up in the artillery park,’ Antonov remarked.</p>
<p>‘Rubbish!’ Zhdanov retorted, turning a smouldering log; everyone fell
silent.</p>
<p>Amidst the general silence a shot rang out behind us in the camp. Our
drummers replied by beating the tattoo. When the last drum rolls had
died away, Zhdanov was first to get to his feet and take off his
cap.</p>
<p>We all followed his example.</p>
<p>A harmonious chorus of manly voices echoed in the deep silence of the
night.</p>
<p>‘Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day
our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil …’</p>
<p>‘In ’45 a soldier was struck by a shell just here,’ Antonov said
after we had put our caps on and sat down again by the fire. ‘We carted
him around for two days on a gun carriage - do you remember Shevchenko,
Zhdanov? - and then we had to leave him under that tree over there.’</p>
<p>Just then an infantryman with enormous sidewhiskers and a moustache,
carrying a rifle and cartridges pouch, came over to our fire.</p>
<p>‘Give us a light for my pipe, lads,’ he asked.</p>
<p>‘Help yourself, there’s plenty of fire!’ Chikin said.</p>
<p>‘I suppose it’s Dargo10 you’re talking about?’ the infantryman asked
Antonov.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Dargo in ’45,’ Antonov replied.</p>
<p>The infantryman shook his head, screwed up his eyes and squatted
beside us.</p>
<p>‘Yes, we had a rough time of it there,’ he remarked.</p>
<p>‘Why did you leave him?’ I asked Antonov.</p>
<p>‘He was suffering terribly from a stomach wound. Whenever we stopped
he was all right, but he screamed his head off the moment we moved. He
begged us to leave him, but we didn’t have the heart. Well, then they
started letting us have it. Three of our gun crew were killed and one of
the officers, and somehow we got cut off from our battery. We were in a
right mess and didn’t think we’d ever get our guns out, what with all
that mud.’</p>
<p>’It was muddiest of all by the Indian Mountain,’11 a soldier
said.</p>
<p>‘Yes, that’s where he got worse. Anoshenko - the old gun-sergeant -
and me thought about it and decided he didn’t have a dog’s chance of
getting out of it alive and he kept begging us in God’s name to leave
him there. So that’s what we did. There was a tree, a kind of willow. We
put some soaked rusks down in front of him - Zhdanov had a few - propped
him up against that tree there, put a clean shirt on him, said a proper
goodbye and left him.’</p>
<p>‘Was he much of a soldier?’</p>
<p>‘He was all right,’ Zhdanov said.</p>
<p>‘God only knows what became of him,’ Antonov continued. ‘We lost a
lot of our lads there.’</p>
<p>‘At Dargo?’ the infantryman asked, rising to his feet, scraping his
pipe and again screwing up his eyes and shaking his head. ‘It was really
tough.’ And he walked away.</p>
<p>‘Were there many from our battery at Dargo?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, Zhdanov was there, myself, Patsan, who’s on leave just now,
and about another six - no more.’</p>
<p>‘Has old Patsan gone on a spree? He’s been away for so long now,’
Chikin said, stretching his legs and laying his head on a log. ‘I reckon
he’s been gone nearly a year now.’</p>
<p>‘And what about you - have you had your year’s leave yet?’ I asked
Zhdanov.</p>
<p>‘No, not yet,’ he replied reluctantly.</p>
<p>‘But it’s good to go, you know,’ Antonov said. ‘If you’re from a rich
family, or if you’re able to work, it’s good to go. Everyone at home’s
usually so pleased to see you.’</p>
<p>‘But what if you have two brothers, like me?’ Zhdanov continued.
‘They have to worry about finding enough food for themselves without
having to feed a soldier as well. You can’t be much good after
twenty-five years in the army. And who knows if they’re still
alive?’</p>
<p>‘Didn’t you write to them?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Of course I did. I sent two letters but didn’t get a reply. Either
they’re dead or they don’t write because they’re living from hand to
mouth themselves. So what can I do?’</p>
<p>‘Was it long ago that you wrote?’</p>
<p>‘The last time was when I came back from Dargo. Come on, sing us “The
Little Birch Tree”,’ Zhdanov asked Antonov, who was sitting with his
elbows on his knees, humming some tune. Antonov started singing.</p>
<p>‘It’s Grandpa Zhdanov’s favourite song,’ Chikin whispered to me,
tugging at my coat. ‘Sometimes, when Filipp Antonych sings it, he fair
cries his heart out.’</p>
<p>At first Zhdanov sat quite still, his eyes fixed on the smouldering
coals and his face extremely gloomy in the reddish glow. Then his jaws
started moving faster and faster beneath the ears and finally he got up,
spread his coat out and lay down in the shadows behind the fire. It was
either his tossing and groaning as he settled down to sleep, or it may
have been the effect of Velenchuk’s death and the miserable weather on
me, but I really had the impression he was crying.</p>
<p>The bottom of the stump that had now turned to charcoal occasionally
flared up, illuminating Antonov’s figure with his grey whiskers, red
face and medals on the coat slung over his shoulders, or someone’s
boots, head or back. The same mournful drizzle was falling and that same
smell of damp and smoke was in the air. All around I could see the
bright dots of dying camp-fires and the plaintive sounds of Antonov’s
song broke the general silence. Whenever he stopped for a moment the
faint, nocturnal noises of the camp - the snoring, the clash of
sentries’ rifles and those soft voices - seemed to take up the tune.</p>
<p>‘Second watch! Makatyuk and Zhdanov!’ shouted Maximov.</p>
<p>Antonov stopped singing, Zhdanov got up, sighed, stepped across a log
and slowly made his way to the guns.</p>
