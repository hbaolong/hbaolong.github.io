<h4 id="polikushka">POLIKUSHKA</h4>
<p>I</p>
<p>‘You’ll have to give the order, madam. It is a pity about the
Dutlovs, though. They’re all good lads, but one of them will have to go
unless we send a house serf,’ said the steward. ‘As things stand,
though, everybody’s pointing in their direction. Anyway, it’s your
decision.’</p>
<p>And he placed his right hand over his left, holding them together
over his stomach as he tilted his head away from her and sucked in his
thin lips, almost tut-tutting; meanwhile he rolled his eyes, said
nothing more and made it clear that he was going to keep quiet for some
time to come while he listened without interrupting to the utter
nonsense that his mistress was about to come out with.</p>
<p>He was a steward who had come up through the servant ranks.
Clean-shaven and sporting the long coat that is the distinguishing
feature of a steward, he stood before his mistress on an autumn evening,
having come to report. For the mistress the concept of reporting meant
listening to his account of estate business past and future. For Yegor
Mikhaylovich, the steward, it meant standing ceremoniously in a corner
with his toes turned out, eyes on the sofa, listening to all sorts of
irrelevant chatter and using every trick in the book to bring his
mistress to the point where her patience would run out and she would
snap, ‘Go on then’ to everything Yegor Mikhaylovich was proposing.</p>
<p>Today’s topic was conscription for military service.1 The village of
Pokrovskoye was required to provide three men. Two were settled beyond
doubt, ordained by fate through a combination of family circumstances,
morality and economics. As far as they were concerned there could be no
shilly-shallying, no arguing of their case by the commune, the mistress
or public opinion. The third place was open to question. The steward
wanted to exempt Dutlov, even though he came from a three-man family,
and send a married house serf called Polikey (or Polikushka) who had an
extremely bad reputation, more than once having been caught stealing
sacks, tackle and corn. But the mistress, who had often cosseted his
ragged children and was using biblical precepts to improve his moral
condition, did not want to give him up. At the same time, however, she
wished no ill on the Dutlovs, whom she did not know and had never set
eyes on. Somehow she couldn’t get it into her head, and the steward
couldn’t bring himself to tell her straight out, that if Polikushka
didn’t go, a Dutlov would. ‘No, I don’t want the Dutlovs to suffer,’ she
would say, with feeling. ‘If you won’t do it, just cough up three
hundred roubles for somebody else,’ is what she should have been told in
response. But that would have been impolitic.</p>
<p>And so Yegor Mikhaylovich took up an easy stance, even leaning
surreptitiously against the doorpost, though a look of servility never
left his face as he watched his mistress’s lips moving and her cap
frills dancing with matching shadows under the picture on the wall. But
he felt no need whatsoever to grapple with the meaning of what she was
saying. A spasm of yawning caught him behind the ears, but he was smart
enough to convert the trembling into a cough, covering up with one hand
and pretending to have a frog in his throat. Not long ago I was watching
as Lord Palmerston sat there with a hat over his face while a member of
the opposition was fulminating against the government, only for him to
rise suddenly and launch into a three-hour oration, rebutting his
opponent’s every last point. I watched this and was not surprised
because I had seen the like of it a thousand times between Yegor
Mikhaylovich and his mistress. He may have been afraid of nodding off,
or perhaps he felt that she was getting carried away, but now he simply
transferred his bulk from his right foot to his left and spoke,
beginning as always with an unctuous preamble.</p>
<p>‘May it please you, madam… it’s just that, er … it’s just that
there’s a meeting being held now outside my office, and we must bring
things to a conclusion. The order says we have to get the recruits into
town before the Feast of Pokrov.2 The Dutlovs are being put forward, and
nobody else. And the commune doesn’t take your interests into account.
They don’t mind us ruining the Dutlovs. But I know what a struggle
they’ve had. They’ve been living in poverty ever since I took over. The
old man’s just finished waiting for his youngest nephew to grow up, and
now they’re going be ruined again. You know me. As I’m sure you’re kind
enough to acknowledge, I look after your property as if it was my own.
It’s a pity, madam, whatever you may think. They’re not my kith and kin,
and they haven’t slipped me anything -’</p>
<p>‘I’m sure I never thought they had, Yegor,’ the mistress cut in, and
immediately it occurred to her that he had been bribed by the
Dutlovs.</p>
<p>‘And there’s no better farmstead in the whole of the village.
God-fearing, hard-working peasants they are. The old man’s been a church
elder for thirty years, he doesn’t drink and he doesn’t use bad
language. He is a church-going man.’ (The steward knew how to get round
people.) ‘But I’m telling you - the most important thing is this. He
only has two sons. The others are nephews. The commune points to them,
but the truth is they ought to count as a two-man family in the ballot.
Other families, some with three sons, have split up because they are so
feckless, and now they’re all right, while these have to suffer because
they’re good-living people.’</p>
<p>By this time the mistress was taking nothing in. She was not taking
in the meaning of ‘a two-man family in the ballot’ or ‘good-living
people’, she was just hearing words and studying the nankeen buttons on
the steward’s coat: the top one was probably not buttoned very often
because it looked firm, whereas the middle one had come away and was
hanging loose - it should have been sewn back on long before now. But,
for the purposes of conversation, especially business conversation,
everyone knows that you don’t have to take in what is being said to you,
you just have to remember what you wanted to say. That is how the
mistress was proceeding.</p>
<p>‘You don’t seem to get it into your head, Yegor Mikhaylovich,’ she
said. ‘I certainly don’t want one of the Dutlovs to go for a soldier.
I’m sure you can judge from what you know of me that I do what I can to
help my peasants, and I do not wish them any harm. You know I would
sacrifice everything to avoid this grievous necessity and make sure that
neither Dutlov nor Khoryushkin goes.’ (I cannot say whether the thought
occurred to the steward that to avoid this grievous necessity it wasn’t
necessary to sacrifice everything - three hundred roubles would have
been enough - but it may well have done.) ‘But I have only one thing to
say to you: nothing will make me send Polikey. After that business with
the clock, when he came and made a clean breast of it and he wept and
swore to go straight, I had a long talk to him, and I could see he was
moved and truly repentant.’ (That’s it. She’s off again, thought Yegor
Mikhaylovich, and he turned his attention to the syrup she had dropped
into her glass of water - was it orange or lemon? Must be something
bitter, he thought.) ‘That was seven months ago and in all that time
he’s never been drunk and his behaviour has been impeccable. His wife
has told me he’s not the same man. How can you possibly want me to
punish him just when he’s reformed? And wouldn’t it be inhuman to send a
man with five children and only him to look after them? No, you’d better
not say any more about it, Yegor …’</p>
<p>And the mistress drank from her glass.</p>
<p>Yegor Mikhaylovich followed the water as it went down her throat. His
response was sharp and succinct.</p>
<p>‘So, you want me to send Dutlov?’</p>
<p>‘Don’t you understand what I’m saying? Do I wish Dutlov any harm?
Have I got it in for him? As God’s my witness, I’m ready to do anything
for them.’ (She glanced at the picture in the corner, but suddenly
realized it wasn’t a holy one.) ‘Never mind,’ she thought. ‘That’s not
the point.’ (Again, it was curious that the idea of three hundred
roubles never occurred to her.) ‘Well, what do I do? Do you think I know
the ins and outs of this? I can’t possibly know. I rely on you, and you
know what I want. Just do something that will leave everybody happy,
without breaking the law. They’re not the only ones - everybody has a
bad time now and then. But Polikey cannot be sent. You must understand -
it would be terrible coming from me.’</p>
<p>She would have said more - she was in full flight - but at that
moment a maid came into the room.</p>
<p>‘What do want, Dunyasha?’</p>
<p>‘A peasant has come and told me to ask Yegor Mikhaylovich whether the
meeting should wait for him to come back,’ said Dunyasha, with an angry
look at Yegor Mikhaylovich. (Oh, that steward, he’s gone and upset the
mistress, she was thinking. Now it’ll be two in the morning before we
get to sleep.)</p>
<p>‘You must go, Yegor,’ said the mistress. ‘Just do the best you
can.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, ma’am.’ (He said nothing more about Dutlov.) ‘But who shall I
send to fetch the money from the market gardener?’</p>
<p>‘Is Petrusha not back from town?’</p>
<p>‘No, ma’am.’</p>
<p>‘Can’t Nikolay go?’</p>
<p>‘His dad’s laid up with a bad back.’</p>
<p>‘Would you like me to go tomorrow?’ asked the steward.</p>
<p>‘No. I need you here, Yegor.’ (The mistress had a sudden thought.)
‘How much is involved?’</p>
<p>‘Four hundred and sixty-two roubles, madam.’</p>
<p>‘Send Polikey,’ said the mistress decisively, looking Yegor
Mikhaylovich straight in the face.</p>
<p>Yegor Mikhaylovich twisted his lips into something resembling a
smile, without showing his teeth. His face did not change.</p>
<p>‘Yes, madam.’</p>
<p>‘Send him to me.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, madam.’</p>
<p>And Yegor Mikhaylovich walked off to his office.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Polikey, as a person of no standing and with a tarnished reputation,
born in another village, had no one to look after his interests, neither
housekeeper, butler, steward nor maid, and his corner was the worst one,
even though he had a wife and family to support. The corners had been
set up by the late master in the following way: in the middle of a
stone-built house, about twenty-three feet square, stood a Russian stove
with a passage around it that the house serfs called a ‘cóllidor’, and
each corner was boarded off. This meant there was very little space,
especially in Polikey’s corner right next to the door. The entire corner
was taken up by the conjugal bed with its quilt and cotton-print
pillows, a cradle with a baby in it, a small three-legged table used for
preparing meals, doing the washing and accommodating all the household
bits and pieces, and also for Polikey to work on (he was a horse
doctor), little tubs, clothing, chickens, a calf and the family of
seven, and there wouldn’t have been room to turn round if it hadn’t been
for the communal stove, a quarter of which presented itself as a place
for things and people to lie on, and also the chance of going out on to
the porch. And even that was not always possible; October was a cold
month and the only item of warm clothing was one sheepskin coat between
the seven of them. Still, the little ones kept warm by running about and
the older ones by working, and both lots by climbing up on to the stove,
which could get up to forty degrees. It may seem too ghastly for people
to live in conditions like these, but they didn’t think so; you could
get by. Akulina washed and mended for the children and her husband, did
some spinning and weaving, and bleached the linen, and she quarrelled
and gossiped with her neighbours while she did the cooking on the
communal stove. The monthly rations fed the children, with a pinch or
two left over for the cow. The firewood was free, and also the cattle
fodder, and a little hay from the stables sometimes came their way. They
had their own small patch in the vegetable garden. Their little cow had
calved; they kept their own chickens. Polikey worked in the stables
looking after two stallions. He bled the horses and cattle, cleaned
their hooves, drained their swellings and treated them with an ointment
of his own making, for which he was paid in money or in kind. Some of
the mistress’s oats were always going spare, and for a couple of
portions a peasant in the village would let them have twenty pounds of
mutton a month. It would have been a decent living if it hadn’t been for
certain troubles of the spirit, real troubles that affected the whole
family. Polikey had grown up on a stud farm in a nearby village. He fell
into the hands of a groom who was the biggest crook in the district, and
eventually got himself sent to Siberia. Polikey received his first
lessons from this groom and by the time he became a young man he was so
set in this man’s silly ways that he couldn’t stop, even though he
wanted to. He was young and feckless, he had no mother or father, no one
to teach him. Polikey liked a drink or two, and he couldn’t bear to see
things lying around. Strap or saddle, lock or bolt, or something worth a
bit more - it all ended up in Polikey’s hands. There were always people
willing to take these things and pay for them in wine or money, by
agreement. People say this is the easiest way to earn a living; no
training, no effort, nothing needed, and once you’ve tried it you won’t
want any other kind of work. There’s only one thing wrong with this:
everything comes cheap and the living is easy, but suddenly some lousy
devils will knock the bottom out of the trade, you have to stump up and
life isn’t fun any more.</p>
<p>This is what happened to Polikey. Polikey had got married, and God
had looked after him. His wife, a cowherd’s daughter, turned out to be a
healthy, intelligent woman and a hard worker, who bore him one fine baby
after another. Polikey kept on at his trade, and all was well. Then
suddenly it all went wrong, and he was in trouble. He was in trouble
over nothing at all - just some peasant’s reins he had hidden away. But
he was found out, given a thrashing and taken before the mistress, and
from then on he was under observation. He was soon in trouble again, and
then a third time. The people despised him, the steward threatened him
with military service, the mistress rebuked him, his wife wept with a
broken heart - everything was inside out. He was a nice man rather than
a bad one, but he was weak, he loved his drink and he had got so used to
it that he couldn’t stop. His wife would shout at him and even beat him
when he came home drunk, but he would collapse in tears. ‘I’m a dead
loss,’ he would say. ‘What can I do? Poke my eyes out, I’m packing it
in. I won’t do it again.’ But lo, a month has gone by, he’s away from
home for a couple of days again, and he’s drunk. ‘Where does he get the
money from to go on a drunken spree?’ people wondered. His last exploit
concerned the office clock. In the office there was an old-fashioned
wall clock that had long since stopped working. The office was unlocked
one day and he happened to go in alone. Tempted by the clock, he took it
away with him, went down town and sold it. Inevitably, it would seem,
the shopkeeper who took the clock off his hands happened to be related
to one of the house serfs; he came to visit them in the country and told
them about the clock. An investigation was conducted, though it was
hardly necessary. The steward had it in for Polikey. They caught him.
They told the mistress. The mistress summoned Polikey. Immediately he
fell at her feet, full of emotion, movingly confessed everything, just
as his wife had told him to. He played his part well. The mistress
reasoned with him, she went on and on, moaning away about God and living
a good life and the life to come and his wife and children until she
reduced him to tears.</p>
<p>The mistress said, ‘I forgive you. But you must promise never to do
it again.’</p>
<p>‘Never again. Cross my heart and hope to die. May my guts be torn
out!’ said Polikey, moving her with his tears.</p>
<p>Polikey went home and for a whole day he lay on the stove bellowing
like a young calf. Since then Polikey had never been seen doing anything
wrong. But his life had become a misery. He was looked on as a thief
and, now that the time for conscription was upon them, all fingers
pointed at him.</p>
<p>Polikey, as has been said, was a horse doctor. How he had suddenly
become a horse doctor nobody knew, least of all Polikey. At the stables,
working with the groom who was sent to Siberia, his only job, apart from
a little grooming and carrying water, was mucking out the boxes. He
couldn’t have learned his trade here. Then he worked as a weaver and a
gardener, clearing paths. Then he spent some time as a convict smashing
bricks. Then, paying his mistress a tax for leave of absence, he hired
himself out as a porter to a merchant. So, he received no training
there. But during his latest spell at home he began to get something of
a reputation for exceptional, almost supernatural skill with horses. He
bled one horse, then another, then dragged one down, fiddled about with
one of its haunches, told them to put it into a stall, and cut into its
hoof frog until it bled and the horse whinnied and thrashed about, which
he ignored, saying it was a question of ‘draining the sub-hoof blood’.
He then explained to a peasant that it was necessary to bleed both veins
‘for greater ease’, and he began to hit the blunt lancet with a mallet,
then he bandaged the belly of the yardman’s horse with a piece of
selvage from his wife’s headscarf. Finally, he took to splashing all
sorts of sores with vitriol, treating horses with liquid from a little
bottle and sometimes giving them medicine made from anything that came
to hand. And the more horses he tortured to death, the more faith people
had in him and the more horses they brought to him.</p>
<p>My feeling is that we gentlemen are hardly in a position to laugh at
Polikey. The tricks he used to inspire confidence are the same ones that
worked for our fathers, still work for us and will continue to work for
our children. The peasant who lies with his belly pressing down on the
head of his only mare - which not only constitutes his only source of
wealth but is also virtually a member of the family - and whose eyes are
full of trust and terror as he watches Polikey’s frowning, purposeful
face, his rolled-up sleeves and skinny hands as they go to work
deliberately probing the very spot that hurts and cutting boldly into
the living flesh (while the peasant thinks to himself, ‘Bandy old girl,
she’ll come through it’), with the air of one who knows where to find
blood, and where to find pus, and can tell a tendon from a vein, as he
holds a healing swab or a bottle of vitriol between his teeth - this
peasant couldn’t imagine that Polikey might raise his hand to make a cut
without knowing what he was doing. He couldn’t do such a thing. And once
the cut had been made he wasn’t going to reproach himself for letting it
go ahead when it wasn’t necessary. I don’t know about you, but I’ve
experienced precisely the same thing with a doctor tormenting my nearest
and dearest at my behest. The lancet, the mystery of the little white
bottle of mercuric chloride, and words like staggers, glanders,
bleeding, draining the pus, and so on - are they not the same as nerves,
rheumatism, organism, and so on? ‘Be bold enough to risk mistakes and
dreams,’ as the German saying goes, but this applies less to poets than
to doctors of horses and of men.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>On that cold, dark October evening, when the village was holding its
noisy meeting outside the office to decide on the conscripts, Polikey
was sitting on the edge of his bed working at the table, using a bottle
to grind up some horse medicine without knowing what was in it. It
contained some corrosive sublimate, some sulphur, Glauber’s salt3 and a
herb that Polikey liked to pick, having got hold of the idea that it was
effective with broken-winded horses and might come in handy for treating
other ailments. The children were in bed, two on the stove, two on the
bed itself and the baby in its cradle, next to which Akulina sat with
her spinning. A candle end that had been left lying around in the
mistress’s house stood burning on the windowsill in its wooden holder,
and Akulina would get up now and then to trim it so that her husband
didn’t have to interrupt his important work. Some free-thinking people
considered Polikey a nonentity as a horse doctor, and as a man. Others -
the majority - considered him a bad man but a great master of his trade.
Akulina, though, despite all her shouting at him and even hitting him,
had no doubts - he was the best horse doctor and the best man in the
world. Polikey sprinkled another ingredient into the palm of his hand.
(He didn’t use scales, and spoke scathingly of the Germans, who did,
saying, ‘This isn’t a chemist’s shop.’) Polikey threw in his handful and
shook it up, but there didn’t seem to be enough of it so he poured out
ten times as much again. ‘Chuck it all in, it’ll give them more of a
lift,’ he mumbled to himself. Akulina looked round sharply at the words
of her lord and master, anticipating some instructions, but when she saw
it was nothing to do with her she gave a shrug. ‘Look how clever he is!
I don’t know where he gets it from,’ she thought as she went back to her
spinning. The piece of paper which the last ingredient had been poured
from fell down on to the floor. This did not escape Akulina’s
attention.</p>
<p>‘Anyutka,’ she called out, ‘look, Daddy’s dropped something on the
floor. Pick it up for him.’</p>
<p>Anyutka put her thin little bare legs out from under the cloak that
was covering her and slid down under the table like a kitten to get the
piece of paper.</p>
<p>‘Here you are, Daddy,’ she said, and slipped her little cold feet
back into bed.</p>
<p>‘Don’t puth me,’ lisped her little sister, whining sleepily.</p>
<p>‘I’ll be after you two!’ said Akulina, and both heads disappeared
under the cloak.</p>
<p>‘He’ll give me three roubles,’ said Polikey, corking the bottle.
‘I’ll put his horse right. He’s getting it cheap,’ he added. ‘Hard on
the brain, though. Akulina, slip over and get some baccy from Nikita.
I’ll pay him back tomorrow.’</p>
<p>And Polikey went through his trousers, pulled out a lime-wood pipe
that had once been painted and now had sealing wax instead of a proper
stem, and started to fiddle with it.</p>
<p>Akulina left her spindle and eased her way out without snagging
anything, which was no mean achievement. Polikey opened a little
cupboard and put the medicine bottle inside. He took down an empty
little glass container and tilted it into his mouth, but there was no
vodka in it. He scowled, but once his wife had brought him the tobacco
and he had filled his pipe, lit up and sat back on the bed, his face
took on the proud and satisfied glow of a man with a good day’s work
behind him. Whether or not he was thinking about tomorrow, when he would
take hold of a horse by the tongue and pour his amazing mixture into its
mouth, or reflecting that a man who is needed never meets with refusal -
hadn’t Nikita sent him some tobacco? - he was feeling fine. Then
suddenly the door, which hung on a single hinge, was flung open and into
their corner came a girl from ‘up there’, not the second maid, but the
third one, a slip of a girl who was kept on to run errands. (‘Up there’,
as everyone knows, means the master’s house, even if it is situated on
lower ground.) Aksyuta - that was the girl’s name - flew everywhere like
a bullet and, as she did so, instead of bending her arms she swung them,
not at her sides but out in front of her body, like two pendulums
keeping time with her running speed. Her cheeks were always redder than
her pink dress; her tongue always moved at the same speed as her legs.
She flew into the room, grabbed hold of the stove for no apparent reason
and began rocking forwards and backwards. She seemed to want to speak no
more than two or three words at a time, but suddenly she turned to
Akulina and gasped out the following message:</p>
<p>‘The mistress wants Polikey up at the house this minute, she does …’
(She stopped and took a deep breath.) ‘Yegor Mikhaylovich has been
talking to the mistress about the constription… and Polikey’s name come
up … Avdotya Nikolayevna wants him up there this minute… Avdotya
Nikolayevna wants him’ (another gasp) ‘up there this minute.’</p>
<p>For half a minute or so Aksyuta looked at Polikey, Akulina and the
children, who had stuck their heads out from under the blanket, then she
grabbed a nutshell lying on the stove and threw it at Anyutka, said
‘This minute’ once last time and whirled out of the room. The pendulums
were soon swinging at their normal speed across the line of her
flight.</p>
<p>Akulina got to her feet again and found Polikey’s boots. The boots
were dreadful, all holes, a soldier’s boots. She took his coat down from
the stove and handed it over without looking at him.</p>
<p>‘Aren’t you going to change your shirt, Polikey?’</p>
<p>‘Nay, I’m not,’ said Polikey.</p>
<p>Akulina never once looked at him as he silently put on his boots and
his coat, and it was as well she didn’t. Polikey’s face was pale, his
jaw trembled and his eyes held the kind of tearful, submissive and
deeply unhappy expression that belongs only to those who are
good-natured but weak and guilty. He ran a comb through his hair, and
was about to walk out, but his wife stopped him and tucked in a bit of
his shirt braid that was hanging down outside his coat, and put the cap
on his head for him.</p>
<p>‘What’s all this, Polikey? Mistress sent for you?’ called the
carpenter’s wife through the partition.</p>
<p>Only that morning the carpenter’s wife had exchanged sharp words with
Akulina over a pot of lye4 that Polikey’s children had knocked over in
her corner, and her immediate reaction, on hearing that the mistress was
calling for Polikey, was to be pleased - it couldn’t mean anything good.
Besides, she was a shrewd, politically minded woman with a sharp tongue.
There was nobody better with a cutting word, or at least that was how
she saw herself on the quiet.</p>
<p>‘They must want somebody to go into town for some shopping,’ she went
on. ‘I’m sure they’ll choose somebody reliable. They’ll be sending you.
If they do, get me a quarter of tea, Polikey.’</p>
<p>Akulina was struggling with tears, and she screwed her lips into a
bitter expression. She felt like grabbing that bitch of a carpenter’s
wife by her mangy hair, but one look at her children made her think of
them as fatherless, and herself as a war widow, and she forgot the
carpenter’s wife with the sharp tongue, buried her face in her hands,
sat on the bed and let her head fall back into the pillows.</p>
<p>‘Mummy, you’re thquashing me!’ whined the lisping little girl,
jerking her cloak cover out from under her mother’s elbow.</p>
<p>‘I wish you were all dead and buried. I’ve brought you into the world
for nothing but suffering,’ cried Akulina, and the whole corner rang to
her sobbing, to the delight of the carpenter’s wife, who had not
forgotten that morning and the spilt lye.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Half an hour went by. The baby started crying. Akulina got up and fed
him. She had stopped weeping, but her eyes were staring on the guttering
candle and, with her thin but still beautiful face propped on one hand,
she was thinking about why she had got married, why they needed so many
soldiers, and also about how to get her own back on the carpenter’s
wife.</p>
<p>She heard her husband’s footsteps. She wiped away the traces of her
tears and stood up to let him through. Polikey walked in triumphant,
tossed his cap on to the bed, breathed out noisily and started to take
his belt off.</p>
<p>‘Well? What did she want?’</p>
<p>‘Ha. Everybody knows Polikushka’s the lowest of the low. But when a
job needs doing, who do they send? Polikushka.’</p>
<p>‘What job?’</p>
<p>Polikey was in no hurry to reply. He lit his pipe and spat.</p>
<p>‘I’ve been told to go and fetch some money from a merchant.’</p>
<p>‘You, carrying money?’</p>
<p>Polikey gave a chuckle and a wag of his head.</p>
<p>‘Right good with words, she is! “You’ve been under observation,” says
she, “what with you not bein’ reliable, only I trust you more than
anybody else.”’ (Polikey’s voice was raised so the neighbours could
hear.) “‘You promised me you would reform,” she says, “and here you are,
here’s the first proof that I trust you. Go and see the merchant, get
the money and bring it back to me.” And I says, “Madam,” I says, “we’m
your serfs, all of us, and we must serve you as we serve God, we must,
therefore I feels I can do anything for your sake and I can’t refuse no
duties. Whatever you tells me, I’ll do it, because I am your slave.”’
(He gave another chuckle, smiling that special smile, the one that
belongs to those who are good-natured but weak and guilty.) ‘ “Anyway,”
she says, “can you do the job properly? Do you understand,” she says,
“that your fate depends on this?” “How could I not understand that there
ain’t nothing I couldn’t do? And if they’ve been saying things about me,
well accusin’ people’s easy enough, but I ain’t never done nothin’, I
tell you, nothin’ that goes against you, and I wouldn’t think of it.”
Anyway, I sweet-talked the mistress until she went all soft. “You’re
goin’ to be my top man,” she says.’ (He stopped for a while, with the
same smile on his face.) ’I knows a bit about sweet-talkin’. Sometimes
when I was out workin’ on my own I used to run straight into trouble.
But just let me have a few words with the bloke an’ I could smooth ’im
down like silk.’</p>
<p>‘How much money?’ Akulina got in at last.</p>
<p>‘Fifteen hundred roubles,’ said Polikushka casually.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>‘When are you going?’</p>
<p>‘She’s told me to go tomorrow. “Take any horse you want,” she says.
“Call in at the office, and God go with you.”’</p>
<p>‘The Lord be praised!’ said Akulina, getting to her feet and making
the sign of the cross. ‘God help you, Polikey,’ she added in a whisper
so as not to be heard through the partition, holding him by the
shirtsleeve. ‘And you listen, Polikey. I’m asking you in the name of
Jesus - when you get going, swear on the cross you won’t touch a
drop.’</p>
<p>‘As if I’d have a drink when I’m riding with that kind of money!’ he
snorted. ‘Do you know, there were somebody up there playin’ the piano
ever so nice. It were lovely. Must’ve been the young lady. I was stood
there in front of her - the mistress, I mean - next to that cabinet, and
the young lady, she were tinklin’ away behind the door. Tinklin’ away
she were, tinklin’ away while she got it right. What a treat! Mind you,
I could’ve played, you know. I’d have mastered it. Wouldn’t have taken
me long. Good at things like that, I am. I’ll need a clean shirt
tomorrow.’</p>
<p>And they went to bed happy.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the office, the noisy meeting was under way. It
was no joking matter. Almost all the peasants were there and, while
Yegor Mikhaylovich was away seeing the mistress, they kept their caps
on. More and more voices were heard in the general clamour and they got
louder and louder. The murmur of deep voices, punctuated now and then by
hoarse cries and loud shouting, hovered in the air and, eventually, like
the sound of a roaring ocean, it reached the windows of the mistress,
where its agitating effect on her nerves was like the feeling brought on
by a heavy thunderstorm. It was a mixture of discomfort and fear. She
had the feeling that at any moment the voices would get louder and more
insistent, and something would happen. ‘As if it couldn’t all be done in
peace and quiet, with no arguments and no shouting,’ she thought, ‘in a
Christian spirit of brotherly love and meekness.’</p>
<p>Suddenly there was an outburst of many voices, but the loudest of
them belonged to Fyodor Rezun, the carpenter. Coming from a two-male
family, he was attacking the Dutlovs. Old Dutlov was defending himself.
Having started at the back, he had worked his way out in front of the
crowd. Gesticulating frantically and pulling at his short beard, he
coughed and spluttered so much as he spoke that even he would have had
difficulty in understanding his own speech. His children and nephews,
fine young lads all of them, clung together behind him, while old Dutlov
looked like a mother hen in a game of hawk-and-chickens. The hawk was
Rezun, but other people as well - all the two-male families, and those
with only one male, nearly everybody there - were attacking Dutlov. The
argument went as follows: Dutlov’s brother had been sent as a soldier
about thirty years ago, so he was claiming exemption from the list of
three-male families; he wanted his brother’s service to be taken into
consideration, which would mean putting him into the ballot along with
the two-male families and choosing the third recruit from the lot of
them. There were four other three-male families apart from the Dutlovs,
but one of them was headed by the village elder, and the mistress had
granted him exemption; one of the other families had supplied a
conscript last time round, and each of the other two was doing so now,
with one of them absent from the meeting, though his wife cut a pathetic
figure right at the back hoping vaguely for the wheel of fate to turn in
her favour. The second of the two nominated young men, red-haired Roman,
dressed in a tattered coat (though he was not a poor man), stood there
in silence leaning against the porch with his head bowed, glancing up
now and then to look closely at anyone who spoke up a little louder,
only to lower his head again. This made his whole figure look a picture
of misery. Old Semyon Dutlov was the sort of man that would have been
entrusted with hundreds or even thousands of roubles by anyone who had
the slightest knowledge of him. He was a steady, God-fearing man of no
little substance, and moreover an elder of the church. Thus it was all
the more striking to see him as worked up as he was now.</p>
<p>Rezun the carpenter was, by contrast, a tall, dark and assertive man
with a stormy temperament, a drinker, good in an argument, a strong
performer at public meetings, or in the market-place, and a good match
for anybody - workers and tradesmen, peasants and gentry. Self-possessed
but viciously effective, he now used his full height and all the power
of his strong voice and rhetorical skill to bear down on the spluttering
church elder, who had been completely put out and lost his composure.
Others were also involved in the argument. Garaska Kopylov, a stocky,
round-faced, youthful-looking, thick-set man with a square head and a
curly beard - one of the speakers from the younger generation who was
following on from Rezun - had a sharp turn of phrase and what he said
was beginning to carry weight at village meetings. Then there was Fyodor
Melnichny, a thin and lanky, round-shouldered and sallow-skinned
peasant, another young man, with tiny eyes and not much of a beard;
always sarcastic and sardonic, he could be relied on to see the dark
side of things and he often shocked the meeting with sudden volleys of
comments and questions. Both of these speakers sided with Rezun. There
were also a couple of men who liked the sound of their own voices, and
had to chip in now and then. One of them, Khrapkov, a man with the
kindest of faces and a flowing brown beard, would keep saying, ‘Oh, my
dearest friend …’ The other, a little chap by the name of Zhidkov, with
a face like a small bird‘s, kept on saying, ‘There we have it, my
brothers…’ - words that were well spoken and clearly addressed, but
completely irrelevant. They kept changing sides in the argument, but no
one was listening. There were others like them, but these two strutted
through the crowd shouting loudest, and they frightened the mistress,
though no one was listened to less than they were; carried away by the
noise and shouting, they were having a wonderful time letting their
tongues run free. There were all sorts of villagers there, sullen,
respectable, indifferent, downtrodden; there were peasant women with
sticks in their hands standing behind their men - but, God willing, I’ll
tell you about them some other time. Overall, though, the meeting
consisted of peasants standing as they did in church, whispering at the
back about day-to-day things like the best time to cut faggots in the
woods, or waiting and wondering how long it would be before all the
jabbering stopped. There were also some rich peasants whose prosperity
couldn’t have been added to or diminished by the village meeting. One
such was Yermil, a man with a broad shiny face; the peasants called him
‘big-belly’ because he was rich. Another was Starostin, whose face
exuded the self-satisfaction that comes from power, and seemed to be
saying, ‘Say what you like, nobody can touch me. My four lads, none of
them’s going.’ These two were sometimes set on by free-thinking men like
Kopylov and Rezun, but they spoke back calmly and firmly, knowing they
were untouchable. If Dutlov was like the mother hen in the
hawk-and-chickens game, his lads were not like the chickens. They stood
quietly behind him without a flutter or a squawk. The eldest of them,
Ignat, was thirty years old and married, as was the second son, Vasily,
who was unfit for service; the third lad, Ilyusha, Dutlov’s nephew, had
also recently got married. Fair-haired and rosy-cheeked, dressed in a
smart sheepskin coat (he worked as a driver), he stood there glancing at
the crowd from time to time, occasionally scratching the back of his
head under his hat as if it was nothing to do with him, whereas he was
the one the hawks were after.</p>
<p>‘Well, my grandad was a soldier,’ said Rezun, ‘so I’m not going in
the ballot. But there ain’t no such law, my friend. Last recruitment,
Mikheyevich was sent, and his uncle was still away serving.’</p>
<p>‘Your father and your uncle never served the Tsar,’ Dutlov was saying
at the same time. ‘And you’ve never served the masters or the village.
You’ve spent all your time boozing, and your kids have all gone away.
Nobody can live with you, yet you go on about other people and sending
them for service. Me, I’ve done ten years with the police and I’ve
served as an elder. Been burnt out twice, I have, and got help from
nobody, and now, just because everything’s right and proper in my house,
I’m facing ruin, am I? Give me my brother back, then. He’s probably died
out there. You should decide according to the law, and in God’s name.
This is a Christian village, not somewhere where they listen to a
ranting drunk.’</p>
<p>Also at the same time Gerasim was saying to Dutlov, ‘You talk about
your brother, but he wasn’t sent by the village, he was sent by the
masters for all them things he did. You can’t talk your way out of it
with him.’</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of Gerasim’s mouth when the sallow and
lanky Melnichny stepped forward and spoke gloomily.</p>
<p>‘That’s the way it is. The masters send who they want and the village
has to sort it out. The village decides to send your son, but if you
don’t like it, go and ask the mistress. She’ll maybe order me to go and
get my head shaved and leave my kids behind, and I’m the only man in the
family. That’s what the law does,’ he said bitterly before waving at
them and going back to his place.</p>
<p>Red-haired Roman, whose son had been chosen, looked up and said,
‘That’s it. That’s what it’s all about!’ and sat down furiously on the
step.</p>
<p>But these were not the only voices to be heard all speaking at once.
Apart from those at the back who were chatting about things that
mattered to them, those who liked the sound of their own voices were not
neglecting their duty.</p>
<p>“E’s right, you know. ‘Tis a Christian village,’ said the diminutive
Zhidkov, parroting Dutlov’s words. ‘We should decide like Christians.
Christians, that’s what we should decide like, brothers.’</p>
<p>‘We should let conscience decide, my dearest friend,’ said the
kind-hearted Khrapkov, parroting Kopylov’s words and catching Dutlov by
his coat. ‘That was the masters’ will, not the village’s.’</p>
<p>‘Dead right! That’s what it’s all about!’ said others.</p>
<p>‘Who are you calling a ranting drunk?’ Rezun protested.‘Did you pay
for my drinks? And that son of yours - gets picked up at the side of the
road - is he going to accuse me of drinking? Come on, brothers, we’ve
got to decide. If you want to let the Dutlovs off you’ll have to choose
from families with two men, or even one, and he’ll be laughing at
us.’</p>
<p>‘A Dutlov’s got to go! Nothing more to be said!’</p>
<p>‘It’s obvious! Families with three have to draw lots first!’ came the
various voices.</p>
<p>‘Depends what the mistress says. Yegor was saying she might send a
house serf.’</p>
<p>This comment put a dampener on the argument for a while, but it soon
flared up again, and once more it came round to personalities.</p>
<p>Then Ignat, the man Rezun had accused of being picked up at the
roadside, laid into Rezun, saying that he had stolen a saw from the
jobbing carpenters, and he had got drunk and beaten his wife to within
an inch of her life.</p>
<p>Rezun replied that he didn’t have to be drunk to beat his wife, he
did it when he was sober, and she still didn’t get enough of it, which
made them all laugh. But when it came to the saw he suddenly took
offence, stepped up closer to Ignat and asked him, ‘Who are you calling
a thief?’</p>
<p>‘You,’ said the sturdy Ignat brazenly, stepping closer still.</p>
<p>‘Who was the thief? It was you, wasn’t it?’ roared Rezun.</p>
<p>‘No, you!’ roared Ignat.</p>
<p>Moving on from the saw they brought up a stolen horse, a bag of oats,
an allotment that was common ground, and a dead body. And the pair of
them laid such dreadful things at each other’s door that if a hundredth
part of the accusations had been true both men would have been exiled to
Siberia - at the very least.</p>
<p>Old man Dutlov meanwhile had hit on a new form of defence. He didn’t
like all this shouting from his son. He stopped him by saying, ‘That’s
enough. It’s a sin, I tell you,’ and he went on to point out that
three-man families were not only those with three sons at home but also
those who had split up, and he pointed to Starostin.</p>
<p>Starostin gave a half-smile, cleared his throat and stroked his beard
with the air of a well-to-do peasant, replying that what counted was the
mistress’s will. His son must be a deserving case, because he had been
given exemption. Gerasim also confuted Dutlov’s argument by claiming
that the separated families ought not to have been allowed to split up -
it wouldn’t have happened under the old master. But it was no good
bolting the stable door when the horse had gone. And this was no time to
start sending men from one-man families.</p>
<p>‘Do you think they enjoyed being split up? Why should we ruin them
now?’ came voices from the separated families, and those who loved the
sound of their own voices came in on that side of the argument.</p>
<p>‘Buy your way out if you don’t like it. You can afford it!’ Rezun
said to Dutlov.</p>
<p>Dutlov wrapped his coat round himself in a despairing gesture and
stepped back behind the other peasants.</p>
<p>‘You’ve obviously been counting my money,’ he said venomously. ‘Let’s
see what Yegor Mikhaylovich says when he gets back from seeing the
mistress.’</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>And sure enough, Yegor Mikhaylovich came out of the house at that
very moment. One by one caps were raised and, as the steward came
forward, one by one all the heads revealed themselves, bald down the
middle and at the sides, grey or grizzled, red, black or mousy, and
gradually, little by little, the voices died down until eventually they
had died out completely. Yegor climbed on to the verandah with the air
of a man who wishes to speak. In his long coat, with his hands thrust
awkwardly into the front pockets, and his factory-made cap tipped
forward, standing there with his legs firmly planted and feet well
apart, fully in command of the heads that were raised towards him, most
of them old ones, most of them bearded and handsome, Yegor cut quite a
different figure from the one that had been standing in front of the
mistress. He was imperious.</p>
<p>‘This is what the mistress has decided, lads. She can’t see her way
to sending one of the house serfs. The man who goes will be the one you
decide on amongst yourselves. Three men are wanted - today. By rights it
should be two and a half, but the half will be taken into account next
time. Makes no difference - if it’s not today, it’ll have to be
tomorrow.’ ‘I knew it. That’s it then,’ came the voices.</p>
<p>‘As I see it,’ Yegor went on, ‘Khoryushkin and Vaska Mityukhin will
have to go. ‘Tis the Lord’s will.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir. ’Tis only right,’ came the voices.</p>
<p>‘The third one will have to be either one of the Dutlovs or somebody
from a two-man family. What do you think?’</p>
<p>‘One of the Dutlovs!’ shouted some of the voices. ‘There’s three in
their family!’</p>
<p>And now, steadily, little by little, the shouting started up again,
with recriminations about the stolen saw, the strip of kitchen garden
and sacks stolen from the mistress’s yard. Yegor Mikhaylovich had been
managing the estate for twenty years; he was an intelligent man with
much experience. He stood there listening for a quarter of an hour or
so, and then suddenly asked for silence and told the Dutlovs to decide
who had to go by drawing lots. Straws were cut, placed in a hat and
shaken up. Ilyushkin lost. No one spoke.</p>
<p>‘Is that mine? Show me,’ said Ilyushkin in a faltering voice.</p>
<p>Still no one spoke. Yegor Mikhaylovich told them all to bring the
recruitment money tomorrow - seven kopecks from each household - and,
with all the business completed, brought the meeting to a close. The
crowd dispersed, caps went on heads as they rounded the corner to the
murmur of voices and the shuffling of feet. The steward stood on the
verandah watching them go. When the younger Dutlovs had disappeared
round the corner he called to the old man, who had remained behind and
now followed him into the office.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry for you,’ said Yegor Mikhaylovich, sinking into the
armchair in front of the desk, ‘but it was your turn. Are you going to
buy him out, that nephew of yours, or not?’</p>
<p>The old man gave him a meaningful look, but said nothing.</p>
<p>‘Can’t do nothing about it,’ said Yegor Mikhaylovich by way of a
reply to that look.</p>
<p>‘I’d be glad to buy him out, but I can’t afford it, Yegor
Mikhaylovich. Lost two horses this summer. Paid for my nephew’s wedding.
It’s obvious, isn’t it? This is what you get for being honest. It’s all
right for him to talk.’ (He was thinking of Rezun.)</p>
<p>Yegor Mikhaylovich wiped his face with one hand and yawned. He had
clearly had enough. It was time for a cup of tea.</p>
<p>‘Hey, you tight-fisted old sinner,’ he said, ‘go and have a little
look under your floor. I bet you’ll turn up a good four hundred in old
notes. I’ll buy you a marvellous volunteer. Only the other day there was
this man offering himself.’</p>
<p>‘Where, in the government?’ asked Dutlov, meaning the big town.</p>
<p>‘Are you buying, then?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, I’d love to, I swear to God, but er -’</p>
<p>Yegor Mikhaylovich cut him short with a stern look.</p>
<p>‘Right. You listen to me, old man. You make sure Ilyushka don’t come
to no harm.5 And when I gives the word, today or tomorrow, you bring him
in. You’re bringing him, and you’re responsible. And if anything happens
to him - God forbid - I’ m sending your eldest son. Do you hear what I’m
saying?’</p>
<p>‘But aren’t there any two-man families who could send somebody, Yegor
Mikhaylovich? It’s not fair!’ he said, after saying nothing for a while.
‘My brother died soldiering, so now they’re taking my son. Why are they
getting at me again like this?’ As he spoke he was almost in tears and
on the point of dropping to his knees.</p>
<p>‘Go on. Off you go,’ said Yegor Mikhaylovich. ‘Can’t do nothing about
it. It’s the way things are. Keep an eye on Ilyushka. You’re
responsible.’</p>
<p>Dutlov set off home, thoughtfully tapping with his stick at the ruts
along the road.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Early next morning the little cart usually driven by the steward
himself stood by the steps leading up into the house serfs’ quarters (or
‘quartels’ as they called them); harnessed to it was the chunky bay
gelding known for some reason as Drum. Braving the cold wind and sleet,
Polikey’s eldest daughter, Anyutka, stood there in her bare feet some
little way ahead of the gelding, obviously frightened of him as she held
on to his reins with one hand and used the other to keep her head
covered by the yellow-green jacket which functioned in her family as
blanket, cloak, hood, carpet, overcoat and many other things as well. It
was all go in Polikey’s corner. It was still dark, though the
early-morning light of a rainy day was just beginning to force its way
in through the window with its paper patches. For the time being Akulina
was ignoring the cooking in the oven and the children - her youngest
were still in bed, freezing because their blanket had been taken away to
be used as clothing and they had been given their mother’s headscarf
instead. Akulina was getting her husband ready for the road. He had a
clean shirt on. She was particularly concerned with his boots, which
were, as the saying goes, ‘asking for porridge’. To begin with she had
stripped off her only pair of thick woollen stockings and lent them to
her husband, then she had taken the saddlecloth that had been left lying
about in the stables and had been brought home by Polikey a couple of
days before, and managed to fashion a pair of insoles in such a way that
they plugged the holes in his boots and kept his feet dry. Polikey
himself was sitting with his feet up on the bed, rebraiding his belt so
that it wouldn’t look like a piece of dirty string. The irritable little
girl with the lisp, wrapped in a sheepskin that trailed under her feet
even though it was thrown over her head, had been sent round to Nikita’s
to ask for the loan of his cap. The fuss got worse as the house serfs
kept calling in to ask Polikey to pick things up for them in town - a
packet of needles, some tea, olive oil, baccy, and some sugar for the
carpenter’s wife who at that early hour had managed to get the samovar
going and brought Polikey a mug of what she called tea, just to get
round him. Even though Nikita wouldn’t lend him his cap, which meant
that Polikey had to bring his own up to standard by shoving some
straggling bits of wadding back in and sewing the hole up with the help
of a vet’s needle, even though the boots with the saddlecloth insoles
wouldn’t fit at first, even though Anyutka was frozen stiff and almost
let go of Drum, and Masha put the sheepskin on and went to take over
from her, but then Masha had to take the sheepskin off and Akulina had
to go and hold Drum herself - it all ended well: Polikey dressed himself
in virtually the entire family wardrobe, leaving behind nothing but the
jacket and a pair of slippers (‘slippons’ to them), finished getting
ready, climbed into the little cart, snuggled into his coat, shook up
the haysack, snuggled down again, untangled the reins, snuggled down
even deeper into his coat, like a person of quality, and set off on his
journey.</p>
<p>His little boy Mishka ran out on to the steps and insisted on being
given a ride. The lisping Masha wanted a ‘lide’ too, because she was
‘thtill warm even without the theepthkin’. Polikey reined Drum in,
smiling his weak smile, while Akulina put the children on board, leaned
over to him and reminded him in a whisper that he had promised not to
drink anything on the journey. Polikey took the children as far as the
smithy, made them get down, wrapped himself up again, straightened his
cap again, and set off alone at a slow steady trot, with his cheeks
wobbling at every jolt and his feet bouncing on the matting. As for the
barefooted Masha and Mishka, they hurtled back home down the hill
yelling so loudly that a stray dog from the village took one look at
them and rushed off home barking, with its tail between its legs, which
made the racket coming from Polikey’s progeny ten times louder.</p>
<p>The weather was atrocious. A cutting wind lashed a mixture of snow,
rain and hail intermittently into Polikey’s face and bare hands, which
he thrust down under his coat sleeves along with the cold reins, and
into the leather cover of the horse collar, and on to Drum’s old head,
making him put his ears back and squint.</p>
<p>Then suddenly it began to ease up. The skies were soon clearing
sharply, bluish snow clouds began to show themselves, and the sun seemed
to be starting to peer through them, but only timidly and cheerlessly,
like Polikey’s own smile. Despite everything, though, Polikey was
thinking pleasant thoughts. He, the man they wanted to send into exile
or into the army, the man who was cursed and beaten by everybody who
wasn’t too lazy to do it, who was always shoved around worse and worse -
he was now on his way to fetch a summer money, a big summer money, and
the mistress trusted him, and here he was driving along in the steward’s
cart, with Drum pulling, the cart that the lady herself sometimes drove
in, bowling along like some rich landowner, with proper leather straps
and reins. And he sat up straighter, tucked some bits of wadding back
into his cap and snuggled deeper into his wrappings.</p>
<p>However, if Polikey thought he looked the picture of a rich
landowner, he was deluding himself. Everybody knows that traders worth a
good ten thousand drive around in sledges with proper leather harnesses,
but that’s neither here nor there. A man with a beard drives past
dressed in a long blue coat, or a black one, sitting alone on his box
and driving a sleek horse; a quick glance to establish whether the horse
is well fed, whether he is himself, how good the harness is, how good
the tyres are, how big his belt is, will tell you whether this man deals
in thousands or hundreds. Anyone who has been around a bit would take
one good look at Polikey, at his hands, his face, his stubble, his
waistline, at the straw scattered about the box all over the place, at
skinny old Drum and the worn tyres, and see immediately that this is no
trader, no cattle-dealer, no landowner worth thousands, hundreds or even
dozens of roubles - this is a common serf. But Polikey wasn’t thinking
along those lines; he was deluding himself, and enjoying it. Three times
five hundred roubles he would be bringing back tucked into his coat. If
he wanted to, he could decide not to go home, turn Drum towards Odessa
(which he called Odesta) and go wherever the fates took him. But he
wasn’t going to do that; he was going to deliver the money properly to
his mistress and say that even this kind of money was nothing to him.
When they came to an inn Drum started pulling on the left rein, turning
away and wanting to stop but, although Polikey was carrying money for
the various purchases, he gave Drum a taste of the whip and drove on. He
did the same thing at the next inn and just before noon he got down from
the cart, opened the gate leading to the merchant’s house where people
from the estate always stayed, led the horse and cart into the yard,
unharnessed the horse and gave him some hay, ate his lunch with the
merchant’s workmen, not omitting to mention that he was there on
important business, and then went off with the letter in his cap to see
the head gardener.</p>
<p>The gardener read through the letter but, knowing Polikey, he looked
dubious as he interrogated him closely to find out whether he really had
been sent to collect the money. Polikey made a show of being offended,
but he couldn’t manage it; all he did was smile his own peculiar smile.
The gardener read the letter again and handed over the money. On
receiving the money, Polikey put it safely inside his coat and went back
to the inn. No tavern or beer shop, nothing could tempt him. He was
enjoying a warm feeling of excitement that ran through his whole being,
and he stopped several times outside shops with alluring goods on
display - boots, coats, caps, cotton material, food. But after a short
stop he would walk on with his warm feeling: I could buy all that lot,
but I’m not going to. He went on to the market to buy what people had
asked for, and once he had got everything he started haggling over a
tanned sheepskin coat priced at twenty-five roubles. The shopkeeper took
one look at Polikey and for some reason seemed to doubt that he had the
wherewithal to pay for it, but Polikey pointed to his inside pocket and
told him he could buy the whole shop if he wanted to. He insisted on
trying it on, fingered it, patted it, blew into the fur until its smell
was all over him, and then took it off with a sigh. ‘The price isn’t
right. If you could let it go for fifteen roubles …’ he said. The dealer
angrily threw the coat across the table and Polikey walked out feeling
good, and went back to the inn. After supper he watered Drum and gave
him his oats, then climbed up on to the stove and took out the envelope,
examining it closely before asking a porter who knew how to read and
write if he would read out the address and the other words: ‘Enclosed:
one thousand, six hundred and seventeen roubles in notes.’ The envelope
was made from ordinary paper and sealed with brown wax stamped with an
anchor, with one big seal in the middle and four more at the corners and
a few drops of sealing wax down one side. Polikey inspected all of this,
committed it to memory and even felt the sharp edges of the banknotes.
It gave him a kind of childish delight simply to know that he was the
holder of this kind of money. He pushed the envelope into the hole in
his cap, put the cap under his head and lay down on it, but during the
night he woke up several times and groped for the envelope. And every
time he found the envelope just where it should be he felt a thrill of
pleasure at the idea that here he was, the much maligned Polikey, a man
of bad reputation, carrying this kind of money and he could be relied
upon to deliver it - he would deliver it more reliably than the steward
himself.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>It was about midnight when the innkeeper’s men and Polikey were all
woken up by a banging at the gate and peasants shouting. It was the
party of conscripts from Pokrovskoye. There were about ten of them:
Khoryushkin, Mityukhin and Ilya the nephew of Dutlov, two substitutes,
the village elder, old man Dutlov and the drivers. A night light was
burning and the cook was asleep on a bench under the icons. She jumped
up and set about lighting a candle. Polikey woke up, too, leaned out
over the stove and took a good look at the peasants as they entered.
They came in crossing themselves and sat down on the benches. All of
them were so perfectly calm that you couldn’t tell who were the
conscripts and who was delivering them. They were saying hello,
chattering amongst themselves and asking for food. True, some of them
were quiet and gloomy, but then there were others who were unusually
merry, obviously having had a few drinks, including Ilya, who had never
been a drinker before.</p>
<p>‘Right, lads. Sleep or supper, what do you want?’ asked the
elder.</p>
<p>‘Supper,’ said Ilya, throwing his heavy coat open wide and settling
on a bench. ‘Get some vodka.’</p>
<p>‘I’ll give you vodka,’ snapped the elder, turning to the others.
‘Right. Have a bite of bread, lads. No need to wake everybody up.’</p>
<p>‘Gimme some vodka,’ Ilya repeated, looking at no one in particular.
His voice made it clear that he would take some stopping.</p>
<p>The peasants did what the elder had told them; got some bread from
their cart, asked for a drink of rye beer and went to lie down on the
floor or on the stove.</p>
<p>Now and again Ilya could be heard repeating, ‘Gimme some vodka. I’m
telling you I want some vodka.’ Suddenly he caught sight of Polikey.</p>
<p>‘Polikushka. Hey, Polikushka! You’re here, my good friend. Know
something? I’m off into the army. Said goodbye to my mum and my missus -
for ever. She didn’t half howl! Into the army. Cooked my goose, they
did. Give us some vodka.’</p>
<p>‘Can’t afford it,’ said Polikey. ‘Anyway, you might get rejected,’ he
added by way of consolation.</p>
<p>‘No chance, old pal. I’m as clean as a birch tree. Never had no
illness. Why would I get rejected? The Tsar won’t find no fitter
soldiers than me.’</p>
<p>Polikey launched into a story about a peasant lad who had slipped the
doctor a note and got off.</p>
<p>Ilya moved over to the stove and spoke more freely.</p>
<p>‘No, Polikushka. That’s it. And I don’t want to stay now. It was my
uncle what cooked my goose. Do you think he couldn’t have bought me out?
Thinks too much of his own lad, he does - and his money. So I gets sent…
Don’t want to stay now.’ (He spoke softly, confidingly, deeply moved by
his own sadness.) ‘I am sorry for my dear old mum, though. She was right
upset! And the missus, too. They’ve done for her, and no reason for it.
She’s had it now. Soldier’s wife - say no more. Better off not getting
married. Why did they want me to get married? They’re coming here
tomorrow.’</p>
<p>‘But why did they bring you here as early as this?’ asked Polikey.
‘First we heard nothing, then all of a sudden …’</p>
<p>‘Well, you know how it is, they thought I might do meself an injury,’
said Ilya with a grin. ‘No chance. I’m not doing nothing. When I’m a
soldier I won’t come to no grief. But I am sorry for my mum. Why did
they want me to get married?’ he said, softly and sadly.</p>
<p>The door opened and banged to. In came old man Dutlov, shaking the
wet off his cap, as always wearing bark-fibre shoes that made him look
as if he had his feet stuck into great big boats.</p>
<p>‘Afanasy,’ he said, crossing himself as he turned towards the porter,
‘can I have a light? I need to get some oats.’</p>
<p>Dutlov had not looked across at Ilya; he slowly began to light a bit
of candle. His coat was neatly belted, with his mittens and whip tucked
into his waistband. With his working man’s face wearing its usual nice
and easy expression, preoccupied with the job in hand, he looked for all
the world as if he had just arrived in charge of a wagon train.</p>
<p>When Ilya caught sight of his uncle he stopped speaking, gloomily
looked down again vaguely in the direction of the bench, and then said
to the village elder, ‘Yermila. Get me some vodka. I want a nice
drink.’</p>
<p>His gloomy voice had a sharp edge to it.</p>
<p>‘What do you want a drink for at this time of night?’ said the elder,
slurping from his cup. ‘Look, everybody’s had a bite and gone to sleep.
Why are you making all this row?’</p>
<p>The word ‘row’ seemed to put him in mind of really making a row.</p>
<p>‘Elder, I’m going to get things going if you don’t get me some
vodka.’</p>
<p>‘Can’t you talk him round?’ said the elder, turning to Dutlov, who
had lit his lantern by now but had stayed on clearly wanting to listen
and see what happened. He angled a sympathetic look at his nephew, as if
surprised to see him behaving like a child.</p>
<p>Looking down, Ilya said once again, ‘Gimme a drink. I’m going to get
things going.’</p>
<p>‘Cut it out, Ilya!’ said the elder sharply. ‘Come on. Cut it out.
You’ll live to regret it.’</p>
<p>But these words were scarcely out of his mouth when Ilya jumped up,
smashed the window with his fist and roared at them.</p>
<p>‘If you won’t listen to me, that’s what you’ll get!’ And he rushed
over to the other window to smash that one, too.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, Polikey did a double roll and disappeared into the
farthest recess of the stove-top, scattering all the cockroaches. The
elder dropped his spoon and rushed over to Ilya. Dutlov slowly put down
the lantern, undid his girdle, shook his head and walked over,
tut-tutting, towards Ilya, who was by now having a go at the elder and
the porter blocking his way to the window. They had grabbed him by the
arms and seemed to have a good hold on him, but the moment he saw his
uncle holding the girdle his strength became that of a dozen men; he
tore himself free and stepped forward to challenge Dutlov, with his eyes
rolling and his fists clenched.</p>
<p>‘I’ll kill you. Don’t you come near me, you brute. You’ve done for
me, you and your sons, done for me. Why did you get me married? Don’t
you come near me. I’ll kill you!’</p>
<p>Ilya was a hideous sight. He was red in the face, his eyes darted
about all over the place, and his young man’s body shivered feverishly
all over. He seemed determined to kill all three of the attacking
peasants, and capable of doing it.</p>
<p>‘You’re drinking your brother’s blood, you bloodsucker!’</p>
<p>Something flashed across Dutlov’s ever-impassive face. He stepped
forward.</p>
<p>‘If you won’t do it the easy way …’ he said. Then suddenly - Heaven
knows where he got the strength from - in one swift movement he grabbed
his nephew, wrestled him to the floor and, with the help of the elder,
set about tying his hands. The struggle lasted five minutes or so. Then
Dutlov got to his feet, assisted by the peasants, disentangled Ilya’s
grasping hands from his coat, steadied himself, made Ilya get up with
his hands tied behind his back, and sat him down on the bench in one
corner.</p>
<p>‘Told you you’d regret it,’ he said, still breathless from fighting
as he straightened the narrow girdle round his shirt. ‘Don’t be a
sinner. We all have to die. Put a jacket under his head for him,’ he
added, turning to the porter, ‘or the blood will go to his head.’ Then
he picked up the lantern, pulled the cord tight round his waist and set
off once again to see to the horses.</p>
<p>Ilya, with his pale face, his hair all over the place and his shirt
rumpled, was staring round the room as if he was trying to remember
where he was. The porter was picking up shards of glass and stuffing a
coat into the window space to keep the draught out. The village elder
sat down to his bowl.</p>
<p>‘Oh dear, Ilya! I’m sorry for you, honest I am. We can’t do nothin’
about it. Look at Khoryushkin. He’s married, too. There’s no getting out
of it.’</p>
<p>‘My uncle’s a swine. He’s the one that’s ruined me,’ he said again,
his voice sharp and bitter. ‘Looks after his own, he does. My mum said
the steward told him to buy me out, but he wouldn’t do it. Said he
couldn’t afford to. And we’ve brought plenty into that house, we have,
me and my brother. Swine!’</p>
<p>Dutlov walked in, said a prayer in front of the icons, took his coat
off and sat down next to the elder. A girl brought him some more kvass6
and a spoon. Ilya had stopped talking; he closed his eyes and lay down
with his head on the coat. The elder pointed to him without saying
anything and shook his head. Dutlov waved a hand.</p>
<p>‘Pitiful, isn’t it? My own brother’s son. It’s no good me being sorry
for him, they still has me down as a villain as far as he’s concerned.
Don’t know whether his old woman put the idea into his head - she’s
still only young, but she’s a sharp one, she is - that we’ve got the
kind of money that could buy him out. Now he blames me. Still you has to
be sorry for him …’</p>
<p>‘Yes. He’s a good lad,’ said the elder.</p>
<p>‘Well, I can’t do nothing with him. I’ll send Ignat over tomorrow,
and his missus wanted to come too.’</p>
<p>‘Well, send her over. That’s all right by me,’ said the elder,
getting to his feet and climbing up on to the stove. ‘What’s money got
to do with it? Money’s just dust and ashes.’</p>
<p>‘If the money was there, nobody wouldn’t grudge it,’ said one of the
innkeeper’s men, looking up.</p>
<p>‘Oh, it’s all money, money! A lot of evil comes from it,’ said Dutlov
in response. ‘Nothin’ in the world causes more evil than money. ’Tis
said in the Scriptures.’</p>
<p>“Tis all said in the Scriptures,’ echoed the porter. ‘A chap was
telling me about this merchant. Made a stack of money, and he didn’t
want to leave none of it behind. Loved his money so much he took it with
him into his grave. When he was dying he told them to put a cushion in
his coffin with him. Nobody guessed what he was up to - they just did
it. Then his sons starts looking for his money. Nothin’. One of his sons
guessed his money must be in the cushion. It went right up to the Tsar,
but they got permission to dig him up. Guess what. They opened it up -
nothing in the cushion. Just the coffin full of creepycrawlies. So they
buried him again. See? That’s what money does for you.’</p>
<p>“Tis a known fact. A lot of evil,’ said Dutlov, getting to his feet
and starting to pray.</p>
<p>When he had finished he glanced at his nephew. He was asleep. Dutlov
walked over, untied the girdle and lay down. Another peasant went out to
sleep with the horses.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>As soon as it had all gone quiet Polikey crept down sheepishly and
started to get his things together. For some reason he felt awful
spending the night in there with the conscripts. By now the cockerels
were crowing to each other and their calls were coming faster. Drum had
finished his oats and was straining towards the drinking trough. Polikey
put his harness on and led him out past the peasants’ carts. His cap and
its contents were intact, and the wheels of his cart were soon
clattering down the frozen road to Pokrovskoye. Only when he had left
the town behind did Polikey begin to feel better. And even then, for
some reason he kept thinking that any moment now he might hear them
chasing after him, and they would stop him, tie his hands behind his
back, put him in Ilya’s place and take him next morning to the
recruiting station. Whether from the cold or from fear he couldn’t have
said, but a shiver kept running down his back, and Drum felt the
continual play of his whip. The first person he came across was a priest
in a tall fur cap walking along with a lame workman. This made him feel
even more alarmed. But once out of the town he felt this fear gradually
fading. Drum slowed to a walking pace, and the road ahead became
clearer. Polikey took off his cap and felt the money. He wondered
whether he ought to put it inside, under his coat. No, that would mean
undoing his belt. At the bottom of the next hill he would get down and
sort himself out. But his cap was well sewn up at the top and nothing
could fall down through the lining; no, he wouldn’t take his cap off
until he got home. And at the bottom of the slope Drum took it upon
himself to dash on up the next hill. Polikey, who was as keen as Drum to
get home, did nothing to stop him. Everything was fine now, or so he
thought, and he allowed himself to dream about how grateful the mistress
would be, and how she would give him five roubles, and all the family
would be delighted. He took his cap off, felt the envelope and crammed
the cap down harder on his head, smiling to himself. The velveteen
lining was rotten and, as a direct result of Akulina carefully sewing up
one torn place, it came loose at the other end, and in the darkness
Polikey’s attempt to shove the money deeper into the padding tore it
open, leaving one corner of the envelope sticking out of the
material.</p>
<p>It was beginning to get light and Polikey, not having slept all
night, felt drowsy. As he pulled his cap further down he pushed the
envelope further out and, in his sleepy state, he let his head bump
against the side of the cart. He woke up near to the house. His first
thought was to feel for the cap - there it was sitting nicely on his
head. Confident that the envelope was still there, he didn’t take it
off. He gave Drum a pat, sorted out the hay, resumed his attitude of a
prosperous peasant and swaggered off towards the house.</p>
<p>There was the kitchen, there was the building the house serfs called
their ‘quartels’. There was the carpenter’s wife carrying some cloth,
there was the office, there was the mistress’s house, where quite soon
Polikey would show himself to be an upright and reliable man - anybody
can have bad things said about them, as he would say - and the mistress
would say, ‘Well now, I’m most grateful to you, Polikey. Please take
these three…’ or maybe five, even ten roubles, and she would tell them
to bring him some tea, perhaps even a drop of vodka. Wouldn’t go amiss
in this cold weather. With ten roubles they could enjoy the holiday, buy
some boots and give Nikita his four and a half roubles back. Nothing to
be done about that - he’d been going on about them. When he was about a
hundred paces from the house Polikey wrapped his coat around himself
again, straightened his belt and his collar, took off his cap and tidied
his hair and felt into the lining with no sense of hurry. His hand
scrabbled about in the cap, faster and faster; he thrust his other hand
into the same place. The colour slowly drained from his face as one hand
went right through… Polikey dropped to his knees, stopped the horse and
took a good look round the cart, searching through the hay and the
things he had bought, feeling under his coat and inside his baggy
trousers. The money was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>‘My godfathers! What does this mean? What’s going to happen now?’ He
let out a roar and clutched at his hair.</p>
<p>But then, realizing that he could be seen, he turned Drum round, put
the cap back on his head and drove the surprised and unhappy animal back
down the road.</p>
<p>‘I can’t stand going out with Polikey,’ Drum must have been thinking.
‘For once in my life he’s not going to be late feeding and watering me,
but it’s all a cruel trick. Ran my heart out running back home, I did.
Dead tired, and as soon as I get within smelling distance of our hay
he’s driving me out again.’</p>
<p>‘Damn you, you old bag of bones!’ Polikey yelled at him through his
tears, standing up in the cart, jerking the reins back into Drum’s mouth
and cracking him with the whip.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>All that day Polikey was not to be seen in Pokrovskoye. After dinner
the mistress asked after him several times, and Aksyuta flew off to see
Akulina. But Akulina said he wasn’t back yet. He’d obviously been held
up by the dealer, or maybe there was something wrong with the horse.
‘He’s not gone lame, has he?’ she asked. ‘Last time it took Maxim a day
and a night to get back. Had to walk all the way, he did!’ So Aksyuta
sped off home, swinging her pendulums, and Akulina was left thinking up
excuses for her husband being late and trying - without success - to
keep calm. With a heavy heart she went on with the preparations for
tomorrow’s holiday, but nothing went right. She was particularly worried
by what the carpenter’s wife claimed to have seen. ‘A man who looked
like Polikey drove up to the avinoo7 and then turned round and went back
again.’ The children were also waiting anxiously and impatiently for
their daddy to come home, though for different reasons. Anyutka and
Masha had been left without the sheepskin and the coat that normally
gave them the chance to go outside at least one after the other, and had
been reduced to going out in their indoor clothing and running around in
circles at top speed near to the house, which was no minor inconvenience
to anybody going in and out of their ‘quartels’. On one occasion Masha
had careered into the legs of the carpenter’s wife who was carrying some
water and, even though she burst out crying in anticipation as she
crashed into the woman’s knees, she got a smack round the head that made
her cry all the louder. And when she managed not to crash into anybody
she would fly straight in through the door and climb on to a tub to get
up on to the stove. Akulina and the mistress were the only people who
were really bothered about Polikey; the children were only worried about
what he was wearing. As for Yegor Mikhaylovich, when he was reporting to
the mistress and she asked him whether Polikey was back yet, and where
he could be, he just smiled and replied, ‘I wouldn’t know’, obviously
pleased to see that his suspicions were being justified. ‘Should have
been back by lunchtime,’ he added meaningfully.</p>
<p>All that day there was neither sight nor sound of Polikey. Only
afterwards did it become known that some peasants who lived nearby had
seen him without his cap on running down the road and saying to
everybody, ‘You haven’t found an envelope, have you?’ Another man had
seen him asleep by the roadside next to a tied-up horse and cart. ‘I
just assumed he was drunk,’ said this fellow, ‘and his horse hadn’t been
fed nor watered for a couple of days judging by the hollows in his
sides.’ Akulina spent a sleepless night listening out for him, but
Polikey didn’t come back. If she had been on her own, or had kept a cook
and a maid, she would have been even more miserable, but as soon as the
cocks started crowing and the carpenter’s wife was up and about she had
to get up and see to the stove. It was the holiday morning - before
sunrise she had to get the bread out, make the kvass, bake some cakes,
milk the cow, iron the frocks and shirts, get the children washed, fetch
some water and make sure her neighbour didn’t take up most of the oven.
Akulina set to work, still listening. Daylight came, the bells were
ringing, the children were up; still no Polikey. The day before, winter
weather had covered the fields, roads and rooftops with patchy snow;
this morning the weather was beautiful, fair, sunny and frosty, real
holiday weather. You could see and hear things miles away. But Akulina
was at the oven with her head thrust in through the door, and she was so
busy with the cakes that she didn’t hear Polikey arrive; it was only
when the children called out that she knew her husband was back.</p>
<p>Anyutka, the eldest, had greased her hair and got dressed all by
herself. She was wearing a new pink cotton dress, rather crumpled, a
present from the mistress; it stuck out like a piece of stiff bark and
was the envy of all the neighbours. Her hair was all shiny — she had
smeared it with half a candle. Her shoes were not exactly new, but they
were nice and slim. Masha was wearing the old jacket and was still
covered in mud; Anyutka wouldn’t let her come anywhere near for fear of
getting dirty. Masha was outside when her father drove up carrying a
sack. ‘Daddy’s here!’ she yelled, hurtling in through the door right
past Anyutka and dirtying her dress. Anyutka, no longer worried about
getting dirty, gave Masha a good slap. Akulina couldn’t tear herself
away from her work; all she could do was scream at them, ‘Stop it, you
two. I’ll smack the pair of you!’ and look round at the door. Polikey,
still carrying his sack, came in through the doorway and walked over to
his corner. Akulina thought he looked pale. His face had something about
it — he seemed to have been crying or laughing, but she hadn’t time to
work out which.</p>
<p>‘Hello, Polikey. Everything all right?’ she asked from down by the
stove.</p>
<p>Polikey muttered something she couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>‘You what?’ she called out. ‘Have you been to see the mistress?’</p>
<p>Polikey was sitting in his corner staring about him with a wild look,
and smiling his usual smile, which made him a picture of guilt and
abject misery. For a long time he didn’t respond.</p>
<p>‘Well? Why don’t you answer?’ came Akulina’s voice.</p>
<p>‘Yes, Akulina. I’ve given the mistress her money. She couldn’t thank
me enough,’ he said suddenly, but he looked even more anxious as he
looked around, still smiling. His staring eyes, restless and feverish,
were focused on two objects in particular: the cords attached to the
cradle, and the baby. He walked over to the cradle and soon his slender
fingers were busy untying the knotted rope. Then his eyes settled on the
baby, but at that moment Akulina came into the corner carrying cakes on
a tray. Polikey quickly hid the rope under his shirt and sat down on the
bed.</p>
<p>‘Polikey, what’s wrong with you? You don’t look right,’ said
Akulina.</p>
<p>‘Haven’t had any sleep,’ he replied.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a flash of something outside the window and, swift
as an arrow, in flew the girl ‘from up at the big house’, Aksyuta.</p>
<p>‘The mistress orders Polikey to come to her right now,’ she said.
‘Right now, orders Avdotya Nikolayevna … right now.’</p>
<p>Polikey looked from Akulina to the girl.</p>
<p>‘I’m on my way. What else does she want?’ he said, so
straightforwardly that Akulina was reassured. ‘Maybe she wants to give
me a reward. Tell her I’m on my way.’</p>
<p>He got to his feet and went out. Akulina picked up the wash-tub, put
it on the bench and filled it with water from buckets by the door and
also from the hot cauldron on the stove. Rolling up her sleeves, she
tested the water.</p>
<p>‘Here, Masha. Time for your wash.’</p>
<p>The lisping little girl went into a tantrum, and howled.</p>
<p>‘Come here, you little minx. I want you to have a clean shirt on.
Don’t mess me about. I’ve still got your brother to bath.’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Polikey was not following the girl up to the big house; he
went somewhere else. In the passageway by the wall there was a ladder
leading up into the loft. Polikey walked out into the passageway,
glanced round to check that no one was there, bent down and nipped
nimbly up the ladder, almost running.</p>
<p>‘Still no Polikey. What does it mean?’ said the mistress impatiently
to Dunyasha, who was combing her hair. ‘Where is he? Why doesn’t he
come?’</p>
<p>Aksyuta flew down to the serfs’ quarters again, ran in through the
passageway again and asked for Polikey to come and see the mistress.</p>
<p>‘But he went ages ago,’ answered Akulina, who had finished washing
Masha, had sat her little baby in the tub and was ignoring his cries as
she wetted his thin streaks of hair. The little boy was crying, scowling
and trying to catch hold of something with his helpless little hands.
Akulina was holding him with one big hand behind his soft, plump and
dimpled little back while she washed him with the other.</p>
<p>‘Check that he’s not gone to sleep somewhere,’ she said, looking
round anxiously.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the carpenter’s wife, with her hair all over the place, her
bosom exposed and her skirts hitched up, was on her way up into the loft
to get her dress that had been drying. Suddenly a cry of horror rang
down from the loft, and the carpenter’s wife came flying down the ladder
like a mad woman, with her eyes shut, scrabbling on all fours, more
sliding than running.</p>
<p>‘It’s Polikey!’ she screamed.</p>
<p>Akulina let go of the baby.</p>
<p>‘He’s hung himself!’ roared the carpenter’s wife.</p>
<p>Akulina, unaware that the baby had rolled over backwards like a ball,
cocked his little legs up and gone headfirst underwater, rushed out into
the passageway.</p>
<p>‘On a rafter … hanging there,’ said the carpenter’s wife, but she
stopped when she saw Akulina.</p>
<p>Akulina raced up the ladder and got to the top before anyone could
hold her back, only to give a terrible cry and fall back down like a
corpse, which would have killed her if the people who had rushed over
from every corner had not been there and managed to support her.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Several minutes passed before anything could be made out in the
general confusion. People came rushing in endlessly, everybody shouting,
everybody talking, children and old women crying, with Akulina lying
there in a dead faint. Eventually the men, the carpenter and the steward
who had run in, went up the ladder, while the carpenter’s wife told her
story for the twentieth time. ‘I had gone to get my dress without a
thought in my head, and looked round, like this … and I saw this man
stood there … I looked … there was his cap, inside out. I looked again …
his feet was swinging. I went cold all over! Not very nice, is it? A man
hangs himself and I has to see it! How I come clatterin’ down I’ll never
know. ’Tis a miracle how God saved me. Not very nice, is it? Real steep
it was, and that high up! Could have killed meself.’</p>
<p>Those who climbed up told the same story. Polikey, in his shirt and
trousers, was hanging from the beam on the rope he had taken from the
cradle. There was his cap, turned inside out, and next to it his coat
and sheepskin, neatly folded. His feet touched the floor, but all signs
of life had gone. Akulina came round, and made as if to climb the
ladder, but they wouldn’t let her.</p>
<p>‘Mummy, the baby’s tsoked!’ The sudden cry came from the lisping
child back in their corner. Akulina tore herself free again and rushed
across to the corner. The baby lay quite still on his back in the tub;
his little legs were not moving. Akulina snatched him up, but the child
wasn’t breathing or moving. Akulina threw him down on the bed, put her
hands on her hips and burst out laughing; the ghastly sound was so sharp
and loud that little Masha also gave a kind of half-laugh and then
covered her ears and rushed out into the passageway crying. The people
were crowding into the corner, weeping and wailing. The child was
carried out and massaged, but it was no good. Akulina was rocking about
on the bed, still laughing and laughing; the laughter horrified everyone
who heard it. Now for the first time, the sight of this motley crowd of
married people, old folk and children who had come crowding into the
passageway made it clear how many people, and what different kinds,
lived in the serfs’ ‘quartels’. Everybody was on the move, everybody was
talking, many were weeping, nobody was doing anything. The carpenter’s
wife kept finding new people who hadn’t yet heard her story, and off she
went again about the effect on her sensitive feelings of seeing such a
shocking thing, and how God had saved her from falling down the ladder.
An aged footman wearing a woman’s jacket was telling them about a woman
who had drowned herself when the old master was still alive. The steward
sent word to the priest and the constable, and put someone on guard. The
girl from the big house, Aksyuta, stared up wide-eyed into the loft
trap, and although there was nothing to be seen she couldn’t tear
herself away to go back to the mistress. Agafya, who had been
lady‘s-maid to the old mistress, wept as she asked for some tea to
settle her nerves. Grannie Annie was laying out the little body on the
table, with her practised, plump hands covered in olive oil. Other women
stood by Akulina and looked at her in silence. The children shrank back
into their corners, peeped out at the mother and cried, then they would
stop, peep out again and shrink back even further. Boys and men crowded
round the steps, looking in at the doors and windows with frightened
faces, seeing nothing, understanding nothing, wondering amongst
themselves what was wrong. One said the carpenter had chopped his wife’s
leg off with an axe. Another said the laundrywoman had had triplets. A
third said the cook’s cat had gone berserk and bitten several people.
But gradually the truth got round, and eventually it reached the ears of
the mistress. And seemingly no one prepared her for it; Yegor, clumsy
oaf that he was, came straight out with it, and upset the mistress so
much that she didn’t recover for quite some time. By now the crowd was
beginning to settle. The carpenter’s wife lit the samovar and made some
tea, which meant that the outsiders, who hadn’t been invited, thought it
wasn’t right for them to stay on. The boys had started fighting by the
steps. Now, everyone knew what had happened. They were beginning to
disperse, making the sign of the cross, when the word went up, ‘The
mistress! The mistress!’, at which they all crowded back and squeezed
together to let her through, though they all wanted to see what she was
going to do. The mistress, looking pale and tear-stained, went down the
passage, crossed the threshold and walked over to Akulina’s corner.
Dozens of heads came together to look in at the door. One pregnant woman
got squashed so much that she cried out, and without further ado she
took her chance to get a place at the front. Who wouldn’t want to get a
look at the mistress in Akulina’s corner? For the house serfs it was
like fireworks at the end of a show. It meant a lot when they lit the
fireworks; it meant a lot when the mistress, dressed in her silks and
lace, walked into Akulina’s corner. The mistress went over to Akulina
and took her hand, but Akulina snatched it away. The old house serfs
shook their heads in disapproval.</p>
<p>‘Akulina!’ said the mistress. ‘You have your children. You must look
after yourself.’</p>
<p>Akulina gave a laugh, and got to her feet.</p>
<p>‘My children are all silver, all silver … I don’t deal in notes,’ she
muttered, gabbling. ‘I told my Polikey, “Don’t you take no notes,” and
they’ve smeared tar all over him, all that tar. Tar and soap, madam! You
got bad skin, that’ll cure it.’ And she laughed again, louder.</p>
<p>The mistress turned round and sent for the doctor’s boy and some
mustard.</p>
<p>‘Get me some cold water.’ And she looked round for some herself. But
when she saw the dead child and Grannie Annie standing there, the
mistress turned away and everyone saw her bury her face in a
handkerchief and burst into tears. Grannie Annie herself — it’s a pity
the mistress didn’t see this, she would have appreciated it, and it was
done for her — covered the baby with a linen cloth, put his little arm
straight with a movement of her plump, nimble hand, then shook her head,
pursed her lips and winced in such a way, with such a deep sigh, that
everyone could see how good-hearted she was. But the mistress did not
see it; she couldn’t see anything. She gave a sob, went into hysterics
and was taken away, supported under the arms, first out to the passage,
and then back home. ‘Did what she could,’ thought many of the people as
they went their separate ways. Akulina was still laughing and gabbling
nonsense. She was taken into another room, where she was bled and
covered with mustard poultices, with ice on her head, but she couldn’t
take anything in and instead of weeping she went on laughing, talking
and behaving so oddly that the kind people who were looking after her
lost control and laughed along with her.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In Pokrovskoye the holiday was not a happy occasion. It may have been
a fine day, but people didn’t go out to enjoy themselves, the girls
didn’t come together to sing their songs, the factory lads who had
walked out from the town didn’t play their concertinas or balalaikas,
and played no games with the girls. They all sat around in corners and,
if they spoke at all, it was in soft tones as if there was a bogeyman
about who might overhear them. It wasn’t too bad during the day, but in
the evening, when darkness came down and the dogs began to howl, and as
ill luck would have it the wind got up and howled down the chimneys, the
people who lived there were so scared that anyone who had a candle lit
it in front of an icon, anyone left alone in a corner went over and
asked if he could spend the night with his neighbours, where there was a
bit more company, and anyone who had to go to one of the out-houses
didn’t go, and didn’t worry about leaving the cattle without fodder for
a night. And all the holy water that everyone kept in little bottles was
used up in the course of that night. It was even said that many people
heard heavy footsteps going up and down in the loft that night, and the
blacksmith saw a serpent fly up there. There was no one in Polikey’s
corner; the children and the demented woman had been taken off
elsewhere. Only the little dead body lay there along with two old
grandmothers and a pilgrim woman who took it upon herself to read
through the Psalms not just for the baby but to mark the whole calamity
in general. It was what the mistress had wanted. Even the pilgrim woman
and the old grannies heard something — a creaking rafter and somebody
groaning immediately after the reading of a passage from the Psalter.
And when the words ‘Let God arise’ were read, everything went quiet
again. The carpenter’s wife invited a friend over and during the night
the pair of them went through a week’s supply of tea. They too heard the
rafters creaking up top, and the sound of something like sacks falling
down. The peasants stationed as guards gave some courage to the house
serfs, who would have died of fear that night without them. The menfolk
spent the time in the passageway lying on some hay, and later on they
would claim to have heard wonderful things up in the loft, though during
the night itself they had a nice cosy chat about the ‘cunscription’,
chewing bread, scratching themselves and filling the passage with that
special men’s smell — it was so bad that the carpenter’s wife, as she
walked past them, spat on the floor and called them ‘peasant louts’. Be
that as it may, the dead man was still dangling up in the loft, and it
was as if the evil one himself had overshadowed their ‘quartels’ that
night with his vast wing, showing them his power and coming closer to
these people than ever before. Or so they felt, at the very least. I
don’t know whether they were right or not. I’m inclined to think they
weren’t right at all. I think that if one of them had been bold enough
that terrible night to take a candle or a lantern, making the sign of
the cross for himself, or not crossing himself, and go up into the loft,
looking ahead and slowly dispelling the horror of the night with his
candle and lighting up the rafters, the sand, the flue pipe covered with
cobwebs and the bits of washing forgotten by the carpenter’s wife, and
gone right up to Polikey, and if he had controlled his fear enough to
lift the lantern up to his face, he would have seen the same skinny body
with its feet touching the floor (the rope had stretched), leaning
lifelessly to one side, with its shirt collar undone and no cross
showing, and its head slumped down over its chest, the kindly unseeing
eyes, the sheepish, guilty smile, and over it all a harsh sense of calm
and quiet. It is certainly true that the carpenter’s wife, huddled up on
the corner of her bed, with her hair all over the place and fear in her
eyes, telling people she can hear sacks falling down is much more
gruesome and horrible than Polikey, even though his cross has come off
and lies there on the rafter.</p>
<p>Up there — which means in the mistress’s house — the same horror
reigned as in the house serfs’ ‘quartels’. The mistress’s room smelt of
eau-de-Cologne and medicine. Dunyasha was melting yellow wax and getting
ready to drop it in water. Exactly what she was dropping it in for I
can’t say; all I know is, they always dropped wax in water when the
mistress was ill. And at present she was so upset she had made herself
ill. Dunyasha’s aunt had come over for the night to keep her spirits up,
so there were four of them including the little girl, and they sat there
in the maids’ room talking in low voices.</p>
<p>‘Who’s going for the oil?’ asked Dunyasha.</p>
<p>‘I’m not going, Dunyasha. Nothing would make me,’ said the second
maid decisively.</p>
<p>‘Nonsense. You can take Aksyuta with you.’</p>
<p>‘I’ll go on my own. I’m not scared,’ said Aksyuta, but she
immediately faltered.</p>
<p>‘Off you go, then. You’re a clever girl. Get some from Grannie Annie
— a glassful. Bring it back here, and don’t spill it,’ Dunyasha said to
her.</p>
<p>Aksyuta lifted up her skirt with one hand and, although this meant
that she couldn’t swing both arms, she swung one of them twice as hard
across her line of flight as she sped away. She was frightened, and she
felt that if she saw or heard anything at all, even her own mother’s
living figure, she would drop dead with fright. She flew down the
familiar pathway with her eyes screwed up tight.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>‘Is the mistress asleep or awake?’ came a question in the deep voice
of a peasant man suddenly close to Aksyuta. She opened her eyes, which
had been screwed up tight, and saw the figure of a man which appeared to
her taller than the ‘quartel’. She gave a scream and hurtled back so
fast her skirt couldn’t keep up with her. In a single bound she was up
on the verandah, and another one took her into the maids’ room, where
she flung herself on to her bed wailing like a wild thing. Dunyasha, her
auntie and the second maid nearly died of fright, but before they could
blink an eye slow, heavy, hesitant footsteps could be heard coming along
the passage to the door. Dunyasha leapt towards her mistress, dropping
her melted wax, the second maid hid away under some skirts hanging on
the wall, while the auntie — more decisive — made as if to hold the door
shut, but it opened and in came a peasant. It was Dutlov, wearing his
boat-like shoes. Ignoring the terror-stricken girls, he directed his
eyes to search for an icon, but, not noticing the little image hanging
in the left-hand corner, he crossed himself in front of a cupboard where
teacups were kept, put his cap down on the windowsill, thrust one arm so
far down into his coat that it looked as if he was scratching himself
under the other armpit, and pulled out a letter with five brown seals
stamped with an anchor. Dunyasha’s auntie clutched at her bosom, finding
it hard to speak.</p>
<p>‘You gave me such a scare, Semyon. I c … can hardly get a w … word
out. I thought my time had come.’</p>
<p>‘Did you have to do it like that?’ said the second maid, peering out
from behind the skirts.</p>
<p>‘You’ve upset the mistress, too,’ said Dunyasha, coming out of her
mistress’s door.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean creeping in through the maids’ entrance without
permission! Typical peasant!’</p>
<p>Dutlov, making no apology, insisted that he must see the
mistress.</p>
<p>‘She’s not well,’ said Dunyasha.</p>
<p>At this point Aksyuta snorted with such loud and uncouth laughter
that she had to push her head back down into the pillows on the bed, and
she couldn’t take it out for a good hour, despite threats from Dunyasha
and her auntie, for fear of erupting again — as if she was bursting
inside her pink print bosom and red cheeks. She found it so funny that
they had all been so scared; again, she buried her head and scraped her
foot along the floor, and her whole body shook with what looked like
convulsions.</p>
<p>Dutlov stopped, looked closely at her as if he was trying to work out
what was wrong with her, but failing to do so he turned back and went on
speaking.</p>
<p>‘What I want to say is, it’s something very important,’ he said.
‘Just tell her a peasant has found the letter with the money in it.’</p>
<p>‘What money?’</p>
<p>Before reporting to her mistress Dunyasha read the address and asked
Dutlov where and how he had found the money that Polikey ought to have
brought back from town. Once she knew all the details, she shoved the
errand girl out into the passageway because she wouldn’t stop snorting,
and went in to see the mistress, but, to Dutlov’s surprise, the old lady
refused to see him and said nothing to Dunyasha that made any sense.</p>
<p>‘I know nothing about it, and I don’t want to know about any peasant
or any money,’ said the mistress. ‘I cannot and will not see anybody.
Tell him to leave me alone.’</p>
<p>‘So what am I supposed to do?’ said Dutlov, turning the envelope
over. ‘It’s a decent sum of money. What’s this writing say?’ he asked
Dunyasha, who read the address out to him again.</p>
<p>Dutlov seemed as if he couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing. He
was hoping the money didn’t belong to the mistress and he had been given
the wrong address. But Dunyasha had confirmed it again. He gave a sigh,
put the envelope into his bosom and made as if to go.</p>
<p>‘S’pose I’ll have to hand it in to the policeman,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘Wait a minute. I’ll have one more try. I’ll tell her again,’ said
Dunyasha, stopping him. She had watched closely as the envelope had
disappeared into this peasant’s bosom. ‘Give me the letter.’</p>
<p>Dutlov found it again, but he hesitated before handing it over into
Dunyasha’s extended hand.</p>
<p>‘Tell her it was found on the road by Semyon Dutlov.’</p>
<p>‘All right. Let me have it.’</p>
<p>‘I thought it was just any ole letter, but a soldier read it and said
it’s got money inside.’</p>
<p>‘Well, let me have it then.’</p>
<p>‘I didn’t dare go home first, to, er …’ Dutlov began again, still not
parting with the valuable envelope. ‘Right. You go and tell her.’</p>
<p>Dunyasha took the envelope and went back in to see her mistress
again.</p>
<p>‘Oh, for goodness’ sake, Dunyasha,’ said the mistress reproachfully,
‘please don’t talk to me about that money. All I can think about is that
little boy …’</p>
<p>The mistress opened up the envelope and shuddered the moment she saw
the money. She stopped and thought.</p>
<p>‘Horrible money! It does so much evil!’ she said.</p>
<p>‘It’s Dutlov, madam. Do you want him to come in, or will you be kind
enough to come out to see him? Is it all there?’ asked Dunyasha.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want this money. It’s horrible money. Look what it’s done.
Tell him he can have it if he wants it,’ said the mistress in a sudden
outburst, reaching for Dunyasha’s hand. ‘Yes, yes, yes,’ she repeated to
an amazed Dunyasha. ‘Let him take it all and do what he wants with
it.’</p>
<p>‘Fifteen hundred roubles,’ commented Dunyasha with a gentle smile as
if she was dealing with a child.</p>
<p>‘Let him take it all,’ said the mistress impatiently. ‘Can’t you
understand what I’m saying? This money is bad luck. Don’t mention it
again. He can take it, the peasant who found it. Go on, get out of
here.’</p>
<p>Dunyasha went out to the maids’ room.</p>
<p>‘Is it all there?’ asked Dutlov.</p>
<p>‘You can count it yourself,’ said Dunyasha, handing him the envelope.
‘I’ve been told to give it to you.’</p>
<p>Dutlov put his cap under his arm, leaned forward and started to count
the money.</p>
<p>‘You haven’t got an abacus?’</p>
<p>Dutlov thought the mistress was too stupid to count and had told him
to do it.</p>
<p>‘Count it at home. It’s yours. It’s your money,’ snapped Dunyasha.
‘Madam says she doesn’t want to see it. She said give it to the man who
found it.’</p>
<p>Dutlov, still leaning forward, settled his eyes on Dunyasha.</p>
<p>Dunyasha’s auntie threw her hands in the air.</p>
<p>‘Heavens above! It’s your lucky day! Heavens alive!’</p>
<p>The second maid couldn’t believe her ears.</p>
<p>‘Dunyasha, this is a joke, isn’t it?’</p>
<p>‘I’ll give you a joke! She told me to give it to this peasant … Well,
go on, then. Take your money, and go,’ said Dunyasha, not hiding her
irritation. ‘Bad luck for some, good luck for others.’</p>
<p>‘Some joke! Fifteen hundred roubles,’ said the auntie.</p>
<p>‘More than that,’ said Dunyasha by way of confirmation. ‘Well, you’ll
be able to afford a penny candle for St Nicholas,’ she added
contemptuously. ‘Well, pull yourself together … This could have done
some good to a poor man. He’s got plenty of his own.’</p>
<p>At last Dutlov got the point — this was no joke. He set about
collecting the notes, having spread them out for counting, and put them
into the envelope, but his hands were trembling and he kept his eyes on
the girls to make sure they weren’t laughing at him.</p>
<p>‘You see? He can’t pull himself together. He’s too happy with
himself,’ said Dunyasha, implying scorn for the man and his money. ‘Let
me put it in for you.’</p>
<p>And she would have taken hold of it, but Dutlov wouldn’t let her. He
crammed the notes together, pushed them further in and took up his
cap.</p>
<p>‘Are you happy now?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what to say! It’s like …’</p>
<p>He couldn’t finish what he wanted to say, so he just waved his hand,
gave a crooked smile and walked out almost in tears.</p>
<p>The mistress rang.</p>
<p>‘Well? Have you given it to him?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I have.’</p>
<p>‘And? Is he happy with that?’</p>
<p>‘He went absolutely crazy.’</p>
<p>‘Go and call him back. I want to ask him where he found it. Bring him
here. I can’t possibly go out.’</p>
<p>Dunyasha ran off and caught up with the peasant in the passageway. He
still hadn’t put his cap on, but he had taken his purse out and he was
leaning forward as he untied the strings, holding the money between his
teeth. It was almost as if he didn’t think the money was his while ever
the money stayed outside his purse. When Dunyasha called to him he was
shaken.</p>
<p>‘Du … Dunyasha, what do you want? Does she want it back? Couldn’t you
put a word in for me? I’ll bring you some nice honey.’</p>
<p>‘Huh! That would be the first time.’</p>
<p>The door was opened again and the peasant was taken to the mistress.
He did not look happy. ‘Oh dear, she’s going to take it back!’ he was
thinking. As he walked through the rooms, he stepped as high as he could
and tried not to press down with his bark-fibre shoes, as if he was
going through tall grass. He took in nothing of his surroundings. He was
going past a mirror, he saw some flowers and a peasant in bark-fibre
shoes stepping high, a painting of the master with a monocle, a sort of
green tub and something in white … Then he looked again. The something
in white was speaking to him — it was the mistress. He couldn’t make out
a word. He just goggled, not knowing where he was. Everything came at
him through a mist.</p>
<p>‘Dutlov, is that you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, madam. It’s all there. I haven’t touched nothing,’ he said. ‘I
wasn’t happy with it, as God’s my judge. And I haven’t half worked my
horse…’</p>
<p>‘Lucky you,’ she said with a kind but derisive smile. ‘You have it.
It’s yours.’</p>
<p>All he did was roll his eyes.</p>
<p>‘I’m happy that it came to you. Let’s hope some good may come of it.
Well then, are you happy now?’</p>
<p>’You bet I am! Real happy, madam. I’ll pray for you always!</p>
<p>… I’m real happy — thank God our mistress is alive. Only it wasn’t my
fault.’</p>
<p>‘How did you find it?’</p>
<p>‘Well, what I mean is, we’ve all tried our honourable best for the
mistress, and it’s not …’</p>
<p>‘He’s not making any sense, madam,’ said Dunyasha.</p>
<p>‘I was taking me nephew off to the army, I come back on the same road
and I found it. Polikey must have dropped it.’</p>
<p>‘Very well. Off you go, my dear man. I’m happy.’</p>
<p>‘Me too, milady!’ said the peasant.</p>
<p>Then he realized he hadn’t said thank you — he hadn’t known how to go
about it. The mistress and Dunyasha smiled as he strode off again as if
he was stepping over grass. He was forcing himself to hold back to avoid
breaking into a trot. Even then, he couldn’t get it out of his head that
they would stop him any moment now and take it off him . . .</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Out in the fresh air again Dutlov stepped off the road and walked
under the lindens, where he completely undid his belt to get at his
purse and began putting the money away. His lips were trembling, moving
in and out even though he wasn’t making any sounds. Once the money had
been put away and his belt was done up, he crossed himself and walked on
staggering down the road like a drunk, his mind reeling under all the
thoughts that had flashed into his head. Suddenly he saw the figure of a
man coming towards him. He called out. It was Yefim, stick in hand,
patrolling the servants’ quarters.</p>
<p>‘Well, if it’s not good old Semyon,’ said Yefim, full of good cheer,
as he approached. (Yefim was frightened of being out on his own.) ‘Have
you seen the recruits off, old lad?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, they’ve gone. What are you up to?’</p>
<p>‘I’m on patrol guarding Polikey after he’s hung himself.’</p>
<p>‘Where’s he done that?’</p>
<p>‘Up in the loft. Still hanging there by all accounts,’ said Yefim,
pointing with his stick in the darkness over towards the roof of the
serfs’ quarters.</p>
<p>Dutlov followed the direction of his hand and, although he couldn’t
see anything, he frowned, screwed up his eyes and shook his head.</p>
<p>‘Policeman’s come,’ said Yefim, ‘according to the driver. They’ll be
taking him down now. Horrible at night-time, isn’t it, old lad? You
wouldn’t get me going up there at night, not even under orders. Yegor
Mikhaylovich could have me put to death and I still wouldn’t go.’</p>
<p>‘It’s a sin, it is. A wicked sin,’ said Dutlov over and over again.
It was obviously the decent thing to say, but he wasn’t thinking at all
about what he was saying, and he wanted to walk on. But he was stopped
by the sound of Yegor Mikhaylovich’s voice.</p>
<p>‘Hey, watchman! Come over here,’ came the voice from the steps.</p>
<p>Yefim called back.</p>
<p>‘Who’s that man stood with you?’</p>
<p>‘Dutlov.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, Semyon. You come, too.’</p>
<p>When he got near, into the light of the lantern carried by the
driver, Dutlov looked closely at Yegor Mikhaylovich and a little
official in a greatcoat and a cap with a badge on it — the
policeman.</p>
<p>‘Look, this old man’ll come with us,’ said Yegor Mikhaylovich when he
saw him.</p>
<p>This jarred on the old man, but there was no avoiding it.</p>
<p>‘Yefim, be a good lad. Nip up into the loft where he’s hung himself
and put the ladder straight so His Honour can get up there all
right.’</p>
<p>Earlier Yefim would have given anything not to go over to the serfs’
quarters, but now he positively ran, with his bark-fibre shoes
clattering like falling logs.</p>
<p>The police officer struck a light and lit his pipe. He lived barely a
mile away and since he was fresh from a severe reprimand from his boss
for drunkenness he was at his most zealous. Arriving at ten o’clock at
night, he wanted to lose no time in seeing the dead man. Yegor
Mikhaylovich wanted to know from Dutlov what he was doing there. As they
walked, Dutlov told the steward how he had found the money and what the
mistress had done about it. He said he had come to get Yegor’s approval.
Dutlov was horrified when he asked for the envelope and took a good look
at it. The policeman also took hold of the envelope and, in sharp, terse
tones, asked for details.</p>
<p>‘The money’s gone now,’ thought Dutlov, and he began to justify
himself. But the policeman handed it back.</p>
<p>‘Bit of luck for a clodhopper like you,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘Come in handy, that will,’ said Yegor Mikhaylovich. ‘He’s just taken
his nephew off for conscription. He can buy him out now.’</p>
<p>‘Aha!’ said the policeman, and he walked on.</p>
<p>‘You’ll be buying him out, your Ilya, won’t you?’ said Yegor
Mikhaylovich.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean buying him out? Might not be enough money. Might be
too late now.’</p>
<p>‘It’s up to you,’ said the steward, and they walked on together
behind the policeman.</p>
<p>They went to the serfs’ quarters, where malodorous watchmen stood
waiting with a lantern. Dutlov brought up the rear. The watchmen had a
shifty look about them, which could only have related to the smells they
had made because they hadn’t done anything wrong. None of them
spoke.</p>
<p>‘Where is he?’ asked the policeman.</p>
<p>‘He’s up there,’ whispered Yegor Mikhaylovich. ‘Yefim, be a good lad.
You go first with the lantern.’</p>
<p>Yefim had already been up and straightened a plank at the top of the
ladder, and now he seemed to have lost all fear. He went up two or three
rungs at a time, leading the way with a cheerful look on his face, only
turning round to light the way for the policeman. After the constable,
up went Yegor Mikhaylovich. When they had disappeared Dutlov put one
foot on the first rung, gave a sigh and stopped. A couple of minutes
went by, and the footsteps up top went quiet. They had clearly gone over
to the body.</p>
<p>‘Semyon, you’re wanted up here!’ Yefim called down.</p>
<p>Dutlov climbed up. The upper bodies of the policeman and Yegor
Mikhaylovich could be seen in the light of the lantern on the other side
of a beam. Beyond them stood someone else with his back to Dutlov. It
was Polikey. Dutlov clambered over the beam and stopped there, crossing
himself.</p>
<p>‘Turn him round, lads,’ said the policeman.</p>
<p>Nobody moved.</p>
<p>‘Yefim, be a good lad,’ said Yegor Mikhaylovich.</p>
<p>The ‘good lad’ stepped over a beam, turned Polikey round and stood at
his side. With a most cheerful look on his face he glanced first at
Polikey, then at the arm of the law, like a showman displaying an albino
girl or a Julia Pastrana,8 keeping one eye on the public and another on
his exhibit, and ready to oblige the audience in any way.</p>
<p>‘Turn him round again.’</p>
<p>Polikey was turned round again, with a gentle swing of his arms and
his feet dragging on the sandy floor.</p>
<p>‘Get hold of him, and cut him down.’</p>
<p>‘Shall we cut the rope, sir?’ asked Yegor Mikhaylovich. ‘Get me a
hatchet, lads.’</p>
<p>The watchmen and Dutlov needed to be told twice before they came
forward. But then the ‘good lad’ shouldered Polikey like a sheep’s
carcass, the rope was cut and the body was taken down and covered up.
The policeman said the doctor would be coming in the morning, and he let
them all go.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Dutlov went home, with his lips still trembling. At first he felt
sickened, but the nearer he got to his village the more this feeling
began to go, and a feeling of gladness gradually came into his heart. In
the village he could hear people singing and drunken voices. Dutlov had
never been a drinker, and he went straight home. It was late when he
walked into his hut. His old wife was asleep. His eldest son and
grandsons were asleep on the stove-top, and the second son outside in
the store-room. Ilyushka’s wife was the only one awake; she sat there
bareheaded on a bench dressed in her dirty working smock, whining. She
hadn’t come out to greet her uncle, and now, as he came in, she started
whining again and railing against her fate louder still. In the old
woman’s opinion she was pretty good at railing against her fate, even
though she was so young she couldn’t have had much practice at it.</p>
<p>The old woman got up and prepared some supper for her husband. Dutlov
sent Ilyushka’s wife away from the table. ‘That’s enough of that,’ he
said. Aksinya got to her feet and went to lie on another bench, but she
didn’t stop wailing. The old woman laid the table and cleared it
afterwards, all in silence. The old man also said not a word. He said
grace, gave a good belch, washed his hands, took the abacus down from a
nail on the wall and went out into the store-room. There, he and wife
exchanged a few whispered words, then she went out, leaving him clicking
on the abacus. Eventually he closed the lid of a chest with a bang, and
went down into the cellar. He rummaged around for quite some time in
both places, up in the room and down in the cellar. When he came back
inside the hut it was quite dark and the little torch had gone out. The
old woman, who by day was so placid and silent, lay flat out on the
sleeping-bench, and her snoring filled the hut. Ilyushka’s noisy wife
was also asleep; her breathing made no sound. She had gone to sleep on
the bench just as she was, still in her daytime clothes, with nothing to
rest her head on. Dutlov prayed for a while, then looked at Ilyushka’s
wife, shaking his head, put the light out, gave another belch, climbed
on to the stove and settled down next to his little grandson. In the
darkness he lobbed his bark-fibre shoes down on to the floor and lay on
his back looking up at a barely visible cross-beam over the stove and
listening to the cockroaches scrabbling up the wall, the sighing and the
snoring and the rubbing of one foot against another, and the sounds of
the cattle outside.</p>
<p>He couldn’t sleep. The moon rose, bringing more light into the hut.
He could see more — there was Aksinya in the corner, and something he
couldn’t quite make out. Was it a jacket forgotten by his son, or a tub
that the women had been using, or was that somebody standing there? He
may have dropped off, or maybe not, but when he peered into the darkness
again … it was all too clear: the dark spirit that had made Polikey do
that awful thing — the house serfs had felt it with them yesterday
evening — that spirit had winged its way to their village, to Dutlov’s
hut where the money was, the money that be had used to destroy Polikey.
At least, Dutlov could sense him there. Dutlov squirmed — he couldn’t
sleep and he couldn’t get up. His glimpse of something unidentifiable
had reminded him of Ilyusha with his hands tied behind his back,
Aksinya’s face and her deliberate whining, and Polikey with his dangling
hands. Suddenly — the old man could have sworn he saw someone walk past
the window. ‘What’s that? Couldn’t be the elder coming round to see us
as early as this, could it?’ he thought. ‘How did he open the door?’
wondered the old man as he heard footsteps in the passage. ‘Maybe my old
woman didn’t put the bar across when she went down the passage.’ A dog
howled in the yard, and he walked up to the entry, and he seemed to be
looking for something — as the old man said when he told the tale
afterwards — looking for the door, and he walked past it, started
groping at the wall again, only he fell over a tub and made it clatter.
Then he was at it again, groping — must have been feeling for the latch.
Then he grabbed at the latch. The old man felt his flesh creep. Then he
lifted the latch and came in, taking on human form. But Dutlov knew it
was him. He tried making the sign of the cross, but he couldn’t. He
walked over to the table, which had a cloth on it, tore it off, threw it
on the floor and climbed up on the stove. The old man knew what it was —
him, in the form of Polikey. He was grinning and his arms were dangling.
He clambered up on to the stove, collapsed on top of the old man and
started to strangle him.</p>
<p>‘It’s my money,’ Polikey forced out.</p>
<p>‘Let go. I’m not going to …’ Semyon tried to say, but couldn’t.</p>
<p>Polikey was pressing down on him with all the weight of a mountain of
stone. Dutlov knew that if only he could say a prayer he would let go,
and he knew which prayer to say, but he couldn’t get it out. His
grandson was sleeping at his side. The little boy cried out and burst
into tears. His grandfather had shoved him up against the wall. The
child’s cry unlocked the old man’s lips. ‘Let God arise,’ Dutlov managed
to say. He eased up a little. ‘And his enemies be scattered…’ spluttered
Dutlov. He got down from the stove. Dutlov heard both his feet bang down
on the floor. He prayed and prayed, saying all the prayers he knew one
after another. He walked to the door, went past the table and slammed
the door with a bang that shook the whole hut. But everyone slept on
except the grandson and grandfather. The grandfather, still praying, was
shaking in every limb; the grandson, weeping, clung to his grandfather
but went back to sleep. Soon it was quiet again. Grandfather lay still.
A cock crew through the wall right by Dutlov’s ear. He could hear the
hens stirring; a young cockerel made an attempt at crowing like the old
one, but couldn’t manage it. Something stirred at the old man’s feet. It
was the cat. She jumped down from the stove-top on her soft paws, and
now she was miaowing at the door. Grandfather got up and raised a
window. It was dark and muddy outside. The cart was still there,
standing by the window. Crossing himself, he went outside in his bare
feet to see to the horses. You could tell that he had been there, the
master. The mare, standing under the eaves at the end of the building,
had caught her foot in the bridle and spilt her chaff all over the
place; she was waiting for her master, with one foot raised and her head
turned round. Her foal lay sprawling across a heap of manure.
Grandfather stood him up, disentangled the mare, sorted out her feed and
went back into the hut.</p>
<p>The old woman got up and lit a torch.</p>
<p>‘Get the boys up,’ he said. ‘I’m going into town.’ And, lighting a
little wax taper from in front of the icons, he took it with him down
into the cellar. By the time he came back up his wasn’t the only candle
to have been lit — there were lights in all of the neighbours’ huts. The
boys were up and ready to go. The womenfolk were coming and going,
carrying buckets or tubs of milk. Ignat was harnessing the horse to one
cart; the second son was greasing the wheels of another one. The young
wife hadn’t started whining yet. She had tidied herself up and put a
scarf round her head; now she was sitting on a bench in the hut, waiting
until it was time to go into town and say goodbye to her husband.</p>
<p>The old man had a particularly harsh look about him. He hadn’t a word
to say to anybody as he put on his best long coat and tied the belt
before walking over to Yegor Mikhaylovich, with all Polikey’s money
stuffed in his bosom.</p>
<p>‘Don’t hang about!’ he roared at Ignat, who was busy rotating the
wheels jacked up on the newly greased axle. ‘I’ll be back in a minute.
Be ready.’</p>
<p>The steward had only just got up, and he was having a drink of tea.
He too was going into town to hand over the conscripts.</p>
<p>‘What do you want?’ he asked.</p>
<p>‘I want to buy him out, Yegor Mikhaylovich, our lad. Do me a favour.
T’other day you said you had a volunteer. Tell me what to do. We’m not
well schooled.’</p>
<p>‘Had second thoughts, have you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes I have. I’m sorry for him. My brother’s boy. Don’t matter what
he’s turned out like. I’m sorry for him. Lot of evil it’s caused, this
’ere money. Do me a favour. Tell me what to do,’ he said, giving a low
bow.</p>
<p>As always on these occasions, Yegor Mikhaylovich champed his lips for
quite some time, thinking things over and saying nothing. Then, having
considered the matter, he wrote two notes and told the old man what to
do in town, and how to go about it.</p>
<p>When Dutlov got back home the young wife was already on the road with
Ignat. The fat-bellied grey mare stood fully harnessed at the gate. He
broke a switch off from the hedge, wrapped himself in his coat, got up
on the box and whipped the horse up. Dutlov drove the mare so fast that
her fat sides were sucked in, and Dutlov looked away so as not to feel
sorry for her. He was tormented by the thought that for one reason or
another he might be too late for the conscription, Ilyusha might go off
to be a soldier and he would be left holding the devil’s money.</p>
<p>I shall not go into all the details of what Dutlov managed to get
through that morning. Suffice it to say that it really was his lucky
day. The master to whom Yegor Mikhaylovich had written one of his notes
did have a volunteer who was ready and waiting; in debt to the tune of
twenty-three roubles, he had already been accepted by the recruitment
board. His master wanted four hundred roubles for him, and a wealthy
buyer who had been after him for the last three weeks was sticking out
for three hundred. Dutlov fixed things with a few short words. ‘Three
twenty-five. All right?’ he said, holding his hand out, but it was
immediately obvious from the way he looked that he was prepared to go
higher. The master withdrew his hand and insisted on four hundred.
‘Three twenty-five, no good?’ said Dutlov, taking the owner’s right hand
with his left, ready to smack it with his own right hand. ‘No good? …
Damn you!’ he suddenly said, whacking his hand into the master’s as hard
as he could and turning his whole body away. ‘That’s it, then. Make it
three fifty. I want a deceipt. Bring the lad here. You’ll need a
deposit. Two tenners all right?’</p>
<p>Dutlov was already undoing his belt to get at the money.</p>
<p>The master did not withdraw his hand, but something seemed to be
holding him back from accepting the deposit. He was going on about
wetting the bargain and giving the volunteer some sort of treat.</p>
<p>‘Don’t be a sinner,’ said Dutlov, pressing the money on to him. ‘We
all have to die.’ His tone was so gentle, assured and convincing that
the master said, ‘Oh, all right then,’ before whacking his hand again
and saying a prayer. ‘God be with you.’</p>
<p>They woke the volunteer, who was still sleeping off the previous
day’s binge, examined him for no obvious reason and left en masse to see
the authorities. The volunteer was in good cheer. He asked for rurn —
the hair of the dog that had bitten him — and Dutlov gave him the money
to get some. He was all right until the moment they set foot in the
entrance to the recruiting board, when his courage failed him. They
stood there for some time, the old man, the master in his dark blue
cloak and the volunteer in his short sheepskin coat, with his eyebrows
raised and his eyes staring. For some time they carried on a whispered
conversation; they kept asking to be taken somewhere, to see someone;
for some reason or other they doffed their caps at every passing clerk,
and they bowed as they listened with profound concentration to any
ruling handed down by a clerk known to the master. It wasn’t long before
any hope of settling the matter that day had vanished, and the volunteer
was showing signs of cheering up and making merry, when Dutlov caught
sight of Yegor Mikhaylovich and immediately latched on to him, bowing
and asking for help. Yegor Mikhaylovich was so effective in his
assistance that by three o’clock the volunteer, much to his own surprise
and dissatisfaction, was taken before the board, accepted as a recruit
and — in an atmosphere of all-round celebration which somehow affected
everybody from doorman to chairman — undressed, shaved, dressed again
and taken outside. Five minutes later Dutlov was counting out the money.
He got his receipt, said goodbye to the master and the volunteer, and
went over to the house where the Pokrovskoye recruits were staying. Ilya
and his young wife were sitting in a corner of the merchant’s kitchen
and, as soon as the old man came in, they stopped talking and stared at
him with an expression of resignation tinged with hostility. As always,
the old man said a prayer, then he undid his belt, took out some sort of
paper and called for his eldest son, Ignat, and Ilya’s mother, who was
out in the yard, to come inside.</p>
<p>‘Don’t you be a sinner, Ilya,’ he said, going across to his nephew.
‘Last night you said some bad things to me … Do you think I’m not sorry
for you? I remember my brother and how he left you in my care. If I’d
had what it took, do you think I’d have given you away? God has sent me
some good luck, and I’m not grudging you. Look, here it is, this paper.’
As he spoke he put the receipt down on the table and carefully smoothed
it out with his stiff, unbending fingers.</p>
<p>All the men from Pokrovskoye, the merchant’s work people and a number
of outsiders came into the hut. They had all guessed what was going on,
but not one of them interrupted the solemnity of the old man’s
speech.</p>
<p>‘There it is, your note. Cost me four hundred. Don’t speak bad of
your uncle.’</p>
<p>Ilya got to his feet in silence, not knowing what to say. His lips
were quivering with emotion. His old mother made as if to go over and
throw herself sobbing on his neck, but the old man waved her away gently
but firmly, and continued to speak.</p>
<p>‘Yesterday you said some bad things to me,’ he repeated, ‘and them
bad things cut me to the heart. Your father left you to me on his
deathbed, and you’ve been like my own son to me, and if I’ve done you
wrong, well, we’m all sinners. Isn’t that right, good Christian folk?’
He turned to the peasants standing around him. ‘Here’s your mother and
your young wife, and here’s your deceipt. Never mind the money! Just say
you forgive me, for the love of Christ.’</p>
<p>And then, folding back the skirts of his coat, he got slowly to his
knees and bowed down at the feet of Ilya and his wife. It was no good
the youngsters trying to hold him back; he wouldn’t get up until he had
touched the floor with his head, and then he shook his clothes straight
and sat down on a bench. Ilya’s mother and wife were howling with joy.
Voices of approval murmured in the crowd. ‘Truly, ’tis God’s work, oh
yes,’ said one. ‘What good is money? Money won’t buy you a young lad,’
said another. ‘There’s happiness for you,’ came a third. ‘Good man he
is, that’s for sure.’ The only ones not speaking were the men being sent
as recruits, who walked out in silence.</p>
<p>Two hours later two carts with the Dutlovs in them were driving
through the outskirts of the town. In the first one, pulled by the
pot-bellied grey mare with a sweaty neck, sat the old man and Ignat.
Bouncing along behind them in the wagon were some little pots tied
together and some cakes. In the second cart, with no one holding the
reins, sat the young wife and her mother-in-law with scarves over their
heads, dignified and happy figures. The younger woman was clutching a
bottle of vodka under her apron. Ilya, crumpled up with his back to the
horse and very red in the face, jolted against the front of the cart,
munching a roll and talking nineteen to the dozen. The speaking voices,
the carts rumbling along the road and the horses snorting - it all
merged into a single happy sound. The horses swished their tails and
trotted along faster and faster, sensing the way home. It was a happy
family group that was bound to catch the eye of people passing by,
driving or on foot.</p>
<p>On the very edge of the town the Dutlovs caught up with a party of
recruits. They were standing in a group outside a tavern. One of the
recruits, with the strange look that comes from having the front of the
head shaven and a grey cap pushed well back, was strumming away at a
balalaika. Another one, not wearing a cap, clutched a bottle of vodka in
one hand as he cavorted in the middle of the ring. Ignat stopped his
horse and got down to tighten the traces. All the Dutlovs looked on with
curiosity, approval and amusement as the man did his dancing. The
recruit seemed not to notice anyone, but he could sense his admiring
audience getting larger, and this added to his energy and agility. He
was giving it all he had. His brows were knitted, his red face showed no
movement, his mouth was set in a fixed smile long devoid of meaning. His
strength of spirit seemed to be totally focused on the placing of one
foot behind the other as fast as possible, toes then heels. Now and
again he would come to a sudden stop and wink at the balalaika-player,
who would then thrum on all his strings faster than ever and rap his
knuckles on the body of his instrument. The recruit would come to a
stop, but even as he stood there motionless he seemed to be still
dancing. Suddenly he would drop into a slow movement, shaking his
shoulders, and then leap up, twisting in the air, before flying down,
yelling out and squatting as he kicked out one leg after the other.
Little boys laughed, women nodded, men smiled their approval. An old
sergeant stood near the dancing recruit with a look on his face that
said, ‘You think it’s marvellous. It’s nothing to us.’ Visibly tiring,
the balalaika-player took a lazy look round, gave a discordant strum and
rapped on the woodwork. The dancing was over.</p>
<p>‘Hey, Alyokha!’ said the balalaika-player to the dancer. ‘There’s
your sponsor!’</p>
<p>‘Where? My dear old friend!’ cried Alyokha. It was the recruit who
had been bought by Dutlov, and now he walked towards their cart,
staggering forwards on his weary legs and holding a vodka bottle over
his head.</p>
<p>‘Misha! Give us a glass!’ he cried. ‘Master! My dear old friend! All
happy now, aren’t we?’ he called out, his drunken head flopping over
into the cart, and he offered his vodka round to the men and the women.
The men had a swig; the women refused. ‘All friends and family… what can
I give you?’ he shouted out, hugging the old women.</p>
<p>A woman selling snacks stood in the crowd. Alyokha caught sight of
her, grabbed hold of her tray and scattered its contents all over the
cart.</p>
<p>‘Don’t you worry. Damn it, I’m paying!’ he wailed through choking
tears. He pulled a purse out of his baggy trousers and threw it to
Misha.</p>
<p>He stood there with his elbows on the cart and his watering eyes
looked at the people sitting in it. ‘Who’s the mother here?’ he asked.
‘Is it you? Must give you a little treat.’</p>
<p>He thought for a moment, dived into his pocket and got hold of a new,
neatly folded handkerchief, then a bit of towelling that he wore round
his waist underneath his greatcoat and finally he took a red scarf from
around his neck, rolled them all together and shoved them on to the old
woman’s knees.</p>
<p>‘There you are. Present from me,’ he said, his voice softening all
the time.</p>
<p>‘Why me? Thank you, dearie! What a nice lad!’ said the old woman,
turning towards old Dutlov, who was walking across to their cart.</p>
<p>Alyokha had stopped talking. There was a dreamy look in his eyes, as
if he was falling asleep, and his head drooped lower and lower.</p>
<p>‘I’m going, to save you. I’m a dead man, to save you!’ he forced out.
‘That’s why I’m giving you things.’</p>
<p>‘Chances are, he’s got a mother, too,’ said a voice in the crowd.
‘Such a nice lad! It’s a shame!’</p>
<p>Alyokha looked up.</p>
<p>‘Yes, I have,’ he said. ‘And a father, too. Finished with me, they
have. You listen to me, old woman,’ he went on, taking Ilya’s mother by
the hand. ‘I’ve given you some presents. Listen to me, for Christ’s
sake. Get down to my village — Vodnoye. Ask for old woman Nikonova.
She’s my mother. You follow me? Tell this old woman, old woman Nikonova,
third hut from the end, where that new well is … Tell her… Alyokha, it’s
your son… He’s… Know what I mean? … Music man! Get playing!’ he
shouted.</p>
<p>And he set off dancing again, still muttering, hurling his bottle to
the ground with some vodka still in it.</p>
<p>Ignat climbed into the cart, and was about to get going.</p>
<p>‘Goodbye. God go with you!’ said the old woman, sinking into her
coat.</p>
<p>Alyokha stopped suddenly. ‘The devil go with you!’ he shouted. ‘Get
fucking gone!’</p>
<p>‘Oh, Lord above!’ she said, making the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>Ignat urged the mare on, and the carts rumbled down the road.</p>
<p>Alyokha the recruit stood there in the middle of the road with his
fists clenched, fury written on his face, swearing at the peasants as
loud as he could.</p>
<p>‘What are you looking at? Get lost! Devils! Cannibals!’ he roared.
‘I’ll get you! Devils! Peasant scum!’</p>
<p>At this words failed him, and he fell where he stood full length on
the ground.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the Dutlovs to get out into the open fields,
and when they looked back there was no sign of the crowd of recruits.
They went on at walking pace for two or three miles, then Ignat got
down, leaving the old man fast asleep, and walked along at the side of
Ilya’s cart.</p>
<p>They shared the bottle of vodka they had brought with them from town.
After a while Ilya got going with a few songs, and the women sang along,
too. Ignat shouted merrily at the horse, keeping time with the singing.
A mail cart galloped merrily towards them. The driver bawled at his
horses as he drove past the two celebrating carts, and the postman
glanced across at the red faces of the peasants, the men and the women
as they bounced along in their cart singing a happy song.</p>
