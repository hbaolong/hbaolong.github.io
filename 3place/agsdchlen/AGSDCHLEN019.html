<h4 id="chapter-xviii-of-the-example-of-the-holy-fathers">CHAPTER XVIII
OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE HOLY FATHERS</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>CONSIDER now the lively examples of the holy fathers, in whom
shone forth real perfectness and religion, and thou shalt see how
little, even as nothing, is all that we do. Ah! What is our life when
compared to theirs? They, saints and friends of Christ as they were,
served the Lord in hunger and thirst, in old and nakedness, in labour
and weariness, in watchings and fastings, in prayer and holy
meditations, in persecutions and much rebuke.</p></li>
<li><p>O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles, Martyrs,
Confessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would walk in the
footsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in this world that they
might keep them unto life eternal. O how strict and retired a life was
that of the holy fathers who dwelt in the desert! what long and grievous
temptations they did suffer! how often were they assaulted by the enemy!
what frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God! what strict
fasts did they endure! what fervent zeal and desire after spiritual
profit did they manifest! how bravely did they fight that their vices
might not gain the mastery! how entirely and steadfastly did they reach
after God! By day they laboured, and at night they gave themselves
ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even when they were labouring they ceased not
from mental prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed short
for retirement with God; and through the great sweetness of
contemplation, even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten. They
renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen; they desired
nothing from the world; they ate the bare necessaries of life; they were
unwilling to minister to the body even in necessity. Thus were they poor
in earthly things, but rich above measure in grace and virtue. Though
poor to the outer eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly
benedictions.</p></li>
<li><p>They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as
kinsmen and friends. They seemed unto themselves as of no reputation,
and in the world’s eyes contemptible; but in the sight of God they were
precious and beloved. They stood fast in true humility, they lived in
simple obedience, they walked in love and patience; and thus they waxed
strong in spirit, and obtained great favour before God. To all religious
men they were given as an example, and they ought more to provoke us
unto good livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to
carelessness of life.</p></li>
<li><p>O how great was the love of all religious persons at the
beginning of this sacred institution! O what devoutness of prayer! what
rivalry in holiness! what strict discipline was observed! what reverence
and obedience under the rule of the master showed they in all things!
The traces of them that remain until now testify that they were truly
holy and perfect men, who fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot.
Now a man is counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he
can only endure with patience what he hath undertaken.</p></li>
<li><p>O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly
decline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to live,
because of sloth and lukewarmness. May progress in holiness not wholly
fall asleep in thee, who many times hast seen so many examples of devout
men!</p></li>
