<h4 id="chapter-xii-of-the-royal-way-of-the-holy-cross">CHAPTER XII OF
THE ROYAL WAY OF THE HOLY CROSS</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THAT seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after
Me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me. But it
will be much harder to hear that last sentence, Depart from me, ye
wicked, into eternal fire. For they who now willingly hear the word of
the Cross and follow it, shall not then fear the hearing of eternal
damnation. This sign of the Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord
cometh to Judgment. Then all servants of the Cross, who in life have
conformed themselves to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the
Judge with great boldness.</p></li>
<li><p>Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a
kingdom? In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the Cross is
protection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly sweetness, in the
Cross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of the spirit, in the Cross the
height of virtue, in the Cross perfection of holiness. There is no
health of the soul, no hope of eternal life, save in the Cross. Take up
therefore, thy cross and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal
life. He went before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the
Cross, that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be
crucified upon it. For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also live
with Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou shalt be also
of His glory.</p></li>
<li><p>Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything lieth
in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true inward
peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily mortification. Go
where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt, and thou shalt find no
higher way above nor safer way below, than the way of the Holy Cross.
Dispose and order all things according to thine own will and judgment,
and thou shalt ever find something to suffer either willingly or
unwillingly, and thus thou shalt ever find thy cross. For thou shalt
either feel pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy
soul.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be
tried by thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be wearisome
to thyself. And still thou canst not be delivered nor eased by any
remedy or consolation, but must bear so long as God will. For God will
have thee learn to suffer tribulation without consolation, and to submit
thyself fully to it, and by tribulation be made more humble. No man
understandeth the Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath
had somewhat of the like suffering himself. The Cross therefore is
always ready, and every where waiteth for thee. Thou canst not flee from
it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou comest, thou
bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find thyself. Turn thee above,
turn thee below, turn thee without, turn thee within, and in them all
thou shalt find the Cross; and needful is it that thou everywhere
possess patience if thou wilt have internal peace and gain the
everlasting crown.</p></li>
<li><p>If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will
bring thee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall be the
end of suffering; though it shall not be here. If thou bear it
unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly increaseth thy
load, and yet thou must bear it. If thou cast away one cross, without
doubt thou shalt find another and perchance a heavier.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinkest thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to avoid?
Which of the saints in the world hath been without the cross and
tribulation? For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was one hour without the
anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived. It behooved, He said,
Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and so enter into his glory.
And how dost thou seek another way than this royal way, which is the way
of the Holy Cross?</p></li>
<li><p>The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost thou
seek for thyself rest and joy? Thou art wrong, thou art wrong, if thou
seekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this whole mortal life is
full of miseries, and set round with crosses. And the higher a man hath
advanced in the spirit, the heavier crosses he will often find, because
the sorrow of his banishment increaseth with the strength of his
love.</p></li>
<li><p>But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not
without refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant fruit to
be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross. For whilst he
willingly submitteth himself to it, every burden of tribulation is
turned into an assurance of divine comfort, and the more the flesh is
wasted by affliction, the more is the spirit strengthened mightily by
inward grace. And ofttimes so greatly is he comforted by the desire for
tribulation and adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of
Christ, that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he
believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more and the
heavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake. This is not the virtue
of man, but the grace of Christ which hath such power and energy in the
weak flesh, that what it naturally hateth and fleeth from, this it
draweth to and loveth through fervour of spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the
cross, to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to fly
from honours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and desire to
be despised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to desire no
prosperity in this world. If thou lookest to thyself, thou wilt of
thyself be able to do none of this; but if thou trustest in the Lord,
endurance shall be given thee from heaven, and the world and the flesh
shall be made subject to thy command. Yea, thou shalt not even fear
thine adversary the devil, if thou be armed with faith and signed with
the Cross of Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of
Christ, to the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out of love
was crucified for thee. Prepare thyself for the bearing many adversities
and manifold troubles in this wretched life; because so it shall be with
thee wheresoever thou art, and so in very deed thou shalt find it,
wherever thou hide thyself. This is must be; and there is no means of
escaping from tribulation and sorrow, except to bear them patiently.
Drink thou lovingly thy Lord’s cup if thou desirest to be His friend and
to have thy lot with Him. Leave consolations to God, let Him do as
seemeth best to Him concerning them. But do thou set thyself to endure
tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the sufferings
of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
shall be revealed in us, nor would they be even if thou wert to endure
them all.</p></li>
<li><p>When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and
pleasant to thee for Christ’s sake, then reckon that it is well with
thee, because thou hast found paradise on earth. So long as it is hard
to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long it will not be
well with thee, and tribulations will follow thee everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to suffer
and to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou shalt find
peace. Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul unto the third
heaven, thou art not on that account secure from suffering evil. I will
show him, saith Jesus, what great things he must suffer for My Name’s
sake. It remaineth, therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou wilt love
Jesus and serve Him continually.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of
Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among all the
saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour! For all men
commend patience, although few be willing to practise it. Thou oughtest
surely to suffer a little for Christ when many suffer heavier things for
the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of a
dying man. And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he beginneth to
live towards God. None is fit for the understanding of heavenly things,
unless he hath submitted himself to bearing adversities for Christ.
Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing more healthful for thyself in
this world, than to suffer willingly for Christ. And if it were thine to
choose, thou oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for Christ,
than to be refreshed with manifold consolations, for thou wouldest be
more like Christ and more conformed to all saints. For our worthiness
and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and consolations, but
rather in bearing many troubles and adversities.</p></li>
<li><p>If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable to
the health of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have shown it by
word and example. For both the disciples who followed Him, and all
desire to follow Him, He plainly exhorteth to bear their cross, and
saith, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up
his cross, and follow Me. So now that we have thoroughly read and
studied all things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. We
must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</p></li>
