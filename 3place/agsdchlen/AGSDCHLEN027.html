<h4 id="chapter-i-of-the-inward-life">CHAPTER I OF THE INWARD LIFE</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE kingdom of God is within you, saith the Lord. Turn thee with
all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable world, and thou
shalt find rest unto thy soul. Learn to despise outward things and to
give thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God
come within thee. For the kingdom of God is peace and joy in the Holy
Ghost, and it is not given to the wicked. Christ will come to thee, and
show thee His consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him
within thee. All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it
pleaseth Him to dwell. He often visiteth the inward man and holdeth with
him sweet discourse, giving him soothing consolation, much peace,
friendship exceeding wonderful.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom that
he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for so He saith,
if any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him,
and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. Give, therefore,
place to Christ and refuse entrance to all others. When thou hast
Christ, thou art rich, and hast sufficient. He shall be thy provider and
faithful watchman in all things, that thou hast no need to trust in men,
for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ remaineth for ever
and standeth by us firmly even to the end.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal man,
even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should much sorrow
arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict us. They who are
on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against thee, and often are they
turned round like the wind. Put thy whole trust in God and let Him be
thy fear and thy love, He will answer for thee Himself, and will do for
thee what is best. Here hast thou no continuing city,and wheresoever
thou art, thou art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have
rest unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.</p></li>
<li><p>Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this is
not the place of thy rest? In heaven ought thy habitation to be, and all
earthly things should be looked upon as it were in the passing by. All
things pass away and thou equally with them. Look that thou cleave not
to them lest thou be taken with them and perish. Let thy contemplation
be on the Most High, and let thy supplication be directed unto Christ
without ceasing. If thou canst not behold high and heavenly things, rest
thou in the passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred wounds.
For if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the precious marks
of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great comfort in
tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much, and thou
wilt easily bear their unkind words.</p></li>
<li><p>Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and rejected
of men, and in His greatest necessity was left by His acquaintance and
friends to bear these reproaches. Christ was willing to suffer and be
despised, and darest thou complain of any? Christ had adversaries and
gainsayers, and dost thou wish to have all men thy friends and
benefactors? Whence shall thy patience attain her crown if no adversity
befall thee? If thou art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt
thou be the friend of Christ? Sustain thyself with Christ and for Christ
if thou wilt reign with Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst
tasted yea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou care
nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience, but wouldst rather
rejoice at trouble brought upon thee, because the love of Jesus maketh a
man to despise himself. He who loveth Jesus, and is inwardly true and
free from inordinate affections, is able to turn himself readily unto
God, and to rise above himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful
peace.</p></li>
<li><p>He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or
seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of men. He
who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little value upon
outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for seasons, for
holding his intercourse with God. The inward man quickly recollecteth
himself, because he is never entirely given up to outward things. No
outward labour and no necessary occupations stand in his way, but as
events fall out, so doth he fit himself to them. He who is rightly
disposed and ordered within careth not for the strange and perverse
conduct of men. A man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is
moved by outward things.</p></li>
<li><p>If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil, all
things would work together for thy good and profiting. For this cause do
many things displease thee and often trouble thee, that thou art not yet
perfectly dead to thyself nor separated from all earthly things. Nothing
so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as impure love towards
created things. If thou rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to
contemplate heavenly things and frequently to be joyful
inwardly.</p></li>
