<h4 id="chapter-xx-of-the-love-of-solitude-and-silence">CHAPTER XX OF
THE LOVE OF SOLITUDE AND SILENCE</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>SEEK a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of
the mercies of God to thee. Leave curious questions. Study such matters
as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement. If thou withdraw
thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings about, as well as
from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy time sufficient and apt
for good meditation. The greatest saints used to avoid as far as they
could the company of men, and chose to live in secret with God.</p></li>
<li><p>One hath said, “As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I
returned less a man.” This is what we often experience when we have been
long time in conversation. For it is easier to be altogether silent than
it is not to exceed in word. It is easier to remain hidden at home than
to keep sufficient guard upon thyself out of doors. He, therefore, that
seeketh to reach that which is hidden and spiritual, must go with Jesus
“apart from the multitude.” No man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to
rest at home. No man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace.
No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject. No man safely
commandeth but he who loveth to obey.</p></li>
<li><p>No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a good
conscience within himself. The boldness of the Saints was always full of
the fear of God. Nor were they the less earnest and humble in
themselves, because they shone forth with great virtues and grace. But
the boldness of wicked men springeth from pride and presumption, and at
the last turneth to their own confusion. Never promise thyself security
in this life, howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou
seemest.</p></li>
<li><p>Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the more
grievously because of their over great confidence. Wherefore it is very
profitable unto many that they should not be without inward temptation,
but should be frequently assaulted, lest they be over confident, lest
they be indeed lifted up into pride, or else lean too freely upon the
consolations of the world. O how good a conscience should that man keep,
who never sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled
with the world! O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who would
cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and divine things,
and build his whole hope upon God!</p></li>
<li><p>No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath
diligently exercised himself in holy compunction. If thou wilt feel
compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and shut out the
tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with your own heart in
your own chamber and be still. In retirement thou shalt find what often
thou wilt lose abroad. Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth
sweet, but if thou keep not in it, begetteth weariness. If in the
beginning of thy conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well, it
shall afterwards be to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant
solace.</p></li>
<li><p>In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and learneth
the hidden things of the Scriptures. Therein findeth she a fountain of
tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each night, that she may grow
the more dear to her Maker as she dwelleth the further from all worldly
distraction. To him who withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and
friends God with His holy angels will draw nigh. It is better to be
unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work
wonders. It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad, to
fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men.</p></li>
<li><p>Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have? The world
passeth away and the lust thereof. The desires of sensuality draw thee
abroad, but when an hour is past, what dost thou bring home, but a
weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart? A merry going forth
bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad
morning? So doth all carnal joy begin pleasantly, but in the end it
gnaweth away and destroyeth. What canst thou see abroad which thou seest
not at home? Behold the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out
of these are all things made.</p></li>
<li><p>What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the
sun? Thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but thou
wilt never be able to attain unto this. If thou shouldest see all things
before thee at once, what would if be but a vain vision? Lift up thine
eyes to God on high, and pray that thy sins and negligences may be
forgiven. Leave vain things to vain men, and mind thou the things which
God hath commanded thee. Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself
Jesus thy beloved. Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not
elsewhere find so great peace. If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened
to vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace. But because
it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou must therefore
suffer trouble of heart.</p></li>
