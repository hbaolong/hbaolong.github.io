XLVI OF HAVING CONFIDENCE IN GOD WHEN EVIL WORDS ARE CAST AT US</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“MY Son, stand fast and believe in Me. For what are words but
words? They fly through the air, but they bruise no stone. If thou are
guilty, think how thou wouldst gladly amend thyself; if thou knowest
nothing against thyself, consider that thou wilt gladly bear this for
God’s sake. It is little enough that thou sometimes hast to bear hard
words, for thou art not yet able to bear hard blows. And wherefore do
such trivial matters go to thine heart, except that thou art yet carnal,
and regardest men more than thou oughtest? For because thou fearest to
be despised, thou art unwilling to be reproved for thy faults, and
seekest paltry shelters of excuses.</p></li>
<li><p>“But look better into thyself, and thou shalt know that the world
is still alive in thee, and the vain love of pleasing men. For when thou
fleest away from being abased and confounded for thy faults, it is plain
that thou art neither truly humble nor truly dead to the world, and that
the world is not crucified to thee. But hearken to My word, and thou
shalt not care for ten thousand words of men. Behold, if all things
could be said against thee which the utmost malice could invent, what
should it hurt thee if thou wert altogether to let it go, and make no
more account of it than of a mote? Could it pluck out a single hair of
thy head?</p></li>
<li><p>“But he that hath no heart within him, and hath not God before
his eyes, is easily moved by a word of reproach; but he who trusteth in
Me, and seeketh not to abide by his own judgment, shall be free from the
fear of men. For I am the Judge and the Discerner of all secrets; I know
how the thing hath been done; I know both the injurer and the bearer.
From Me went forth that word, by My permission this hath happened, that
the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. I shall judge the guilty
and the innocent; but beforehand I have willed to try them both by a
secret judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>“The testimony of men often deceiveth. My judgment is true; it
will stand, and it shall not be overturned. It commonly lieth hid, and
only to few in certain cases is it made known; yet it never erreth, nor
can err, although it seem not right to the eyes of foolish men. To Me,
therefore, must men have recourse in all judgment, and must not lean to
their opinion. For there shall no evil happen to the just, whatsoever
may be sent to him by God. Even though some unjust charge be brought
against him, he will care little; nor, again, will he exult above
measure, if through others he be clearly vindicated. For he considereth
that I am He who try the hearts and reins, who judge not outwardly and
according to human appear-ance;for often in Mine eyes that is found
blameworthy which in the judgmet of men is held worthy of
praise.”</p></li>
<li><p>O Lord God, O Judge, just, strong, and patient, who knowest the
frailty and sinfulness of men, be Thou my strength and my whole
confidence; for my own conscience sufficeth me not. Thou knowest what I
know not; and therefore ought I under all rebuke to humble myself, and
to bear it meekly. Therefore mercifully forgive me as often as I have
not done this, and grant me the next time the grace of greater
endurance. For better unto me is Thine abundant pity for the attainment
of Thy pardon, than the righteousness which I believe myself to have for
defence against my conscience, which lieth wait against me. Although I
know nothing against myself, yet am I not hereby justified, because if
Thy mercy were removed away, in Thy sight should no man living be
justified.</p></li>
