LIV OF THE DIVERSE MOTIONS OF NATURE AND OF GRACE</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“MY Son, pay diligent heed to the motions of Nature and of Grace,
because they move in a very contrary and subtle manner, and are hardly
distinguished save by a spiritual and inwardly enlightened man. All men
indeed seek good, and make pretence of something good in all that they
say or do; and thus under the appearance of good many are
deceived.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature is deceitful and draweth away, ensnareth, and deceiveth
many, and always hath self for her end; but Grace walketh in simplicity
and turneth away from every appearance of evil, maketh no false
pretences, and doeth all entirely for the sake of God, in whom also she
finally resteth.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature is very unwilling to die, and to be pressed down, and to
be overcome, and to be in subjection, and to bear the yoke readily; but
Grace studieth self-mortification, resisteth sensuality, seeketh to be
subdued, longeth to be conquered, and willeth not to use her own
liberty. She loveth to be held by discipline, and not to have authority
over any, but always to live, to remain, to have her being under God,
and for God’s sake is ready to be humbly subject to every ordinance of
man.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature laboureth for her own advantage, and considereth what
profit she may gain from another; but Grace considereth more, not what
may be useful and convenient to self, but what may be profitable to the
many.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature willingly receiveth honour and reverence; but Grace
faithfully ascribeth all honour and glory to God.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature feareth confusion and contempt, but Grace rejoiceth to
suffer shame for the name of Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature loveth ease and bodily quiet; Grace cannot be unemployed,
but gladly embraceth labour.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature seeketh to possess things curious and attractive, and
abhorreth those which are rough and cheap; Grace is delighted with
things simple and humble, despiseth not those which are rough, nor
refuseth to be clothed with old garments.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature hath regard to things temporal, rejoiceth in earthly
lucre, is made sad by loss, vexed by any little injurious word; but
Grace reacheth after things eternal, cleaveth not to those which are
temporal, is not perturbed by losses, nor embittered by any hard words,
because she hath placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nought
perisheth.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature is covetous, and receiveth more willingly than she
giveth, loveth things that are personal and private to herself; while
Grace is kind and generous, avoideth selfishness, is contended with a
little, believeth that it is more blessed to give than to
receive.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature inclineth thee to created things, to thine own flesh, to
vanities and dissipation; but Grace draweth to God and to virtues,
renounceth creatures, fleeth from the world, hateth the desires of the
flesh, restraineth vagaries, blusheth to be seen in public.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature is glad to receive some outward solace in which the
senses may have delight; but Grace seeketh to be comforted in God alone,
and to have delight in the chief good above all visible things.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature doeth everything for her own gain and profit, can do
nothing as a free favour, but hopeth to attain something as good or
better, or some praise or favour for her benefits; and she loveth that
her own deeds and gifts should be highly valued; but Grace seeketh
nothing temporal, nor requireth any other gift of reward than God alone;
neither longeth she for more of temporal necessities than such as may
suffice for the attaining of eternal life.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature rejoiceth in many friends and kinsfolk, she boasteth of
noble place and noble birth, she smileth on the powerful, flattereth the
rich, applaudeth those who are like herself; but Grace loveth even her
enemies, and is not lifted up by the multitude of friends, setteth no
store upon high place or high birth, unless there be greater virtue
therewith; favoureth the poor man more than the rich, hath more sympathy
with the innocent than with the powerful; rejoiceth with the truthful,
not with the liar; always exhorteth the good to strive after better
gifts of grace, and to become by holiness like unto the Son of
God.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature quickly complaineth of poverty and of trouble; Grace
beareth want with constancy.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature looketh upon all things in reference to herself; striveth
and argueth for self; but Grace bringeth back all things to God from
whom they came at the beginning; ascribeth no good to herself nor
arrogantly presumeth; is not contentious, nor preferreth her own opinion
to others, but in every sense and understanding submitteth herself to
the Eternal wisdom and the Divine judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nature is eager to know secrets and to hear new things; she
loveth to appear abroad, and to make experience of many things through
the senses; she desireth to be acknowledged and to do those things which
win praise and admirations; but Grace careth not to gather up new or
curious things, because all this springeth from the old corruption,
whereas there is nothing new of lasting upon earth. So she teacheth to
restrain the senses, to shun vain complacency and ostentation, to hide
humbly those things which merit praise and real admiration, and from
everything and in all knowledge to seek after useful fruit, and the
praise and honour of God. She desireth not to receive praise for herself
or her own, but longeth that God be blessed in all His gifts, who out of
unmingled love bestoweth all things.”</p></li>
<li><p>This Grace is a supernatural light, and a certain special gift of
God, and the proper mark of the elect, and the pledge of eternal
salvation; it exalteth a man from earthly things to love those that are
heavenly; and it maketh the carnal man spiritual. So far therefore as
Nature is utterly pressed down and overcome, so far is greater Grace
bestowed and the inner man is daily created anew by fresh visitations,
after the image of God.</p></li>
