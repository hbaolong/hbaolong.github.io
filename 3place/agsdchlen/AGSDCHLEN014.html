<h4 id="chapter-xiii-of-resisting-temptation">CHAPTER XIII OF RESISTING
TEMPTATION</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>SO long as we live in the world, we cannot be without trouble and
trial. Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the earth is
a trial. And therefore ought each of us to give heed concerning trials
and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest the devil find occasion to
deceive; for he never sleepeth, but goeth about seeking whom he may
devour. No man is so perfect in holiness that he hath never temptations,
nor can we ever be wholly free from them.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our profit,
even though they be great and hard to bear; for through them we are
humbled, purified instructed. All Saints have passed through much
tribulation and temptation, and have profited thereby. And they who
endured not temptation became reprobate and fell away. There is no
position so sacred, no place so secret, that it is without temptations
and adversities.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he
liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves, in that
we are born in concupiscence. One temptation or sorrow passeth, and
another cometh; and always we shall have somewhat to suffer, for we have
fallen from perfect happiness. Many who seek to fly from temptations
fall yet more deeply into them. By flight alone we cannot overcome, but
by endurance and true humility we are made stronger than all our
enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the root,
shall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to him the more
quickly, and will be the more terrible. Little by little, through
patience and long suffering, thou shalt conquer by the help of God,
rather than violence and thine own strength of will. In the midst of
temptation often seek counsel; and deal not hardly with one who is
tempted, but comfort and strengthen him as thou wouldest have done unto
thyself.</p></li>
<li><p>The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of temper
and want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a helm is tossed
about by the waves, so is a man who is careless and infirm of purpose
tempted, now on this side, now on that. As fire testeth iron, so doth
temptation the upright man. Oftentimes we know not what strength we
have; but temptation revealeth to us what we are. Nevertheless, we must
watch, especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe
the more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within the
mind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked. Wherefore
one saith,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Check the beginnings; once thou might’st have cured,</p>
<p>But now ’tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured.</p>
<p>For first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the strong
imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent. And so little
by little the enemy entereth in altogether, because he was not resisted
at the beginning. And the longer a man delayeth his resistance, the
weaker he groweth, and the stronger groweth the enemy against him.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the beginning
of their conversion, some at the end. Some are sorely tried their whole
life long. Some there are who are tempted but lightly, according to the
wisdom and justice of the ordering of God, who knoweth the character and
circumstances of men, and ordereth all things for the welfare of His
elect.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the
more fervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to help us in
all our tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul saith, with the
temptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it. Let us
therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God in all
temptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt such as are of an
humble spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he
hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue doth
the more appear. Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout and zealous
so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he behave himself
patiently in the time of adversity, then is there hope of great
progress. Some are kept safe from great temptations, but are overtaken
in those which are little and common, that the humiliation may teach
them not to trust to themselves in great things, being weak in small
things.</p></li>
