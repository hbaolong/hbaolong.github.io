<h4 id="chapter-iii-of-the-knowledge-of-truth">CHAPTER III OF THE
KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>HAPPY is the man whom Truth by itself doth teach, not by figures
and transient words, but as it is in itself. Our own judgment and
feelings often deceive us, and we discern but little of the truth. What
doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which
we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not?
Oh, grievous folly, to neglect the things which are profitable and
necessary, and to give our minds to things which are curious and
hurtful! Having eyes, we see not.</p></li>
<li><p>And what have we to do with talk about genus and species! He to
whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from multiplied questionings.
From this One World are all things, and all things speak of Him; and
this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto us. No man without Him
understandeth or rightly judgeth. The man to whom all things are one,
who bringeth all things to one, who seeth all things in one, he is able
to remain steadfast of spirit, and at rest in God. O God, who art the
Truth, make me one with Thee in everlasting love. It wearieth me
oftentimes to read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish
for and desire. Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all creation
keep silence before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.</p></li>
<li><p>The more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself, the more
things and the deeper things he understandeth; and that without labour,
because he receiveth the light of understanding from above. The spirit
which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not distracted though it hath
many works to do, because it doth all things to the honour of God, and
striveth to be free from all thoughts of self-seeking. Who is so full of
hindrance and annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart? A man
who is good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart the
works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the
desires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the judgment of
right reason. Who hath a harder battle to fight than he who striveth for
self-mastery? And this should be our endeavour, even to master self, and
thus daily to grow stronger than self, and go on unto
perfection.</p></li>
<li><p>All perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this life,
and all our power of sight is not without some darkness. A lowly
knowledge of thyself is a surer way to God than the deep searchings of
man’s learning. Not that learning is to be blamed, nor the taking
account of anything that is good; but a good conscience and a holy life
is better than all. And because many seek knowledge rather than good
living, therefore they go astray, and bear little or no fruit.</p></li>
<li><p>O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice
and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain questionings: there
had not been so many evil doings and stumbling-blocks among the laity,
nor such ill living among houses of religion. Of a surety, at the Day of
Judgment it will be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we
have done; not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived.
Tell me, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou knewest
well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished in learning? Their
stalls are now filled by others, who perhaps never have one thought
concerning them. Whilst they lived they seemed to be somewhat, but now
no one speaks of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away! Would that
their life and knowledge had agreed together! For then would they have
read and inquired unto good purpose. How many perish through empty
learning in this world, who care little for serving God. And because
they love to be great more than to be humble, therefore they “have
become vain in their imaginations.” He only is truly great, who hath
great charity. He is truly great who deemeth himself small, and counteth
all height of honour as nothing. He is the truly wise man, who counteth
all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ. And he is the truly
learned man, who doeth the will of God, and forsaketh his own
will.</p></li>
