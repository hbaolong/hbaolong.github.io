id="chapter-xlv-that-we-must-not-believe-everyoneand-that-we-are-prone-to-fall-in-our-words">CHAPTER
XLV THAT WE MUST NOT BELIEVE EVERYONE,AND THAT WE ARE PRONE TO FALL IN
OUR WORDS</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LORD, be thou my help in trouble, for vain is the help of man.
How often have I failed to find faithfulness, where I thought I
possessed it. How many times I have found it where I least expected.
Vain therefore is hope in men, but the salvation of the just, O God, is
in Thee. Blessed be thou, O Lord my God, in all things which happen unto
us. We are weak and unstable, we are quickly deceived and quite
changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the man who is able to keep himself so warily and
circumspectly as not sometimes to come into some snare of perplexity?
But he who trusteth in Thee, O Lord, and seeketh Thee with an unfeigned
heart, doth not so easily slip. And if he fall into any tribulation,
howsoever he may be entangled, yet very quickly he shall be delivered
through Thee, or by Thee shall be comforted, because Thou wilt not
forsake him that trusteth in Thee unto the end. A friend who continueth
faithful in all the distresses of his friend is rare to be found. Thou,
O Lord, Thou alone art most faithful in all things, and there is none
other like unto Thee.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, how truly wise was that holy soul which said, “My mind is
steadfastly fixed, and it is grounded in Christ.” If thus it were with
me, the fear of man should not so easily tempt me, nor the arrows of
words move me. Who is sufficient to foresee all things, who to guard
beforehand against future ills? If even things which are foreseen
sometimes hurt us, what can things which are not foreseen do, but
grievously injure? But wherefore have I not better provided for myself,
miserable that I am? Why, too, have I given such heed to others? But we
are men, nor are we other than frail men, even though by many we are
reckoned and called angels. Whom shall I trust, O Lord, whom shall I
trust but Thee? Thou art the Truth, and deceivest not, nor canst be
deceived. And on the other hand, Every man is a liar, weak, unstable and
frail, especially in his words, so that one ought scarcely ever to
believe what seemeth to sound right on the face of it.</p></li>
<li><p>With what wisdom hast thou warned us beforehand to beware of men,
and that a man’s foes are they of his own household, and that we must
not believe if one say unto us Lo re, or Lo there. I have been taught by
my loss, and O that I may prove move careful and not foolish hereby. “Be
cautious,” saith some one: “be cautious, keep unto thyself what I tell
thee.” And whilst I am silent and believe that it is hid with me, he
himself cannot keep silence concerning it, but straightway betrayeth me
and himself, and goeth his way. Protect me, O Lord, from such
mischief-making and reckless men; let me not fall into their hands, nor
ever do such things myself. Put a true and steadfast word into my mouth,
and remove a deceitful tongue far from me. What I would not suffer, I
ought by all means to beware of doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, how good and peacemaking a thing it is to be silent
concerning others, and not carelessly to believe all reports, nor to
hand them on further; how good also to lay one’s self open to few, to
seek ever to have Thee as the beholder of the heart; not to be carried
about with every wind of words, but to desire that all things inward and
outward be done according to the good pleasure of Thy will! How safe for
the preserving of heavenly grace to fly from human approval, and not to
long after the things which seem to win admiration abroad, but to follow
with all earnestness those things which bring amendment of life and
heavenly fervour! How many have been injured by their virtue being made
known and too hastily praised. How truly profitable hath been grace
preserved in silence in this frail life, which, as we are told, is all
temptation and warfare.</p></li>
