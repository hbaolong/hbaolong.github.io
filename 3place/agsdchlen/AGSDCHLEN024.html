<h4 id="chapter-xxiii-of-meditation-upon-death">CHAPTER XXIII OF
MEDITATION UPON DEATH</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>VERY quickly will there be an end of thee here; take heed
therefore how it will be with thee in another world. To-day man is, and
to-morrow he will be seen no more. And being removed out of sight,
quickly also he is out of mind. O the dulness and hardness of man’s
heart, which thinketh only of the present, and looketh not forward to
the future. Thou oughtest in every deed and thought so to order thyself,
as if thou wert to die this day. If thou hadst a good conscience thou
wouldst not greatly fear death. It were better for thee to watch against
sin, than to fly from death. If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt
thou be ready to-morrow? To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest
thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow?</p></li>
<li><p>What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little? Ah!
long life doth not always amend, but often the more increaseth guilt. Oh
that we might spend a single day in this world as it ought to be spent!
Many there are who reckon the years since they were converted, and yet
oftentimes how little is the fruit thereof. If it is a fearful thing to
die, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long. Happy is
the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and daily
prepareth himself to die. If thou hast ever seen one die, consider that
thou also shalt pass away by the same road.</p></li>
<li><p>When it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see the
evening, and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the morrow. Always
be thou prepared, and so live that death may never find thee unprepared.
Many die suddenly and unexpectedly. For at such an hour as ye think not,
the Son of Man cometh. When that last hour shall come, thou wilt begin
to think very differently of thy whole life past, and wilt mourn
bitterly that thou hast been so negligent and slothful.</p></li>
<li><p>Happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he
would fain be found in death! For a perfect contempt of the world, a
fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of discipline, the
painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey, denial of self, submission
to any adversity for love of Christ; these are the things which shall
give great confidence of a happy death. Whilst thou art in health thou
hast many opportunities of good works; but when thou art in sickness I
know not how much thou wilt be able to do. Few are made better by
infirmity: even as they who wander much a broad seldom become
holy.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of thy
salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than thou
thinkest. It is better for thee now to provide in time, and to send some
good before thee, than to trust to the help of others. If thou art not
anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest thou, will be anxious for thee
afterwards? Now the time is most precious. Now is the accepted time, now
is the day of salvation. But, alas! that thou spendest not well this
time, wherein thou mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee
everlastingly. The hour will come when thou shalt desire one day, yea,
one hour, for amendment of life, and I know not whether thou shalt
obtain.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free thyself,
from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live in fear, and in
expectation of death! Strive now to live in such wise that in the hour
of death thou mayest rather rejoice than fear. Learn now to die to the
world, so shalt thou begin to live with Christ. Learn now to contemn all
earthly things, and then mayest thou freely go unto Christ. Keep under
thy body by penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure
confidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Ah, foolish one! why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long,
when thou art not sure of a single day? How many have been deceived, and
suddenly have been snatched away from the body! How many times hast thou
heard how one was slain by the sword, another was drowned, another
falling from on high broke his neck, another died at the table, another
whilst at play! One died by fire, another by the sword, another by the
pestilence, another by the robber. Thus cometh death to all, and the
life of men swiftly passeth away like a shadow.</p></li>
<li><p>Who will remember thee after thy death? And who will entreat for
thee? Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou canst. For
thou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall happen unto thee
after death. While thou hast time, lay up for thyself undying riches
Think of nought but of thy salvation; care only for the things of God.
Make to thyself friends, by venerating the saints of God walking in
their steps, that when thou failest, thou mayest be received into
everlasting habitations.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to whom
the things of the world appertain not. Keep thine heart free, and lifted
up towards God, for here have we no continuing city. To Him direct thy
daily prayers with crying and tears, that thy spirit may be found worthy
to pass happily after death unto its Lord. Amen.</p></li>
