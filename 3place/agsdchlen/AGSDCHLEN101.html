IV THAT MANY GOOD GIFTS ARE BESTOWED UPON THOSE WHO COMMUNICATE
DEVOUTLY</h4>
<p>The Voice of the Disciple</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>O LORD my God, prevent Thou Thy servant with the blessings of Thy
sweetness, that I may be enabled to draw near worthily and devoutly to
Thy glorious Sacrament. Awaken my heart towards Thee, and deliver me
from heavy slumber. Visit me with Thy salvation that I may in spirit
taste Thy sweetness, which plentifully leith hid in this Sacrament as in
a fountain. Lighten also mine eyes to behold this so great mystery, and
strengthen me that I may believe it with undoubting faith. For it is Thy
word, not human power; it is Thy holy institution, not the invention of
man. For no man is found fit in himself to receive and to understand
these things, which transcend even the wisdom of the Angels. What
portion then shall I, unworthy sinner, who am but dust and ashes, be
able to search into and comprehend of so deep a Sacrament?</p></li>
<li><p>O Lord, in the simplicity of my heart, in good and firm faith,
and according to Thy will, I draw nigh unto Thee with hope and
reverence, and truly believe that Thou art here present in the
Sacrament, God and man. Thou willest therefore that I receive Thee and
unite myself to Thee in charity. Wherefore I beseech Thy mercy, and
implore Thee to give me Thy special grace, to this end, that I may be
wholly dissolved and overflow with love towards Thee, and no more suffer
any other consolation to enter into me. For this most high and most
glorious Sacrament is the health of the soul and the body, the medicine
of all spiritual sickness, whereby I am healed of my sins, my passions
are bridled, temptations are conquered or weakened, more grace is poured
into me, virtue begun is increased, faith is made firm, hope is
strengthened, and charity is enkindled and enlarged.</p></li>
<li><p>For in this Sacrament Thou hast bestowed many good things and
still bestowest them continually on Thine elect who communicate
devoutly, O my God, Lifter up of my soul, Repairer of human infirmity,
and Giver of all inward consolation. For Thou pourest into them much
consolation against all sorts of tribulation, and out of the deep of
their own misery Thou liftest them up to the hope of Thy protection, and
with ever new grace, dost inwardly refresh and enlighten them; so that
they who felt themselves to be anxious and without affection before
Communion, afterwards being refreshed with heavenly food and drink, find
themselves changed for the better. And even in such wise Thou dealest
severally with Thine elect, that they may truly acknowledge and clearly
make proof that they have nothing whatsoever of their own, and what
goodness and grace come to them from Thee; because being in themselves
cold, hard of heart, indevout, through Thee they become fervent,
zealous, and devout. For who is there coming humbly to the fountain of
sweetness, carrieth not away thence at the least some little of that
sweetness? Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a
little of its heat? And Thou art ever a full and overflowing fountain, a
fire continually burning, and never going out.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherefore if it is not suffered to me to draw from the fullness
of the fountain, nor to drink unto satisfying, yet will I set my lips to
the mouth of the heavenly conduit, that at least I may receive a small
drop to quench my thirst, that I dry not up within my heart. And if I am
not yet able to be altogether heavenly and so enkindled as the Cherubim
and Seraphim, yet will I endeavour to give myself unto devotion, and to
prepare my heart, that I may gain if it be but a little flame of the
divine fire, through the humble receiving of the life-giving Sacrament.
But whatsoever is wanting unto me, O merciful Jesus, Most Holy Saviour,
do Thou of Thy kindness and grace supply, who hast vouchsafed to call
all unto Thee, saying, Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy
laden, and I will refresh you.</p></li>
<li><p>I indeed labour in the sweat of my face, I am tormented with
sorrow of heart, I am burdened with sins, I am disquieted with
temptations, I am entangled and oppressed with many passions, and there
is none to help me, there is none to deliver and ease me, but Thou, O
Lord God, my Saviour, to whom I commit myself and all things that are
mine, that Thou mayest preserve me and lead me unto life
eternal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Receive me unto the praise and glory of Thy name, who hast prepared
Thy Body and Blood to be my meat and drink. Grant, O Lord God my
Saviour, that with coming often to Thy mysteries the zeal of my devotion
may increase.</p>
