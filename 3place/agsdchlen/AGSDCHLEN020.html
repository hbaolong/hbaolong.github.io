<h4 id="chapter-xix-of-the-exercises-of-a-religious-man">CHAPTER XIX OF
THE EXERCISES OF A RELIGIOUS MAN</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THE Life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues,
that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men. And verily
it should be yet better within than without, for God is a discerner of
our heart, Whom we must reverence with all our hearts wheresoever we
are, and walk pure in His presence as do the angels. We ought daily to
renew our vows, and to kindle our hearts to zeal, as if each day were
the first day of our conversion, and to say, “Help me, O God, in my good
resolutions, and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may make
a good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!”</p></li>
<li><p>According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress, and
much diligence is needful for him who would make good progress. For if
he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with
him who resolveth rarely or feebly? But manifold causes bring about
abandonment of our resolution, yet a trivial omission of holy exercises
can hardly be made without some loss to us. The resolution of the
righteous dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own
wisdom; for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in
hand. For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a man is not
in himself.</p></li>
<li><p>If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some act
of piety, or of some brotherly kindness, it can easily be taken up
afterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or slothfulness,
then is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt. Strive as earnestly as
we may, we shall still fall short in many things. Always should some
distinct resolution be made by us; and, most of all, we must strive
against those sins which most easily beset us. Both our outer and inner
life should be straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to
do with our progress.</p></li>
<li><p>If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at
certain seasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at
morning. In the morning make thy resolves, and in the evening inquire
into thy life, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed, and thought; for
in these ways thou hast often perchance offended God and thy neighbour.
Gird up thy loins like a man against the assaults of the devil; bridle
thine appetite, and thou wilt soon be able to bridle every inclination
of the flesh. Be thou never without something to do; be reading, or
writing, or praying, or meditating, or doing something that is useful to
the community. Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with
discretion, nor are they to be used by all alike.</p></li>
<li><p>The duties which are not common to all must not be done openly,
but are safest carried on in secret. But take heed that thou be not
careless in the common duties, and more devout in the secret; but
faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and commands which lie upon
thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still leisure, give thyself to
thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee. All cannot have one exercise, but
one suiteth better to this man and another to that. Even for the
diversity of season different exercises are needed, some suit better for
feasts, some for fasts. We need one kind in time of temptations and
others in time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times of
sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord.</p></li>
<li><p>When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises
should be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently besought.
We ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to another, as if each
were the period of our departure from this world, and of entering into
the eternal feast. So ought we to prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn
seasons, and the more solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch
upon each holy observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward
of our labours at the hand of God.</p></li>
<li><p>And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet
ill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be revealed
in us at the appointed season; and let us study to prepare ourselves the
better for our end. Blessed is that servant, as the Evangelist Luke hath
it, whom, when the Lord cometh He shall find watching. Verily I say unto
you He will make him ruler over all that He hath.</p></li>
