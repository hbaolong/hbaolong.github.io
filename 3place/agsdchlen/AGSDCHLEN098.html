id="chapter-i-with-how-great-reverence-christ-must-be-received">CHAPTER
I WITH HOW GREAT REVERENCE CHRIST MUST BE RECEIVED</h4>
<p>The Voice of the Disciple</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THESE are Thy words, O Christ, Eternal Truth; though not uttered
at one time nor written together in one place of Scripture. Because
therefore they are Thy words and true, I must gratefully and faithfully
receive them all. They are Thine, and Thou hast uttered them; and they
are mine also, because Thou didst speak them for my salvation. Gladly I
received them from Thy mouth, that they may be more deeply implanted in
my heart. Words of such great grace arouse me, for they are full of
sweetness and love; but my own sins terrify me, and my impure conscience
driveth me away from receiving so great mysteries. The sweetness of Thy
words encourageth me, but the multitude of my faults presseth me
down.</p></li>
<li><p>Thou commandest that I draw near to Thee with firm confidence, if
I would have part with Thee, and that I receive the food of immorality,
if I desire to obtain eternal life and glory. Come unto Me, sayest Thou,
all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Oh, sweet
and lovely word in the ear of the sinner, that Thou, O Lord my God, dost
invite the poor and needy to the Communion of Thy most holy body and
blood. But who am I, O Lord, that I should presume to approach unto
Thee? Behold the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee, and yet Thou
sayest, Come ye all unto Me.</p></li>
<li><p>What meaneth this most gracious condescension, this most lovely
invitation? How shall I dare to come, who know no good thing of myself,
whence I might be able to presume? How shall I bring Thee within my
house, seeing that I so often have sinned in Thy most loving sight?
Angels and Archangels stand in awe of Thee, the Saints and just men fear
Thee, and Thou sayest, Come unto Me! Except Thou, Lord, hadst said it,
who should believe it true? And except Thou hadst commanded, who should
attempt to draw near?</p></li>
<li><p>Behold, Noah, that just man, laboured for a hundred years in
building the ark, that he might be saved with the few; and I, how shall
I be able in one hour to prepare myself to receive the Builder of the
world with reverence? Moses, Thy servant, Thy great and especial friend,
made an ark of incorruptible wood, which also he covered with purest
gold, that he might lay up in it the tables of the law, and I, a
corruptible creature, shall I dare thus easily to receive Thee, the
Maker of the Law and the Giver of life? Solomon, the wisest of the kings
of Israel, was seven years building his magnificent temple to the praise
of Thy Name, and for eight days celebrated the feast of its dedication,
offered a thousand peace offerings, and solemnly brought up the Ark of
the Covenant to the place prepared for it, with the sound of trumpets
and great joy, and I, unhappy and poorest of mankind, how shall I bring
Thee into my house, who scarce know how to spend half and hour in
devotion? And oh that it were even one half hour worthily
spent!</p></li>
<li><p>O my God, how earnestly these holy men strove to please Thee! And
alas! how little and trifling is that which I do! how short a time do I
spend, when I am disposing myself to Communion. Rarely altogether
collected, most rarely cleansed from all distraction. And surely in the
saving presence of Thy Godhead no unmeet thought ought to intrude, nor
should any creature take possession of me, because it is not an Angel
but the Lord of the Angels, that I am about to receive as my
Guest.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet there is a vast difference between the Ark of the Covenant
with its relics, and Thy most pure Body with its ineffable virtues,
between those sacrifices of the law, which were figures of things to
come, and the true sacrifice of Thy Body, the completion of all the
ancient sacrifices.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherefore then do I not yearn more ardently after Thy adorable
presence? Why do I not prepare myself with greater solicitude to receive
Thy holy things, when those holy Patriarchs and Prophets of old, kings
also and princes, with the whole people, manifested so great affection
of devotion towards Thy Divine Service?</p></li>
<li><p>The most devout king David danced with all his might before the
Ark of God, calling to mind the benefits granted to his forefathers in
days past; he fashioned musical instruments of various sorts, put forth
Psalms, and appointed them to be sung with joy, played also himself
ofttimes on the harp, being inspired with the grace of the Holy Ghost;
he taught the people of Israel to praise God with the whole heart, and
with unity of voice to bless and praise Him every day. If so great
devotion was then exercised, and celebration of divine praise was
carried on before the Ark of the Testimony, how great reverence and
devotion ought now to be shown by me and all Christian people at the
ministering of the Sacrament, at receiving the most precious Body and
Blood of Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Many run to diverse places to visit the memorial of departed
Saints, and rejoice to hear of their deeds and to look upon the
beautiful buildings of their shrines. And behold, Thou art present here
with me, O my God, Saint of Saints, Creator of men and Lord of the
Angels. Often in looking at those memorials men are moved by curiosity
and novelty, and very little fruit of amendment is borne away,
especially when there is so much careless trifling and so little true
contrition. But here in the Sacrament of the Altar, Thou art present
altogether, My God, the Man Christ Jesus; where also abundant fruit of
eternal life is given to every one soever that receiveth Thee worthily
and devoutly. But to this no levity draweth, no curiosity, nor
sensuality, only steadfast faith, devout hope, and sincere
charity.</p></li>
<li><p>O God, invisible Creator of the world, how wondrously dost Thou
work with us, how sweetly and graciously Thou dealest with Thine elect,
to whom Thou offerest Thyself to be received in this Sacrament! For this
surpasseth all understanding, this specially draweth the hearts of the
devout and enkindleth their affections. For even thy true faithful ones
themselves, who order their whole life to amendment, oftentimes gain
from this most excellent Sacrament great grace of devotion and love of
virtue.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh admirable and hidden grace of the Sacrament, which only
Christ’s faithful ones know, but the faithless and those who serve sin
cannot experience! In this Sacrament is conferred spiritual grace, and
lost virtue is regained in the soul, and the beauty which was disfigured
by sin returneth again. So great sometimes is this grace that out of the
fullness of devotion given, not only the mind but also the weak body
feeleth that more strength is supplied unto it.</p></li>
<li><p>But greatly must we mourn and lament over our lukewarmness and
negligence, that we are not drawn by greater affection to become
partakers of Christ, in whom all the hope and the merit of those that
are to be saved consist. For He Himself is our sanctification and
redemption. He is the consolation of pilgrims and the eternal fruition
of the Saints. Therefore it is grievously to be lamented that many so
little consider this health-giving mystery, which maketh heaven glad and
preserveth the whole world. Alas for the blindness and hardness of man’s
heart, that he considereth not more this unspeakable gift, and even
slippeth down through the daily use, into carelessness.</p></li>
<li><p>For if this most holy Sacrament were celebrated in one place
only, and were consecrated only by one priest in the whole world, with
what great desire thinkest thou, would men be affected towards that
place and towards such a priest of God, that they might behold the
divine mysteries celebrated? But now are many men made priests and in
many places the Sacrament is celebrated, that the grace and love of God
towards men might the more appear, the more widely the Holy Communion is
spread abroad over all the world. Thanks be unto Thee, O good Jesus,
Eternal Shepherd, who hast vouchsafed to refresh us, poor and exiled
ones, with Thy precious Body and Blood, and to invite us to partake
these holy mysteries by the invitation from Thine own mouth, saying,
Come unto Me, ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh
you.</p></li>
