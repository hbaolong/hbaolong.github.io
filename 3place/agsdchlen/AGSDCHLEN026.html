<h4 id="chapter-xxv-of-the-zealous-amendment-of-our-whole-life">CHAPTER
XXV OF THE ZEALOUS AMENDMENT OF OUR WHOLE LIFE</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>BE thou watchful and diligent in God’s service, and bethink thee
often why thou hast renounced the world. Was it not that thou mightest
live to God and become a spiritual man? Be zealous, therefore, for thy
spiritual profit, for thou shalt receive shortly the reward of thy
labours, and neither fear nor sorrow shall come any more into thy
borders. Now shalt thou labour a little, and thou shalt find great rest,
yea everlasting joy. If thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in
labour, doubt not that God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding
thee. It is thy duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the
victory, but thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful
or lifted up.</p></li>
<li><p>A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed about
between hope and fear, and being on a certain day overwhelmed with
grief, cast himself down in prayer before the altar in a church, and
meditated within himself, saying, “Oh! if I but knew that I should still
persevere,” and presently heard within him a voice from God, “And if
thou didst know it, what wouldst thou do? Do now what thou wouldst do
then, and thou shalt be very secure.” And straightway being comforted
and strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the
perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to search
curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but studied rather
to inquire what was the good and acceptable will of God, for the
beginning and perfecting of every good work.</p></li>
<li><p>Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell in
the land and thou shalt be fed with its riches. One thing there is which
holdeth back many from progress and fervent amendment, even the dread of
difficulty, or the labour of the conflict. Nevertheless they advance
above all others in virtue who strive manfully to conquer those things
which are most grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth
most and meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and
mortifieth himself in spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to mortify,
yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit, although he have
stronger passions, than another who is more temperate of disposition,
but is withal less fervent in the pursuit of virtue. Two things
specially avail unto improvement in holiness, namely firmness to
withdraw ourselves from the sin to which by nature we are most inclined,
and earnest zeal for that good in which we are most lacking. And strive
also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which
displease thee most frequently in others.</p></li>
<li><p>Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever
thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them, but
where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed that thou do
not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it, strive quickly to
amend thyself. As thine eye observeth others, so again are the eyes of
others upon thee. How sweet and pleasant is it to see zealous and godly
brethren temperate and of good discipline; and how sad is it and
grievous to see them walking disorderly, not practising the duties to
which they are called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose
of their calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none
of their business.</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set
always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified. Truly oughtest thou
to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of Jesus Christ, because
thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform thyself more unto Him, though
thou hast been a long time in the way of God. A religious man who
exercises himself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and
passion of our Lord shall find there abundantly all things that are
profitable and necessary for him, neither is there need that he shall
seek anything better beyond Jesus. Oh! if Jesus crucified would come
into our hearts, how quickly, and completely should we have learned all
that we need to know!</p></li>
<li><p>He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that are
laid upon him. He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble upon
trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he is without
inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that which is outward. He
who is living without discipline is exposed to grievous ruin. He who
seeketh easier and lighter discipline shall always be in distress,
because one thing or another will give him displeasure.</p></li>
<li><p>O! If no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God
with our whole heart and voice! Oh! if thou never hadst need to eat or
drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and to give thyself
to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou be far happier than
now, when for so many necessities thou must serve the flesh. O! that
these necessities were not, but only the spiritual refreshments of the
soul, which alas we taste too seldom.</p></li>
<li><p>When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no
created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then also will
he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto him. Then will he
neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for little, but he committeth
himself altogether and with full trust unto God, who is all in all to
him, to whom nothing perisheth nor dieth, but all things live to Him and
obey His every word without delay.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost
returneth not. Without care and diligence thou shalt never get virtue.
If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill with thee, but
if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find much peace, and shalt
find thy labour the lighter because of the grace of God and the love of
virtue. A zealous and diligent man is ready for all things. It is
greater labour to resist sins and passions than to toil in bodily
labours. He who shunneth not small faults falleth little by little into
greater. At eventide thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day
profitably. Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and
howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more violence thou
dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit Amen.</p></li>
