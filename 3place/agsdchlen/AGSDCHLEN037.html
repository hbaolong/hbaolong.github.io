id="chapter-xi-of-the-fewness-of-those-who-love-the-gross-of-jesus">CHAPTER
XI OF THE FEWNESS OF THOSE WHO LOVE THE GROSS OF JESUS</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>JESUS hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers
of His Cross. He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of tribulation.
He findeth many companions of His table, but few of His fasting. All
desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to undergo anything for His
sake. Many follow Jesus that they may eat of His loaves, but few that
they may drink of the cup of His passion. Many are astonished at His
Miracles, few follow after the shame of His Cross. Many love Jesus so
long as no adversities happen to them. Many praise Him and bless Him, so
long as they receive any comforts from Him. But if Jesus hide Himself
and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either into complaining
or into too great dejection of mind.</p></li>
<li><p>But they who love Jesus for Jesus’ sake, and not for any
consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and anguish of
heart as in the highest consolation. And if He should never give them
consolation, nevertheless they would always praise Him and always give
Him thanks.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any gain
or love of self! Should not all they be called mercenary who are always
seeking consolations? Do they not prove themselves lovers of self more
than of Christ who are always seeking their own gain and advantage?
Where shall be found one who is willing to serve God altogether for
nought?</p></li>
<li><p>Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all
selfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit and free
of all created things? “His value is from afar, yea from the ends of the
earth.” A man may give away all his goods, yet that is nothing; and if
he do many deeds of penitence, yet that is a small thing; and though he
understand all knowledge, yet that is afar off; and if he have great
virtue and zealous devotion, yet much is lacking unto him, yea, one
thing which is the most necessary to him of all. What is it then? That
having given up all things besides, he give up himself and go forth from
himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and having done all
things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he feel that he hath
done nothing. Let him not reckon that much which might be much esteemed,
but let him pronounce himself to be in truth an unprofitable servant, as
the Truth Himself saith, When ye have done all things that are commanded
you, say, we are unprofitable servants. Then may he be truly poor and
naked in spirit, and be able to say with the Prophet, As for me, I am
poor and needy. Nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man stronger,
no man freer. For he knoweth both how to give up himself and all things,
and how to be lowly in his own eyes.</p></li>
