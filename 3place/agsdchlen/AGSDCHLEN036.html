<h4 id="chapter-x-of-gratitude-for-the-grace-of-god">CHAPTER X OF
GRATITUDE FOR THE GRACE OF GOD</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>WHY seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour? Prepare
thyself for patience more than for comforts, and for bearing the cross
more than for joy. For who among the men of this world would not gladly
receive consolation and spiritual joy if he might always have it? For
spiritual comforts exceed all the delights of the world, and all the
pleasures of the flesh. For all worldly delights are either empty or
unclean, whilst spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable,
the offspring of virtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds. But no
man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own will, because the
season of temptation ceaseth not for long.</p></li>
<li><p>Great is the difference between a visitation from above and false
liberty of spirit and great confidence in self. God doeth well in giving
us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not immediately giving God
thanks thereof. And thus the gifts of grace are not able to flow unto
us, because we are ungrateful to the Author of them, and return them out
wholly to the Fountain whence they flow. For grace ever becometh the
portion of him who is grateful and that is taken away from the proud,
which is wont to be given to the humble.</p></li>
<li><p>I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction, I
love no contemplation which leadeth to pride. For all that is high is
not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every desire is not
pure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing unto God. Willingly
do I accept that grace whereby I am made humbler and more wary and more
ready to renounce myself. He who is made learned by the gift of grace
and taught wisdom by the stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not dare
to claim any good thing for himself, but will rather confess that he is
poor and needy. Give unto God the thing which is God’s, and ascribe to
thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God for His
grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy punishment
is deserved for thy fault.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be given
the highest place. For the highest cannot be without the lowest. For the
highest saints of God are least in their own sight, and the more
glorious they are, so much the lowlier are they in themselves; full of
grace and heavenly glory, they are not desirous of vainglory; resting on
God and strong in His might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise. And
they who ascribe unto God all the good which they have received, “seek
not glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God only,” and
they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all His Saints
above all things, and they are always striving for this very
thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt be
worthy to receive greater. Let the least be unto thee even as the
greatest, and let that which is of little account be unto thee as a
special gift. If the majesty of the Giver be considered, nothing that is
given shall seem small and of no worth, for that is not a small thing
which is given by the Most High God. Yea, though He gave punishment and
stripes, we ought to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit
whatever He suffereth to come upon us. He who seeketh to retain the
favour of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and
patient in respect of that which is taken away. Let him pray that it may
return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it not.</p></li>
