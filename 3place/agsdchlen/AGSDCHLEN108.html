XI THAT THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST AND THE HOLY SCRIPTURES ARE MOST
NECESSARY TO A FAITHFUL SOUL</h4>
<p>The Voice of the Disciple</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>O MOST sweet Lord Jesus, how great is the blessedness of the
devout soul that feedeth with Thee in Thy banquet, where there is set
before it no other food than Thyself its only Beloved, more to be
desired than all the desires of the heart? And to me it would verily be
sweet to pour forth my tears in Thy presence from the very bottom of my
heart, and with the pious Magdalene to water Thy feet with my tears. But
where is this devotion? Where the abundant flowing of holy tears? Surely
in Thy presence and in the presence of the holy Angels my whole heart
ought to burn and to weep for joy; for I have Thee in the Sacrament
verily present, although hidden under other form.</p></li>
<li><p>For in Thine own Divine brightness, mine eyes could not endure to
behold Thee, neither could the whole world stand before the splendour of
the glory of Thy Majesty. In this therefore Thou hast consideration unto
my weakness, that Thou hidest Thyself under the Sacrament. I verily
possess and adore Him whom the Angels adore in heaven; I yet for a while
by faith, but they by sight and without a veil. It is good for me to be
content with the light of true faith, and to walk therein until the day
of eternal brightness dawn, and the shadows of figures flee away. But
when that which is perfect is come, the using of Sacraments shall cease,
because the Blessed in heavenly glory have no need of Sacramental
remedy. For they rejoice unceasingly in the presence of God, beholding
His glory face to face, and being changed from glory to glory of the
infinite God, they taste the Word of God made flesh, as He was in the
beginning and remaineth for everlasting.</p></li>
<li><p>When I think on these wondrous things, even spiritual comfort
whatsoever it be becometh sore weariness to me; for so long as I see not
openly my Lord in His own Glory, I count for nothing all which I behold
and hear in the world. Thou, O God, art my witness that nothing is able
to comfort me, no creature is able to give me rest, save Thou, O my God,
whom I desire to contemplate everlastingly. But this is not possible, so
long as I remain in this mortal state. Therefore ought I to set myself
unto great patience, and submit myself unto Thee in every desire. For
even Thy Saints, O Lord, who now rejoice with Thee in the kingdom of
heaven, waited for the coming of Thy glory whilst they lived here, in
faith and great glory. What they believed, that believe I; what they
hoped, I hope; whether they have attained to, thither through Thy grace
hope I to come. I will walk meanwhile in faith, strengthened by the
examples of the Saints. I will have also holy books for comfort and for
a mirror of life, and above them all Thy most holy Body and Blood shall
be for me a special remedy and refuge.</p></li>
<li><p>For two things do I feel to be exceedingly necessary to me in
this life, without which this miserable life would be intolerable to me;
being detained in the prison of this body, I confess that I need two
things, even food and light. Thou hast therefore given to me who am so
weak, Thy sacred Body and Blood, for the refreshing of my soul and body,
and hast set Thy Word for a lantern to my feet. Without these two I
could not properly live; for the Word of God is the light of my soul,
and Thy Sacrament the bread of life. These may also be called the two
tables, placed on this side and on that, in the treasury of Thy holy
Church. One table is that of the Sacred Altar, bearing the holy bread,
that is the precious Body and Blood of Christ; the other is the table of
the Divine Law, containing holy doctrine, teaching the true faith, and
leading steadfastly onwards even to that which is within the veil, where
the Holy of Holies is.</p></li>
<li><p>Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, Light of Light everlasting,
for that table of holy doctrine which Thou has furnished unto us by Thy
servants the Prophets and Apostles and other teachers. Thanks be to
Thee, O Creator and Redeemer of men, who to make known Thy love to the
whole world has prepared a great supper, in which Thou hast set forth
for good not the typical lamb, but Thine own most Holy Body and Blood;
making all Thy faithful ones joyful with this holy banquet and giving
them to drink the cup of salvation, wherein are all the delights of
Paradise, and the holy Angels do feed with us, and with yet happier
sweetness.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh how great and honourable is the office of the priests, to whom
it is given to consecrate the Sacrament of the Lord of majesty with holy
words, to bless it with the lips, to hold it in their hands, to receive
it with their own mouth, and to administer it to others! Oh how clean
ought those hands to be, how pure the mouth, how holy the body, how
unspotted the heart of the priest, to whom so often the Author of purity
entereth in! From the mouth of the priest ought naught to proceed but
what is holy, what is honest and profitable, because he so often
receiveth the Sacrament of Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>His eyes ought to be single and pure, seeing they are wont to
look upon the Body of Christ; the hands should be pure and lifted
towards heaven, which are wont to hold within them the Creator of heaven
and earth. To priests is it specially said in the Law, Be ye holy, for I
the Lord your God am holy.</p></li>
<li><p>Assist us with Thy grace, O Almighty God, that we who have taken
upon us the priestly office, may be able to converse worthily and
devoutly with Thee in all purity and good conscience. And if we are not
able to have our conversation in such innocency of life as we ought, yet
grant unto us worthily to lament the sins which we have committed, and
in the spirit of humility and full purpose of a good will, to serve Thee
more earnestly for the future.</p></li>
