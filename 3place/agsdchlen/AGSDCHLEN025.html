id="chapter-xxiv-of-the-judgment-and-punishment-of-the-wicked">CHAPTER
XXIV OF THE JUDGMENT AND PUNISHMENT OF THE WICKED</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>IN all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand
before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not bribed with
gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge righteous judgment. O most
miserable and foolish sinner, who art sometimes in fear of the
countenance of an angry man, what wilt thou answer to God, who knoweth
all thy misdeeds? Why dost thou not provide for thyself against the day
of judgment, when no man shall be able to be excused or defended by
means of another, but each one shall bear his burden himself alone? Now
doth thy labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy
groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to thy
soul.</p></li>
<li><p>Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of
purifying his soul. When suffering injuries he grieveth more for the
other’s malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth heartily for
those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them from his heart; when
he is not slow to ask pardon from others; when he is swifter to pity
than to anger; when he frequently denieth himself and striveth
altogether to subdue the flesh to the spirit. Better is it now to purify
the soul from sin, than to cling to sins from which we must be purged
hereafter. Truly we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we
bear towards the flesh.</p></li>
<li><p>What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins? The more
thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy shall thy
punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up for the burning.
For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he be the more heavily
punished. There shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning
goads, and the gluttons be tormented with intolerable hunger and thirst.
There shall the luxurious and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into
burning pitch and stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like
mad dogs for very grief.</p></li>
<li><p>No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own
proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter confusion, and
the covetous shall be pinched with miserable poverty. An hour’s pain
there shall be more grievous than a hundred years here of the bitterest
penitence. No quiet shall be there, no comfort for the lost, though here
sometimes there is respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of
friends. Be thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day
of judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed. For then shall
the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as
have afflicted him and made no account of his labours. Then shall he
stand up to judge, he who now submitteth himself in humility to the
judgments of men. Then shall the poor and humble man have great
confidence, while the proud is taken with fear on every side.</p></li>
<li><p>Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world who
learned to be a fool and despised for Christ. Then shall all tribulation
patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the ungodly shall be
stopped. Then shall every godly man rejoice, and every profane man shall
mourn. Then the afflicted flesh shall more rejoice than if it had been
always nourished in delights. Then the humble garment shall put on
beauty, and the precious robe shall hide itself as vile. Then the little
poor cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace. Then
enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the world.
Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than all worldly
wisdom.</p></li>
<li><p>Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than learned
philosophy. Then contempt of riches shall have more weight than all the
treasure of the children of this world. Then shalt thou find more
comfort in having prayed devoutly than in having fared sumptuously. Then
thou wilt rather rejoice in having kept silence than in having made long
speech. Then holy deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words. Then
a strict life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all
earthly delight. Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou mayest be
enabled to escape heavier sufferings. Prove first here, what thou art
able to endure hereafter. If now thou art able to bear so little, how
wilt thou be able to endure eternal torments? If now a little suffering
maketh thee so impatient, what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a
surety thou art not able to have two Paradise, to take thy fill or
delight here in this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and
pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to thee in
an instant? All therefore is vanity, save to love God and to serve Him
only. For he who loveth God with all his heart feareth not death, nor
punishment, nor judgment, nor hell, because perfect love giveth sure
access to God. But he who still delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is
afraid of death and judgment. Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love
as yet cannot restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell
should hold thee back. But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot
long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of the
devil.</p></li>
