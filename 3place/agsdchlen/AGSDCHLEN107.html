id="chapter-x-that-holy-communion-is-not-lightly-to-be-omitted">CHAPTER
X THAT HOLY COMMUNION IS NOT LIGHTLY TO BE OMITTED</h4>
<p>The Voice of the Beloved</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>THOU must frequently betake thee to the Fountain of grace and
divine mercy, to the Fountain of goodness and all purity; to the end
that thou mayest obtain the healing of thy passions and vices, and
mayest be made stronger and more watchful against all temptations and
wiles of the devil. The enemy, knowing what profit and exceeding strong
remedy lieth in the Holy Communion, striveth by all means and occasions
to draw back and hinder the faithful and devout, so far as he
can.</p></li>
<li><p>For when some set about to prepare themselves for Holy Communion,
they suffer from the more evil suggestions of Satan. The very evil
spirit himself (as is written in Job), cometh among the sons of God that
he may trouble them by his accustomed evil dealing, or make them over
timid and perplexed; to the intent that he may diminish their
affections, or take away their faith by his attacks, if haply he may
prevail upon them to give up Holy Communion altogether, or to come
thereto with lukewarm hearts. But his wiles and delusions must not be
heeded, howsoever wicked and terrible they be; but all his delusion must
be cast back upon his own head. The wretch must be despised and laughed
to scorn: neither must holy Communion be omitted because of his insults
and the inward troubles which he stirreth up.</p></li>
<li><p>Often also too much carefulness or some anxiety or other touching
confession hindereth from obtaining devotion. Do thou according to the
counsel of wise men, and lay aside anxiety and scruple, because it
hindereth the grace of God and destroyeth devotion of mind. Because of
some little vexation or trouble do not thou neglect holy Communion, but
rather hasten to confess it, and forgive freely all offences committed
against thee. And if thou hast offended any man, humbly beg for pardon,
and God shall freely forgive thee.</p></li>
<li><p>What profiteth it to put off for long time the confession of thy
sins, or to defer Holy Communion? Cleanse thyself forthwith, spit out
the poison with all speed, hasten to take the remedy, and thou shalt
feel thyself better than if thou didst long defer it. If to-day thou
defer it on one account, to-morrow perchance some greater obstacle will
come, and so thou mayest be long time hindered from Communion and become
more unfit. As soon as thou canst, shake thyself from thy present
heaviness and sloth, for it profiteth nothing to be long anxious, to go
long on thy way with heaviness of heart, and because of daily little
obstacles to sever thyself from divine things: nay it is exceeding
hurtful to defer thy Communion long, for this commonly bringeth on great
torpor. Alas! there are some, lukewarm and undisciplined, who willingly
find excuses for delaying repentance, and desire to defer Holy
Communion, lest they should be bound to keep stricter watch upon
themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Alas! how little charity, what flagging devotion, have they who
so lightly put off Holy Communion. How happy is he, how acceptable to
God, who so liveth, and in such purity of conscience keepeth himself,
that any day he could be ready and well inclined to communicate, if it
were in his power, and might be done without the notice of others. If a
man sometimes abstaineth for the sake of humility or some sound, cause
he is to be commended for his reverence. But if drowsiness have taken
hold of him, he ought to rouse himself and to do what in him lieth; and
the Lord will help his desire for the good will which he hath, which God
specially approveth.</p></li>
<li><p>But when he is hindered by sufficient cause, yet will he ever
have a good will and pious intention to communicate; and so he shall not
be lacking in the fruit of the Sacrament. For any devout man is able
every day and every hour to draw near to spiritual communion with Christ
to his soul’s health and without hindrance. Nevertheless on certain days
and at the appointed time he ought to receive the Body and Blood of his
Redeemer with affectionate reverence, and rather to seek after the
praise and honour of God, than his own comfort. For so often doth he
communicate mystically, and is invisibly refreshed, as he devoutly
calleth to mind the mystery of Christ’s incarnation and His Passion, and
is inflamed with the love of Him.</p></li>
<li><p>He who only prepareth himself when a festival is at hand or
custom compelleth, will too often be unprepared. Blessed is he who
offereth himself to God for a whole burnt-offering, so often as he
celebrateth or communicateth! Be not too slow nor too hurried in thy
celebrating, but preserve the good received custom of those with whom
thou livest. Thou oughtest not to produce weariness and annoyance in
others, but to observe the received custom, according to the institution
of the elders; and to minister to the profit of others rather than to
thine own devotion or feeling.</p></li>
