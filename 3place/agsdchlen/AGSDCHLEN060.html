id="chapter-xxii-of-the-recollection-of-gods-manifold-benefits">CHAPTER
XXII OF THE RECOLLECTION OF GOD’S MANIFOLD BENEFITS</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>OPEN, O Lord, my heart in Thy law, and teach me to walk in the
way of Thy commandments. Grant me to understand Thy will and to be
mindful of Thy benefits, both general and special, with great reverence
and diligent meditation, that thus I may be able worthily to give Thee
thanks. Yet I know and confess that I cannot render Thee due praises for
the least of Thy mercies. I am less than the least of all the good
things which Thou gavest me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit
faileth because of the greatness thereof.</p></li>
<li><p>All things which we have in the soul and in the body, and
whatsoever things we possess, whether outwardly or inwardly, naturally
or supernaturally, are Thy good gifts, and prove Thee, from whom we have
received them all, to be good, gentle, and kind. Although one receiveth
many things, and another fewer, yet all are Thine, and without Thee not
even the least thing can be possessed. He who hath received greater
cannot boast that it is of his own merit, nor lift himself up above
others, nor contemn those beneath him; for he is the greater and the
better who ascribeth least to himself, and in giving thanks is the
humbler and more devout; and he who holdeth himself to be viler than
all, and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy, is the apter for
receiving greater things.</p></li>
<li><p>But he who hath received fewer gifts, ought not to be cast down,
nor to take it amiss, nor to envy him who is richer; but rather ought he
to look unto Thee, and to greatly extol Thy goodness, for Thou pourest
forth Thy gifts so richly, so freely and largely, without respect of
persons. All things come of Thee; therefore in all things shalt thou be
praised. Thou knowest what is best to be given to each; and why this man
hath less, and that more, is not for us but for Thee to understand, for
unto Thee each man’s deservings are fully known.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherefore, O Lord God, I reckon it even a great benefit, not to
have many things, whence praise and glory may appear outwardly, and
after the thought of men. For so it is that he who considereth his own
poverty and vileness, ought not only to draw therefrom no grief or
sorrow, or sadness of spirit, but rather comfort and cheerfulness;
because Thou, Lord, hast chosen the poor and humble, and those who are
poor in this world, to be Thy friends and acquaintance. So give all
Thine apostles witness whom Thou hast made princes in all lands. Yet
they had their conversation in this world blameless, so humble and meek,
without any malice or deceit, that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes
for Thy Name’s sake, and what things the world hateth, they embraced
with great joy.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth Thee
and knoweth Thy benefits, as Thy will in him, and the good pleasure of
Thine eternal Providence, wherewith he ought to be so contended and
comforted, that he would as willingly be the least as any other would be
the greatest, as peaceable and contented in the lowest as in the highest
place, and as willingly held of small and low account and of no name or
reputation as to be more honourable and greater in the world than
others. For Thy will and the love of Thine honour ought to go before all
things, and to please and comfort him more, than all benefits that are
given or may be given to himself.</p></li>
