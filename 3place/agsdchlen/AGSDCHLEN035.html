<h4 id="chapter-ix-of-the-lack-of-all-comfort">CHAPTER IX OF THE LACK OF
ALL COMFORT</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>IT is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is
present. It is a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear the
loss both of human and divine comfort; and for the love of God willingly
to bear exile of heart, and in nought to seek oneself, nor to look to
one’s own merit. What great matter is it, if thou be cheerful of heart
and devout when favour cometh to thee? That is an hour wherein all
rejoice. Pleasantly enough doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth.
And what marvel, if he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty,
and is led onwards by the Guide from on high?</p></li>
<li><p>We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is
difficult for a man to be freed from himself. The holy martyr Laurence
overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly master, because
he despised everything in the world which seemed to be pleasant; and for
the love of Christ he calmly suffered even God’s chief priest, Sixtus,
whom he dearly loved, to be taken from him. Thus by the love of the
Creator he overcame the love of man, and instead of human comfort he
chose rather God’s good pleasure. So also learn thou to resign any near
and beloved friend for the love of God. Nor take it amiss when thou hast
been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted from one
another at last.</p></li>
<li><p>Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he
learn altogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole affection
towards God. When a man resteth upon himself, he easily slippeth away
unto human comforts. But a true lover of Christ, and a diligent seeker
after virtue, falleth not back upon those comforts, nor seeketh such
sweetnesses as may be tasted and handled, but desireth rather hard
exercises, and to undertake severe labours for Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it
with giving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not thy
desert. Be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly presume,
but rather be more humble for the gift, more wary and more careful in
all thy doings; for that hour will pass away, and temptation will
follow. When comfort is taken from thee, do not straightway despair, but
wait for the heavenly visitation with humility and patience, for God is
able to give thee back greater favour and consolation. This is not new
nor strange to those who have made trial of the way of God, for with the
great saints and the ancient prophets there was often this manner of
change.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with him, I
said in my prosperity I shall never be moved, but he goeth on to say
what he felt within himself when the favour departed: Thou didst turn
Thy face from me, and I was troubled. In spite whereof he in no wise
despaireth, but the more instantly entreateth God, and saith, Unto Thee,
O Lord, will I cry, and will pray unto my God; and then he receiveth the
fruit of his prayer, and testifieth how he hath been heard, saying, The
Lord heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my helper. But
wherein? Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast put off my
sackcloth and girded me with gladness. If it was thus with the great
saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to despair if we are
sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the cold, for the Spirit cometh
and goeth according to the good pleasure of His will. Wherefore holy Job
saith, Thou dost visit him in the morning, and suddenly Thou dost prove
him.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only in
the great mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace? For whether good
men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends, whether holy books
or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns and songs, all these help
but little, and have but little savour when I am deserted by God’s
favour and left to mine own poverty. There is no better remedy, then,
than patience and denial of self, and an abiding in the will of
God.</p></li>
<li><p>I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he
felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of fervour.
No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so enlightened, but that
sooner or later he was tempted. For he is not worthy of the great vision
of God, who, for God’s sake, hath not been exercised by some temptation.
For temptation is wont to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall
follow, and heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by
temptation. As it is written, To him that overcometh I will give to eat
of the tree of life.</p></li>
<li><p>Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear
adversities. And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up because of
the benefit. The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not yet dead;
therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto the battle, for
enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left, and they are never at
rest.</p></li>
