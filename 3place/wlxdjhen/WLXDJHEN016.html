<h4 id="the-riddle-of-colour">THE RIDDLE OF COLOUR</h4>
<p>It was again Newton’s genius which explained for the first time the
wealth of colour in the world. Here is a description of one of Newton’s
experiments in his own words:</p>
<p>In the year 1666 (at which time I applied myself to the grinding of
optick glasses of other figures than spherical) I procured me a
triangular glass prism, to try therewith the celebrated phenomena of
colours. And in order thereto,</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW IOI</p>
<p>having darkened my chamber, and made a small hole in my window-shuts,
to let in a convenient quantity of the sun’s light, I placed my prism at
its entrance, that it might thereby be refracted to the opposite wall.
It was at first a very pleasing divertisement, to view the vivid and
intense colours produced thereby.</p>
<p>The light from the sun is “white“. After passing through a prism it
shows all the colours which exist in the visible world. Nature herself
reproduces the same result in the beautiful colour scheme of the
rainbow. Attempts to explain this phenomenon are very old. The Biblical
story that a rainbow is God’s signature to a covenant with man is, in a
sense, a “theory“. But it does not satisfactorily explain why the
rainbow is repeated from time to time, and why always in connection with
rain. The whole puzzle of colour was first scientifically attacked and
the solution pointed out in the great work of Newton.</p>
<p>One edge of the rainbow is always red and the other violet. Between
them all other colours are arranged. Here is Newton’s explanation of
this phenomenon: every colour is already present in white light. They
all traverse interplanetary space and the atmosphere in unison and give
the effect of white light. White light is, so to speak, a jnixture of
corpuscies._of^different kinds, belonging to different colours. In the
case of Newton’s experiment the prism separates them in space. According
to the mechanical theory, refraction is due to forces acting on the
particles of light and originating from the particles of glass. These
forces are different for</p>
<p>corpuscles belonging to different colours, being strongest for the
violet and weakest for the red. Each of the colours will therefore be
refracted along a different path and be separated from the others when
the light leaves the prism. In the case of a rainbow, drops of water
play the role of the prism.</p>
<p>The substance theory of light is now more complicated than before. We
have not one light substance but many, each belonging to a different
colour. If, however, there is some truth in the theory, its consequences
must agree with observation.</p>
<p>The series of colours in the white light of the sun, as revealed by
Newton’s experiment, is called the spectrum of the sun, or more
precisely, its visible spectrum. The decomposition of white light into
its components, as described here, is called the dispersion of light.
The separated colours of the spectrum could be mixed together again by a
second prism properly adjusted, unless the explanation given is wrong.
The process should be just the reverse of the previous one. We should
obtain white light from the previously separated colours. Newton showed
by experiment that it is indeed possible to obtain white light from its
spectrum and the spectrum from white light in this simple way as many
times as one pleases. These experiments formed a strong support for the
theory in which corpuscles belonging to each colour behave as
unchangeable substances. Newton wrote thus :</p>
<p>.. .which colours are not new generated, but only made apparent by
being parted; for if they be again entirely</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW IO3</p>
<p>mixt and blended together, they will again compose that colour, which
they did before separation. And for the same reason, transmutations made
by the convening of divers colours are not real; for when the difform
rays are again severed, they will exhibit the very same colours which
they did before they entered the composition; as you see blue and yellow
powders, when finely mixed, appear to the naked eye, green, and yet the
colours of the component corpuscles are not thereby really transmuted,
but only blended. For when viewed with a good microscope they still
appear blue and yellow interspersedly.</p>
<p>Suppose that we have isolated a very narrow strip of the spectrum.
This means that of all the many colours we allow only one to pass
through the slit, the others being stopped by a screen. The beam which
comes through will consist of homogeneous light, that is, light which
cannot be split into further components. This is a consequence of the
theory and can be easily confirmed by experiment. In no way can such a
beam of single colour be divided further. There are simple means of
obtaining sources of homogeneous light. For example, sodium, when
incandescent, emits homogeneous yellow light. It is very often
convenient to perform certain optical experiments with homogeneous
light, since, as we can well understand, the result will be much
simpler.</p>
<p>Let us imagine that suddenly a very strange thing happens: our sun
begins to emit only homogeneous light of some definite colour, say
yellow. The great variety of colours on the earth would immediately
vanish. Everything would be either yellow or black!</p>
<p>This prediction is a consequence of the substance theory of light,
for new colours cannot be created. Its validity can be confirmed by
experiment: in a room where the only source of light is incandescent
sodium everything is either yellow or black. The wealth of colour in the
world reflects the variety of colour of which white light is
composed.</p>
<p>The substance theory of light seems to work splendidly in all these
cases, although the necessity for introducing as many substances as
colours may make us somewhat uneasy. The assumption that all the
corpuscles of light have exactly the same velocity in empty space also
seems very artificial.</p>
<p>It is imaginable that another set of suppositions, a theory of
entirely different character, would work just as well and give all the
required explanations. Indeed, we shall soon witness the rise of another
theory, based on entirely different concepts, yet explaining the same
domain of optical phenomena. Before formulating the underlying
assumptions of this new theory, however, we must answer a question in no
way connected with these optical considerations. We must go back to
mechanics and ask:</p>
