<h4 id="probability-waves">PROBABILITY WAVES</h4>
<p>If, according to classical mechanics, we know the position and
velocity of a given material point and also what external forces are
acting, we can predict, from</p>
<p>the mechanical laws, the whole of its future path. The sentence: “The
material point has such-and-such position and velocity at such-and-such
an instant,“ has a definite meaning in classical mechanics. If this
statement were to lose its sense, our argument (p. 32) about foretelling
the future path would fail.</p>
<p>In the early nineteenth century, scientists wanted to reduce all
physics to simple forces acting on material particles that have definite
positions and velocities at any instant. Let us recall how we described
motion when discussing mechanics at the beginning of our journey through
the realm of physical problems. We drew points along a definite path
showing the exact positions of the body at certain instants and then
tangent vectors showing the direction and magnitude of the velocities.
This was both simple and convincing. But it cannot be repeated for our
elementary quanta of matter, that is electrons, or for quanta of energy,
that is photons. We cannot picture the journey of a photon or electron
in the way we imagined motion in classical mechanics. The example of the
two pinholes shows this clearly. Electron and photon seem to pass
through the two holes. It is thus impossible to explain the effect by
picturing the path of an electron or a photon in the old classical
way.</p>
<p>We must, of course, assume the presence of elementary actions, such
as the passing of electrons or photons through the holes. The existence
of elementary quanta of matter and energy cannot be doubted. But the
elementary laws certainly cannot be formulated by</p>
<p>specifying positions and velocities at any instant in the simple
manner of classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, try something different. Let us continually repeat
the same elementary processes. One after the other, the electrons are
sent in the direction of the pinholes. The word “electron“ is used here
for the sake of definiteness; our argument is also valid for
photons.</p>
<p>The same experiment is repeated over and over again in exactly the
same way; the electrons all have the same velocity and move in the
direction of the two pinholes. It need hardly be mentioned that this is
an idealized experiment which cannot be carried out in reality but may
well be imagined. We cannot shoot out single photons or electrons at
given instants, like bullets from a gun.</p>
<p>The outcome of repeated experiments must again be dark and light
rings for one hole and dark and light stripes for two. But there is one
essential difference. In the case of one individual electron, the
experimental result was incomprehensible. It is more easily understood
when the experiment is repeated many times. We can now say: light
stripes appear where many electrons fall. The stripes become darker at
the place where fewer electrons are falling. A completely dark spot
means that there are no electrons. We are not, of course, allowed to
assume that all the electrons pass through one of the holes. If this
were so, it could not make the slightest difference whether or not the
other is covered. But we already know that covering the</p>
<p>second hole does make a difference. Since one particle is
indivisible, we cannot imagine that it passes through both the holes.
The fact that the experiment was repeated many times points to another
way out. Some of the electrons may pass through the first hole and
others through the second. We do not know why individual electrons
choose particular holes, but the net result of repeated experiments must
be that both pinholes participate in transmitting the electrons from the
source to the screen. If we state only what happens to the crowd of
electrons when the experiment is repeated, not bothering about the
behaviour of individual particles, the difference between the ringed and
the striped pictures becomes comprehensible. By the discussion of a
sequence of experiments a new idea was born, that of a crowd with the
individuals behaving in an unpredictable way. We cannot foretell the
course of one single electron, but we can predict that, in the net
result, the light and dark stripes will appear on the screen.</p>
<p>Let us leave quantum physics for the moment.</p>
<p>We have seen in classical physics that if we know the position and
velocity of a material point at a certain instant and the forces acting
upon it, we can predict its future path. We also saw how the mechanical
point of view was applied to the kinetic theory of matter. But in this
theory a new idea arose from our reasoning. It will be helpful in
understanding later arguments to grasp this idea thoroughly.</p>
<p>There is a vessel containing gas. In attempting to</p>
<p>trace the motion of every particle one would have to commence by
finding the initial states, that is, the initial positions and
velocities of all the particles. Even if this were possible, it would
take more than a human lifetime to set down the result on paper, owing
to the enormous number of particles which would have to be considered.
If one then tried to employ the known methods of classical mechanics for
calculating the final positions of the particles, the difficulties would
be insurmountable. In principle, it is possible to use the method
applied for the motion of planets, but in practice this is useless and
must give way to the method of statistics. This method dispenses with
any exact knowledge of initial states. We know less about the system at
any given moment and are thus less able to say anything about its past
or future. We become indifferent to the fate of the individual gas
particles. Our problem is of a different nature. For example: we do not
ask, “What is the speed of every particle at this moment?“ But we may
ask: “How many particles have a speed between 1000 and uoo feet per
second?“ We care nothing for individuals. What we seek to determine are
average values typifying the whole aggregation. It is clear that there
can be some point in a statistical method of reasoning only when the
system consists of a large number of individuals.</p>
<p>By applying the statistical method we cannot foretell the behaviour
of an individual in a crowd. We can only foretell the chance, the
probability, that it will behave in some particular manner. If our
statistical</p>
<p>laws tell us that one-third of the particles have a speed between
1000 and uoo feet per second, it means that by repeating our
observations for many particles, we shall really obtain this average, or
in other words, that the probability of finding a particle within this
limit is equal to one-third.</p>
<p>Similarly, to know the birth rate of a great community does not mean
knowing whether any particular family is blessed with a child. It means
a knowledge of statistical results in which the contributing
personalities play no role.</p>
<p>By observing the registration plates of a great many cars we can soon
discover that one-third of their numbers are divisible by three. But we
cannot foretell whether the car which will pass in the next moment will
have this property. Statistical laws can be applied only to big
aggregations, but not to their individual members.</p>
<p>We can now return to our quantum problem.</p>
<p>The laws of quantum physics are of a statistical character. This
means: they concern not one single system but an aggregation of
identical systems; they cannot be verified by measurement of one
individual, but only by a series of repeated measurements.</p>
<p>Radioactive disintegration is one of the many events for which
quantum physics tries to formulate laws governing the spontaneous
transmutation from one element to another. We know, for example, that in
1600 years half of one gram of radium will disintegrate, and half will
remain. We can foretell approximately how</p>
<p>many atoms will disintegrate during the next half-hour, but we cannot
say, even in our theoretical descriptions, why just these particular
atoms are doomed. According to our present knowledge, we have no power
to designate the individual atoms condemned to disintegration. The fate
of an atom does not depend on its age. There is not the slightest trace
of a law governing their individual behaviour. Only statistical laws can
be formulated, laws governing large aggregations of atoms.</p>
<p>Take another example. The luminous gas of some element placed before
a spectroscope shows lines of definite wave-length. The appearance of a
discontinuous set of definite wave-lengths is characteristic of the
atomic phenomena in which the existence of elementary quanta is
revealed. But there is still another aspect of this problem. Some of the
spectrum lines are very distinct, others are fainter. A distinct line
means that a comparatively large number of photons belonging to this
particular wave-length are emitted; a faint line means that a
comparatively small number of photons belonging to this wave-length are
emitted. Theory again gives us statements of a statistical nature only.
Every line corresponds to a transition from higher to lower energy
level. Theory tells us only about the probability of each of these
possible transitions, but nothing about the actual transition of an
individual atom. The theory works splendidly because all these phenomena
involve large aggregations and not single individuals.</p>
<p>It seems that the new quantum physics resembles somewhat the kinetic
theory of matter, since both are of a statistical nature and both refer
to great aggregations. But this is not so ! In this analogy an
understanding not only of the similarities but also of the differences
is most important. The similarity between the kinetic theory of matter
and quantum physics lies chiefly in their statistical character. But
what are the differences?</p>
<p>If we wish to know how many men and women over the age of twenty live
in a city, we must get every citizen to fill up a form under the
headings “male“, “female “, and ’ c age’’. Provided every answer is
correct, we can obtain, by counting and segregating them, a result of a
statistical nature. The individual names and addresses on the forms are
of no account. Our statistical view is gained by the knowledge of
individual cases. Similarly, in the kinetic theory of matter, we have
statistical laws governing the aggregation, gained on the basis of
individual laws.</p>
<p>But in quantum physics the state of affairs is entirely different.
Here the statistical laws are given immediately. The individual laws are
discarded. In the example of a photon or an electron and two pinholes we
have seen that we cannot describe the possible motion of elementary
particles in space and time as we did in classical physics. Quantum
physics abandons individual laws of elementary particles and states
directly the statistical laws governing aggregations. It is impossible,
on the basis of quantum physics, to describe positions and velocities of
an elementary particle or to predict its</p>
<p>future path as in classical physics. Quantum physics deals only with
aggregations, and its laws are for crowds and not for individuals.</p>
<p>It is hard necessity and not speculation or a desire for novelty
which forces us to change the old classical view. The difficulties of
applying the old view have been outlined for one instance only, that of
diffraction phenomena. But many others, equally convincing, could be
quoted. Changes of view are continually forced upon us by our attempts
to understand reality. But it always remains for the future to decide
whether we chose the only possible way out and whether or not a better
solution of our difficulties could have been found.</p>
<p>We have had to forsake the description of individual cases as
objective happenings in space and time; we have had to introduce laws of
a statistical nature. These are the chief characteristics of modern
quantum physics.</p>
<p>Previously, when introducing new physical realities, such as the
electromagnetic and gravitational field, we tried to indicate in general
terms the characteristic features of the equations through which the
ideas have been mathematically formulated. We shall now do the same with
quantum physics, referring only very briefly to the work of Bohr, de
Broglie, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Dirac and Born.</p>
<p>Let us consider the case of one electron. The electron may be under
the influence of an arbitrary foreign electromagnetic field, or free
from all external influences. It may move, for instance, in the field of
an atomic</p>
<p>nucleus or it may diffract on a crystal. Quantum physics teaches us
how to formulate the mathematical equations for any of these
problems.</p>
<p>We have already recognized the similarity between an oscillating
cord, the membrane of a drum, a wind instrument, or any other acoustical
instrument on the one hand, and a radiating atom on the other. There is
also some similarity between the mathematical equations governing the
acoustical problem and those governing the problem of quantum physics.
But again the physical interpretation of the quantities determined in
these two cases is quite different. The physical quantities describing
the oscillating cord and the radiating atom have quite a different
meaning, despite some formal likeness in the equations. In the case of
the cord, we ask about the deviation of an arbitrary point from its
normal position at an arbitrary moment. Knowing the form of the
oscillating cord at a given instant, we know everything we wish. The
deviation from the normal can thus be calculated for any other moment
from the mathematical equations for the oscillating cord. The fact that
some definite deviation from the normal position corresponds to every
point of the cord is expressed more rigorously as follows: for any
instant, the deviation from the normal value is a function of the
co-ordinates of the cord. All points of the cord form a one-dimensional
continuum, and the deviation is a function defined in this
one-dimensional continuum, to be calculated from the equations of the
oscillating cord.</p>
<p>Analogously, in the case of an electron a certain function is
determined for any point in space and for any moment. We shall call this
function the probability wave. In our analogy the probability wave
corresponds to the deviation from the normal position in the acoustical
problem. The probability wave is, at a given instant, a function of a
three-dimensional continuum, whereas, in the case of the cord the
deviation was, at a given moment, a function of the one-dimensional
continuum. The probability wave forms the catalogue of our knowledge of
the quantum system under consideration and will enable us to answer all
sensible statistical questions concerning this system. It does not tell
us the position and velocity of the electron at any moment because such
a question has no sense in quantum physics. But it will tell us the
probability of meeting the electron on a particular spot, or where we
have the greatest chance of meeting an electron. The result does not
refer to one, but to many repeated measurements. Thus the equations of
quantum physics determine the probability wave just as Maxwell’s
equations determine the electromagnetic field and the gravitational
equations determine the gravitational field. The laws of quantum physics
are again structure laws. But the meaning of physical concepts
determined by these equations of quantum physics is much more abstract
than in the case of electromagnetic and gravitational fields; they
provide only the mathematical means of answering questions of a
statistical nature.</p>
<p>So far we have considered the electron in some ex-</p>
<p>ternal field. If it were not the electron, the smallest possible
charge, but some respectable charge containing billions of electrons, we
could disregard the whole quantum theory and treat the problem according
to our old pre-quantum physics. Speaking of currents in a wire, of
charged conductors, of electromagnetic waves, we can apply our old
simple physics contained in Maxwell’s equations. But we cannot do this
when speaking of the photoelectric effect, intensity of spectral lines,
radioactivity, diffraction of electric waves and many other phenomena in
which the quantum character of matter and energy is revealed. We must
then, so to speak, go one floor higher. Whereas in classical physics we
spoke of positions and velocities of one particle, we must now consider
probability waves, in a three-dimensional continuum corresponding to
this one-particle problem.</p>
<p>Quantum physics gives its own prescription for treating a problem if
we have previously been taught how to treat an analogous problem from
the point of view of classical physics.</p>
<p>For one elementary particle, electron or photon, we have probability
waves in a three-dimensional continuum, characterizing the statistical
behaviour of the system if the experiments are often repeated. But what
about the case of not one but two interacting particles, for instance,
two electrons, electron and photon, or electron and nucleus? We cannot
treat them separately and describe each of them through a probability
wave in three dimensions, just because of their mutual inter-</p>
<p>action. Indeed, it is not very difficult to guess how to describe in
quantum physics a system composed of two interacting particles. We have
to descend one floor, to return for a moment to classical physics. The
position of two material points in space, at any moment, is
characterized by six numbers, three for each of the points. All possible
positions of the two material points form a six-dimensional continuum
and not a three-dimensional one as in the case of one point. If we now
again ascend one floor, to quantum physics, we shall have probability
waves in a six-dimensional continuum and not in a three-dimensional
continuum as in the case of one particle. Similarly, for three, four,
and more particles the probability waves will be functions in a
continuum of nine, twelve, and more dimensions.</p>
<p>This shows clearly that the probability waves are more abstract than
the electromagnetic and gravitational field existing and spreading in
our three-dimensional space. The continuum of many dimensions forms the
background for the probability waves, and only for one particle does the
number of dimensions equal that of physical space. The only physical
significance of the probability wave is that it enables us to answer
sensible statistical questions in the case of many particles as well as
of one. Thus, for instance, for one electron we could ask about the
probability of meeting an electron in some particular spot. For two
particles our question could be: what is the probability of meeting the
two particles at two definite spots at a given instant?</p>
<p>Our first step away from classical physics was abandoning the
description of individual cases as objective events in space and time.
We were forced to apply the statistical method provided by the
probability waves. Once having chosen this way, we are obliged to go
further toward abstraction. Probability waves in many dimensions
corresponding to the many-particle problem must be introduced.</p>
<p>Let us, for the sake of briefness, call everything except quantum
physics, classical physics. Classical and quantum physics differ
radically. Classical physics aims at a description of objects existing
in space, and the formulation of laws governing their changes in time.
But the phenomena revealing the particle and wave nature of matter and
radiation, the apparently statistical character of elementary events
such as radioactive disintegration, diffraction, emission of spectral
lines, and many others, forced us to give up this view. Quantum physics
does not aim at the description of individual objects in space and their
changes in time. There is no place in quantum physics for statements
such as: “This object is so-and-so, has this-and-this property.’ 5
Instead we have statements of this kind: “There is such-and-such a
probability that the individual object is so-and-so and has
this-and-this property.’ 5 There is no place in quantum physics for laws
governing the changes in time of the individual object. Instead, we have
laws governing the changes in time of the probability. Only this
fundamental change, brought into physics by the quantum theory, made
possible an adequate</p>
<p>explanation of the apparently discontinuous and statistical character
of events in the realm of phenomena in which the elementary quanta of
matter and radiation reveal their existence.</p>
<p>Yet new, still more difficult problems arise which have not been
definitely settled as yet. We shall mention only some of these unsolved
problems. Science is not and will never be a closed book. Every
important advance brings new questions. Every development reveals, in
the long run, new and deeper difficulties.</p>
<p>We already know that in the simple case of one or many particles we
can rise from the classical to the quantum description, from the
objective description of events in space and time to probability waves.
But we remember the all-important field concept in classical physics.
How can we describe interaction between elementary quanta of matter and
field? If a probability wave in thirty dimensions is needed for the
quantum description of ten particles, then a probability wave with an
infinite number of dimensions would be needed for the quantum
description of a field. The transition from the classical field concept
to the corresponding problem of probability waves in quantum physics is
a very difficult step. Ascending one floor is here no easy task and all
attempts so far made to solve the problem must be regarded as
unsatisfactory. There is also one other fundamental problem. In all our
arguments about the transition from classical physics to quantum physics
we used the old pre-relativistic description in which space and time are
treated differently. If, however, we</p>
<p>try to begin from the classical description as proposed by the
relativity theory, then our ascent to the quantum problem seems much
more complicated. This is another problem tackled by modern physics, but
still far from a complete and satisfactory solution. There is still a
further difficulty in forming a consistent physics for heavy particles,
constituting the nuclei. In spite of the many experimental data and the
many attempts to throw light on the nuclear problem, we are still in the
dark about some of the most fundamental questions in this domain.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that quantum physics explained a very rich variety
of facts, achieving, for the most part, splendid agreement between
theory and observation. The new quantum physics removes us still further
from the old mechanical view, and a retreat to the former position
seems, more than ever, unlikely. But there is also no doubt that quantum
physics must still be based on the two concepts: matter and field. It
is, in this sense, a dualistic theory and does not bring our old problem
of reducing everything to the field concept even one step nearer
realization.</p>
<p>Will the further development be along the line chosen in quantum
physics, or is it more likely that new revolutionary ideas will be
introduced into physics? Will the road of advance again make a sharp
turn, as it has so often done in the past?</p>
<p>During the last few years all the difficulties of quantum physics
have been concentrated around a few principal points. Physics awaits
their solution impa-</p>
<p>tiently. But there is no way of foreseeing when and where the
clarification of these difficulties will be brought about.</p>
