<h4 id="the-first-serious-difficulty">THE FIRST SERIOUS DIFFICULTY</h4>
<p>We are now ready to note the first grave difficulty in the
application of our general philosophical point of view. It will be shown
later that this difficulty, together with another even more serious,
caused a complete breakdown of the belief that all phenomena can be
explained mechanically.</p>
<p>The tremendous development of electricity as a branch of science and
technique began with the dis-</p>
<p>covery of the electric current. Here we find in the history of
science one of the very few instances in which accident seemed to play
an essential role. The story of the convulsion of a frog’s leg is told
in many different ways. Regardless of the truth concerning details,
there is no doubt that Galvani’s accidental discovery led Volt a at the
end of the eighteenth century to the construction of what is known as a
voltaic battery. This is no longer of any practical use, but it still
furnishes a very simple example of a source of current in school
demonstrations and in textbook descriptions.</p>
<p>The principle of its construction is simple. There are several glass
tumblers, each containing water with a little sulphuric acid. In each
glass two metal plates, one copper and the other zinc, are immersed in
the solution. The copper plate of one glass is connected to the zinc of
the next, so that only the zinc plate of the first and the copper plate
of the last glass remain unconnected. We can detect a difference in
electric potential between the copper in the first glass and the zinc in
the last by means of a fairly sensitive electroscope if the number of
the “elements 55 , that is, glasses with plates, constituting the
battery, is sufficiently large.</p>
<p>It was only for the purpose of obtaining something easily measurable
with apparatus already described that we introduced a battery consisting
of several elements. For further discussion, a single element will serve
just as well. The potential of the copper turns out to be higher than
that of the zinc. “Higher“ is used here in the sense in which +2 is
greater than -2. If one</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 89</p>
<p>conductor is connected to the free copper plate and another to the
zinc, both will become charged, the first positively and the other
negatively. Up to this point nothing particularly new or striking has
appeared, and we may try to apply our previous ideas about potential
differences. We have seen that a potential difference between two
conductors can be quickly nullified by connecting them with a wire, so
that there is a flow of electric fluid from one conductor to the other.
This process was similar to the equalization of temperatures by heat
flow. But does this work in the case of a voltaic battery? Volta wrote
in his report that the plates behave like conductors:</p>
<p>.. . feebly charged, which act unceasingly or so that their charge
after each discharge re-establishes itself; which, in a word, provides
an unlimited charge or imposes a perpetual action or impulsion of the
electric fluid.</p>
<p>The astonishing result of his experiment is that the potential
difference between the copper and zinc plates does not vanish as in the
case of two charged conductors connected by a wire. The difference
persists, and according to the fluids theory it must cause a constant
flow of electric fluid from the higher potential level (copper plate) to
the lower (zinc plate). In an attempt to save the fluid theory, we may
assume that some constant force acts to regenerate the potential
difference and cause a flow of electric fluid. But the whole phenomenon
is astonishing from the standpoint of energy. A noticeable quantity of
heat is generated in the wire carrying the current, even enough to melt
the wire if</p>
<p>it is a thin one. Therefore, heat-energy is created in the wire. But
the whole voltaic battery forms an isolated system, since no external
energy is being supplied. If we want to save the law of conservation of
energy we must find where the transformations take place, and at what
expense the heat is created. It is not difficult to realize that
complicated chemical processes are taking place in the battery,
processes in which the immersed copper and zinc, as well as the liquid
itself, take active parts. From the standpoint of energy this is the
chain of transformations which are taking place: chemical
energy-&gt;energy of the flowing electric fluid, i.e., the
current-&gt;heat. A voltaic battery does not last for ever; the chemical
changes associated with the flow of electricity make the battery useless
after a time.</p>
<p>The experiment which actually revealed the great difficulties in
applying the mechanical ideas must sound strange to anyone hearing about
it for the first time. It was performed by Oersted about a hundred and
twenty years ago. He reports:</p>
<p>By these experiments it seems to be shown that the magnetic needle
was moved from its position by help of a galvanic apparatus, and that,
when the galvanic circuit was closed, but not when open, as certain very
celebrated physicists in vain attempted several years ago.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a voltaic battery and a conducting wire. If the wire
is connected to the copper plate but not to the zinc, there will exist a
potential difference but no current can flow. Let us assume that the
wire is bent to form a circle, in the centre of which a magnetic</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW gi</p>
<p>needle is placed, both wire and needle lying in the same plane.
Nothing happens so long as the wire does not touch the zinc plate. There
are no forces acting, the existing potential difference having no
influence</p>
<p>whatever on the position of the needle. It seems difficult to
understand why the “very celebrated physicists“, as Oersted called them,
expected such an influence.</p>
<p>But now let us join the wire to the zinc plate. Immediately a strange
thing happens. The magnetic needle turns from its previous position. One
of its poles now points to the reader if the page of this book
represents the plane of the circle. The effect is that of a force,
perpendicular to the plane, acting on the magnetic pole. Faced with the
facts of the experiment, we can hardly avoid drawing such a conclusion
about the direction of the force acting.</p>
<p>This experiment is interesting, in the first place, be-</p>
<p>Q2 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>cause it shows a relation between two apparently quite different
phenomena, magnetism and electric current. There is another aspect even
more important. The force between the magnetic pole and the small
portions of the wire through which the current flows cannot lie along
lines connecting the wire and needle, or the particles of flowing
electric fluid and the elementary magnetic dipoles. The force is
perpendicular to these lines ! For the first time there appears a force
quite different from that to which, according to our mechanical point of
view, we intended to reduce all actions in the external world. We
remember that the forces of gravitation, electrostatics, and magnetism,
obeying the laws of Newton and Coulomb, act along the line adjoining the
two attracting or repelling bodies.</p>
<p>This difficulty was stressed even more by an experiment performed
with great skill by Rowland nearly sixty years ago. Leaving out
technical details, this experiment could be described as follows.
Imagine a small charged sphere. Imagine further that this sphere moves
very fast in a circle at the centre of which is a magnetic needle. This
is, in principle, the same experiment as Oersted’s, the only difference
being that instead of an ordinary current we have a mechanically
effected motion of the electric charge. Rowland found that the result is
indeed similar to that observed when a current flows in a circular wire.
The magnet is deflected by a perpendicular force.</p>
<p>Let us now move the charge faster. The force acting on the magnetic
pole is, as a result, increased; the</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 93</p>
<p>deflection from its initial position becomes more distinct. This
observation presents another grave complication.</p>
<p>+/</p>
<p>V<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not only does the force fail to lie on the line connecting charge and
magnet, but the intensity of the force depends on the velocity of the
charge. The whole mechanical point of view was based on the belief that
all phenomena can be explained in terms of forces depending only on the
distance and not on the velocity. The result of Rowland’s experiment
certainly shakes this belief. Yet we may choose to be conservative and
seek a solution within the frame of old ideas.</p>
<p>Difficulties of this kind, sudden and unexpected obstacles in the
triumphant development of a theory, arise frequently in science.
Sometimes a simple generalization of the old ideas seems, at least
temporarily, to be a good way out. It would seem sufficient in the
present case, for example, to broaden the previous point of view and
introduce more general forces between the elementary particles. Very
often, however, it is impossible to patch up an old theory, and the
difficulties result in its</p>
<p>downfall and the rise of a new one. Here it was not only the
behaviour of a tiny magnetic needle which broke the apparently
well-founded and successful mechanical theories. Another attack, even
more vigorous, came from an entirely different angle. But this is
another story, and we shall tell it later.</p>
