<h4 id="the-switchback">THE SWITCHBACK</h4>
<p>Let us trace the motion of that popular thrill-giver, the switchback.
A small car is lifted or driven to the highest point of the track. When
set free it starts rolling down under the force of gravity, and then
goes up and down along a fantastically curved line, giving the occupants
a thrill by the sudden changes in velocity. Every switchback has its
highest point, that from which it starts. Never again, throughout the
whole course of the motion, will it reach the same height. A complete
description of the motion would be very complicated. On the one hand is
the mechanical side of the problem, the changes of velocity and position
in time. On the other there is friction and therefore the creation of
heat, on the rail and in the wheels. The only significant reason for
dividing the physical process into these two aspects is to make possible
the use of the concepts previously discussed. The division leads to an
idealized experiment, for a physical process in which only the
mechanical aspect appears can be only imagined but never realized.</p>
<p>For the idealized experiment we may imagine that someone has learned
to eliminate entirely the friction which always accompanies motion. He
decides to apply his discovery to the construction of a switchback,
and</p>
<p>must find out for himself how to build one. The car is to run up and
down, with its starting-point, say, at one hundred feet above ground
level. He soon discovers by trial and error that he must follow a very
simple rule: he may build his track in whatever path he pleases so long
as no point is higher than the starting-point. If the car is to proceed
freely to the end of the</p>
<p>course, its height may attain a hundred feet as many times as he
likes, but never exceed it. The initial height can never be reached by a
car on an actual track because of friction, but our hypothetical
engineer need not consider that.</p>
<p>Let us follow the motion of the idealized car on the idealized
switchback as it begins to roll downward from the starting-point. As it
moves its distance from the ground diminishes, but its speed increases.
This sentence at first sight may remind us of one from a language
lesson: “I have no pencil, but you have six oranges.“ It is not so
stupid, however. There is no connection between my having no pencil and
your having six oranges, but there is a very real correlation</p>
<p>between the distance of the car from the ground and its speed. We can
calculate the speed of the car at any moment if we know how high it
happens to be above the ground, but we omit this point here because of
its quantitative character which can best be expressed by mathematical
formulae.</p>
<p>At its highest point the car has zero velocity and is one hundred
feet from the ground. At the lowest possible point it is no distance
from the ground, and has its greatest velocity. These facts may be
expressed in other terms. At its highest point the car has potential
energy but no kinetic energy or energy of motion. At its lowest point it
has the greatest kinetic energy and no potential energy whatever. At all
intermediate positions, where there is some velocity and some elevation,
it has both kinetic and potential energy. The potential energy increases
with the elevation, while the kinetic energy becomes greater as the
velocity increases. The principles of mechanics suffice to explain the
motion. Two expressions for energy occur in the mathematical
description, each of which changes, although the sum does not vary. It
is thus possible to introduce mathematically and rigorously the concepts
of potential energy, depending on position, and kinetic energy,
depending on velocity. The introduction of the two names is, of course,
arbitrary and justified only by convenience. The sum of the two
quantities remains unchanged, and is called a constant of the motion.
The total energy, kinetic plus potential, can be compared, for example,
with money kept intact as to amount but changed</p>
<p>continually from, one currency to another, say from dollars to pounds
and back again, according to a well-defined rate of exchange.</p>
<p>In the real switchback, where friction prevents the car from again
reaching as high a point as that from which it started, there is still a
continuous change between kinetic and potential energy. Here, however,
the sum does not remain constant, but grows smaller.</p>
<p>Now one important and courageous step more is needed to relate the
mechanical and heat aspects of motion. The wealth of consequences and
generalizations from this step will be seen later.</p>
<p>Something more than kinetic and potential energies is now involved,
namely, the heat created by friction. Does this heat correspond to the
diminution in mechanical energy, that is kinetic and potential energy? A
new guess is imminent. If heat may be regarded as a form of energy,
perhaps the sum of all three—heat, kinetic and potential
energies—remains constant. Not heat alone, but heat and other forms of
energy taken</p>
<p>together are, like a substance, indestructible. It is as if a man
must pay himself a commission in francs for changing dollars to pounds,
the commission money also being saved so that the sum of dollars,
pounds, and francs is a fixed amount according to some defiYiite
exchange rate.</p>
<p>The progress of science has destroyed the older concept of heat as a
substance. We try to create a new substance, energy, with heat as one of
its forms.</p>
