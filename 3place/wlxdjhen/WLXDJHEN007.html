<h4 id="the-riddle-of-motion">THE RIDDLE OF MOTION</h4>
<p>So long as we deal only with motion along a straight line, we are far
from understanding the motions observed in nature. We must consider
motions along curved paths, and our next step is to determine the laws
governing such motions. This is no easy task. In the case of rectilinear
motion our concepts of velocity, change of velocity, and force proved
most useful. But we do not immediately see how we can apply them to</p>
<p>motion along a curved path. It is indeed possible to imagine that the
old concepts are unsuited to the description of general motion, and that
new ones must be created. Should we try to follow our old path, or seek
a new one?</p>
<p>The generalization of a concept is a process very often used in
science. A method of generalization is not uniquely determined, for
there are usually numerous ways of carrying it out. One requirement,
however, must be rigorously satisfied: any generalized concept must
reduce to the original one when the original conditions are
fulfilled.</p>
<p>We can best explain this by the example with which we are now
dealing. We can try to generalize the old concepts of velocity, change
of velocity, and force for the case of motion along a curved path.
Technically, when speaking of curves, we include straight lines. The
straight line is a special and trivial example of a curve. If,
therefore, velocity, change in velocity, and force are introduced for
motion along a curved line, then they are automatically introduced for
motion along a straight line. But this result must not contradict those
results previously obtained. If the curve becomes a straight line, all
the generalized concepts must reduce to the familiar ones describing
rectilinear motion. But this restriction is not sufficient to determine
the generalization uniquely. It leaves open many possibilities. The
history of science shows that the simplest generalizations sometimes
prove successful and sometimes not. We must first make a guess. In our
case it is</p>
<p>a simple matter to guess the right method of generalization. The new
concepts prove very successful and help us to understand the motion of a
thrown stone as well as that of the planets.</p>
<p>And now just what do the words velocity, change in velocity, and
force mean in the general case of motion along a curved line? Let us
begin with velocity. Along the curve a very small body is moving from
left to</p>
<p>right. Such a small body is often called a particle. The dot on the
curve in our drawing shows the position of the particle at some instant
of time. What is the velocity corresponding to this time and position?
Again Galileo’s clue hints at a way of introducing the velocity. We
must, once more, use our imagination and think about an idealized
experiment. The particle moves along the curve, from left to right,
under the influence of external forces. Imagine that at a given time,
and at the point indicated by the dot, all these forces suddenly cease
to act. Then, the motion must, according to the law of inertia, be
uniform. In practice we can, of course, never completely free a body
from all external influences. We can only surmise “what would happen if…
?“ and judge the pertinence of our guess by the conclusions which can be
drawn from it and by their agreement with experiment.</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>The vector in the next drawing indicates the guessed direction of the
uniform motion if all external forces</p>
<p>were to vanish. It is the direction of the so-called tangent. Looking
at a moving particle through a microscope one sees a very small part of
the curve, which appears as a small segment. The tangent is its
prolongation. Thus the vector drawn represents the velocity at a given
instant. The velocity vector lies on the tangent. Its length represents
the magnitude of the velocity, or the speed as indicated, for instance,
by the speedometer of a car.</p>
<p>Our idealized experiment about destroying the motion in order to find
the velocity vector must not be taken too seriously. It only helps us to
understand what we should call the velocity vector and enables us to
determine it for a given instant at a given point.</p>
<p>In the next drawing, the velocity vectors for three different
positions of a particle moving along a curve</p>
<p>are shown. In this case not only the direction but the magnitude of
the velocity, as indicated by the length of the vector, varies during
the motion.</p>
<p>Does this new concept of velocity satisfy the requirement formulated
for all generalizations? That is: does it reduce to the familiar concept
if the curve becomes a straight line? Obviously it does. The tangent to
a straight line is the line itself. The velocity vector lies in the line
of the motion, just as in the case of the moving cart or the rolling
spheres.</p>
<p>The next step is the introduction of the change in velocity of a
particle moving along a curve. This also may be done in various ways,
from which we choose the simplest and most convenient. The last drawing
showed several velocity vectors representing the motion at various
points along the path. The first two of these may be drawn again so that
they have a common starting-point, as we have seen is possible with
vectors.</p>
<p>The dotted vector we call the change in velocity. Its starting-point
is the end of the first vector and its end-point the end of the second
vector. This definition of the change in velocity may, at first sight,
seem artificial and meaningless. It becomes much clearer in the special
case in which vectors (i) and (2) have the same direction. This, of
course, means going over to the case of straight-line motion. If both
vectors have the same initial point, the dotted vector again connects
their end-points. The drawing is now identical with that on p. 18,</p>
<p>— *-&gt; ……… &gt;</p>
<p>and the previous concept is regained as a special case of the new
one. We may remark that we had to separate the two lines in our drawing,
since otherwise they would coincide and be indistinguishable.</p>
<p>We now have to take the last step in our process of generalization.
It is the most important of all the guesses we have had to make so far.
The connection between force and change in velocity has to be
established so that we can formulate the clue which will enable us to
understand the general problem of motion.</p>
<p>The clue to an explanation of motion along a straight line was simple
: external force is responsible for change in velocity; the force vector
has the same direction as the change. And now what is to be regarded as
the clue to curvilinear motion? Exactly the same ! The only difference
is that change of velocity has now a broader meaning than before. A
glance at the dotted vectors of the last two drawings shows this point
clearly. If the velocity is known for all points along the curve, the
direction of the force at any point can be deduced at once. One must
draw the velocity vectors for two instants separated by a very short
time interval and therefore corresponding to positions very near each
other. The vector from the end-point of the first to that of the second
indicates the direction of the acting force. But v it is essential that
the two velocity vectors</p>
<p>should be separated only by a “very short“ time interval. The
rigorous analysis of such words as “very near“, “very short“ is far from
simple. Indeed it was this analysis which led Newton and Leibnitz to the
discovery of differential calculus.</p>
<p>It is a tedious and elaborate path which leads to the generalization
of Galileo’s clue. We cannot show here how abundant and fruitful the
consequences of this generalization have proved. Its application leads
to simple and convincing explanations of many facts previously
incoherent and misunderstood.</p>
<p>From the extremely rich variety of motions we shall take only the
simplest and apply to their explanation the law just formulated.</p>
<p>A bullet shot from a gun, a stone thrown at an angle, a stream of
water emerging from a hose, all describe familiar paths of the same
type—the parabola. Imagine a speedometer attached to a stone, for
example, so that its velocity vector may be drawn for any instant.</p>
<p>The result may well be that represented in the above drawing. The
direction of the force acting on the stone is just that of the change in
velocity, and we have seen how it may be determined. The result, shown
in the next drawing, indicates that the force is vertical, and</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>directed downward. It is exactly the same as when a stone is allowed
to fall from the top of a tower. The paths are quite different, as also
are the velocities, but the change in velocity has the same direction,
that is, toward the centre of the earth.</p>
<p>A stone attached to the end of a string and swung around in a
horizontal plane moves in a circular path.</p>
<p>All the vectors in the diagram representing this motion have the same
length if the speed is uniform.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the velocity is not uniform, for the path is not a
straight line. Only in uniform, rectilinear mo-</p>
<p>tion are there no forces involved. Here, however, there are, and the
velocity changes not in magnitude but in direction. According to the law
of motion there must be some force responsible for this change, a force
in this case between the stone and the hand holding the string. A
further question arises immediately: in what direction does the force
act? Again a vector diagram shows the answer. The velocity vectors for
two very near points are drawn, and the change of velocity</p>
<p>found. This last vector is seen to be directed along the string
toward the centre of the circle, and is always perpendicular to the
velocity vector, or tangent. In other words, the hand exerts a force on
the stone by means of the string.</p>
<p>Very similar is the more important example of the revolution of the
moon around the earth. This may be represented approximately as uniform
circular motion. The force is directed toward the earth for the same
reason that it was directed toward the hand in our former example. There
is no string connecting the earth and the moon, but we can imagine a
line be-tween the centres of the two bodies; the force lies along this
line and is directed toward the centre of the earth, just as the force
on a stone thrown in the air or dropped from a tower.</p>
<p>All that we have said concerning motion can be summed up in a single
sentence. Force and change of velocity are vectors having the same
direction. This is the initial clue to the problem of motion, but it
certainly does not suffice for a thorough explanation of all motions
observed. The transition from Aristotle’s line of thought to that of
Galileo formed a most important corner-stone in the foundation of
science. Once this break was made, the line of further development was
clear. Our interest here lies in the first stages of development, in
following initial clues, in showing how new physical concepts are born
in the painful struggle with old ideas. We are concerned only with
pioneer work in science, which consists of finding new and unexpected
paths of development; with the adventures in scientific thought which
create an ever-changing picture of the universe. The initial and
fundamental steps are always of a revolutionary character. Scientific
imagination finds old concepts too confining, and replaces them by new
ones. The continued development along any line already initiated is more
in the nature of evolution, until the next turning point is reached when
a still newer field must be conquered. In order to understand, however,
what reasons and what difficulties force a change in important concepts,
we must know not only the initial clues, but also the conclusions which
can be drawn.</p>
<p>One of the most important characteristics of modern physics is that
the conclusions drawn from initial clues are not only qualitative but
also quantitative. Let us</p>
<p>again consider a stone dropped from a tower. We have seen that its
velocity increases as it falls, but we should like to know much more.
Just how great is this change? And what is the position and the velocity
of the stone at any time after it begins to fall? We wish to be able to
predict events and to determine by experiment whether observation
confirms these predictions and thus the initial assumptions.</p>
<p>To draw quantitative conclusions we must use the language of
mathematics. Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially
simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to
everyone. To follow up these ideas demands the knowledge of a highly
refined technique of investigation. Mathematics as a tool of reasoning
is necessary if we wish to draw conclusions which may be compared with
experiment. So long as we are concerned only with fundamental physical
ideas we may avoid the language of mathematics. Since in these pages we
do this consistently, we must occasionally restrict ourselves to
quoting, without proof, some of the results necessary for an
understanding of important clues arising in the further development. The
price which must be paid for abandoning the language of mathematics is a
loss in precision, and the necessity of sometimes quoting results
without showing how they were reached.</p>
<p>A very important example of motion is that of the earth around the
sun. It is known that the path is a closed curve, called the ellipse.
The construction of a</p>
<p>vector diagram of the change in velocity shows that the force on the
earth is directed toward the sun. But</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>this, after all, is scant information. We should like to be able to
predict the position of the earth and the other planets for any
arbitrary instant of time, we should like to predict the date and
duration of the next solar eclipse and many other astronomical events.
It is possible to do these things, but not on the basis of our initial
clue alone, for it is now necessary to know not only the direction of
the force but also its absolute value—its magnitude. It was Newton who
made the inspired guess on this point. According to his law of
gravitation the force of attraction between two bodies depends in a
simple way on their distance from each other. It becomes smaller when
the distance increases. To be specific it becomes 2x2=4 times smaller if
the distance is doubled, 3x3 = 9 times smaller if the distance is made
three times as great.</p>
<p>Thus we see that in the case of gravitational force we have succeeded
in expressing, in a simple way, the</p>
<p>dependence of the force on the distance between the moving bodies. We
proceed similarly in all other cases where forces of different kinds—for
instance, electric, magnetic, and the like—are acting. We try to use a
simple expression for the force. Such an expression is justified only
when the conclusions drawn from it are confirmed by experiment.</p>
<p>But this knowledge of the gravitational force alone is not sufficient
for a description of the motion of the planets. We have seen that
vectors representing force and change in velocity for any short interval
of time have the same direction, but we must follow Newton one step
farther and assume a simple relation between their lengths. Given all
other conditions the same, that is, the same moving body and changes
considered over equal time intervals, then, according to Newton, the
change of velocity is proportional to the force.</p>
<p>Thus just two complementary guesses are needed for quantitative
conclusions concerning the motion of the planets. One is of a general
character, stating the connection between force and change in velocity.
The other is special, and states the exact dependence of the particular
kind of force involved on the distance between the bodies. The first is
Newton’s general law of motion, the second his law of gravitation.
Together they determine the motion. This can be made clear by the
following somewhat clumsy-sounding reasoning. Suppose that at a given
time the position and velocity of a planet can be determined, and that
the force is known. Then, according to Newton’s laws, we know</p>
<p>the change in velocity during a short time interval. Knowing the
initial velocity and its change, we can find the velocity and position
of the planet at the end of the time interval. By a continued repetition
of this process the whole path of the motion may be traced without
further recourse to observational data. This is, in principle, the way
mechanics predicts the course of a body in motion, but the method used
here is hardly practical. In practice such a step-by-step procedure
would be extremely tedious as well as inaccurate. Fortunately, it is
quite unnecessary; mathematics furnishes a short cut, and makes possible
precise description of the motion in much less ink than we use for a
single sentence. The conclusions reached in this way can be proved or
disproved by observation.</p>
<p>The same kind of external force is recognized in the motion of a
stone falling through the air and in the revolution of the moon in its
orbit, namely, that of the earth’s attraction for material bodies.
Newton recognized that the motions of falling stones, of the moon, and
of planets are only very special manifestations of a universal
gravitational force acting between any two bodies. In simple cases the
motion may be described and predicted by the aid of mathematics. In
remote and extremely complicated cases, involving the action of many
bodies on each other, a mathematical description is not so simple, but
the fundamental principles are the same.</p>
<p>We find the conclusions, at which we arrived by following our initial
clues, realized in the motion of a</p>
<p>thrown stone, in the motion of the moon, the earth, and the
planets.</p>
<p>It is really our whole system of guesses which is to be either proved
or disproved by experiment. No one of the assumptions can be isolated
for separate testing. In the case of the planets moving around the sun
it is found that the system of mechanics works splendidly. Nevertheless
we can well imagine that another system, based on different assumptions,
might work just as well.</p>
<p>Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not,
however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our
endeavour to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to
understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the
moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way of opening the
case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which
could be responsible for all the things he observes, but he may never be
quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his
observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real
mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of
such a comparison. But he certainly believes that, as his knowledge
increases, his picture of reality will become simpler and simpler and
will explain a wider and wider range of his sensuous impressions. He may
also believe in the existence of the ideal limit of knowledge and that
it is approached by the human mind. He may call this ideal limit the
objective truth.</p>
<p>ONE GLUE REMAINS</p>
<p>When first studying mechanics one has the impression that everything
in this branch of science is simple, fundamental and settled for all
time. One would hardly suspect the existence of an important clue which
no one noticed for three hundred years. The neglected clue is connected
with one of the fundamental concepts of mechanics—that of mass.</p>
<p>Again we return to the simple idealized experiment of the cart on a
perfectly smooth road. If the cart is initially at rest and then given a
push, it afterwards moves uniformly with a certain velocity. Suppose
that the action of the force can be repeated as many times as desired,
the mechanism of pushing acting in the same way and exerting the same
force on the same cart. However many times the experiment is repeated,
the final velocity is always the same. But what happens if the
experiment is changed, if previously the cart was empty and now it is
loaded? The loaded cart will have a smaller final velocity than the
empty one. The conclusion is: if the same force acts on two different
bodies, both initially at rest, the resulting velocities will not be the
same. We say that the velocity depends on the mass of the body, being
smaller if the mass is greater.</p>
<p>We know, therefore, at least in theory, how to determine the mass of
a body or, more exactly, how many times greater one mass is than
another. We have identical forces acting on two resting masses.
Finding</p>
<p>that the velocity of the first mass is three times greater than that
of the second, we conclude that the first mass is three times smaller
than the second. This is certainly not a very practical way of
determining the ratio of two masses. We can, nevertheless, well imagine
having done it in this, or in some similar way, based upon the
application of the law of inertia.</p>
<p>How do we really determine mass in practice? Not, of course, in the
way just described. Everyone knows the correct answer. We do it by
weighing on a scale.</p>
<p>Let us discuss in more detail the two different ways of determining
mass.</p>
<p>The first experiment had nothing whatever to do with gravity, the
attraction of the earth. The cart moves along a perfectly smooth and
horizontal plane after the push. Gravitational force, which causes the
cart to stay on the plane, does not change, and plays no role in the
determination of the mass. It is quite different with weighing. We could
never use a scale if the earth did not attract bodies, if gravity did
not exist. The difference between the two determinations of mass is that
the first has nothing to do with the force of gravity while the second
is based essentially on its existence.</p>
<p>We ask: if we determine the ratio of two masses in both ways
described above, do we obtain the same result? The answer given by
experiment is quite clear. The results are exactly the same ! This
conclusion could not have been foreseen, and is based on observation,
not reason. Let us, for the sake of simplicity, call the</p>
<p>mass determined in the first way the inertial mass and that
determined in the second way the gravitational mass. In our world it
happens that they are equal, but we can well imagine that this should
not have been the case at all. Another question arises immediately: is
this identity of the two kinds of mass purely accidental, or does it
have a deeper significance? The answer, from the point of view of
classical physics, is: the identity of the two masses is accidental and
no deeper significance should be attached to it. The answer of modern
physics is just the opposite: the identity of the two masses is
fundamental and forms a new and essential clue leading to a more
profound understanding. This was, in fact, one of the most important
clues from which the so-called general theory of relativity was
developed.</p>
<p>A mystery story seems inferior if it explains strange events as
accidents. It is certainly more satisfying to have the story follow a
rational pattern. In exactly the same way a theory which offers an
explanation for the identity of gravitational and inertial mass is
superior to one which interprets their identity as accidental, provided,
of course, that the two theories are equally consistent with observed
facts.</p>
<p>Since this identity of inertial and gravitational mass was
fundamental for the formulation of the theory of relativity, we are
justified in examining it a little more closely here. What experiments
prove convincingly that the two masses are the same? The answer lies in
Galileo’s old experiment in which he dropped different masses from a
tower. He noticed that the time required</p>
<p>for the fall was always the same, that the motion of a falling body
does not depend on the mass. To link this simple but highly important
experimental result with the identity of the two masses needs some
rather intricate reasoning.</p>
<p>A body at rest gives way before the action of an external force,
moving and attaining a certain velocity. It yields more or less easily,
according to its inertial mass, resisting the motion more strongly if
the mass is large than if it is small. We may say, without pretending to
be rigorous: the readiness with which a body responds to the call of an
external force depends on its inertial mass. If it were true that the
earth attracts all bodies with the same force, that of greatest inertial
mass would move more slowly in falling than any other. But this is not
the case: all bodies fall in the same way. This means that the force by
which the earth attracts different masses must be different. Now the
earth attracts a stone with the force of gravity and knows nothing about
its inertial mass. The “calling“ force of the earth depends on the
gravitational mass. The “ answering“ motion of the stone depends on the
inertial mass. Since the “ answering “ motion is always the same —all
bodies dropped from the same height fall in the same way—it must be
deduced that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equal.</p>
<p>More pedantically a physicist formulates the same conclusion: the
acceleration of a falling body increases in proportion to its
gravitational mass and decreases in proportion to its inertial mass.
Since all falling bodies</p>
<p>have the same constant acceleration, the two masses must be
equal.</p>
<p>In our great mystery story there are no problems wholly solved and
settled for all time. After three hundred years we had to return to the
initial problem of motion, to revise the procedure of investigation, to
find clues which had been overlooked, thereby reaching a different
picture of the surrounding universe.</p>
<p>IS HEAT A SUBSTANCE</p>
<p>Here we begin to follow a new clue, one originating in the realm of
heat phenomena. It is impossible, however, to divide science into
separate and unrelated sections. Indeed, we shall soon find that the new
concepts introduced here are interwoven with those already familiar, and
with those we shall still meet. A line of thought developed in one
branch of science can very often be applied to the description of events
apparently quite different in character. In this process the original
concepts are often modified so as to advance the understanding both of
those phenomena from which they sprang and of those to which they are
newly applied.</p>
<p>The most fundamental concepts in the description of heat phenomena
are temperature and heat. It took an unbelievably long time in the
history of science for these two to be distinguished, but once this
distinction was made rapid progress resulted. Although these concepts
are now familiar to everyone, we shall examine them closely, emphasizing
the differences between tfiem.</p>
<p>Our sense of touch tells us quite definitely that one body is hot and
another cold. But this is a purely qualitative criterion, not sufficient
for a quantitative description and sometimes even ambiguous. This is
shown by a well-known experiment: we have three vessels containing,
respectively, cold, warm and hot water. If we dip one hand into the cold
water and the other into the hot, we receive a message from the first
that it is cold and from the second that it is hot. If we then dip both
hands into the same warm water, we receive two contradictory messages,
one from each hand. For the same reason an Eskimo and a native of some
equatorial country meeting in New York on a spring day would hold
different opinions as to whether the climate was hot or cold. We settle
all such questions by the use of a thermometer, an instrument designed
in a primitive form by Galileo. Here again that familiar name! The use
of a thermometer is based on some obvious physical assumptions. We shall
recall them by quoting a few lines from lectures given about a hundred
and fifty years ago by Black, who contributed a great deal toward
clearing up the difficulties connected with the two concepts, heat and
temperature:</p>
<p>By the use of this instrument we have learned, that if we take 1000,
or more, different kinds of matter, such as metals, stones, salts,
woods, feathers, wool, water and a variety of other fluids, although
they be all at first of different heats, let them be placed together in
the same room without a fire, and into which the sun does not shine, the
heat will be communicated from the hotter of these bodies to the colder,
during some hours perhaps, or the course of a</p>
<p>at the end of which time, if we apply a thermometer to them all in
succession, it will point precisely to the same degree.</p>
<p>The italicized word heats should, according to present-day
nomenclature, be replaced by the word temperatures.</p>
<p>A physician taking the thermometer from a sick man’s mouth might
reason like this: “The thermometer indicates its own temperature by the
length of its column of mercury. We assume that the length of the
mercury column increases in proportion to the increase in temperature.
But the thermometer was for a few minutes in contact with my
P^ientjjojhat bothjjatient and thermometer havef the Tame temperature. I
con-cIuHe, therefore, that my patient’s temperature is that registered
on the thermometer.“ The doctor probably acts mechanically, but he
applies physical principles without thinking about it.</p>
<p>But does the thermometer contain the same amount of heat as the body
of the man? Of course not. To assume that two bodies contain equal
quantities of heat just because their temperatures are equal would, as
Black remarked, be</p>
<p>taking a very hasty view of the subject. It is confounding the
quantity of heat in different bodies with its general strength or
intensity, though it is plain that these are two different things, and
should always be distinguished, when we are thinking of the distribution
of heat.</p>
<p>An understanding of this distinction can be gained by considering a
very simple experiment. A pound of</p>
<p>water placed over a gas flame takes some time to change from room
temperature to the boiling point. A much longer time is required for
heating twelve pounds, say, of water in the same vessel by means of the
same flame. We interpret this fact as indicating that now more of
“something“ is needed and we call this “something“ heat.</p>
<p>A further important concept, specific heat<sup>is</sup> gained by the
following experiment: let one vessel contain a pound of water and
another a pound of mercury, both to be heated in the same way. The
mercury gets hot much more quickly than the water, showing that less
“heat“ is needed to raise the temperature by one degree. In general ?
different amounts of “heat“ are required to change by one degree, say
from ^ojtp 41 degrees Fah-renheit, the temperatures of different
substances such as~water, mercury, iron, copper, woodTelc^ aTroTtHc
samelrTass. We say that each substance has its individual heat
capacit^^j)Y, specific heat.</p>
<p>Once having gained the concept of heat, we can investigate its nature
more closely. We have two bodies, one hot, the other cold, or more
precisely, one of a higher temperature than the other. We bring them
into contact and free them from all other external influences.
Eventually they will, we know, reach the same temperature. But how does
this take place? What happens between the instant they are brought into
contact and the achievement of equal temperatures? The picture of heat
“flowing“ from one body to another suggests itself, like water flowing
from a higher</p>
<p>level to a lower. This picture, though primitive, seems to fit many
of the facts, so that the analogy runs:</p>
<p>Water—Heat</p>
<p>Higher level—Higher temperature Lower level—Lower temperature</p>
<p>The flow proceeds until both levels, that is, both temperatures, are
equal. This naive view can be made more useful by quantitative
considerations. If definite masses of water and alcohol, each at a
definite temperature, are mixed together, a knowledge of the specific
heats will lead to a prediction of the final temperature of the mixture.
Conversely, an observation of the final temperature, together with a
little algebra, would enable us to find the ratio of the two specific
heats.</p>
<p>We recognize in the concept of heat which appears here a similarity
to other physical concepts. Heat is, according to our view, a substance,
such as mass in mechanics. Its quantity may change or not, like money
put aside in a safe or spent. The amount of money in a safe will remain
unchanged so long as the safe remains locked, and so will the amounts of
mass and heat in an isolated body. The ideal thermos flask is analogous
to such a safe. Furthermore, just as the mass of an isolated system is
unchanged even if a chemical transformation takes place, so heat is
conserved even though it flows from one body to another. Even if heat is
not used for raising the temperature of a body but for melting ice, say,
or changing water into steam, we can still think of it as a substance
and regain it entirely by</p>
<p>freezing the water or liquefying the steam. The old names, latent
heat of melting or vaporization, show that these concepts are drawn from
the picture of heat as a substance. Latent heat is temporarily hidden,
like money put away in a safe, but available for use if one knows the
lock combination.</p>
<p>But heat is certainly not a substance in the same sense as mass. Mass
can be detected by means of scales, but what of heat? Does a piece of
iron weigh more when red-hot than when ice-cold? Experiment shows that
it does not. If heat is a substance at all, it is a weightless one. The
“heat-substance“ was usually called caloric and is our first
acquaintance among a whole family of weightless substances. Later we
shall have occasion to follow the history of the family, its rise and
fall. It is sufficient now to note the birth of this particular
member.</p>
<p>The purpose of any physical theory is to explain as wide a range of
phenomena as possible. It is justified in so far as it does make events
understandable. We have seen that the substance theory explains many of
the heat phenomena. It will soon become apparent, however, that this
again is a false clue, that heat cannot be regarded as a substance, even
weightless. This is clear if we think about some simple experiments
which marked the beginning of civilization.</p>
<p>We think of a substance as something which can be neither created nor
destroyed. Yet primitive man created by friction sufficient heat to
ignite wood. Examples of heating by friction are, as a matter of
fact,</p>
<p>much too numerous and familiar to need recounting. In all these cases
some quantity of heat is created, a fact difficult to account for by the
substance theory. It is true that a supporter of this theory could
invent arguments to account for it. His reasoning would run something
like this: u The substance theory can explain the apparent creation of
heat. Take the simplest example of two pieces of wood rubbed one against
the other. Now rubbing is something which influences the wood and
changes its properties. It is very likely that the properties are so
modified that an unchanged quantity of heat comes to produce a higher
temperature than before. After all, the only thing we notice is the rise
in temperature. It is possible that the friction changes the specific
heat of the wood and not the total amount of heat.“</p>
<p>At this stage of the discussion it would be useless to argue with a
supporter of the substance theory, for this is a matter which can be
settled only by experiment. Imagine two identical pieces of wood and
suppose equal changes of temperature are induced by different methods;
in one case by friction and in the other by contact with a radiator, for
example. If the two pieces have the same specific heat at the new
temperature, the whole substance theory must break down. There are very
simple methods for determining specific heats, and the fate of the
theory depends on the result of just such measurements. Tests which are
capable of pronouncing a verdict of life or death on a theory occur
frequently in the history of physics, and are called crucial</p>
<p>experiments. The crucial value of an experiment is revealed only by
the way the question is formulated, and only one theory of the phenomena
can be put on trial by it. The determination of the specific heats of
two bodies of the same kind, at equal temperatures attained by friction
and heat flow respectively, is a typical example of a crucial
experiment. This experiment was performed about a hundred and fifty
years ago by Rumford, and dealt a death blow to the substance theory of
heat.</p>
<p>An extract from Rurnford’s own account tells the story:</p>
<p>It frequently happens, that in the ordinary affairs and occupations
of life, opportunities present themselves of contemplating some of the
most curious operations of Nature; and very interesting philosophical
experiments might often be made, almost without trouble or expense, by
means of machinery contrived for the mere mechanical purposes of the
arts and manufactures,</p>
<p>I have frequently had occasion to make this observation; and am
persuaded, that a habit of keeping the eyes open to every thing that is
going on in the ordinary course of the business of life has oftener led,
as it were by accident, or in the playful excursions of the imagination,
put into action by contemplating the most common appearances, to useful
doubts, and sensible schemes for investigation and improvement, than all
the more intense meditations of philosophers, in the hours expressly set
apart for study</p>
<p>Being engaged, lately, in superintending the boring of cannon, in the
workshops of the military arsenal at Munich, I was struck with the very
considerable degree of Heat which a brass gun acquires, in a short time,
in being bored; and with the still more intense Heat (much greater
than</p>
<p>that of boiling water, as I found by experiment) of the metallic
chips separated from it by the borer….</p>
<p>From whence comes the Heat actually produced in the mechanical
operation above mentioned?</p>
<p>Is it furnished by the metallic chips which are separated by the
borer from the solid mass of metal?</p>
<p>If this were the case, then, according to the modern doctrines of
latent Heat, and of caloric, the capacity ought not only to be changed,
but the change undergone by them should be sufficiently great to account
for all the Heat produced.</p>
<p>But no such change had taken place; for I found, upon taking equal
quantities, by weight, of these chips, and of thin slips of the same
block of metal separated by means of a fine saw and putting them, at the
same temperature (that of boiling water), into equal quantities of cold
water (that is to say, at the temperature of 59^° F.) the portion of
water into which the chips were put was not, to all appearance, heated
either less or more than the other portion, in which the slips of metal
were put.</p>
<p>Finally we reach his conclusion:</p>
<p>And, in reasoning on this subject, we must not forget to consider
that most remarkable circumstance, that the source of the Heat generated
by friction, in these Experiments, appeared evidently to be
inexhaustible.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to add, that anything which any insulated
body, or system of bodies, can continue to furnish without limitation,
cannot possibly be a material substance] and it appears to me to be
extremely difficult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea
of anything, capable of being excited and communicated, in the manner
the Heat was excited and communicated in these Experiments, except it be
MOTION.</p>
<p>Thus we see the breakdown of the old theory, or to be more exact, we
see that the substance theory is</p>
<p>limited to problems of heat flow. Again, as Rumford has intimated, we
must seek a new clue. To do this, let us leave for the moment the
problem of heat and return to mechanics.</p>
