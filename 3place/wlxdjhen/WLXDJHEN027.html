<h4 id="physics-and-reality">PHYSICS AND REALITY</h4>
<p>What are the general conclusions which can be drawn from the
development of physics indicated here in a broad outline representing
only the most fundamental ideas?</p>
<p>Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated
facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented
ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality
and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense
impressions. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is
whether and in what way our theories form such a link.</p>
<p>We have seen new realities created by the advance of physics. But
this chain of creation can be traced back far beyond the starting point
of physics. One of the most primitive concepts is that of an object. The
concepts of a tree, a horse, any material body, are creations gained on
the basis of experience, though the impressions from which they arise
are primitive in comparison with the world of physical phenomena. A cat
teasing a mouse also creates, by thought, its own primitive reality. The
fact that the cat reacts in a similar way toward any mouse it meets
shows that it forms concepts and theories which are its guide through
its own world of sense impressions.</p>
<p>“Three trees“ is something different from “two trees“. Again “two
trees“ is different from “two stones“. The concepts of the pure numbers
2, 3, 4, …, freed from the objects from which they arose, are creations
of the thinking mind which describe the reality of our world.</p>
<p>The psychological subjective feeling of time enables us to order our
impressions, to state that one event precedes another. But to connect
every instant of time with a number, by the use of a clock, to regard
time as a one-dimensional continuum, is already an invention. So also
are the concepts of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and our space
understood as a three-dimensional continuum.</p>
<p>Physics really began with the invention of mass, force, and an
inertial system. These concepts are all free inventions. They led to the
formulation of the mechanical point of view. For the physicist of the
early nineteenth century, the reality of our outer world consisted of
particles with simple forces acting between them and depending only on
the distance. He tried to retain as long as possible his belief that he
would succeed in explaining all events in nature by these fundamental
concepts of reality. The difficulties connected with the deflection of
the magnetic needle, the difficulties connected with the structure of
the ether, induced us to create a more subtle reality. The important
invention of the electromagnetic field appears. A courageous scientific
imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of
bodies, but</p>
<p>the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be
essential for ordering and understanding events.</p>
<p>Later developments both destroyed old concepts and created new ones.
Absolute time and the inertial co-ordinate system were abandoned by the
relativity theory. The background for all events was no longer the
one-dimensional time and the three-dimensional space continuum, but the
four-dimensional time-space continuum, another free invention, with new
transformation properties. The inertial co-ordinate system was no longer
needed. Every co-ordinate system is equally suited for the description
of events in nature.</p>
<p>The quantum theory again created new and essential features of our
reality. Discontinuity replaced continuity. Instead of laws governing
individuals, probability laws appeared.</p>
<p>The reality created by modern physics is, indeed, far removed from
the reality of the early days. But the aim of every physical theory
still remains the same.</p>
<p>With the help of physical theories we try to find our way through the
maze of observed facts, to order and understand the world of our sense
impressions. We want the observed facts to follow logically from our
concept of reality. Without the belief that it is possible to grasp the
reality with our theoretical constructions, without the belief in the
inner harmony of our world, there could be no science. This belief is
and always will remain the fundamental motive for all scientific
creation. Throughout all our efforts, in every dramatic</p>
<p>struggle between old and new views, we recognize the eternal longing
for understanding, the ever-firm belief in the harmony of our world,
continually strengthened by the increasing obstacles to
comprehension.</p>
<p>WE SUMMARIZE:</p>
<p>Again the rich variety of facts in the realm of atomic phenomena
forces us to invent new physical concepts. Matter has a granular
structure; it is composed of elementary particles, the elementary quanta
of matter. Thus, the electric charge has a granular structure and — most
important from the point of view of the quantum theory — so has energy.
Photons are the energy quanta of which light is composed.</p>
<p>Is light a wave or a shower of photons? Is a beam of electrons a
shower of elementary particles or a wave? These fundamental questions
are forced upon physics by experiment. In seeking to answer them we have
to abandon the description of atomic events as happenings in space and
time, we have to retreat still further from the old mechanical view.
Quantum physics formulates laws governing crowds and not individuals.
Not properties but probabilities are described, not laws disclosing the
future of systems are formulated, but laws governing the changes in time
of the probabilities and relating to great congregations of
individuals.</p>
