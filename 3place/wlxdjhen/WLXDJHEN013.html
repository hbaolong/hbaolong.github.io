<h4 id="the-magnetic-fluids">THE MAGNETIC FLUIDS</h4>
<p>We shall proceed here in the same manner as before, starting with
very simple facts and then seeking their theoretical explanation.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>We have two long bar magnets, one suspended freely at its centre,
the other held in the hand. The ends of the two magnets are brought
together in such a way that a strong attraction is noticed between them.
This can always be done. If no attraction results, we must turn the
magnet and try the other end. Something will happen if the bars are
magnetized at all. The</li>
</ol>
<p>ends of the magnets are called their poles. To continue with the
experiment we move the pole of the magnet held in the hand along the
other magnet. A decrease in the attraction is noticed and when the pole
reaches the middle of the suspended magnet there is no evidence of any
force at all. If the pole is moved farther in the same direction a
repulsion is observed, attaining its greatest strength at the second
pole of the hanging magnet.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The above experiment suggests another. Each</li>
</ol>
<p>magnet has two poles. Can we not isolate one of them? The idea is
very simple: just break a magnet into two equal parts. We have seen that
there is no force between the pole of one magnet and the middle of the
other. But the result of actually breaking a magnet is surprising and
unexpected. If we repeat the experiment described under i, with only
half a magnet suspended, the results are exactly the same as before !
Where there was no trace of magnetic force previously, there is now a
strong pole.</p>
<p>How are these facts to be explained? We can attempt to pattern a
theory of magnetism after the theory of electric fluids. This is
suggested by the fact that here, as in electrostatic phenomena, we have
attraction and repulsion. Imagine two spherical conductors possessing
equal charges, one positive and the other negative. Here “equal“ means
having the same absolute value; + 5 and —5, for example, have the same
absolute value. Let us assume that these spheres are connected</p>
<p>by means of an insulator such as a glass rod. Schematically this
arrangement can be represented by an arrow directed from the negatively
charged conductor to the positive one. We shall call the whole thing an
electric dipole. It is clear that two such dipoles would behave exactly
like the bar magnets in experiment i. If we think of our invention as a
model for a real magnet,</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 85</p>
<p>we may say, assuming the existence of magnetic fluids, that a magnet
is nothing but a magnet dipole y having at its ends two fluids of
different kinds. This simple theory, imitating the theory of
electricity, is adequate for an explanation of the first experiment.
There would be attraction at one end, repulsion at the other, and a
balancing of equal and opposite forces in the middle. But what of the
second experiment? By breaking the glass rod in the case of the electric
dipole we get two isolated poles. The same ought to hold good for the
iron bar of the magnetic dipole, contrary to the results of the second
experiment. Thus this contradiction forces us to introduce a somewhat
more subtle theory. Instead of our previous model we may imagine that
the magnet consists of very small elementary magnetic dipoles which
cannot be broken into separate poles. Order reigns in the magnet as a
whole, for all the elementary dipoles are directed in the same way.</p>
<p>We see immediately why cutting a magnet causes two new poles to
appear on the new ends, and why this more refined theory explains the
facts of experiment i as well as 2.</p>
<p>For many facts, the simpler theory gives an explanation and the
refinement seems unnecessary. Let us take an example: We know that a
magnet attracts pieces of</p>
<p>iron. Whyr In a piece of ordinary iron the two magnetic fluids are
mixed, so that no net effect results. Bringing a positive pole near acts
as a “command of division“ to the fluids, attracting the negative fluid
of the iron and repelling the positive. The attraction between iron and
magnet follows^If the magnet is removed, the fluids go back to more or
less their original state, depending on the extent to which they
remember the commanding voice of the external force.</p>
<p>Little need be said about the quantitative side of the problem. With
two very long magnetized rods we could investigate the attraction (or
repulsion) of their poles when brought near one another. The effect of
the other ends of the rods is negligible if the rods are long enough.
How does the attraction or repulsion depend on the distance between the
poles? The answer given by Coulomb’s experiment is that this dependence
on distance is the same as in Newton’s law of gravitation and Coulomb’s
law of electrostatics.</p>
<p>We see again in this theory the application of a general point of
view: the tendency to describe all phenomena by means of attractive and
repulsive forces depending only on distance and acting betweenr
unchangeable particles.</p>
<p>One well-known fact should be mentioned, for later we shall make use
of it. The earth is a great magnetic dipole. There is not the slightest
trace of an explanation as to why this is true. The North Pole is
approximately the minus (—) and the South Pole the plus (-f) magnetic
pole of the earth. The names plus and minus are</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 87</p>
<p>only a matter of convention, but when once fixed, enable us to
designate poles in any other case. A magnetic needle supported on a
vertical axis obeys the command of the magnetic force of the earth. It
directs its ( + ) pole toward the North Pole, that is, toward the (-)
magnetic pole of the earth.</p>
<p>Although we can consistently carry out the mechanical view in the
domain of electric and magnetic phenomena introduced here, there is no
reason to be particularly proud or pleased about it. Some features of
the theory are certainly unsatisfactory if not discouraging. New kinds
of substances had to be invented: two electric fluids and the elementary
magnetic dipoles. The wealth of substances begins to be overwhelming
!</p>
<p>The forces are simple. They are expressible in a similar way for
gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces. But the price paid for
this simplicity is high: the introduction of new weightless substances.
These are rather artificial concepts, and quite unrelated to the
fundamental substance, mass.</p>
