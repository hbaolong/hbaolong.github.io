<h4 id="continuity-discontinuity">CONTINUITY, DISCONTINUITY</h4>
<p>A MAP of New York City and the surrounding country is spread before
us. We ask: which points on this map can be reached by train? After
looking up these points in a railway timetable, we mark them on the map.
We now change our question and ask: which points can be reached by car?
If we draw lines on the map representing all the roads starting from New
York, every point on these roads can, in fact, be reached by car. In
both cases we have sets of points. In the first they are separated from
each other and represent the different railway stations, and in the
second they are the points along the lines representing the roads. Our
next question is about the distance of each of these points from New
York, or, to be more rigorous, from a certain spot in that city. In the
first case, certain numbers correspond to the points on our map. These
numbers change by irregular, but always finite, leaps and bounds. We
say: the distances from New York of the places which can be reached by
train change only in a discontinuous way. Those of the places which can
be</p>
<p>reached by car, however, may change by steps as small as we wish,
they can vary in a continuous way. The changes in distance can be made
arbitrarily small in the case of a car, but not in the case of a
train.</p>
<p>The output of a coal mine can change in a continuous way. The amount
of coal produced can be decreased or increased by arbitrarily small
steps. But the number of miners employed can change only
discon-tinuously. It would be pure nonsense to say: “Since yesterday,
the number of employees has increased by</p>
<p>3-783.“</p>
<p>Asked about the amount of money in his pocket, a man can give a
number containing only two decimals. A sum of money can change only by
jumps, in a discontinuous way. In America the smallest permissible
change or, as we shall call it, the “ elementary quantum’’ for American
money, is one cent. The elementary quantum for English money is one
farthing, worth only half the American elementary quantum. Here we have
an example of two elementary quanta whose mutual values can be compared.
The ratio of their values has a definite sense since one of them is
worth twice as much as the other.</p>
<p>We can say: some quantities can change continuously and others can
change only discontinuously, by steps which cannot be further decreased.
These indivisible steps are called the elementary quanta of the
particular quantity to which they refer.</p>
<p>We can weigh large quantities of sand and regard its mass as
continuous even though its granular structure</p>
<p>is evident. But if the sand were to become very precious and the
scales used very sensitive, we should have to consider the fact that the
mass always changes by a multiple number of one grain. The mass of this
one grain would be our elementary quantum. From this example we see how
the discontinuous character of a quantity, so far regarded as
continuous, can be detected by increasing the precision of our
measurements.</p>
<p>If we had to characterize the principal idea of the quantum theory in
one sentence, we could say: it must be assumed that some physical
quantities so far regarded as continuous are composed of elementary
quanta.</p>
<p>The region of facts covered by the quantum theory is tremendously
great. These facts have been disclosed by the highly developed technique
of modern experiment. As we can neither show nor describe even the basic
experiments, we shall frequently have to quote their results
dogmatically. Our aim is to explain the principal underlying ideas
only.</p>
