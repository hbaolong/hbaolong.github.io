<h4 id="light-spectra">LIGHT SPECTRA</h4>
<p>We already know that all matter is built of only a few kinds of
particles. Electrons were the first elementary particles of matter to be
discovered. But electrons are also the elementary quanta of negative
electricity. We learned furthermore that some phenomena force us to
assume that light is composed of elementary light quanta, differing for
different wave-lengths. Before proceeding we must discuss some physical
phenomena in which matter as well as radiation plays an essential role.
The sun emits radiation which can be split into its components by a
prism. The continuous spectrum of</p>
<p>the sun can thus be obtained. Every wave-length between the two ends
of the visible spectrum is represented. Let us take another example. It
was previously mentioned that sodium when incandescent emits homogeneous
light, light of one colour or one wave-length. If incandescent sodium is
placed before the prism, we see only one yellow line. In general, if a
radiating body is placed before the prism, then the light it emits is
split up into its components, revealing the spectrum characteristic of
the emitting body.</p>
<p>The discharge of electricity in a tube containing gas produces a
source of light such as seen in the neon tubes used for luminous
advertisements. Suppose such a tube is placed before a spectroscope. The
spectroscope is an instrument which acts like a prism, but with much
greater accuracy and sensitiveness; it splits light into its components,
that is, it analyses it. Light from the sun, seen through a
spectroscope, gives a continuous spectrum; all wave-lengths are
represented in it. If, however, the source of light is a gas through
which a current of electricity passes, the spectrum is of a different
character. Instead of the continuous, multi-coloured design of the sun’s
spectrum, bright, separated stripes appear on a continuous dark
background. Every stripe, if it is very narrow, corresponds to a
definite colour or, in the language of the wave theory, to a definite
wavelength. For example, if twenty lines are visible in the spectrum,
each of them will be designated by one of twenty numbers expressing the
corresponding wavelength. The vapours of the various elements
possess</p>
<p>different systems of lines, and thus different combinations of
numbers designating the wave-lengths composing the emitted light
spectrum. No two elements have identical systems of stripes in their
characteristic spectra, just as no two persons have exactly identical
finger-prints. As a catalogue of these lines was worked out by
physicists, the existence of laws gradually became evident, and it was
possible to replace some of the columns of seemingly disconnected
numbers expressing the length of the various waves by one simple
mathematical formula.</p>
<p>All that has just been said can now be translated into the photon
language. The stripes correspond to certain definite wave-lengths or, in
other words, to photons with a definite energy. Luminous gases do not,
therefore, emit photons with all possible energies, but only those
characteristic of the substance. Reality again limits the wealth of
possibilities.</p>
<p>Atoms of a particular element, say, hydrogen, can emit only photons
with definite energies. Only the emission of definite energy quanta is
permissible, all others being prohibited. Imagine, for the sake of
simplicity, that some element emits only one line, that is, photons of a
quite definite energy. The atom is richer in energy before the emission
and poorer afterwards. From the energy principle it must follow that the
energy level of an atom is higher before emission and lower afterwards,
and that the difference between the two levels must be equal to the
energy of the emitted photon. Thus the fact that an atom of a certain
element emits radiation of one wave-length only, that is photons of
a</p>
<p>definite energy only, could be expressed differently: only two energy
levels are permissible in an atom of this element and the emission of a
photon corresponds to the transition of the atom from the higher to the
lower energy level.</p>
<p>But more than one line appears in the spectra of the elements, as a
rule. The photons emitted correspond to many energies and not to one
only. Or, in other words, we must assume that many energy levels are
allowed in an atom and that the emission of a photon corresponds to the
transition of the atom from a higher energy level to a lower one. But it
is essential that not every energy level should be permitted, since not
every wave-length, not every photon-energy, appears in the spectra of an
element. Instead of saying that some definite lines, some definite
wave-lengths, belong to the spectrum of every atom, we can say that
every atom has some definite energy levels, and that the emission of
light quanta is associated with the transition of the atom from one
energy level to another. The energy levels are, as a rule, not
continuous but discontinuous. Again we see that the possibilities are
restricted by reality.</p>
<p>It was Bohr who showed for the first time why just these and no other
lines appear in the spectra. His theory, formulated twenty-five years
ago, draws a picture of the atom from which, at any rate in simple
cases, the spectra of the elements can be calculated and the apparently
dull and unrelated numbers are suddenly made coherent in the light of
the theory.</p>
<p>Bohr’s theory forms an intermediate step toward a</p>
<p>deeper and more general theory, called the wave or quantum mechanics.
It is our aim in these last pages to characterize the principal ideas of
this theory. Before doing so, we must mention one more theoretical and
experimental result of a more special character.</p>
<p>Our visible spectrum begins with a certain wavelength for the violet
colour and ends with a certain wave-length for the red colour. Or, in
other words, the energies of the photons in the visible spectrum are
always enclosed within the limits formed by the photon energies of the
violet and red lights. This limitation is, of course, only a property of
the human eye. If the difference in energy of some of the energy levels
is sufficiently great, then an ultraviolet photon will be sent out,
giving a line beyond the visible spectrum. Its presence cannot be
detected by the naked eye; a photographic plate must be used.</p>
<p>X-rays are also composed of photons of a much greater energy than
those of visible light, or in other words, their wave-lengths are much
smaller, thousands of times smaller in fact, than those of visible
light.</p>
<p>But is it possible to determine such small wavelengths
experimentally? It was difficult enough to do so for ordinary light. We
had to have small obstacles or small apertures. Two pinholes very near
to each other, showing diffraction for ordinary light, would have to be
many thousands of times smaller and closer together to show diffraction
for X-rays.</p>
<p>How then can we measure the wave-lengths of these rays? Nature
herself comes to our aid.</p>
<p>A crystal is a conglomeration of atoms arranged at very short
distances from each other on a perfectly regular plan. Our drawing shows
a simple model of the structure of a crystal. Instead of minute
apertures, there are extremely small obstacles formed by the atoms</p>
<p>of the element, arranged very close to each other in absolutely
regular order. The distances between the atoms, as found from the theory
of the crystal structure, are so small that they might be expected to
show the effect of diffraction for X-rays. Experiment proved that it is,
in fact, possible to diffract the X-ray wave by means of these closely
packed obstacles disposed in the regular three-dimensional arrangement
occurring in a crystal.</p>
<p>Suppose that a beam of X-rays falls upon a crystal and, after passing
through it, is recorded on a photo-</p>
<p>graphic plate. The plate then shows the diffraction pattern. Various
methods have been used to study the X-ray spectra, to deduce data
concerning the wavelength from the diffraction pattern. What has been
said here in a few words would fill volumes if all theoretical and
experimental details were set forth. In Plate III we give only one
diffraction pattern obtained by one of the various methods. We again see
the dark and light rings so characteristic of the wave theory. In the
centre the non-diffracted ray is visible. If the crystal were not
brought between the X-rays and the photographic plate, only the light
spot in the centre would be seen. From photographs of this kind the
wave-lengths of the X-ray spectra can be calculated and, on the other
hand, if the wave-length is known, conclusions can be drawn about the
structure of the crystal.</p>
