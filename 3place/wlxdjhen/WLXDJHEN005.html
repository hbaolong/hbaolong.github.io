<h4 id="the-great-mystery-story">THE GREAT MYSTERY STORY</h4>
<p>IN IMAGINATION there exists the perfect mystery story. Such a story
presents all the essential clues, and compels us to form our own theory
of the case. If we follow the plot carefully, we arrive at the complete
solution for ourselves just before the author’s disclosure at the end of
the book. The solution itself, contrary to those of inferior mysteries,
does not disappoint us; moreover, it appears at the very moment we
expect it.</p>
<p>Can we liken the reader of such a book to the scientists, who
throughout successive generations continue to seek solutions of the
mysteries in the book of nature? The comparison is false and will have
to be abandoned later, but it has a modicum of justification which may
be extended and modified to make it more appropriate to the endeavour of
science to solve the mystery of the universe.</p>
<p>This great mystery story is still unsolved. We cannot</p>
<p>even be sure that it has a final solution. The reading has already
given us much; it has taught us the rudiments of the language of nature;
it has enabled us to understand many of the clues, and has been a source
of joy and excitement in the oftentimes painful advance of science. But
we realize that in spite of all the volumes read and understood we are
still far from a complete solution, if, indeed, such a thing exists at
all. At every stage we try to find an explanation consistent with the
clues already discovered. Tentatively accepted theories have explained
many of the facts, but no general solution compatible with all known
clues has yet been evolved. Very often a seemingly perfect theory has
proved inadequate in the light of further reading. New facts appear,
contradicting the theory or unexplained by it. The more we read, the
more fully do we appreciate the perfect construction of the book, even
though a complete solution seems to recede as we advance.</p>
<p>In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan
Doyle there comes a time when the investigator has collected all the
facts he needs for at least some phase of his problem. These facts often
seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated. The great
detective, however, realizes that no further investigation is needed at
the moment, and that only pure thinking will lead to a correlation of
the facts collected. So he plays his violin, or lounges in his armchair
enjoying a pipe, when suddenly, by Jove, he has it! Not only does he
have an explanation for the clues at hand,</p>
<p>but he knows that certain other events must have happened. Since he
now knows exactly where to look for it, he may go out, if he likes, to
collect further confirmation for his theory.</p>
<p>The scientist reading the book of nature, if we may be allowed to
repeat the trite phrase, must find the solution for himself; for he
cannot, as impatient readers of other stories often do, turn to the end
of the book. In our case the reader is also the investigator, seeking to
explain, at least in part, the relation of events to their rich context.
To obtain even a partial solution the scientist must collect the
unordered facts available and make them coherent and understandable by
creative thought.</p>
<p>It is our aim, in the following pages, to describe in broad outline
that work of physicists which corresponds to the pure thinking of the
investigator. We shall be chiefly concerned with the role of thoughts
and ideas in the adventurous search for knowledge of the physical
world.</p>
<p>THE FIRST GLUE</p>
<p>Attempts to read the great mystery story are as old as human thought
itself. Only a little over three hundred years ago, however, did
scientists begin to understand the language of the story. Since that
time, the age of Galileo and Newton, the reading has proceeded rapidly.
Techniques of investigation, systematic methods of finding and following
clues, have been developed. Some of</p>
<p>the riddles of nature have been solved, although many of the
solutions have proved temporary and superficial in the light of further
research.</p>
<p>A most fundamental problem, for thousands of years wholly obscured by
its complications, is that of motion. All those motions we observe in
nature—that of a stone thrown into the air, a ship sailing the sea, a
cart pushed along the street—are in reality very intricate. To
understand these phenomena it is wise to begin with the simplest
possible cases, and proceed gradually to the more complicated ones.
Consider a body at rest, where there is no motion at all. To change the
position of such a body it is necessary to exert some influence upon it,
to push it or lift it, or let other bodies, such as horses or steam
engines, act upon it. Our intuitive idea is that motion is connected
with the acts of pushing, lifting or pulling. Repeated experience would
make us risk the further statement that we must push harder if we wish
to move the body faster. It seems natural to conclude that the stronger
the action exerted on a body, the greater will be its speed. A
four-horse carriage goes faster than a carriage drawn by only two
horses. Intuition thus tells us that speed is essentially connected with
action.</p>
<p>It is a familiar fact to readers of detective fiction that a false
clue muddles the story and postpones the solution. The method of
reasoning dictated by intuition was wrong and led to false ideas of
motion which were held for centuries. Aristotle’s great authority
throughout Europe was perhaps the chief reason for</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW ^</p>
<p>the long belief in this intuitive idea. We read in the Mechanics ,
for two thousand years attributed to him:</p>
<p>The moving body comes to a standstill when the force which pushes it
along can no longer so act as to push it.</p>
<p>The discovery and use of scientific reasoning by Galileo was one of
the most important achievements in the history of human thought, and
marks the real beginning of physics. This discovery taught us that
intuitive conclusions based on immediate observation are not always to
be trusted, for they sometimes lead to the wrong clues.</p>
<p>But where does intuition go wrong? Can it possibly be wrong to say
that a carriage drawn by four horses must travel faster than one drawn
by only two?</p>
<p>Let us examine the fundamental facts of motion more closely, starting
with simple everyday experiences familiar to mankind since the beginning
of civilization and gained in the hard struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Suppose that someone going along a level road with a pushcart
suddenly stops pushing. The cart will go on moving for a short distance
before coming to rest. We ask: how is it possible to increase this
distance? There are various ways, such as oiling the wheels, and making
the road very smooth. The more easily the wheels turn, and the smoother
the road, the longer the cart will go on moving. And just what has been
done by the oiling and smoothing? Only this: the external influences
have been made smaller. The effect of what is called friction has been
diminished, both in the wheels and between the wheels and the road. This
is</p>
<p>already a theoretical interpretation of the observable evidence, an
interpretation which is, in fact, arbitrary. One significant step
farther and we shall have the right clue. Imagine a road perfectly
smooth, and wheels with no friction at all. Then there would be nothing
to stop the cart, so that it would run for ever. This conclusion is
reached only by thinking of an idealized experiment, which can never be
actually performed, since it is impossible to eliminate all external
influences. The idealized experiment shows the clue which really formed
the foundation of the mechanics of motion.</p>
<p>Comparing the two methods of approaching the problem, we can say: the
intuitive idea is—the greater the action, the greater the velocity. Thus
the velocity shows whether or not external forces are acting on a body.
The new clue found by Galileo is: if a body is neither pushed, pulled,
nor acted on in any other way, or, more briefly, if no external forces
act on a body, it moves uniformly, that is, always with the same
velocity along a straight line. Thus, the velocity does not show whether
or not external forces are acting on a body. Galileo’s conclusion, the
correct one, was formulated a generation later by Newton as the law of
inertia. It is usually the first thing about physics which we learn by
heart in school, and some of us may remember it:</p>
<p>Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a
right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed thereon.</p>
<p>We have seen that this law of inertia cannot be</p>
<p>derived directly from experiment, but only by speculative thinking
consistent with observation. The idealized experiment can never be
actually performed, although it leads to a profound understanding of
real experiments.</p>
<p>From the variety of complex motions in the world around us we choose
as our first example uniform motion. This is the simplest, because there
are no external forces acting. Uniform motion can, however, never be
realized; a stone thrown from a tower, a cart pushed along a road can
never move absolutely uniformly because we cannot eliminate the
influence of external forces.</p>
<p>In a good mystery story the most obvious clues often lead to the
wrong suspects. In our attempts to understand the laws of nature we
find, similarly, that the most obvious intuitive explanation is often
the wrong one.</p>
<p>Human thought creates an ever-changing picture of the universe.
Galileo’s contribution was to destroy the intuitive view and replace it
by a new one. This is the significance of Galileo’s discovery.</p>
<p>But a further question concerning motion arises immediately. If the
velocity is no indication of the external forces acting on a body, what
is? The answer to this fundamental question was found by Galileo and
still more concisely by Newton, and forms a further clue in our
investigation.</p>
<p>To find the correct answer we must think a little more deeply about
the cart on a perfectly smooth road.</p>
<p>In our idealized experiment the uniformity of the motion was due to
the absence of all external forces. Let us now imagine that the
uniformly moving cart is given a push in the direction of the motion.
What happens now? Obviously its speed is increased. Just as obviously, a
push in the direction opposite to that of the motion would decrease the
speed. In the first case the cart is accelerated by the push, in the
second case decelerated, or slowed down. A conclusion follows at once:
the action of an external force changes the velocity. Thus not the
velocity itself but its change is a consequence of pushing or pulling.
Such a force either increases or decreases the velocity according to
whether it acts in the direction of motion or in the opposite direction.
Galileo saw this clearly and wrote in his Two New Sciences:</p>
<p>… any velocity once imparted to a moving body will be rigidly
maintained as long as the external causes of acceleration or retardation
are removed, a condition which is found only on horizontal planes; for
in the case of planes which slope downwards there is already present a
cause of acceleration; while on planes sloping upwards there is
retardation; from this it follows that motion along a horizontal plane
is perpetual; for, if the velocity be uniform, it cannot be diminished
or slackened, much less destroyed.</p>
<p>By following the right clue we achieve a deeper understanding of the
problem of motion. The connection between force and the change of
velocity—and not, as we should think according to our intuition, the
connection between force and the velocity itself—is</p>
<p>the basis of classical mechanics as formulated by Newton.</p>
<p>We have been making use of two concepts which play principal roles in
classical mechanics: force and change of velocity. In the further
development of science both of these concepts are extended and
generalized. They must, therefore, be examined more closely.</p>
<p>What is force? Intuitively, we feel what is meant by this term. The
concept arose from the effort of pushing, throwing or pulling—from the
muscular sensation accompanying each of these acts. But its
generalization goes far beyond these simple examples. We can think of
force even without picturing a horse pulling a carriage ! We speak of
the force of attraction between the sun and the earth, the earth and the
moon, and of those forces which cause the tides. We speak of the force
by which the earth compels ourselves and all the objects about us to
remain within its sphere of influence, and of the force with which the
wind makes waves on the sea, or moves the leaves of trees. When and
where we observe a change in velocity, an external force, in the general
sense, must be held responsible. Newton wrote in his Principle,:</p>
<p>An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to
change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a
right line.</p>
<p>This force consists in the action only; and remains no longer in the
body, when the action is over. For a body maintains every new state it
acquires, by its vis inertiae only. Impressed forces are of different
origins; as from percussion, from pressure, from centripetal force.</p>
<p>If a stone is dropped from the top of a tower its motion is by no
means uniform; the velocity increases as the stone falls. We conclude:
an external force is acting in the direction of the motion. Or, in other
words: the earth attracts the stone. Let us take another example. What
happens when a stone is thrown straight upward? The velocity decreases
until the stone reaches its highest point and begins to fall. This
decrease in velocity is caused by the same force as the acceleration of
a falling body. In one case the force acts in the direction of the
motion, in the other case in the opposite direction. The force is the
same, but it causes acceleration or deceleration according to whether
the stone is dropped or thrown upward.</p>
