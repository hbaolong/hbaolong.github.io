<h4 id="the-philosophical-background">THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>The results of scientific research very often force a change in the
philosophical view of problems which extend far beyond the restricted
domain of science itself. What is the aim of science? What is demanded
of a theory which attempts to describe nature? These questions, although
exceeding the bounds of physics, are intimately related to it, since
science forms the material from which they arise. Philosophical
generalizations must be founded on scientific results. Once formed and
widely accepted, however, they very often influence the further
development of scientific thought by indicating one of the many possible
lines of procedure. Successful revolt against the accepted view results
in unexpected and completely different developments, becoming a source
of new philosophical aspects. These remarks necessarily sound vague and
pointless until illustrated by examples quoted from the history of
physics.</p>
<p>We shall here try to describe the first philosophical ideas on the
aim of science. These ideas greatly influenced the development of
physics until nearly a hundred years ago, when their discarding was
forced by new evidence, new facts and theories, which in their turn
formed a new background for science.</p>
<p>In the whole history of science from Greek philosophy to modern
physics there have been constant attempts to reduce the apparent
complexity of natural phenomena to some simple fundamental ideas and
relations. This is the underlying principle of all natural philosophy.
It is expressed even in the work of the Atomists. Twenty-three centuries
ago Democritus wrote:</p>
<p>By convention sweet is sweet, by convention bitter is bitter, by
convention hot is hot, by convention cold is cold, by convention colour
is colour. But in reality there are atoms and the void. That is, the
objects of sense are supposed to be real and it is customary to regard
them as such, but in truth they are not. Only the atoms and the void are
real.</p>
<p>This idea remains in ancient philosophy nothing more than an
ingenious figment of the imagination. Laws of nature relating subsequent
events were unknown to the Greeks. Science connecting theory and
experiment really began with the work of Galileo. We have followed the
initial clues leading to the laws of motion. Throughout two hundred
years of scientific research force and matter were the underlying
concepts in all endeavours to understand nature. It is impossible to
imagine one without the other because matter demonstrates its existence
as a source of force by its action on other matter.</p>
<p>Let us consider the simplest example: two particles with forces
acting between them. The easiest forces to imagine are those of
attraction and repulsion. In both cases the force vectors lie on a line
connecting the</p>
<p>material points. The demand for simplicity leads to the picture of
particles attracting or repelling each other;</p>
<p>Attraction</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Repulsion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>any other assumption about the direction of the acting forces would
give a much more complicated picture. Can we make an equally simple
assumption about the length of the force vectors? Even if we want to
avoid too special assumptions we can still say one thing: the force
between any two given particles depends only on the distance between
them, like gravitational forces. This seems simple enough. Much more
complicated forces could be imagined, such as those which might depend
not only on the distance but also on the velocities of the two
particles. With matter and force as our fundamental concepts, we can
hardly imagine simpler assumptions than that forces act along the line
connecting the particles and depend only on the distance. But is it
possible to describe all physical phenomena by forces of this kind
alone?</p>
<p>The great achievements of mechanics in all its branches, its striking
success in the development of astronomy, the application of its ideas to
problems apparently different and non-mechanical in character, all these
things contributed to the belief that it is possible</p>
<p>to describe all natural phenomena in terms of simple forces between
unalterable objects. Throughout the two centuries following Galileo’s
time such an endeavour, conscious or unconscious, is apparent in nearly
all scientific creation. This was clearly formulated by Helmholtz about
the middle of the nineteenth century:</p>
<p>Finally, therefore, we discover the problem of physical material
science to be to refer natural phenomena back to unchangeable attractive
and repulsive forces whose intensity depends wholly upon distance. The
solubility of this problem is the condition of the complete
comprehensibility of nature.</p>
<p>Thus, according to Helmholtz, the line of development of science is
determined and follows strictly a fixed course:</p>
<p>And its vocation will be ended as soon as the reduction of natural
phenomena to simple forces is complete and the proof given that this is
the only reduction of which the phenomena are capable.</p>
<p>This view appears dull and naive to a twentieth-century physicist. It
would frighten him to think that the great adventure of research could
be so soon finished, and an unexciting if infallible picture of the
universe established for all time.</p>
<p>Although these tenets would reduce the description of all events to
simple forces, they do leave open the question of just how the forces
should depend on distance. It is possible that for different phenomena
this dependence is different. The necessity of introducing many
different kinds of force for different events is</p>
<p>certainly unsatisfactory from a philosophical point of view.
Nevertheless this so-called mechanical view, most clearly formulated by
Helmholtz, played an important role in its time. The development of the
kinetic theory of matter is one of the greatest achievements directly
influenced by the mechanical view.</p>
<p>Before witnessing its decline, let us provisionally accept the point
of view held by the physicists of the past century and see what
conclusions we can draw from their picture of the external world.</p>
<p>THE KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER Is it possible to explain the phenomena
of heat in terms of the motions of particles interacting through simple
forces? A closed vessel contains a certain mass of gas — air, for
example — at a certain temperature. By heating we raise the temperature,
and thus increase the energy. But how is this heat connected with
motion? The possibility of such a connection is suggested both by our
tentatively accepted philosophical point of view and by the way in which
heat is generated by motion. Heat must be mechanical energy if every
problem is a mechanical one. The gljr/it flf *^r kmtic theory is to
present the cop<sup>p</sup> of matVr just in this way. According to this
theory a gas is a congregation</p>
<p>Of ar&gt;</p>
<p>moving in all directions T colliding with^ each other and changing in
direction of motiorpwith each collision. There must exist an average
speed of molecules, just as in a large human community there exists an
average</p>
<p>age, or an average wealth. There will therefore^be an average kinetic
energy per particle. More heat in the vessel means a greater
^verageTffietic energy. Thus heat, accofdlilgTo tKiiTpicture, is not a
special form of energy different from the mechanical one but is just the
kinetic energy of molecular motion. To any definite temperature there
corresponds a definite average kinetic energy per molecule. This is, in
fact, not an arbitrary assumption. We are forced to regard the kinetic
energy of a molecule as a measure of the temperature of the gas if we
wish to form a consistent mechanical picture of matter.</p>
<p>This theory is more than a play of the imagination. It can be shown
that the kinetic theory of gases is not only in agreement with
experiment, but actually leads to a more profound understanding of the
facts. This may be illustrated by a few examples.</p>
<p>We have a vessel closed by a piston which can move freely. The vessel
contains a certain amount of gas to be kept at a constant temperature.
If the piston is initially at rest in some position, it can be moved
upward by removing and downward by adding weight. To push the piston
down force must be used acting against the inner pressure of the gas.
What is the mechanism of this inner pressure according to the kinetic
theory? A tremendous number of particles constituting the gas are moving
in all directions. They bombard the walls and the piston, bouncing back
like balls thrown against a wall. This continual bombardment by a great
number of particles keeps the piston at a certain height by</p>
<p>opposing the force of gravity acting downward on the piston and the
weights. In one direction there is a constant gravitational force, in
the other very many irregular blows from the molecules. The net effect
on the piston of all these small irregular forces must be equal to that
of the force of gravity if there is to be equilibrium.</p>
<p>Inner Pressure</p>
<p>Gravitational Force</p>
<p>Suppose the piston were pushed down so as to compress the gas to a
fraction of its former volume, say one-half, its temperature being kept
unchanged. What, according to the kinetic theory, can we expect to
happen? Will the force due to the bombardment be more or less effective
than before? The particles are now packed more closely. Although the
average kinetic energy is still the same, the collisions of the
particles with the piston will now occur more frequently and thus the
total force will be greater. It is clear from this</p>
<p>picture presented by the kinetic theory that to keep the piston in
this lower position more weight is required. This simple experimental
fact is well known, but its prediction follows logically from the
kinetic view of matter.</p>
<p>Consider another experimental arrangement. Take two vessels
containing equal volumes of different gases, say hydrogen and nitrogen,
both at the same temperature. Assume the two vessels are closed with
identical pistons, on which are equal weights. This means, briefly, that
both gases have the same volume, temperature, and pressure. Since the
temperatue is the same, so, according to the theory, is the average
kinetic energy per particle. Since the pressures are equal, the two
pistons are bombarded with the same total force. On the average every
particle carries the same energy and both vessels have the same volume.
Therefore, the number of molecules in each must be the same, although
the gases are chemically different. This result is very important for
the understanding of many chemical phenomena. It means that the number
of molecules in a given volume, at a certain temperature and pressure,
is something which is characteristic, not of a particular gas, but of
all gases. It is most astonishing that the kinetic theory not only
predicts the existence of such a universal number, but enables us to
determine it. To this point we shall return very soon.</p>
<p>The kinetic theory of matter explains quantitatively as well as
qualitatively the laws of gases as determined by experiment.
Furthermore, the theory is not restricted</p>
<p>to gases, although its greatest successes have been in this
domain.</p>
<p>A gas can be liquefied by means of a decrease of temperature. A fall
in the temperature of matter means a decrease in the average kinetic
energy of its particles. It is therefore clear that the average kinetic
energy of a liquid particle is smaller than that of a corresponding gas
particle.</p>
<p>A striking manifestation of the motion of particles in liquids was
given for the first time by the so-called Brownian movement, a
remarkable phenomenon which would remain quite mysterious and
incomprehensible without the kinetic theory of matter. It was first
observed by the botanist Brown, and was explained eighty years later, at
the beginning of this century. The only apparatus necessary for
observing Brownian motion is a microscope, which need not even be a
particularly good one.</p>
<p>Brown was working with grains of pollen of certain plants, that
is:</p>
<p>particles or granules of unusually large size varying from one
four-thousandth to about five-thousandth of an inch in length.</p>
<p>He reports further:</p>
<p>While examining the form of these particles immersed in water, I
observed many of them evidently in motion…. These motions were such as
to satisfy me, after frequently repeated observation, that they arose
neither from current in the fluid nor from its gradual evaporation, but
belonged to the particle itself.</p>
<p>What Brown observed was the unceasing agitation of the granules when
suspended in water and visible through the microscope. It is an
impressive sight!</p>
<p>Is the choice of particular plants essential for the phenomenon?
Brown answered this question by repeating the experiment with many
different plants, and found that all the granules, if sufficiently
small, showed such motion when suspended in water. Furthermore, he found
the same kind of restless, irregular motion in very small particles of
inorganic as well as organic substances. Even with a pulverized fragment
of a sphinx he observed the same phenomenon!</p>
<p>How is this motion to be explained? It seems contradictory to all
previous experience. Examination of the position of one suspended
particle, say every thirty seconds, reveals the fantastic form of its
path. The amazing thing is the apparently eternal character of the
motion. A swinging pendulum placed in water soon comes to rest if not
impelled by some external force. The existence of a never-diminishing
motion seems contrary to all experience. This difficulty was splendidly
clarified by the kinetic theory of matter.</p>
<p>Looking at water through even our most powerful microscopes we cannot
see molecules and their motion as pictured by the kinetic theory of
matter. It must be concluded that if the theory of water as a
congregation of particles is correct, the size of the particles must be
beyond the limit of visibility of the best microscopes. Let us
nevertheless stick to the theory and assume that it represents a
consistent picture of reality.</p>
<p>The Brownian particles visible through a microscope are bombarded by
the smaller ones composing the water itself. The Brownian movement
exists if the bombarded particles are sufficiently small. It exists
because this bombardment is not uniform from all sides and cannot be
averaged out, owing to its irregular and haphazard character. The
observed motion is thus the result of the unobservable one. The
behaviour of the big particles reflects in some way that of the
molecules, constituting, so to speak, a magnification so high that it
becomes visible through the microscope. The irregular and haphazard
character of the path of the Brownian particles reflects a similar
irregularity in the path of the smaller particles which constitute
matter. We can understand, therefore, that a quantitative study of
Brownian movement can give us deeper insight into the kinetic theory of
matter. It is apparent that the visible Brownian motion depends on the
size of the invisible bombarding molecules. There would be no Brdwnian
motion at all if the bombarding molecules did not possess a certain
amount of energy or, in other words, if they did not have mass and
velocity. That the study of Brownian motion can lead to a determination
of the mass of a molecule is therefore not astonishing.</p>
<p>Through laborious research, both theoretical and experimental, the
quantitative features of the kinetic theory were formed. The clue
originating in the phenomenon of Brownian movement was one of those
which led to the quantitative data. The same data can</p>
<p>EE 3</p>
<p>be obtained in different ways, starting from quite different clues.
The fact that all these methods support the same view is most important,
for it demonstrates the internal consistency of the kinetic theory of
matter.</p>
<p>Only one of the many quantitative results reached by experiment and
theory will be mentioned here. Suppose we have a gram of the lightest of
all elements, hydrogen, and ask: how many particles are there in this
one gram? The answer will characterize not only hydrogen but also all
other gases, for we already know under what conditions two gases have
the same number of particles.</p>
<p>The theory enables us to answer this question from certain
measurements of the Brownian motion of a suspended particle. The answer
is an astonishingly great number: a three followed by twenty-three other
digits ! The number of molecules in one gram of hydrogen is
303,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Imagine the molecules of a gram of hydrogen so increased in size that
they are visible through a microscope: say that the diameter becomes one
five-thousandth of an inch, such as that of a Brownian particle. Then,
to pack them closely, we should have to use a box each side of which is
about one-quarter of a mile long !</p>
<p>We can easily calculate the mass of one such hydrogen molecule by
dividing i by the number quoted above. The answer is a fantastically
small number:</p>
<p>o-ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0033 gram, representing the mass of one
molecule of hydrogen.</p>
<p>PLATE I</p>
<p>Brownian particles seen through a microscope</p>
<p>One Brownian particle photographed by a long exposure and covering a
surface</p>
<p>Consecutive positions observed for one of the Brownian particles</p>
<p>The path avenged from these consecutive positions</p>
<p>The experiments on Brownian motion are only some of the many
independent experiments leading to the determination of this number
which plays such an important part in physics.</p>
<p>In the kinetic theory of matter and in all its important achievements
we see the realization of the general philosophical programme: to reduce
the explanation of all phenomena to the interaction between particles of
matter.</p>
<p>WE SUMMARIZE:</p>
<p>In mechanics the future path of a moving body can be predicted and
its past disclosed if its present condition and the forces acting upon
it are known. Thus, for example, the future paths of all planets can be
foreseen. The active forces are Newton’s gravitational forces depending
on the distance alone. The great results of classical mechanics suggest
that the mechanical view can be consistently applied to all branches of
physics, that all phenomena can be explained by the action of forces
representing either attraction or repulsion, depending only upon
distance and acting between unchangeable particles.</p>
<p>In the kinetic theory of matter we see how this view, arising from
mechanical problems, embraces the phenomena of heat and how it leads to
a successful picture of the structure of matter.</p>
