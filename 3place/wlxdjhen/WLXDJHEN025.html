<h4 id="the-waves-of-matter">THE WAVES OF MATTER</h4>
<p>How can we understand the fact that only certain characteristic
wave-lengths appear in the spectra of the elements?</p>
<p>It has often happened in physics that an essential advance was
achieved by carrying out a consistent analogy between apparently
unrelated phenomena. In these pages we have often seen how ideas created
and developed in one branch of science were afterwards successfully
applied to another. The development of the mechanical and field views
gives many examples of this kind. The association of solved problems
with those unsolved may throw new light on our difficulties</p>
<p>(Photographed by A. G“. Shenslone) Spectral lines</p>
<p>(Photographed by iMstowiecki and Gregor]</p>
<p>Diffraction of X-rays</p>
<p>(Photographed by Ijoria and Klinger) Diffraction of electronic
waves</p>
<p>by suggesting new ideas. It is easy to find a superficial analogy
which really expresses nothing. But to discover some essential common
features, hidden beneath a surface of external differences, to form, on
this basis, a new successful theory, is important creative work. The
development of the so-called wave mechanics, begun by de Broglie and
Schrodinger, less than fifteen years ago, is a typical example of the
achievement of a successful theory by means of a deep and fortunate
analogy.</p>
<p>Our starting-point is a classical example having nothing to do with
modern physics. We take in our</p>
<p>hand the end of a very long flexible rubber tube, or a very long
spring, and try to move it rhythmically up and down, so that the end
oscillates. Then, as we have seen in many other examples, a wave is
created by the oscillation which spreads through the tube with a certain
velocity. If we imagine an infinitely long tube, then the portions of
waves, once started, will pursue their endless journey without
interference.</p>
<p>Now another case. The two ends of the same tube are fastened. If
preferred, a violin string may be used. What happens now if a wave is
created at one end of the rubber tube or cord? The wave begins its
journey as in the previous example, but it is soon reflected by the
other end of the tube. We now have two waves:</p>
<p>one creation by oscillation, the other by reflection; they travel in
opposite directions and interfere with each other. It would not be
difficult to trace the interference of the two waves and discover the
one wave resulting from their superposition; it is called the standing
wave. The two words “standing“ and “wave“ seem to contradict each other;
their combination is, nevertheless, justified by the result of the
superposition of the two waves.</p>
<p>The simplest example of a standing wave is the motion of a cord with
the two ends fixed, an up-and-down motion, as shown in our drawing. This
motion is</p>
<p>the result of one wave lying on the other when the two are travelling
in opposite directions. The characteristic feature of this motion is:
only the two end-points are at rest. They are called nodes. The wave
stands, so to speak, between the two nodes, all points of the cord
reaching simultaneously the maxima and minima of their deviation.</p>
<p>But this is only the simplest kind of a standing wave. There are
others. For example, a standing wave can have three nodes, one at each
end and one in the centre.</p>
<p>In this case three points are always at rest. A glance at the
drawings shows that here the wave-length is half as great as the one
with two nodes. Similarly, standing</p>
<p>waves can have four, five, and more nodes. The wavelength in each
case will depend on the number of nodes. This number can only be an
integer and can change only by jumps. The sentence—“the number of</p>
<p>nodes in a standing wave is 3*576“—is pure nonsense. Thus the
wave-length can only change discontinuously. Here, in this most
classical problem, we recognize the familiar features of the quantum
theory. The standing wave produced by a violin player is, in fact, still
more complicated, being a mixture of very many waves with two, three,
four, five, and more nodes and, therefore, a mixture of several
wave-lengths. Physics can analyse such a mixture into the simple
standing waves from which it is composed. Or, using our previous
terminology, we could say that the oscillating string has its spectrum,
just as an element emitting radiation. And, in the same way as for the
spectrum of an element, only certain wave-lengths are allowed, all
others being prohibited.</p>
<p>We have thus discovered some similarity between the oscillating cord
and the atom emitting radiation. Strange as this analogy may seem, let
us draw further conclusions from it and try to proceed with the
comparison, once having chosen it. The atoms of every element are
composed of elementary particles, the heavier constituting the nucleus,
and the lighter the electrons. Such a system of particles behaves like a
small acoustical instrument in which standing waves are produced.</p>
<p>Yet the standing wave is the result of interference between two or,
generally, even more moving waves. If there is some truth in our
analogy, a still simpler arrangement than that of the atom should
correspond to a spreading wave. What is the simplest arrangement? In our
material world, nothing can be simpler than an electron, an elementary
particle, on which no forces are acting, that is, an electron at rest or
in uniform motion. We could guess a further link in the chain of our
analogy: electron moving uniformly-&gt;waves of a definite length. This
was de Broglie’s new and courageous idea.</p>
<p>It was previously shown that there are phenomena in which light
reveals its wave-like character and others in which light reveals its
corpuscular character. After becoming used to the idea that light is a
wave, we found, to our. astonishment, that in some cases, for instance
in the photoelectric effect, it behaves like a shower of photons. Now we
have just the opposite state of affairs for electrons. We accustomed
ourselves</p>
<p>QUANTA</p>
<p>to the idea that electrons are particles, elementary quanta of
electricity and matter. Their charge and mass were investigated. If
there is any truth in de Broglie’s idea, then there must be some
phenomena in which matter reveals its wave-like character. At first,
this conclusion, reached by following the acoustical analogy, seems
strange and incomprehensible. How can a moving corpuscle have anything
to do with a wave? But this is not the first time we have faced a
difficulty of this kind in physics. We met the same problem in the
domain of light phenomena.</p>
<p>Fundamental ideas play the most essential role in forming a physical
theory. Books on physics are full of complicated mathematical formulae.
But thought and ideas, not formulae, are the beginning of every physical
theory. The ideas must later take the mathematical form of a
quantitative theory, to make possible the comparison with experiment.
This can be explained by the example of the problem with which we are
now dealing. The principal guess is that the uniformly moving electron
will behave, in some phenomena, like a wave. Assume that an electron or
a shower of electrons, provided they all have the same velocity, is
moving uniformly. The mass, charge, and velocity of each individual
electron are known. If we wish to associate in some way a wave concept
with a uniformly moving electron or electrons, our next question must
be: what is the wave-length? This is a quantitative question and a more
or less quantitative theory must be built up to answer it. This is
indeed a simple matter. The mathe-</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>matical simplicity of de Broglie’s work, providing an answer to this
question, is most astonishing. At the time his work was done, the
mathematical technique of other physical theories was very subtle and
complicated, comparatively speaking. The mathematics dealing with the
problem of waves of matter is extremely simple and elementary but the
fundamental ideas are deep and far-reaching.</p>
<p>Previously, in the case of light waves and photons, it was shown that
every statement formulated in the wave language can be translated into
the language of photons or light corpuscles. The same is true for
electronic waves. For uniformly moving electrons, the corpuscular
language is already known. But every statement expressed in the
corpuscular language can be translated into the wave language, just as
in the case of photons. Two clues laid down the rules of translation.
The analogy between light waves and electronic waves or photons and
electrons is one clue. We try to use the same method of translation for
matter as for light. The special relativity theory furnished the other
clue. The laws of nature must be invariant with respect to the Lorentz
and not to the classical transformation. These two clues together
determine the wave-length corresponding to a moving electron. It follows
from the theory that an electron moving with a velocity of, say, 10,000
miles per second, has a wave-length which can be easily calculated, and
which turns out to lie in the same region as the X-ray wave-lengths.
Thus we conclude further that if the wave character of matter</p>
<p>can be detected, it should be done experimentally in an analogous way
to that of X-rays.</p>
<p>Imagine an electron beam moving uniformly with a given velocity, or,
to use the wave terminology, a homogeneous electronic wave, and assume
that it falls on a very thin crystal, playing the part of a diffraction
grating. The distances between the diffracting obstacles in the crystal
are so small that diffraction for X-rays can be produced. One might
expect a similar effect for electronic waves with the same order of
wave-length. A photographic plate would register this diffraction of
electronic waves passing through the thin layer of crystal. Indeed, the
experiment produces what is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of
the theory: the phenomenon of diffraction for electronic waves. The
similarity between the diffraction of an electronic wave and that of an
X-ray is particularly marked as seen from a comparison of the patterns
in Plate III. We know that such pictures enable us to determine the
wave-lengths of X-rays. The same holds good for electronic waves. The
diffraction pattern gives the length of a wave of matter and the perfect
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment confirms the chain
of our argument splendidly.</p>
<p>Our previous difficulties are broadened and deepened by this result.
This can be made clear by an example similar to the one given for a
light wave. An electron shot at a very small hole will bend like a light
wave. Light and dark rings appear on the photographic plate. There may
be some hope of explaining</p>
<p>this phenomenon by the interaction between the electron and the rim,
though such an explanation does not seem to be very promising. But what
about the two pinholes? Stripes appear instead of rings. How is it
possible that the presence of the other hole completely changes the
effect? The electron is indivisible and can, it would seem, pass through
only one of the two holes. How could an electron passing through a hole
possibly know that another hole has been made some distance away?</p>
<p>We asked before: what is light? Is it a shower of corpuscles or a
wave? We now ask: what is matter, what is an electron? Is it a particle
or a wave? The electron behaves like a particle when moving in an
external electric or magnetic field. It behaves like a wave when
diffracted by a crystal. With the elementary quanta of matter we came
across the same difficulty that we met with in the light quanta. One of
the most fundamental questions raised by recent advance in science is
how to reconcile the two contradictory views of matter and wave. It is
one of those fundamental difficulties which, once formulated, must lead,
in the long run, to scientific progress. Physics has tried to solve this
problem. The future must decide whether the solution suggested by modern
physics is enduring or temporary.</p>
