<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW</p>
<p>The great mystery story — The fast clue — Vectors — The riddle of
motion — One clue remains — Is heat a substance? — The switchback — The
rate of exchange — The philosophical background — The kinetic theory of
matter</p>
<p>THE GREAT MYSTERY STORY</p>
<p>IN IMAGINATION there exists the perfect mystery story. Such a story
presents all the essential clues, and compels us to form our own theory
of the case. If we follow the plot carefully, we arrive at the complete
solution for ourselves just before the author’s disclosure at the end of
the book. The solution itself, contrary to those of inferior mysteries,
does not disappoint us; moreover, it appears at the very moment we
expect it.</p>
<p>Can we liken the reader of such a book to the scientists, who
throughout successive generations continue to seek solutions of the
mysteries in the book of nature? The comparison is false and will have
to be abandoned later, but it has a modicum of justification which may
be extended and modified to make it more appropriate to the endeavour of
science to solve the mystery of the universe.</p>
<p>This great mystery story is still unsolved. We cannot</p>
<p>even be sure that it has a final solution. The reading has already
given us much; it has taught us the rudiments of the language of nature;
it has enabled us to understand many of the clues, and has been a source
of joy and excitement in the oftentimes painful advance of science. But
we realize that in spite of all the volumes read and understood we are
still far from a complete solution, if, indeed, such a thing exists at
all. At every stage we try to find an explanation consistent with the
clues already discovered. Tentatively accepted theories have explained
many of the facts, but no general solution compatible with all known
clues has yet been evolved. Very often a seemingly perfect theory has
proved inadequate in the light of further reading. New facts appear,
contradicting the theory or unexplained by it. The more we read, the
more fully do we appreciate the perfect construction of the book, even
though a complete solution seems to recede as we advance.</p>
<p>In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan
Doyle there comes a time when the investigator has collected all the
facts he needs for at least some phase of his problem. These facts often
seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated. The great
detective, however, realizes that no further investigation is needed at
the moment, and that only pure thinking will lead to a correlation of
the facts collected. So he plays his violin, or lounges in his armchair
enjoying a pipe, when suddenly, by Jove, he has it! Not only does he
have an explanation for the clues at hand,</p>
<p>but he knows that certain other events must have happened. Since he
now knows exactly where to look for it, he may go out, if he likes, to
collect further confirmation for his theory.</p>
<p>The scientist reading the book of nature, if we may be allowed to
repeat the trite phrase, must find the solution for himself; for he
cannot, as impatient readers of other stories often do, turn to the end
of the book. In our case the reader is also the investigator, seeking to
explain, at least in part, the relation of events to their rich context.
To obtain even a partial solution the scientist must collect the
unordered facts available and make them coherent and understandable by
creative thought.</p>
<p>It is our aim, in the following pages, to describe in broad outline
that work of physicists which corresponds to the pure thinking of the
investigator. We shall be chiefly concerned with the role of thoughts
and ideas in the adventurous search for knowledge of the physical
world.</p>
<p>THE FIRST GLUE</p>
<p>Attempts to read the great mystery story are as old as human thought
itself. Only a little over three hundred years ago, however, did
scientists begin to understand the language of the story. Since that
time, the age of Galileo and Newton, the reading has proceeded rapidly.
Techniques of investigation, systematic methods of finding and following
clues, have been developed. Some of</p>
<p>the riddles of nature have been solved, although many of the
solutions have proved temporary and superficial in the light of further
research.</p>
<p>A most fundamental problem, for thousands of years wholly obscured by
its complications, is that of motion. All those motions we observe in
nature—that of a stone thrown into the air, a ship sailing the sea, a
cart pushed along the street—are in reality very intricate. To
understand these phenomena it is wise to begin with the simplest
possible cases, and proceed gradually to the more complicated ones.
Consider a body at rest, where there is no motion at all. To change the
position of such a body it is necessary to exert some influence upon it,
to push it or lift it, or let other bodies, such as horses or steam
engines, act upon it. Our intuitive idea is that motion is connected
with the acts of pushing, lifting or pulling. Repeated experience would
make us risk the further statement that we must push harder if we wish
to move the body faster. It seems natural to conclude that the stronger
the action exerted on a body, the greater will be its speed. A
four-horse carriage goes faster than a carriage drawn by only two
horses. Intuition thus tells us that speed is essentially connected with
action.</p>
<p>It is a familiar fact to readers of detective fiction that a false
clue muddles the story and postpones the solution. The method of
reasoning dictated by intuition was wrong and led to false ideas of
motion which were held for centuries. Aristotle’s great authority
throughout Europe was perhaps the chief reason for</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW ^</p>
<p>the long belief in this intuitive idea. We read in the Mechanics ,
for two thousand years attributed to him:</p>
<p>The moving body comes to a standstill when the force which pushes it
along can no longer so act as to push it.</p>
<p>The discovery and use of scientific reasoning by Galileo was one of
the most important achievements in the history of human thought, and
marks the real beginning of physics. This discovery taught us that
intuitive conclusions based on immediate observation are not always to
be trusted, for they sometimes lead to the wrong clues.</p>
<p>But where does intuition go wrong? Can it possibly be wrong to say
that a carriage drawn by four horses must travel faster than one drawn
by only two?</p>
<p>Let us examine the fundamental facts of motion more closely, starting
with simple everyday experiences familiar to mankind since the beginning
of civilization and gained in the hard struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Suppose that someone going along a level road with a pushcart
suddenly stops pushing. The cart will go on moving for a short distance
before coming to rest. We ask: how is it possible to increase this
distance? There are various ways, such as oiling the wheels, and making
the road very smooth. The more easily the wheels turn, and the smoother
the road, the longer the cart will go on moving. And just what has been
done by the oiling and smoothing? Only this: the external influences
have been made smaller. The effect of what is called friction has been
diminished, both in the wheels and between the wheels and the road. This
is</p>
<p>already a theoretical interpretation of the observable evidence, an
interpretation which is, in fact, arbitrary. One significant step
farther and we shall have the right clue. Imagine a road perfectly
smooth, and wheels with no friction at all. Then there would be nothing
to stop the cart, so that it would run for ever. This conclusion is
reached only by thinking of an idealized experiment, which can never be
actually performed, since it is impossible to eliminate all external
influences. The idealized experiment shows the clue which really formed
the foundation of the mechanics of motion.</p>
<p>Comparing the two methods of approaching the problem, we can say: the
intuitive idea is—the greater the action, the greater the velocity. Thus
the velocity shows whether or not external forces are acting on a body.
The new clue found by Galileo is: if a body is neither pushed, pulled,
nor acted on in any other way, or, more briefly, if no external forces
act on a body, it moves uniformly, that is, always with the same
velocity along a straight line. Thus, the velocity does not show whether
or not external forces are acting on a body. Galileo’s conclusion, the
correct one, was formulated a generation later by Newton as the law of
inertia. It is usually the first thing about physics which we learn by
heart in school, and some of us may remember it:</p>
<p>Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a
right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed thereon.</p>
<p>We have seen that this law of inertia cannot be</p>
<p>derived directly from experiment, but only by speculative thinking
consistent with observation. The idealized experiment can never be
actually performed, although it leads to a profound understanding of
real experiments.</p>
<p>From the variety of complex motions in the world around us we choose
as our first example uniform motion. This is the simplest, because there
are no external forces acting. Uniform motion can, however, never be
realized; a stone thrown from a tower, a cart pushed along a road can
never move absolutely uniformly because we cannot eliminate the
influence of external forces.</p>
<p>In a good mystery story the most obvious clues often lead to the
wrong suspects. In our attempts to understand the laws of nature we
find, similarly, that the most obvious intuitive explanation is often
the wrong one.</p>
<p>Human thought creates an ever-changing picture of the universe.
Galileo’s contribution was to destroy the intuitive view and replace it
by a new one. This is the significance of Galileo’s discovery.</p>
<p>But a further question concerning motion arises immediately. If the
velocity is no indication of the external forces acting on a body, what
is? The answer to this fundamental question was found by Galileo and
still more concisely by Newton, and forms a further clue in our
investigation.</p>
<p>To find the correct answer we must think a little more deeply about
the cart on a perfectly smooth road.</p>
<p>In our idealized experiment the uniformity of the motion was due to
the absence of all external forces. Let us now imagine that the
uniformly moving cart is given a push in the direction of the motion.
What happens now? Obviously its speed is increased. Just as obviously, a
push in the direction opposite to that of the motion would decrease the
speed. In the first case the cart is accelerated by the push, in the
second case decelerated, or slowed down. A conclusion follows at once:
the action of an external force changes the velocity. Thus not the
velocity itself but its change is a consequence of pushing or pulling.
Such a force either increases or decreases the velocity according to
whether it acts in the direction of motion or in the opposite direction.
Galileo saw this clearly and wrote in his Two New Sciences:</p>
<p>… any velocity once imparted to a moving body will be rigidly
maintained as long as the external causes of acceleration or retardation
are removed, a condition which is found only on horizontal planes; for
in the case of planes which slope downwards there is already present a
cause of acceleration; while on planes sloping upwards there is
retardation; from this it follows that motion along a horizontal plane
is perpetual; for, if the velocity be uniform, it cannot be diminished
or slackened, much less destroyed.</p>
<p>By following the right clue we achieve a deeper understanding of the
problem of motion. The connection between force and the change of
velocity—and not, as we should think according to our intuition, the
connection between force and the velocity itself—is</p>
<p>the basis of classical mechanics as formulated by Newton.</p>
<p>We have been making use of two concepts which play principal roles in
classical mechanics: force and change of velocity. In the further
development of science both of these concepts are extended and
generalized. They must, therefore, be examined more closely.</p>
<p>What is force? Intuitively, we feel what is meant by this term. The
concept arose from the effort of pushing, throwing or pulling—from the
muscular sensation accompanying each of these acts. But its
generalization goes far beyond these simple examples. We can think of
force even without picturing a horse pulling a carriage ! We speak of
the force of attraction between the sun and the earth, the earth and the
moon, and of those forces which cause the tides. We speak of the force
by which the earth compels ourselves and all the objects about us to
remain within its sphere of influence, and of the force with which the
wind makes waves on the sea, or moves the leaves of trees. When and
where we observe a change in velocity, an external force, in the general
sense, must be held responsible. Newton wrote in his Principle,:</p>
<p>An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to
change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a
right line.</p>
<p>This force consists in the action only; and remains no longer in the
body, when the action is over. For a body maintains every new state it
acquires, by its vis inertiae only. Impressed forces are of different
origins; as from percussion, from pressure, from centripetal force.</p>
<p>If a stone is dropped from the top of a tower its motion is by no
means uniform; the velocity increases as the stone falls. We conclude:
an external force is acting in the direction of the motion. Or, in other
words: the earth attracts the stone. Let us take another example. What
happens when a stone is thrown straight upward? The velocity decreases
until the stone reaches its highest point and begins to fall. This
decrease in velocity is caused by the same force as the acceleration of
a falling body. In one case the force acts in the direction of the
motion, in the other case in the opposite direction. The force is the
same, but it causes acceleration or deceleration according to whether
the stone is dropped or thrown upward.</p>
<p>VECTORS</p>
<p>All motions we have been considering are rectilinear, that is, along
a straight line. Now we must go one step farther. We gain an
understanding of the laws of nature by analysing the simplest cases and
by leaving out of our first attempts all intricate complications. A
straight line is simpler than a curve. It is, however, impossible to be
satisfied with an understanding of rectilinear motion alone. The motions
of the moon, the earth and the planets, just those to which the
principles of mechanics have been applied with such brilliant success,
are motions along curved paths. Passing from rectilinear motion to
motion along a curved path brings new difficulties. We must have the
courage to overcome them if we wish to understand the principles</p>
<p>of classical mechanics which gave us the first clues and so formed
the starting-point for the development of science.</p>
<p>Let us consider another idealized experiment, in which a perfect
sphere rolls uniformly on a smooth table. We know that if the sphere is
given a push, that is, if an external force is applied, the velocity
will be changed. Now suppose that the direction of the blow is not, as
in the example of the cart, in the line of motion, but in a quite
different direction, say, perpendicular to that line. What happens to
the sphere? Three stages of the motion can be distinguished: the initial
motion, the action of the force, and the final motion after the force
has ceased to act. According to the law of inertia, the velocities
before and after the action of the force are both perfectly uniform. But
there is a difference between the uniform motion before and after the
action of the force: the direction is changed. The initial path of the
sphere and the direction of the force are perpendicular to each other.
The final motion will be along neither of these two lines, but somewhere
between them, nearer the direction of the force if the blow is a hard
one and the initial velocity small, nearer the original line of motion
if the blow is gentle and the initial velocity great. Our new
conclusion, based on the law of inertia, is: in general the action of an
external force changes not only the speed but also the direction of the
motion. An understanding of this fact prepares us for the generalization
introduced into physics by the concept of vectors.</p>
<p>We can continue to use our straightforward method of reasoning. The
starting-point is again Galileo’s law of inertia. We are still far from
exhausting the consequences of this valuable clue to the puzzle of
motion.</p>
<p>Let us consider two spheres moving in different directions on a
smooth table. So as to have a definite picture, we may assume the two
directions perpendicular to each other. Since there are no external
forces acting, the motions are perfectly uniform. Suppose, further, that
the speeds are equal, that is, both cover the same distance in the same
interval of time. But is it correct to say that the two spheres have the
same velocity? The answer can be yes or no ! If the speedometers of two
cars both show forty miles per hour, it is usual to say that they have
the same speed or velocity, no matter in which direction they are
travelling. But science must create its own language, its own concepts,
for its own use. Scientific concepts often begin with those used in
ordinary language for the affairs, of everyday life, but they develop
quite differently. They are transformed and lose the ambiguity
associated with them in ordinary language, gaining in rigor-ousness so
that they may be applied to scientific thought.</p>
<p>From the physicist’s point of view it is advantageous to say that the
velocities of the two spheres moving in different directions are
different. Although purely a matter of convention, it is more convenient
to say that four cars travelling away from the same traffic roundabout
on different roads do not have the same velocity</p>
<p>even though the speeds, as registered on the speedometers, are all
forty miles per hour. This differentiation between speed and velocity
illustrates how physics, starting with a concept used in everyday life,
changes it in a way which proves fruitful in the further development of
science.</p>
<p>If a length is measured, the result is expressed as a number of
units. The length of a stick may be 3 ft. 7 in.; the weight of some
object 2 Ib. 3 oz.; a measured time interval so many minutes or seconds.
In each of these cases the result of the measurement is expressed by a
number. A number alone is, however, insufficient for describing some
physical concepts. The recognition of this fact marked a distinct
advance in scientific investigation. A direction as well as a number is
essential for the characterization of a velocity, for example. Such a
quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction, is called a vector. A
suitable symbol for</p>
<p>it is an arrow. Velocity may be represented by an arrow or, briefly
speaking, by a vector whose length in some chosen scale of units is a
measure of the speed, and whose direction is that of the motion.</p>
<p>If four cars diverge with equal speed from a traffic roundabout,
their velocities can be represented by four vectors of the same length,
as seen from our last drawing. In the scale used, one inch stands for 40
m.p.h. In this way any velocity may be denoted by a vector, and
conversely, if the scale is known, one may ascertain the velocity from
such a vector diagram.</p>
<p>If two cars pass each other on the highway and their speedometers
both show 40 m.p.h., we characterize their velocities by two different
vectors with arrows pointing in opposite directions. So also the arrows
indicating “uptown“ and “downtown“ subway trains in New</p>
<p>York must point in opposite directions. But all trains moving uptown
at different stations or on different avenues with the same speed have
the same velocity, which may be represented by a single vector. There is
nothing about a vector to indicate which stations the train passes or on
which of the many parallel tracks it is running. In other words,
according to the accepted convention, all such vectors, as drawn below,
may be regarded as equal; they lie along the same or parallel lines, are
of equal length, and finally, have arrows</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW</p>
<p>pointing in the same direction. The next figure shows vectors all
different, because they differ either in length</p>
<p>or direction, or both. The same four vectors may be drawn in another
way, in which they all diverge from</p>
<p>&lt;*</p>
<p>a common point. Since the starting-point does not matter, these
vectors can represent the velocities of four cars moving away from the
same traffic roundabout, or the velocities of four cars in different
parts of the country travelling with the indicated speeds in the
indicated directions.</p>
<p>This vector representation may now be used to describe the facts
previously discussed concerning rectilinear motion. We talked of a cart,
moving uniformly in a straight line and receiving a push in the
direction of its motion which increases its velocity. Graphically this
may be represented by two vectors, a shorter one denoting the velocity
before the push and a longer one in the same direction denoting the
velocity after the</p>
<p>push. The meaning of the dotted vector is clear; it represents the
change in velocity for which, as we know, the push is responsible. For
the case where the force is directed against the motion, where the
motion is slowed down, the diagram is somewhat different.</p>
<p>-X-</p>
<p>Again the dotted vector corresponds to a change in velocity, but in
this case its direction is different. It is clear that not only
velocities themselves but also their changes are vectors. But every
change in velocity is</p>
<p>due to the action of an external force; thus the force must also be
represented by a vector. In order to characterize a force it is not
sufficient to state how hard we push the cart; we must also say in which
direction we push. The force, like the velocity or its change, must be
represented by a vector and not by a number alone. Therefore: the
external force is also a vector, and must have the same direction as the
change in velocity. In the two drawings the dotted vectors show the
direction of the force as truly as they indicate the change in
velocity.</p>
<p>Here the sceptic may remark that he sees no advantage in the
introduction of vectors. All that has been accomplished is the
translation of previously recognized facts into an unfamiliar and
complicated language. At this stage it would indeed be difficult to
convince him that he is wrong. For the moment he is, in fact, right. But
we shall see that just this strange language leads to an important
generalization in which vectors appear to be essential.</p>
<p>THE RIDDLE OF MOTION</p>
<p>So long as we deal only with motion along a straight line, we are far
from understanding the motions observed in nature. We must consider
motions along curved paths, and our next step is to determine the laws
governing such motions. This is no easy task. In the case of rectilinear
motion our concepts of velocity, change of velocity, and force proved
most useful. But we do not immediately see how we can apply them to</p>
<p>motion along a curved path. It is indeed possible to imagine that the
old concepts are unsuited to the description of general motion, and that
new ones must be created. Should we try to follow our old path, or seek
a new one?</p>
<p>The generalization of a concept is a process very often used in
science. A method of generalization is not uniquely determined, for
there are usually numerous ways of carrying it out. One requirement,
however, must be rigorously satisfied: any generalized concept must
reduce to the original one when the original conditions are
fulfilled.</p>
<p>We can best explain this by the example with which we are now
dealing. We can try to generalize the old concepts of velocity, change
of velocity, and force for the case of motion along a curved path.
Technically, when speaking of curves, we include straight lines. The
straight line is a special and trivial example of a curve. If,
therefore, velocity, change in velocity, and force are introduced for
motion along a curved line, then they are automatically introduced for
motion along a straight line. But this result must not contradict those
results previously obtained. If the curve becomes a straight line, all
the generalized concepts must reduce to the familiar ones describing
rectilinear motion. But this restriction is not sufficient to determine
the generalization uniquely. It leaves open many possibilities. The
history of science shows that the simplest generalizations sometimes
prove successful and sometimes not. We must first make a guess. In our
case it is</p>
<p>a simple matter to guess the right method of generalization. The new
concepts prove very successful and help us to understand the motion of a
thrown stone as well as that of the planets.</p>
<p>And now just what do the words velocity, change in velocity, and
force mean in the general case of motion along a curved line? Let us
begin with velocity. Along the curve a very small body is moving from
left to</p>
<p>right. Such a small body is often called a particle. The dot on the
curve in our drawing shows the position of the particle at some instant
of time. What is the velocity corresponding to this time and position?
Again Galileo’s clue hints at a way of introducing the velocity. We
must, once more, use our imagination and think about an idealized
experiment. The particle moves along the curve, from left to right,
under the influence of external forces. Imagine that at a given time,
and at the point indicated by the dot, all these forces suddenly cease
to act. Then, the motion must, according to the law of inertia, be
uniform. In practice we can, of course, never completely free a body
from all external influences. We can only surmise “what would happen if…
?“ and judge the pertinence of our guess by the conclusions which can be
drawn from it and by their agreement with experiment.</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>The vector in the next drawing indicates the guessed direction of the
uniform motion if all external forces</p>
<p>were to vanish. It is the direction of the so-called tangent. Looking
at a moving particle through a microscope one sees a very small part of
the curve, which appears as a small segment. The tangent is its
prolongation. Thus the vector drawn represents the velocity at a given
instant. The velocity vector lies on the tangent. Its length represents
the magnitude of the velocity, or the speed as indicated, for instance,
by the speedometer of a car.</p>
<p>Our idealized experiment about destroying the motion in order to find
the velocity vector must not be taken too seriously. It only helps us to
understand what we should call the velocity vector and enables us to
determine it for a given instant at a given point.</p>
<p>In the next drawing, the velocity vectors for three different
positions of a particle moving along a curve</p>
<p>are shown. In this case not only the direction but the magnitude of
the velocity, as indicated by the length of the vector, varies during
the motion.</p>
<p>Does this new concept of velocity satisfy the requirement formulated
for all generalizations? That is: does it reduce to the familiar concept
if the curve becomes a straight line? Obviously it does. The tangent to
a straight line is the line itself. The velocity vector lies in the line
of the motion, just as in the case of the moving cart or the rolling
spheres.</p>
<p>The next step is the introduction of the change in velocity of a
particle moving along a curve. This also may be done in various ways,
from which we choose the simplest and most convenient. The last drawing
showed several velocity vectors representing the motion at various
points along the path. The first two of these may be drawn again so that
they have a common starting-point, as we have seen is possible with
vectors.</p>
<p>The dotted vector we call the change in velocity. Its starting-point
is the end of the first vector and its end-point the end of the second
vector. This definition of the change in velocity may, at first sight,
seem artificial and meaningless. It becomes much clearer in the special
case in which vectors (i) and (2) have the same direction. This, of
course, means going over to the case of straight-line motion. If both
vectors have the same initial point, the dotted vector again connects
their end-points. The drawing is now identical with that on p. 18,</p>
<p>— *-&gt; ……… &gt;</p>
<p>and the previous concept is regained as a special case of the new
one. We may remark that we had to separate the two lines in our drawing,
since otherwise they would coincide and be indistinguishable.</p>
<p>We now have to take the last step in our process of generalization.
It is the most important of all the guesses we have had to make so far.
The connection between force and change in velocity has to be
established so that we can formulate the clue which will enable us to
understand the general problem of motion.</p>
<p>The clue to an explanation of motion along a straight line was simple
: external force is responsible for change in velocity; the force vector
has the same direction as the change. And now what is to be regarded as
the clue to curvilinear motion? Exactly the same ! The only difference
is that change of velocity has now a broader meaning than before. A
glance at the dotted vectors of the last two drawings shows this point
clearly. If the velocity is known for all points along the curve, the
direction of the force at any point can be deduced at once. One must
draw the velocity vectors for two instants separated by a very short
time interval and therefore corresponding to positions very near each
other. The vector from the end-point of the first to that of the second
indicates the direction of the acting force. But v it is essential that
the two velocity vectors</p>
<p>should be separated only by a “very short“ time interval. The
rigorous analysis of such words as “very near“, “very short“ is far from
simple. Indeed it was this analysis which led Newton and Leibnitz to the
discovery of differential calculus.</p>
<p>It is a tedious and elaborate path which leads to the generalization
of Galileo’s clue. We cannot show here how abundant and fruitful the
consequences of this generalization have proved. Its application leads
to simple and convincing explanations of many facts previously
incoherent and misunderstood.</p>
<p>From the extremely rich variety of motions we shall take only the
simplest and apply to their explanation the law just formulated.</p>
<p>A bullet shot from a gun, a stone thrown at an angle, a stream of
water emerging from a hose, all describe familiar paths of the same
type—the parabola. Imagine a speedometer attached to a stone, for
example, so that its velocity vector may be drawn for any instant.</p>
<p>The result may well be that represented in the above drawing. The
direction of the force acting on the stone is just that of the change in
velocity, and we have seen how it may be determined. The result, shown
in the next drawing, indicates that the force is vertical, and</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>directed downward. It is exactly the same as when a stone is allowed
to fall from the top of a tower. The paths are quite different, as also
are the velocities, but the change in velocity has the same direction,
that is, toward the centre of the earth.</p>
<p>A stone attached to the end of a string and swung around in a
horizontal plane moves in a circular path.</p>
<p>All the vectors in the diagram representing this motion have the same
length if the speed is uniform.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the velocity is not uniform, for the path is not a
straight line. Only in uniform, rectilinear mo-</p>
<p>tion are there no forces involved. Here, however, there are, and the
velocity changes not in magnitude but in direction. According to the law
of motion there must be some force responsible for this change, a force
in this case between the stone and the hand holding the string. A
further question arises immediately: in what direction does the force
act? Again a vector diagram shows the answer. The velocity vectors for
two very near points are drawn, and the change of velocity</p>
<p>found. This last vector is seen to be directed along the string
toward the centre of the circle, and is always perpendicular to the
velocity vector, or tangent. In other words, the hand exerts a force on
the stone by means of the string.</p>
<p>Very similar is the more important example of the revolution of the
moon around the earth. This may be represented approximately as uniform
circular motion. The force is directed toward the earth for the same
reason that it was directed toward the hand in our former example. There
is no string connecting the earth and the moon, but we can imagine a
line be-tween the centres of the two bodies; the force lies along this
line and is directed toward the centre of the earth, just as the force
on a stone thrown in the air or dropped from a tower.</p>
<p>All that we have said concerning motion can be summed up in a single
sentence. Force and change of velocity are vectors having the same
direction. This is the initial clue to the problem of motion, but it
certainly does not suffice for a thorough explanation of all motions
observed. The transition from Aristotle’s line of thought to that of
Galileo formed a most important corner-stone in the foundation of
science. Once this break was made, the line of further development was
clear. Our interest here lies in the first stages of development, in
following initial clues, in showing how new physical concepts are born
in the painful struggle with old ideas. We are concerned only with
pioneer work in science, which consists of finding new and unexpected
paths of development; with the adventures in scientific thought which
create an ever-changing picture of the universe. The initial and
fundamental steps are always of a revolutionary character. Scientific
imagination finds old concepts too confining, and replaces them by new
ones. The continued development along any line already initiated is more
in the nature of evolution, until the next turning point is reached when
a still newer field must be conquered. In order to understand, however,
what reasons and what difficulties force a change in important concepts,
we must know not only the initial clues, but also the conclusions which
can be drawn.</p>
<p>One of the most important characteristics of modern physics is that
the conclusions drawn from initial clues are not only qualitative but
also quantitative. Let us</p>
<p>again consider a stone dropped from a tower. We have seen that its
velocity increases as it falls, but we should like to know much more.
Just how great is this change? And what is the position and the velocity
of the stone at any time after it begins to fall? We wish to be able to
predict events and to determine by experiment whether observation
confirms these predictions and thus the initial assumptions.</p>
<p>To draw quantitative conclusions we must use the language of
mathematics. Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially
simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to
everyone. To follow up these ideas demands the knowledge of a highly
refined technique of investigation. Mathematics as a tool of reasoning
is necessary if we wish to draw conclusions which may be compared with
experiment. So long as we are concerned only with fundamental physical
ideas we may avoid the language of mathematics. Since in these pages we
do this consistently, we must occasionally restrict ourselves to
quoting, without proof, some of the results necessary for an
understanding of important clues arising in the further development. The
price which must be paid for abandoning the language of mathematics is a
loss in precision, and the necessity of sometimes quoting results
without showing how they were reached.</p>
<p>A very important example of motion is that of the earth around the
sun. It is known that the path is a closed curve, called the ellipse.
The construction of a</p>
<p>vector diagram of the change in velocity shows that the force on the
earth is directed toward the sun. But</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>this, after all, is scant information. We should like to be able to
predict the position of the earth and the other planets for any
arbitrary instant of time, we should like to predict the date and
duration of the next solar eclipse and many other astronomical events.
It is possible to do these things, but not on the basis of our initial
clue alone, for it is now necessary to know not only the direction of
the force but also its absolute value—its magnitude. It was Newton who
made the inspired guess on this point. According to his law of
gravitation the force of attraction between two bodies depends in a
simple way on their distance from each other. It becomes smaller when
the distance increases. To be specific it becomes 2x2=4 times smaller if
the distance is doubled, 3x3 = 9 times smaller if the distance is made
three times as great.</p>
<p>Thus we see that in the case of gravitational force we have succeeded
in expressing, in a simple way, the</p>
<p>dependence of the force on the distance between the moving bodies. We
proceed similarly in all other cases where forces of different kinds—for
instance, electric, magnetic, and the like—are acting. We try to use a
simple expression for the force. Such an expression is justified only
when the conclusions drawn from it are confirmed by experiment.</p>
<p>But this knowledge of the gravitational force alone is not sufficient
for a description of the motion of the planets. We have seen that
vectors representing force and change in velocity for any short interval
of time have the same direction, but we must follow Newton one step
farther and assume a simple relation between their lengths. Given all
other conditions the same, that is, the same moving body and changes
considered over equal time intervals, then, according to Newton, the
change of velocity is proportional to the force.</p>
<p>Thus just two complementary guesses are needed for quantitative
conclusions concerning the motion of the planets. One is of a general
character, stating the connection between force and change in velocity.
The other is special, and states the exact dependence of the particular
kind of force involved on the distance between the bodies. The first is
Newton’s general law of motion, the second his law of gravitation.
Together they determine the motion. This can be made clear by the
following somewhat clumsy-sounding reasoning. Suppose that at a given
time the position and velocity of a planet can be determined, and that
the force is known. Then, according to Newton’s laws, we know</p>
<p>the change in velocity during a short time interval. Knowing the
initial velocity and its change, we can find the velocity and position
of the planet at the end of the time interval. By a continued repetition
of this process the whole path of the motion may be traced without
further recourse to observational data. This is, in principle, the way
mechanics predicts the course of a body in motion, but the method used
here is hardly practical. In practice such a step-by-step procedure
would be extremely tedious as well as inaccurate. Fortunately, it is
quite unnecessary; mathematics furnishes a short cut, and makes possible
precise description of the motion in much less ink than we use for a
single sentence. The conclusions reached in this way can be proved or
disproved by observation.</p>
<p>The same kind of external force is recognized in the motion of a
stone falling through the air and in the revolution of the moon in its
orbit, namely, that of the earth’s attraction for material bodies.
Newton recognized that the motions of falling stones, of the moon, and
of planets are only very special manifestations of a universal
gravitational force acting between any two bodies. In simple cases the
motion may be described and predicted by the aid of mathematics. In
remote and extremely complicated cases, involving the action of many
bodies on each other, a mathematical description is not so simple, but
the fundamental principles are the same.</p>
<p>We find the conclusions, at which we arrived by following our initial
clues, realized in the motion of a</p>
<p>thrown stone, in the motion of the moon, the earth, and the
planets.</p>
<p>It is really our whole system of guesses which is to be either proved
or disproved by experiment. No one of the assumptions can be isolated
for separate testing. In the case of the planets moving around the sun
it is found that the system of mechanics works splendidly. Nevertheless
we can well imagine that another system, based on different assumptions,
might work just as well.</p>
<p>Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not,
however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our
endeavour to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to
understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the
moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way of opening the
case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which
could be responsible for all the things he observes, but he may never be
quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his
observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real
mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of
such a comparison. But he certainly believes that, as his knowledge
increases, his picture of reality will become simpler and simpler and
will explain a wider and wider range of his sensuous impressions. He may
also believe in the existence of the ideal limit of knowledge and that
it is approached by the human mind. He may call this ideal limit the
objective truth.</p>
<p>ONE GLUE REMAINS</p>
<p>When first studying mechanics one has the impression that everything
in this branch of science is simple, fundamental and settled for all
time. One would hardly suspect the existence of an important clue which
no one noticed for three hundred years. The neglected clue is connected
with one of the fundamental concepts of mechanics—that of mass.</p>
<p>Again we return to the simple idealized experiment of the cart on a
perfectly smooth road. If the cart is initially at rest and then given a
push, it afterwards moves uniformly with a certain velocity. Suppose
that the action of the force can be repeated as many times as desired,
the mechanism of pushing acting in the same way and exerting the same
force on the same cart. However many times the experiment is repeated,
the final velocity is always the same. But what happens if the
experiment is changed, if previously the cart was empty and now it is
loaded? The loaded cart will have a smaller final velocity than the
empty one. The conclusion is: if the same force acts on two different
bodies, both initially at rest, the resulting velocities will not be the
same. We say that the velocity depends on the mass of the body, being
smaller if the mass is greater.</p>
<p>We know, therefore, at least in theory, how to determine the mass of
a body or, more exactly, how many times greater one mass is than
another. We have identical forces acting on two resting masses.
Finding</p>
<p>that the velocity of the first mass is three times greater than that
of the second, we conclude that the first mass is three times smaller
than the second. This is certainly not a very practical way of
determining the ratio of two masses. We can, nevertheless, well imagine
having done it in this, or in some similar way, based upon the
application of the law of inertia.</p>
<p>How do we really determine mass in practice? Not, of course, in the
way just described. Everyone knows the correct answer. We do it by
weighing on a scale.</p>
<p>Let us discuss in more detail the two different ways of determining
mass.</p>
<p>The first experiment had nothing whatever to do with gravity, the
attraction of the earth. The cart moves along a perfectly smooth and
horizontal plane after the push. Gravitational force, which causes the
cart to stay on the plane, does not change, and plays no role in the
determination of the mass. It is quite different with weighing. We could
never use a scale if the earth did not attract bodies, if gravity did
not exist. The difference between the two determinations of mass is that
the first has nothing to do with the force of gravity while the second
is based essentially on its existence.</p>
<p>We ask: if we determine the ratio of two masses in both ways
described above, do we obtain the same result? The answer given by
experiment is quite clear. The results are exactly the same ! This
conclusion could not have been foreseen, and is based on observation,
not reason. Let us, for the sake of simplicity, call the</p>
<p>mass determined in the first way the inertial mass and that
determined in the second way the gravitational mass. In our world it
happens that they are equal, but we can well imagine that this should
not have been the case at all. Another question arises immediately: is
this identity of the two kinds of mass purely accidental, or does it
have a deeper significance? The answer, from the point of view of
classical physics, is: the identity of the two masses is accidental and
no deeper significance should be attached to it. The answer of modern
physics is just the opposite: the identity of the two masses is
fundamental and forms a new and essential clue leading to a more
profound understanding. This was, in fact, one of the most important
clues from which the so-called general theory of relativity was
developed.</p>
<p>A mystery story seems inferior if it explains strange events as
accidents. It is certainly more satisfying to have the story follow a
rational pattern. In exactly the same way a theory which offers an
explanation for the identity of gravitational and inertial mass is
superior to one which interprets their identity as accidental, provided,
of course, that the two theories are equally consistent with observed
facts.</p>
<p>Since this identity of inertial and gravitational mass was
fundamental for the formulation of the theory of relativity, we are
justified in examining it a little more closely here. What experiments
prove convincingly that the two masses are the same? The answer lies in
Galileo’s old experiment in which he dropped different masses from a
tower. He noticed that the time required</p>
<p>for the fall was always the same, that the motion of a falling body
does not depend on the mass. To link this simple but highly important
experimental result with the identity of the two masses needs some
rather intricate reasoning.</p>
<p>A body at rest gives way before the action of an external force,
moving and attaining a certain velocity. It yields more or less easily,
according to its inertial mass, resisting the motion more strongly if
the mass is large than if it is small. We may say, without pretending to
be rigorous: the readiness with which a body responds to the call of an
external force depends on its inertial mass. If it were true that the
earth attracts all bodies with the same force, that of greatest inertial
mass would move more slowly in falling than any other. But this is not
the case: all bodies fall in the same way. This means that the force by
which the earth attracts different masses must be different. Now the
earth attracts a stone with the force of gravity and knows nothing about
its inertial mass. The “calling“ force of the earth depends on the
gravitational mass. The “ answering“ motion of the stone depends on the
inertial mass. Since the “ answering “ motion is always the same —all
bodies dropped from the same height fall in the same way—it must be
deduced that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equal.</p>
<p>More pedantically a physicist formulates the same conclusion: the
acceleration of a falling body increases in proportion to its
gravitational mass and decreases in proportion to its inertial mass.
Since all falling bodies</p>
<p>have the same constant acceleration, the two masses must be
equal.</p>
<p>In our great mystery story there are no problems wholly solved and
settled for all time. After three hundred years we had to return to the
initial problem of motion, to revise the procedure of investigation, to
find clues which had been overlooked, thereby reaching a different
picture of the surrounding universe.</p>
<p>IS HEAT A SUBSTANCE</p>
<p>Here we begin to follow a new clue, one originating in the realm of
heat phenomena. It is impossible, however, to divide science into
separate and unrelated sections. Indeed, we shall soon find that the new
concepts introduced here are interwoven with those already familiar, and
with those we shall still meet. A line of thought developed in one
branch of science can very often be applied to the description of events
apparently quite different in character. In this process the original
concepts are often modified so as to advance the understanding both of
those phenomena from which they sprang and of those to which they are
newly applied.</p>
<p>The most fundamental concepts in the description of heat phenomena
are temperature and heat. It took an unbelievably long time in the
history of science for these two to be distinguished, but once this
distinction was made rapid progress resulted. Although these concepts
are now familiar to everyone, we shall examine them closely, emphasizing
the differences between tfiem.</p>
<p>Our sense of touch tells us quite definitely that one body is hot and
another cold. But this is a purely qualitative criterion, not sufficient
for a quantitative description and sometimes even ambiguous. This is
shown by a well-known experiment: we have three vessels containing,
respectively, cold, warm and hot water. If we dip one hand into the cold
water and the other into the hot, we receive a message from the first
that it is cold and from the second that it is hot. If we then dip both
hands into the same warm water, we receive two contradictory messages,
one from each hand. For the same reason an Eskimo and a native of some
equatorial country meeting in New York on a spring day would hold
different opinions as to whether the climate was hot or cold. We settle
all such questions by the use of a thermometer, an instrument designed
in a primitive form by Galileo. Here again that familiar name! The use
of a thermometer is based on some obvious physical assumptions. We shall
recall them by quoting a few lines from lectures given about a hundred
and fifty years ago by Black, who contributed a great deal toward
clearing up the difficulties connected with the two concepts, heat and
temperature:</p>
<p>By the use of this instrument we have learned, that if we take 1000,
or more, different kinds of matter, such as metals, stones, salts,
woods, feathers, wool, water and a variety of other fluids, although
they be all at first of different heats, let them be placed together in
the same room without a fire, and into which the sun does not shine, the
heat will be communicated from the hotter of these bodies to the colder,
during some hours perhaps, or the course of a</p>
<p>at the end of which time, if we apply a thermometer to them all in
succession, it will point precisely to the same degree.</p>
<p>The italicized word heats should, according to present-day
nomenclature, be replaced by the word temperatures.</p>
<p>A physician taking the thermometer from a sick man’s mouth might
reason like this: “The thermometer indicates its own temperature by the
length of its column of mercury. We assume that the length of the
mercury column increases in proportion to the increase in temperature.
But the thermometer was for a few minutes in contact with my
P^ientjjojhat bothjjatient and thermometer havef the Tame temperature. I
con-cIuHe, therefore, that my patient’s temperature is that registered
on the thermometer.“ The doctor probably acts mechanically, but he
applies physical principles without thinking about it.</p>
<p>But does the thermometer contain the same amount of heat as the body
of the man? Of course not. To assume that two bodies contain equal
quantities of heat just because their temperatures are equal would, as
Black remarked, be</p>
<p>taking a very hasty view of the subject. It is confounding the
quantity of heat in different bodies with its general strength or
intensity, though it is plain that these are two different things, and
should always be distinguished, when we are thinking of the distribution
of heat.</p>
<p>An understanding of this distinction can be gained by considering a
very simple experiment. A pound of</p>
<p>water placed over a gas flame takes some time to change from room
temperature to the boiling point. A much longer time is required for
heating twelve pounds, say, of water in the same vessel by means of the
same flame. We interpret this fact as indicating that now more of
“something“ is needed and we call this “something“ heat.</p>
<p>A further important concept, specific heat<sup>is</sup> gained by the
following experiment: let one vessel contain a pound of water and
another a pound of mercury, both to be heated in the same way. The
mercury gets hot much more quickly than the water, showing that less
“heat“ is needed to raise the temperature by one degree. In general ?
different amounts of “heat“ are required to change by one degree, say
from ^ojtp 41 degrees Fah-renheit, the temperatures of different
substances such as~water, mercury, iron, copper, woodTelc^ aTroTtHc
samelrTass. We say that each substance has its individual heat
capacit^^j)Y, specific heat.</p>
<p>Once having gained the concept of heat, we can investigate its nature
more closely. We have two bodies, one hot, the other cold, or more
precisely, one of a higher temperature than the other. We bring them
into contact and free them from all other external influences.
Eventually they will, we know, reach the same temperature. But how does
this take place? What happens between the instant they are brought into
contact and the achievement of equal temperatures? The picture of heat
“flowing“ from one body to another suggests itself, like water flowing
from a higher</p>
<p>level to a lower. This picture, though primitive, seems to fit many
of the facts, so that the analogy runs:</p>
<p>Water—Heat</p>
<p>Higher level—Higher temperature Lower level—Lower temperature</p>
<p>The flow proceeds until both levels, that is, both temperatures, are
equal. This naive view can be made more useful by quantitative
considerations. If definite masses of water and alcohol, each at a
definite temperature, are mixed together, a knowledge of the specific
heats will lead to a prediction of the final temperature of the mixture.
Conversely, an observation of the final temperature, together with a
little algebra, would enable us to find the ratio of the two specific
heats.</p>
<p>We recognize in the concept of heat which appears here a similarity
to other physical concepts. Heat is, according to our view, a substance,
such as mass in mechanics. Its quantity may change or not, like money
put aside in a safe or spent. The amount of money in a safe will remain
unchanged so long as the safe remains locked, and so will the amounts of
mass and heat in an isolated body. The ideal thermos flask is analogous
to such a safe. Furthermore, just as the mass of an isolated system is
unchanged even if a chemical transformation takes place, so heat is
conserved even though it flows from one body to another. Even if heat is
not used for raising the temperature of a body but for melting ice, say,
or changing water into steam, we can still think of it as a substance
and regain it entirely by</p>
<p>freezing the water or liquefying the steam. The old names, latent
heat of melting or vaporization, show that these concepts are drawn from
the picture of heat as a substance. Latent heat is temporarily hidden,
like money put away in a safe, but available for use if one knows the
lock combination.</p>
<p>But heat is certainly not a substance in the same sense as mass. Mass
can be detected by means of scales, but what of heat? Does a piece of
iron weigh more when red-hot than when ice-cold? Experiment shows that
it does not. If heat is a substance at all, it is a weightless one. The
“heat-substance“ was usually called caloric and is our first
acquaintance among a whole family of weightless substances. Later we
shall have occasion to follow the history of the family, its rise and
fall. It is sufficient now to note the birth of this particular
member.</p>
<p>The purpose of any physical theory is to explain as wide a range of
phenomena as possible. It is justified in so far as it does make events
understandable. We have seen that the substance theory explains many of
the heat phenomena. It will soon become apparent, however, that this
again is a false clue, that heat cannot be regarded as a substance, even
weightless. This is clear if we think about some simple experiments
which marked the beginning of civilization.</p>
<p>We think of a substance as something which can be neither created nor
destroyed. Yet primitive man created by friction sufficient heat to
ignite wood. Examples of heating by friction are, as a matter of
fact,</p>
<p>much too numerous and familiar to need recounting. In all these cases
some quantity of heat is created, a fact difficult to account for by the
substance theory. It is true that a supporter of this theory could
invent arguments to account for it. His reasoning would run something
like this: u The substance theory can explain the apparent creation of
heat. Take the simplest example of two pieces of wood rubbed one against
the other. Now rubbing is something which influences the wood and
changes its properties. It is very likely that the properties are so
modified that an unchanged quantity of heat comes to produce a higher
temperature than before. After all, the only thing we notice is the rise
in temperature. It is possible that the friction changes the specific
heat of the wood and not the total amount of heat.“</p>
<p>At this stage of the discussion it would be useless to argue with a
supporter of the substance theory, for this is a matter which can be
settled only by experiment. Imagine two identical pieces of wood and
suppose equal changes of temperature are induced by different methods;
in one case by friction and in the other by contact with a radiator, for
example. If the two pieces have the same specific heat at the new
temperature, the whole substance theory must break down. There are very
simple methods for determining specific heats, and the fate of the
theory depends on the result of just such measurements. Tests which are
capable of pronouncing a verdict of life or death on a theory occur
frequently in the history of physics, and are called crucial</p>
<p>experiments. The crucial value of an experiment is revealed only by
the way the question is formulated, and only one theory of the phenomena
can be put on trial by it. The determination of the specific heats of
two bodies of the same kind, at equal temperatures attained by friction
and heat flow respectively, is a typical example of a crucial
experiment. This experiment was performed about a hundred and fifty
years ago by Rumford, and dealt a death blow to the substance theory of
heat.</p>
<p>An extract from Rurnford’s own account tells the story:</p>
<p>It frequently happens, that in the ordinary affairs and occupations
of life, opportunities present themselves of contemplating some of the
most curious operations of Nature; and very interesting philosophical
experiments might often be made, almost without trouble or expense, by
means of machinery contrived for the mere mechanical purposes of the
arts and manufactures,</p>
<p>I have frequently had occasion to make this observation; and am
persuaded, that a habit of keeping the eyes open to every thing that is
going on in the ordinary course of the business of life has oftener led,
as it were by accident, or in the playful excursions of the imagination,
put into action by contemplating the most common appearances, to useful
doubts, and sensible schemes for investigation and improvement, than all
the more intense meditations of philosophers, in the hours expressly set
apart for study</p>
<p>Being engaged, lately, in superintending the boring of cannon, in the
workshops of the military arsenal at Munich, I was struck with the very
considerable degree of Heat which a brass gun acquires, in a short time,
in being bored; and with the still more intense Heat (much greater
than</p>
<p>that of boiling water, as I found by experiment) of the metallic
chips separated from it by the borer….</p>
<p>From whence comes the Heat actually produced in the mechanical
operation above mentioned?</p>
<p>Is it furnished by the metallic chips which are separated by the
borer from the solid mass of metal?</p>
<p>If this were the case, then, according to the modern doctrines of
latent Heat, and of caloric, the capacity ought not only to be changed,
but the change undergone by them should be sufficiently great to account
for all the Heat produced.</p>
<p>But no such change had taken place; for I found, upon taking equal
quantities, by weight, of these chips, and of thin slips of the same
block of metal separated by means of a fine saw and putting them, at the
same temperature (that of boiling water), into equal quantities of cold
water (that is to say, at the temperature of 59^° F.) the portion of
water into which the chips were put was not, to all appearance, heated
either less or more than the other portion, in which the slips of metal
were put.</p>
<p>Finally we reach his conclusion:</p>
<p>And, in reasoning on this subject, we must not forget to consider
that most remarkable circumstance, that the source of the Heat generated
by friction, in these Experiments, appeared evidently to be
inexhaustible.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to add, that anything which any insulated
body, or system of bodies, can continue to furnish without limitation,
cannot possibly be a material substance] and it appears to me to be
extremely difficult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea
of anything, capable of being excited and communicated, in the manner
the Heat was excited and communicated in these Experiments, except it be
MOTION.</p>
<p>Thus we see the breakdown of the old theory, or to be more exact, we
see that the substance theory is</p>
<p>limited to problems of heat flow. Again, as Rumford has intimated, we
must seek a new clue. To do this, let us leave for the moment the
problem of heat and return to mechanics.</p>
<p>THE SWITCHBACK</p>
<p>Let us trace the motion of that popular thrill-giver, the switchback.
A small car is lifted or driven to the highest point of the track. When
set free it starts rolling down under the force of gravity, and then
goes up and down along a fantastically curved line, giving the occupants
a thrill by the sudden changes in velocity. Every switchback has its
highest point, that from which it starts. Never again, throughout the
whole course of the motion, will it reach the same height. A complete
description of the motion would be very complicated. On the one hand is
the mechanical side of the problem, the changes of velocity and position
in time. On the other there is friction and therefore the creation of
heat, on the rail and in the wheels. The only significant reason for
dividing the physical process into these two aspects is to make possible
the use of the concepts previously discussed. The division leads to an
idealized experiment, for a physical process in which only the
mechanical aspect appears can be only imagined but never realized.</p>
<p>For the idealized experiment we may imagine that someone has learned
to eliminate entirely the friction which always accompanies motion. He
decides to apply his discovery to the construction of a switchback,
and</p>
<p>must find out for himself how to build one. The car is to run up and
down, with its starting-point, say, at one hundred feet above ground
level. He soon discovers by trial and error that he must follow a very
simple rule: he may build his track in whatever path he pleases so long
as no point is higher than the starting-point. If the car is to proceed
freely to the end of the</p>
<p>course, its height may attain a hundred feet as many times as he
likes, but never exceed it. The initial height can never be reached by a
car on an actual track because of friction, but our hypothetical
engineer need not consider that.</p>
<p>Let us follow the motion of the idealized car on the idealized
switchback as it begins to roll downward from the starting-point. As it
moves its distance from the ground diminishes, but its speed increases.
This sentence at first sight may remind us of one from a language
lesson: “I have no pencil, but you have six oranges.“ It is not so
stupid, however. There is no connection between my having no pencil and
your having six oranges, but there is a very real correlation</p>
<p>between the distance of the car from the ground and its speed. We can
calculate the speed of the car at any moment if we know how high it
happens to be above the ground, but we omit this point here because of
its quantitative character which can best be expressed by mathematical
formulae.</p>
<p>At its highest point the car has zero velocity and is one hundred
feet from the ground. At the lowest possible point it is no distance
from the ground, and has its greatest velocity. These facts may be
expressed in other terms. At its highest point the car has potential
energy but no kinetic energy or energy of motion. At its lowest point it
has the greatest kinetic energy and no potential energy whatever. At all
intermediate positions, where there is some velocity and some elevation,
it has both kinetic and potential energy. The potential energy increases
with the elevation, while the kinetic energy becomes greater as the
velocity increases. The principles of mechanics suffice to explain the
motion. Two expressions for energy occur in the mathematical
description, each of which changes, although the sum does not vary. It
is thus possible to introduce mathematically and rigorously the concepts
of potential energy, depending on position, and kinetic energy,
depending on velocity. The introduction of the two names is, of course,
arbitrary and justified only by convenience. The sum of the two
quantities remains unchanged, and is called a constant of the motion.
The total energy, kinetic plus potential, can be compared, for example,
with money kept intact as to amount but changed</p>
<p>continually from, one currency to another, say from dollars to pounds
and back again, according to a well-defined rate of exchange.</p>
<p>In the real switchback, where friction prevents the car from again
reaching as high a point as that from which it started, there is still a
continuous change between kinetic and potential energy. Here, however,
the sum does not remain constant, but grows smaller.</p>
<p>Now one important and courageous step more is needed to relate the
mechanical and heat aspects of motion. The wealth of consequences and
generalizations from this step will be seen later.</p>
<p>Something more than kinetic and potential energies is now involved,
namely, the heat created by friction. Does this heat correspond to the
diminution in mechanical energy, that is kinetic and potential energy? A
new guess is imminent. If heat may be regarded as a form of energy,
perhaps the sum of all three—heat, kinetic and potential
energies—remains constant. Not heat alone, but heat and other forms of
energy taken</p>
<p>together are, like a substance, indestructible. It is as if a man
must pay himself a commission in francs for changing dollars to pounds,
the commission money also being saved so that the sum of dollars,
pounds, and francs is a fixed amount according to some defiYiite
exchange rate.</p>
<p>The progress of science has destroyed the older concept of heat as a
substance. We try to create a new substance, energy, with heat as one of
its forms.</p>
<p>THE RATE OF EXCHANGE</p>
<p>Less than a hundred years ago the new clue which led to the concept
of heat as a form of energy was guessed by Mayer and confirmed
experimentally by Joule. It is a strange coincidence that nearly all the
fundamental work concerned with the nature of heat was done by
non-professional physicists who regarded physics merely as their great
hobby. There was the versatile Scotsman Black, the German physician
Mayer, and the great American adventurer Count Rumford, who afterwards
lived in Europe and, among other activities, became Minister of War for
Bavaria. There was also the English brewer Joule who, in his spare time,
performed some most important experiments concerning the conservation of
energy.</p>
<p>Joule verified by experiment the guess that heat is a form of energy,
and determined the rate of exchange. It is worth our while to see just
what his results were.</p>
<p>The kinetic and potential energy of a system together constitute its
mechanical energy. In the case of</p>
<p>the switchback we made a guess that some of the mechanical energy was
converted into heat. If this is right, there must be here and in all
other similar physical processes a definite rate of exchange between the
two. This is rigorously a quantitative question, but the fact that a
given quantity of mechanical energy can be changed into a definite
amount of heat is highly important. We should like to know what number
expresses the rate of exchange, i.e., how much heat we obtain from a
given amount of mechanical energy.</p>
<p>The determination of this number was the object of Joule’s
researches. The mechanism of one of his experiments is very much like
that of a weight clock. The winding of such a clock consists of
elevating two weights, thereby adding potential energy to the system. If
the clock is not further interfered with, it may be regarded as a closed
system. Gradually the weights fall and the clock runs down. At the end
of a certain time the weights will have reached their lowest position
and the clock will have stopped. What has happened to the energy? The
potential energy of the weights has changed into kinetic energy of the
mechanism, and has then gradually been dissipated as heat.</p>
<p>A clever alteration in this sort of mechanism enabled Joule to
measure the heat lost and thus the rate of exchange. In his apparatus
two weights caused a paddle wheel to turn while immersed in water. The
potential energy of the weights was changed into kinetic energy of the
movable parts, and thence into heat which</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>raised the temperature of the water. Joule measured this change of
temperature and, making use of the known specific heat of water,
calculated the amount of heat absorbed. He summarized the results of
many trials as follows:</p>
<p>i st. That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies,
whether solid or liquid, is always proportional to the quantity of force
[by force Joule means energy] expended. And</p>
<p>2nd. That the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature
of a pound of water (weighed in vacuo and taken at between 55° and 60°)
by i° Fahr. requires for its evolution the expenditure of a mechanical
force [energy] represented by the fall of 772 Ib. through the space of
one foot.</p>
<p>In other words, the potential energy of 772 pounds elevated one foot
above the ground is equivalent to the quantity of heat necessary to
raise the temperature of one pound of water from 55° F. to 56° F. Later
experimenters were capable of somewhat greater accuracy,</p>
<p>but the mechanical equivalent of heat is essentially what Joule found
in his pioneer work.</p>
<p>Once this important work was done, further progress was rapid. It was
soon recognized that these kinds of energy, mechanical and heat, are
only two of its many forms. Everything which can be converted into
either of them is also a form of energy. The radiation given off by the
sun is energy, for part of it is transformed into heat on the earth. An
electric current possesses energy, for it heats a wire or turns the
wheels of a motor. Coal represents chemical energy, liberated as heat
when the coal burns. In every event in nature one form of energy is
being converted into another, always at some well-defined rate of
exchange. In a closed system, one isolated from external influences, the
energy is conserved and thus behaves like a substance. The sum of all
possible forms of energy in such a system is constant, although the
amount of any one kind may be changing. If we regard the whole universe
as a closed system, we can proudly announce with the physicists of the
nineteenth century that the energy of the universe is invariant, that no
part of it can ever be created or destroyed.</p>
<p>Our two concepts of substance are, then, matter and energy. Both obey
conservation laws: An isolated system cannot change either in mass or in
total energy. Matter has weight but energy is weightless. We have
therefore two different concepts and two conservation laws. Are these
ideas still to be taken seriously? Or has this apparently well-founded
picture been changed in</p>
<p>the light of newer developments? It has! Further changes in the two
concepts are connected with the theory of relativity. We shall return to
this point later.</p>
<p>THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The results of scientific research very often force a change in the
philosophical view of problems which extend far beyond the restricted
domain of science itself. What is the aim of science? What is demanded
of a theory which attempts to describe nature? These questions, although
exceeding the bounds of physics, are intimately related to it, since
science forms the material from which they arise. Philosophical
generalizations must be founded on scientific results. Once formed and
widely accepted, however, they very often influence the further
development of scientific thought by indicating one of the many possible
lines of procedure. Successful revolt against the accepted view results
in unexpected and completely different developments, becoming a source
of new philosophical aspects. These remarks necessarily sound vague and
pointless until illustrated by examples quoted from the history of
physics.</p>
<p>We shall here try to describe the first philosophical ideas on the
aim of science. These ideas greatly influenced the development of
physics until nearly a hundred years ago, when their discarding was
forced by new evidence, new facts and theories, which in their turn
formed a new background for science.</p>
<p>In the whole history of science from Greek philosophy to modern
physics there have been constant attempts to reduce the apparent
complexity of natural phenomena to some simple fundamental ideas and
relations. This is the underlying principle of all natural philosophy.
It is expressed even in the work of the Atomists. Twenty-three centuries
ago Democritus wrote:</p>
<p>By convention sweet is sweet, by convention bitter is bitter, by
convention hot is hot, by convention cold is cold, by convention colour
is colour. But in reality there are atoms and the void. That is, the
objects of sense are supposed to be real and it is customary to regard
them as such, but in truth they are not. Only the atoms and the void are
real.</p>
<p>This idea remains in ancient philosophy nothing more than an
ingenious figment of the imagination. Laws of nature relating subsequent
events were unknown to the Greeks. Science connecting theory and
experiment really began with the work of Galileo. We have followed the
initial clues leading to the laws of motion. Throughout two hundred
years of scientific research force and matter were the underlying
concepts in all endeavours to understand nature. It is impossible to
imagine one without the other because matter demonstrates its existence
as a source of force by its action on other matter.</p>
<p>Let us consider the simplest example: two particles with forces
acting between them. The easiest forces to imagine are those of
attraction and repulsion. In both cases the force vectors lie on a line
connecting the</p>
<p>material points. The demand for simplicity leads to the picture of
particles attracting or repelling each other;</p>
<p>Attraction</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Repulsion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>any other assumption about the direction of the acting forces would
give a much more complicated picture. Can we make an equally simple
assumption about the length of the force vectors? Even if we want to
avoid too special assumptions we can still say one thing: the force
between any two given particles depends only on the distance between
them, like gravitational forces. This seems simple enough. Much more
complicated forces could be imagined, such as those which might depend
not only on the distance but also on the velocities of the two
particles. With matter and force as our fundamental concepts, we can
hardly imagine simpler assumptions than that forces act along the line
connecting the particles and depend only on the distance. But is it
possible to describe all physical phenomena by forces of this kind
alone?</p>
<p>The great achievements of mechanics in all its branches, its striking
success in the development of astronomy, the application of its ideas to
problems apparently different and non-mechanical in character, all these
things contributed to the belief that it is possible</p>
<p>to describe all natural phenomena in terms of simple forces between
unalterable objects. Throughout the two centuries following Galileo’s
time such an endeavour, conscious or unconscious, is apparent in nearly
all scientific creation. This was clearly formulated by Helmholtz about
the middle of the nineteenth century:</p>
<p>Finally, therefore, we discover the problem of physical material
science to be to refer natural phenomena back to unchangeable attractive
and repulsive forces whose intensity depends wholly upon distance. The
solubility of this problem is the condition of the complete
comprehensibility of nature.</p>
<p>Thus, according to Helmholtz, the line of development of science is
determined and follows strictly a fixed course:</p>
<p>And its vocation will be ended as soon as the reduction of natural
phenomena to simple forces is complete and the proof given that this is
the only reduction of which the phenomena are capable.</p>
<p>This view appears dull and naive to a twentieth-century physicist. It
would frighten him to think that the great adventure of research could
be so soon finished, and an unexciting if infallible picture of the
universe established for all time.</p>
<p>Although these tenets would reduce the description of all events to
simple forces, they do leave open the question of just how the forces
should depend on distance. It is possible that for different phenomena
this dependence is different. The necessity of introducing many
different kinds of force for different events is</p>
<p>certainly unsatisfactory from a philosophical point of view.
Nevertheless this so-called mechanical view, most clearly formulated by
Helmholtz, played an important role in its time. The development of the
kinetic theory of matter is one of the greatest achievements directly
influenced by the mechanical view.</p>
<p>Before witnessing its decline, let us provisionally accept the point
of view held by the physicists of the past century and see what
conclusions we can draw from their picture of the external world.</p>
<p>THE KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER Is it possible to explain the phenomena
of heat in terms of the motions of particles interacting through simple
forces? A closed vessel contains a certain mass of gas — air, for
example — at a certain temperature. By heating we raise the temperature,
and thus increase the energy. But how is this heat connected with
motion? The possibility of such a connection is suggested both by our
tentatively accepted philosophical point of view and by the way in which
heat is generated by motion. Heat must be mechanical energy if every
problem is a mechanical one. The gljr/it flf *^r kmtic theory is to
present the cop<sup>p</sup> of matVr just in this way. According to this
theory a gas is a congregation</p>
<p>Of ar&gt;</p>
<p>moving in all directions T colliding with^ each other and changing in
direction of motiorpwith each collision. There must exist an average
speed of molecules, just as in a large human community there exists an
average</p>
<p>age, or an average wealth. There will therefore^be an average kinetic
energy per particle. More heat in the vessel means a greater
^verageTffietic energy. Thus heat, accofdlilgTo tKiiTpicture, is not a
special form of energy different from the mechanical one but is just the
kinetic energy of molecular motion. To any definite temperature there
corresponds a definite average kinetic energy per molecule. This is, in
fact, not an arbitrary assumption. We are forced to regard the kinetic
energy of a molecule as a measure of the temperature of the gas if we
wish to form a consistent mechanical picture of matter.</p>
<p>This theory is more than a play of the imagination. It can be shown
that the kinetic theory of gases is not only in agreement with
experiment, but actually leads to a more profound understanding of the
facts. This may be illustrated by a few examples.</p>
<p>We have a vessel closed by a piston which can move freely. The vessel
contains a certain amount of gas to be kept at a constant temperature.
If the piston is initially at rest in some position, it can be moved
upward by removing and downward by adding weight. To push the piston
down force must be used acting against the inner pressure of the gas.
What is the mechanism of this inner pressure according to the kinetic
theory? A tremendous number of particles constituting the gas are moving
in all directions. They bombard the walls and the piston, bouncing back
like balls thrown against a wall. This continual bombardment by a great
number of particles keeps the piston at a certain height by</p>
<p>opposing the force of gravity acting downward on the piston and the
weights. In one direction there is a constant gravitational force, in
the other very many irregular blows from the molecules. The net effect
on the piston of all these small irregular forces must be equal to that
of the force of gravity if there is to be equilibrium.</p>
<p>Inner Pressure</p>
<p>Gravitational Force</p>
<p>Suppose the piston were pushed down so as to compress the gas to a
fraction of its former volume, say one-half, its temperature being kept
unchanged. What, according to the kinetic theory, can we expect to
happen? Will the force due to the bombardment be more or less effective
than before? The particles are now packed more closely. Although the
average kinetic energy is still the same, the collisions of the
particles with the piston will now occur more frequently and thus the
total force will be greater. It is clear from this</p>
<p>picture presented by the kinetic theory that to keep the piston in
this lower position more weight is required. This simple experimental
fact is well known, but its prediction follows logically from the
kinetic view of matter.</p>
<p>Consider another experimental arrangement. Take two vessels
containing equal volumes of different gases, say hydrogen and nitrogen,
both at the same temperature. Assume the two vessels are closed with
identical pistons, on which are equal weights. This means, briefly, that
both gases have the same volume, temperature, and pressure. Since the
temperatue is the same, so, according to the theory, is the average
kinetic energy per particle. Since the pressures are equal, the two
pistons are bombarded with the same total force. On the average every
particle carries the same energy and both vessels have the same volume.
Therefore, the number of molecules in each must be the same, although
the gases are chemically different. This result is very important for
the understanding of many chemical phenomena. It means that the number
of molecules in a given volume, at a certain temperature and pressure,
is something which is characteristic, not of a particular gas, but of
all gases. It is most astonishing that the kinetic theory not only
predicts the existence of such a universal number, but enables us to
determine it. To this point we shall return very soon.</p>
<p>The kinetic theory of matter explains quantitatively as well as
qualitatively the laws of gases as determined by experiment.
Furthermore, the theory is not restricted</p>
<p>to gases, although its greatest successes have been in this
domain.</p>
<p>A gas can be liquefied by means of a decrease of temperature. A fall
in the temperature of matter means a decrease in the average kinetic
energy of its particles. It is therefore clear that the average kinetic
energy of a liquid particle is smaller than that of a corresponding gas
particle.</p>
<p>A striking manifestation of the motion of particles in liquids was
given for the first time by the so-called Brownian movement, a
remarkable phenomenon which would remain quite mysterious and
incomprehensible without the kinetic theory of matter. It was first
observed by the botanist Brown, and was explained eighty years later, at
the beginning of this century. The only apparatus necessary for
observing Brownian motion is a microscope, which need not even be a
particularly good one.</p>
<p>Brown was working with grains of pollen of certain plants, that
is:</p>
<p>particles or granules of unusually large size varying from one
four-thousandth to about five-thousandth of an inch in length.</p>
<p>He reports further:</p>
<p>While examining the form of these particles immersed in water, I
observed many of them evidently in motion…. These motions were such as
to satisfy me, after frequently repeated observation, that they arose
neither from current in the fluid nor from its gradual evaporation, but
belonged to the particle itself.</p>
<p>What Brown observed was the unceasing agitation of the granules when
suspended in water and visible through the microscope. It is an
impressive sight!</p>
<p>Is the choice of particular plants essential for the phenomenon?
Brown answered this question by repeating the experiment with many
different plants, and found that all the granules, if sufficiently
small, showed such motion when suspended in water. Furthermore, he found
the same kind of restless, irregular motion in very small particles of
inorganic as well as organic substances. Even with a pulverized fragment
of a sphinx he observed the same phenomenon!</p>
<p>How is this motion to be explained? It seems contradictory to all
previous experience. Examination of the position of one suspended
particle, say every thirty seconds, reveals the fantastic form of its
path. The amazing thing is the apparently eternal character of the
motion. A swinging pendulum placed in water soon comes to rest if not
impelled by some external force. The existence of a never-diminishing
motion seems contrary to all experience. This difficulty was splendidly
clarified by the kinetic theory of matter.</p>
<p>Looking at water through even our most powerful microscopes we cannot
see molecules and their motion as pictured by the kinetic theory of
matter. It must be concluded that if the theory of water as a
congregation of particles is correct, the size of the particles must be
beyond the limit of visibility of the best microscopes. Let us
nevertheless stick to the theory and assume that it represents a
consistent picture of reality.</p>
<p>The Brownian particles visible through a microscope are bombarded by
the smaller ones composing the water itself. The Brownian movement
exists if the bombarded particles are sufficiently small. It exists
because this bombardment is not uniform from all sides and cannot be
averaged out, owing to its irregular and haphazard character. The
observed motion is thus the result of the unobservable one. The
behaviour of the big particles reflects in some way that of the
molecules, constituting, so to speak, a magnification so high that it
becomes visible through the microscope. The irregular and haphazard
character of the path of the Brownian particles reflects a similar
irregularity in the path of the smaller particles which constitute
matter. We can understand, therefore, that a quantitative study of
Brownian movement can give us deeper insight into the kinetic theory of
matter. It is apparent that the visible Brownian motion depends on the
size of the invisible bombarding molecules. There would be no Brdwnian
motion at all if the bombarding molecules did not possess a certain
amount of energy or, in other words, if they did not have mass and
velocity. That the study of Brownian motion can lead to a determination
of the mass of a molecule is therefore not astonishing.</p>
<p>Through laborious research, both theoretical and experimental, the
quantitative features of the kinetic theory were formed. The clue
originating in the phenomenon of Brownian movement was one of those
which led to the quantitative data. The same data can</p>
<p>EE 3</p>
<p>be obtained in different ways, starting from quite different clues.
The fact that all these methods support the same view is most important,
for it demonstrates the internal consistency of the kinetic theory of
matter.</p>
<p>Only one of the many quantitative results reached by experiment and
theory will be mentioned here. Suppose we have a gram of the lightest of
all elements, hydrogen, and ask: how many particles are there in this
one gram? The answer will characterize not only hydrogen but also all
other gases, for we already know under what conditions two gases have
the same number of particles.</p>
<p>The theory enables us to answer this question from certain
measurements of the Brownian motion of a suspended particle. The answer
is an astonishingly great number: a three followed by twenty-three other
digits ! The number of molecules in one gram of hydrogen is
303,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Imagine the molecules of a gram of hydrogen so increased in size that
they are visible through a microscope: say that the diameter becomes one
five-thousandth of an inch, such as that of a Brownian particle. Then,
to pack them closely, we should have to use a box each side of which is
about one-quarter of a mile long !</p>
<p>We can easily calculate the mass of one such hydrogen molecule by
dividing i by the number quoted above. The answer is a fantastically
small number:</p>
<p>o-ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0033 gram, representing the mass of one
molecule of hydrogen.</p>

<p>One Brownian particle photographed by a long exposure and covering a
surface</p>
<p>Consecutive positions observed for one of the Brownian particles</p>
<p>The path avenged from these consecutive positions</p>
<p>The experiments on Brownian motion are only some of the many
independent experiments leading to the determination of this number
which plays such an important part in physics.</p>
<p>In the kinetic theory of matter and in all its important achievements
we see the realization of the general philosophical programme: to reduce
the explanation of all phenomena to the interaction between particles of
matter.</p>
<p>WE SUMMARIZE:</p>
<p>In mechanics the future path of a moving body can be predicted and
its past disclosed if its present condition and the forces acting upon
it are known. Thus, for example, the future paths of all planets can be
foreseen. The active forces are Newton’s gravitational forces depending
on the distance alone. The great results of classical mechanics suggest
that the mechanical view can be consistently applied to all branches of
physics, that all phenomena can be explained by the action of forces
representing either attraction or repulsion, depending only upon
distance and acting between unchangeable particles.</p>
<p>In the kinetic theory of matter we see how this view, arising from
mechanical problems, embraces the phenomena of heat and how it leads to
a successful picture of the structure of matter.</p>
