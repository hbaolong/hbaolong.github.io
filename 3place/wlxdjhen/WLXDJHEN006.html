<p>QUANTA</p>
<p>Continuity, discontinuity — Elementary quanta of matter and
electricity — The quanta of light — Light spectra — The waves of matter
— Probability waves — Physics and reality</p>
<p>CONTINUITY, DISCONTINUITY</p>
<p>A MAP of New York City and the surrounding country is spread before
us. We ask: which points on this map can be reached by train? After
looking up these points in a railway timetable, we mark them on the map.
We now change our question and ask: which points can be reached by car?
If we draw lines on the map representing all the roads starting from New
York, every point on these roads can, in fact, be reached by car. In
both cases we have sets of points. In the first they are separated from
each other and represent the different railway stations, and in the
second they are the points along the lines representing the roads. Our
next question is about the distance of each of these points from New
York, or, to be more rigorous, from a certain spot in that city. In the
first case, certain numbers correspond to the points on our map. These
numbers change by irregular, but always finite, leaps and bounds. We
say: the distances from New York of the places which can be reached by
train change only in a discontinuous way. Those of the places which can
be</p>
<p>reached by car, however, may change by steps as small as we wish,
they can vary in a continuous way. The changes in distance can be made
arbitrarily small in the case of a car, but not in the case of a
train.</p>
<p>The output of a coal mine can change in a continuous way. The amount
of coal produced can be decreased or increased by arbitrarily small
steps. But the number of miners employed can change only
discon-tinuously. It would be pure nonsense to say: “Since yesterday,
the number of employees has increased by</p>
<p>3-783.“</p>
<p>Asked about the amount of money in his pocket, a man can give a
number containing only two decimals. A sum of money can change only by
jumps, in a discontinuous way. In America the smallest permissible
change or, as we shall call it, the “ elementary quantum’’ for American
money, is one cent. The elementary quantum for English money is one
farthing, worth only half the American elementary quantum. Here we have
an example of two elementary quanta whose mutual values can be compared.
The ratio of their values has a definite sense since one of them is
worth twice as much as the other.</p>
<p>We can say: some quantities can change continuously and others can
change only discontinuously, by steps which cannot be further decreased.
These indivisible steps are called the elementary quanta of the
particular quantity to which they refer.</p>
<p>We can weigh large quantities of sand and regard its mass as
continuous even though its granular structure</p>
<p>is evident. But if the sand were to become very precious and the
scales used very sensitive, we should have to consider the fact that the
mass always changes by a multiple number of one grain. The mass of this
one grain would be our elementary quantum. From this example we see how
the discontinuous character of a quantity, so far regarded as
continuous, can be detected by increasing the precision of our
measurements.</p>
<p>If we had to characterize the principal idea of the quantum theory in
one sentence, we could say: it must be assumed that some physical
quantities so far regarded as continuous are composed of elementary
quanta.</p>
<p>The region of facts covered by the quantum theory is tremendously
great. These facts have been disclosed by the highly developed technique
of modern experiment. As we can neither show nor describe even the basic
experiments, we shall frequently have to quote their results
dogmatically. Our aim is to explain the principal underlying ideas
only.</p>
<p>ELEMENTARY QUANTA OF MATTER AND ELECTRICITY</p>
<p>In the picture of matter drawn by the kinetic theory, all elements
are built of molecules. Take the simplest case of the lightest element,
that is hydrogen. On p. 66 we saw how the study of Brownian motions led
to the determination of the mass of one hydrogen molecule. Its value
is:</p>
<p>0*000 ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0033 gram.</p>
<p>This means that mass is discontinuous. The mass of a portion of
hydrogen can change only by a whole number of small steps each
corresponding to the mass of one hydrogen molecule. But chemical
processes show that the hydrogen molecule can be broken up into two
parts, or, in other words, that the hydrogen molecule is composed of two
atoms. In chemical processes it is the atom and not the molecule which
plays the role of an elementary quantum. Dividing the above number by
two, we find the mass of a hydrogen atom. This is about</p>
<p>0*000 ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0017 gram.</p>
<p>Mass is a discontinuous quantity. But, of course, we need not bother
about this when determining weight. Even the most sensitive scales are
far from attaining the degree of precision by which the discontinuity in
mass variation could be detected.</p>
<p>Let us return to a well-known fact. A wire is connected with the
source of a current. The current is flowing through the wire from higher
to lower potential. We remember that many experimental facts were
explained by the simple theory of electric fluids flowing through the
wire. We also remember (p. 82) that the decision as to whether the
positive fluid flows from higher to lower potential, or the negative
fluid flows from lower to higher potential, was merely a matter of
convention. For the moment we disregard all the further progress
resulting from the field concepts. Even when thinking in the simple
terms of electric fluids,</p>
<p>there still remain some questions to be settled. As the name “fluid“
suggests, electricity was regarded, in the early days, as a continuous
quantity. The amount of charge could be changed, according to these old
views, by arbitrarily small steps. There was no need to assume
elementary electric quanta. The achievements of the kinetic theory of
matter prepared us for a new question: do elementary quanta of electric
fluids exist? The other question to be settled is: does the current
consist of a flow of positive, negative or perhaps of both fluids? The
idea of all the experiments answering these questions is to tear the
electric fluid from the wire, to let it travel through empty space, to
deprive it of any association with matter and then to investigate its
properties, which must appear most clearly under these conditions. Many
experiments of this kind were performed in the late nineteenth century.
Before explaining the idea of these experimental arrangements, at least
in one case, we shall quote the results. The electric fluid flowing
through the wire is a negative one, directed, therefore, from lower to
higher potential. Had we known this from the start, when the theory of
electric fluids was first formed, we should certainly have interchanged
the words, and called the electricity of the rubber rod positive, that
of the glass rod negative. It would then have been more convenient to
regard the flowing fluid as the positive one. Since our first guess was
wrong, we now have to put up with the inconvenience. The next important
question is whether the structure of this negative fluid is “granular“,
whether</p>
<p>or not it is composed of electric quanta. Again a number of
independent experiments show that there is no doubt as to the existence
of an elementary quantum of this negative electricity. The negative
electric fluid is constructed of grains, just as the beach is composed
of grains of sand, or a house built of bricks. This result was
formulated most clearly by J. J. Thomson, about forty years ago. The
elementary quanta of negative electricity are called electrons. Thus
every negative electric charge is composed of a multitude of elementary
charges represented by electrons. The negative charge can, like mass,
vary only discontinuously. The elementary electric charge is, however,
so small that in many investigations it is equally possible and
sometimes even more convenient to regard it as a continuous quantity.
Thus the atomic and electron theories introduce into science
discontinuous physical quantities which can vary only by jumps.</p>
<p>Imagine two parallel metal plates in some place from which all air
has been extracted. One of the plates has a positive, the other a
negative charge. A positive test charge brought between the two plates
will be repelled by the positively charged and attracted by the
negatively charged plate. Thus the lines of force of the electric field
will be directed from the positively to the negatively charged plate. A
force acting on a negatively charged test body would have the opposite
direction. If the plates are sufficiently large, the lines of force
between them will be equally dense everywhere; it is immaterial where
the test body is placed, the force and,</p>
<p>therefore, the density of the lines of force will be the same.
Electrons brought somewhere between the plates</p>
<p>would behave like raindrops in the gravitational field of the earth,
moving parallel to each other from the negatively to the positively
charged plate. There are many known experimental arrangements for
bringing a shower of electrons into such a field which directs them all
in the same way. One of the simplest is to bring a heated wire between
the charged plates. Such a heated wire emits electrons which are
afterwards directed by the lines of force of the external field. For
instance, radio tubes, familiar to everyone, are based on this
principle.</p>
<p>Many very ingenious experiments have been performed on a beam of
electrons. The changes of their path in different electric and magnetic
external fields have been investigated. It has even been possible to
isolate a single electron and to determine its elementary charge and its
mass, that is, its inertial resistance to the</p>
<p>action of an external force. Here we shall only quote the value of
the mass of an electron. It turned out to be about two thousand times
smaller than the mass of a hydrogen atom. Thus the mass of a hydrogen
atom, small as it is, appears great in comparison with the mass of an
electron. From the point of view of a consistent field theory, the whole
mass, that is, the whole energy, of an electron is the energy of its
field; the bulk of its strength is within a very small sphere, and away
from the “centre“ of the electron it is weak.</p>
<p>We said before that the atom of any element is its smallest
elementary quantum. This statement was believed for a very long time.
Now, however, it is no longer believed ! Science has formed a new view
showing the limitations of the old one. There is scarcely any statement
in physics more firmly founded on facts than the one about the complex
structure of the atom. First came the realization that the electron, the
elementary quantum of the negative electric fluid, is also one of the
components of the atom, one of the elementary bricks from which all
matter is built. The previously quoted example of a heated wire emitting
electrons is only one of the numerous instances of the extraction of
these particles from matter. This result closely connecting the problem
of the structure of matter with that of electricity, follows, beyond any
doubt, from very many independent experimental facts.</p>
<p>It is comparatively easy to extract from an atom some of the
electrons from which it is composed. This can be done by heat, as in our
example of a heated wire, or in</p>
<p>a different way, such as by bombarding atoms with other
electrons.</p>
<p>Suppose a thin, red-hot, metal wire is inserted into rarefied
hydrogen. The wire will emit electrons in all directions. Under the
action of a foreign electric field a given velocity will be imparted to
them. An electron increases its velocity just like a stone falling in
the gravitational field. By this method we can obtain a beam of
electrons rushing along with a definite speed in a definite direction.
Nowadays, we can reach velocities comparable to that of light by
submitting electrons to the action of very strong fields. What happens,
then, when a beam of electrons of a definite velocity impinges on the
molecules of rarefied hydrogen? The impact of a sufficiently speedy
electron will not only disrupt the hydrogen molecule into its two atoms
but will also extract an electron from one of the atoms.</p>
<p>Let us accept the fact that electrons are constituents of matter.
Then, an atom from which an electron has been torn out cannot be
electrically neutral. If it was previously neutral, then it cannot be so
now, since it is poorer by one elementary charge. That which remains
must have a positive charge. Furthermore, since the mass of an electron
is so much smaller than that of the lightest atom, we can safely
conclude that by far the greater part of the mass of the atom is not
represented by electrons but by the remainder of the elementary
particles which are much heavier than the electrons. We call this heavy
part of the atom its nucleus.</p>
<p>Modern experimental physics has developed methods</p>
<p>of breaking up the nucleus of the atom, of changing atoms of one
element into those of another, and of extracting from the nucleus the
heavy elementary particles of which it is built. This chapter of
physics, known as “nuclear physics“, to which Rutherford contributed so
much, is, from the experimental point of view, the most interesting. But
a theory, simple in its fundamental ideas and connecting the rich
variety of facts in the domain of nuclear physics, is still lacking.
Since, in these pages, we are interested only in general physical ideas,
we shall omit this chapter in spite of its great importance in modern
physics.</p>
<p>THE QUANTA OF LIGHT</p>
<p>Let us consider a wall built along the seashore. The waves from the
sea continually impinge on the wall, wash away some of its surface, and
retreat, leaving the way clear for the incoming waves. The mass of the
wall decreases and we can ask how much is washed away in, say, one year.
But now let us picture a different process. We want to diminish the mass
of the wall by the same amount as previously but in a different way. We
shoot at the wall and split it at the places where the bullets hit. The
mass of the wall will be decreased and we can well imagine that the same
reduction in mass is achieved in both cases. But from the appearance of
the wall we could easily detect whether the continuous sea wave or the
discontinuous shower of bullets has been acting. It will be helpful, in
understanding the phenomena which we are about to describe, to bear
in</p>
<p>mind the difference between sea waves and a shower of bullets.</p>
<p>We said, previously, that a heated wire emits electrons. Here we
shall introduce another way of extracting electrons from metal.
Homogeneous light, such as violet light, which is, as we know, light of
a definite wave-length, is impinging on a metal surface. The light
extracts electrons from the metal. The electrons are torn from the metal
and a shower of them speeds along with a certain velocity. From the
point of view of the energy principle we can say: the energy of light is
partially transformed into the kinetic energy of expelled electrons.
Modern experimental technique enables us to register these
electron-bullets, to determine their velocity and thus their energy.
This extraction of electrons by light falling upon metal is called the
photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>Our starting-point was the action of a homogeneous light wave, with
some definite intensity. As in every experiment, we must now change our
arrangements to see whether this will have any influence on the observed
effect.</p>
<p>Let us begin by changing the intensity of the homogeneous violet
light falling on the metal plate and note to what extent the energy of
the emitted electrons depends upon the intensity of the light. Let us
try to find the answer by reasoning instead of by experiment. We could
argue: in the photoelectric effect a certain definite portion of the
energy of radiation is transformed into energy of motion of the
electrons. If we again</p>
<p>illuminate the metal with light of the same wave-length but from a
more powerful source, then the energy of the emitted electrons should be
greater, since the radiation is richer in energy. We should, therefore,
expect the velocity of the emitted electrons to increase if the
intensity of the light increases. But experiment again contradicts our
prediction. Once more we see that the laws of nature are not as we
should like them to be. We have come upon one of the experiments which,
contradicting our predictions, breaks the theory on which they were
based. The actual experimental result is, from the point of view of the
wave theory, astonishing. The observed electrons all have the same
speed, the same energy, which does not change when the intensity of the
light is increased.</p>
<p>This experimental result could not be predicted by the wave theory.
Here again a new theory arises from the conflict between the old theory
and experiment.</p>
<p>Let us be deliberately unjust to the wave theory of light, forgetting
its great achievements, its splendid explanation of the bending of light
around very small obstacles. With our attention focused on the
photoelectric effect, let us demand from the theory an adequate
explanation of this effect. Obviously, we cannot deduce from the wave
theory the independence of the energy of electrons from the intensity of
light by which they have been extracted from the metal plate. We shall,
therefore, try another theory. We remember that Newton’s corpuscular
theory, explaining many of the observed phenomena of light, failed to
account</p>
<p>for the bending of light, which we are now deliberately disregarding.
In Newton’s time the concept of energy did not exist. Light corpuscles
were, according to him, weightless; each colour preserved its own
substance character. Later, when the concept of energy was created and
it was recognized that light carries energy, no one thought of applying
these concepts to the corpuscular theory of light. Newton’s theory was
dead and, until our own century, its revival was not taken
seriously.</p>
<p>To keep the principal idea of Newton’s theory, we must assume that
homogeneous light is composed of energy-grains and replace the old light
corpuscles by light quanta, which we shall call photons, small portions
of energy, travelling through empty space with the velocity of light.
The revival of Newton’s theory in this new form leads to the quantum
theory of light. Not only matter and electric charge, but also energy of
radiation has a granular structure, i.e., is built up of light quanta.
In addition to quanta of matter and quanta of electricity there are also
quanta of energy.</p>
<p>The idea of energy quanta was first introduced by Planck at the
beginning of this century in order to explain some effects much more
complicated than the photoelectric effect. But the photo-effect shows
most clearly and simply the necessity for changing our old concepts.</p>
<p>It is at once evident that this quantum theory of light explains the
photoelectric effect. A shower of photons is falling on a metal plate.
The action between radiation</p>
<p>and matter consists here of very many single processes in which a
photon impinges on the atom and tears out an electron. These single
processes are all alike and the extracted electron will have the same
energy in every case. We also understand that increasing the intensity
of the light means, in our new language, increasing the number of
falling photons. In this case, a different number of electrons would be
thrown out of the metal plate, but the energy of any single one would
not change. Thus we see that this theory is in perfect agreement with
observation.</p>
<p>What will happen if a beam of homogeneous light of a different
colour, say, red instead of violet, falls on the metal surface? Let us
leave experiment to answer this question. The energy of the extracted
electrons must be measured and compared with the energy of electrons
thrown out by violet light. The energy of the electron extracted by red
light turns out to be smaller than the energy of the electron extracted
by violet light. This means that the energy of the light quanta is
different for different colours. The photons belonging to the colour red
have half the energy of those belonging to the colour violet. Or, more
rigorously: the energy of a light quantum belonging to a homogeneous
colour decreases proportionally as the wave-length increases. There is
an essential difference between quanta of energy and quanta of
electricity. Light quanta differ for every wave-length, whereas quanta
of electricity are always the same. If we were to use one of our
previous analogies, we should compare</p>
<p>light quanta to the smallest monetary quanta, differing in each
country.</p>
<p>Let us continue to discard the wave theory of light and assume that
the structure of light is granular and is formed by light quanta, that
is, photons speeding through space with the velocity of light. Thus, in
our new picture, light is a shower of photons, and the photon is the
elementary quantum of light energy. If, however, the wave theory is
discarded, the concept of a wave-length disappears. What new concept
takes its place? The energy of the light quanta! Statements expressed in
the terminology of the wave theory can be translated into statements of
the quantum theory of radiation. For example:</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY OF THE TERMINOLOGY OF THE WAVE THEORY QUANTUM THEORY</p>
<p>Homogeneous light has a Homogeneous light con-definite wave-length.
The tains photons of a definite wave-length of the red end energy. The
energy of the of the spectrum is twice photon for the red end of that of
the violet end. the spectrum is half that of</p>
<p>the violet end.</p>
<p>The state of affairs can be summarized in the following way: there
are phenomena which can be explained by the quantum theory but not by
the wave theory. Photo-effect furnishes an example, though other
phenomena of this kind are known. There are phenomena which can be
explained by the wave theory but not by the quantum theory. The bending
of light around obstacles is a typical example. Finally, there are</p>
<p>phenomena, such as the rectilinear propagation of light, which can be
equally well explained by the quantum and the wave theory of light.</p>
<p>But what is light really? Is it a wave or a shower of photons? Once
before we put a similar question when we asked: is light a wave or a
shower of light corpuscles? At that time there was every reason for
discarding the corpuscular theory of light and accepting the wave
theory, which covered all phenomena. Now, however, the problem is much
more complicated. There seems no likelihood of forming a consistent
description of the phenomena of light by a choice of only one of the two
possible languages. It seems as though we must use sometimes the one
theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are
faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures
of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of
light, but together they do!</p>
<p>How is it possible to combine these two pictures? How can we
understand these two utterly different aspects of light? It is not easy
to account for this new difficulty. Again we are faced with a
fundamental problem.</p>
<p>For the moment let us accept the photon theory of light and try, by
its help, to understand the facts so far explained by the wave theory.
In this way we shall stress the difficulties which make the two theories
appear, at first sight, irreconcilable.</p>
<p>We remember: a beam of homogeneous light passing</p>
<p>through a pinhole gives light and dark rings (p. 118). How is it
possible to understand this phenomenon by the help of the quantum theory
of light, disregarding the wave theory? A photon passes through the
hole. We could expect the screen to appear light if the photon passes
through and dark if it does not. Instead, we find light and dark rings.
We could try to account for it as follows: perhaps there is some
interaction between the rim of the hole and the photon which is
responsible for the appearance of the diffraction rings. This sentence
can, of course, hardly be regarded as an explanation. At best, it
outlines a programme for an explanation holding out at least some hope
of a future understanding of diffraction by interaction between matter
and photons.</p>
<p>But even this feeble hope is dashed by our previous discussion of
another experimental arrangement. Let us take two pinholes. Homogeneous
light passing through the two holes gives light and dark stripes on the
screen. How is this effect to be understood from the point of view of
the quantum theory of light? We could argue: a photon passes through
either one of the two pinholes. If a photon of homogeneous light
represents an elementary light particle, we can hardly imagine its
division and its passage through the two holes. But then the effect
should be exactly as in the first case, light and dark rings and not
light and dark stripes. How is it possible then that the presence of
another pinhole completely changes the effect? Apparently the hole
through which the photon does not pass, even though it may be</p>
<p>at a fair distance, changes the rings into stripes! If the photon
behaves like a corpuscle in classical physics, it must pass through one
of the two holes. But in this case, the phenomena of diffraction seem
quite incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Science forces us to create new ideas, new theories. Their aim is to
break down the wall of contradictions which frequently blocks the way of
scientific progress. All the essential ideas in science were born in a
dramatic conflict between reality and our attempts at understanding.
Here again is a problem for the solution of which new principles are
needed. Before we try to account for the attempts of modern physics to
explain the contradiction between the quantum and the wave aspects of
light, we shall show that exactly the same difficulty appears when
dealing with quanta of matter instead of quanta of light.</p>
<p>LIGHT SPECTRA</p>
<p>We already know that all matter is built of only a few kinds of
particles. Electrons were the first elementary particles of matter to be
discovered. But electrons are also the elementary quanta of negative
electricity. We learned furthermore that some phenomena force us to
assume that light is composed of elementary light quanta, differing for
different wave-lengths. Before proceeding we must discuss some physical
phenomena in which matter as well as radiation plays an essential role.
The sun emits radiation which can be split into its components by a
prism. The continuous spectrum of</p>
<p>the sun can thus be obtained. Every wave-length between the two ends
of the visible spectrum is represented. Let us take another example. It
was previously mentioned that sodium when incandescent emits homogeneous
light, light of one colour or one wave-length. If incandescent sodium is
placed before the prism, we see only one yellow line. In general, if a
radiating body is placed before the prism, then the light it emits is
split up into its components, revealing the spectrum characteristic of
the emitting body.</p>
<p>The discharge of electricity in a tube containing gas produces a
source of light such as seen in the neon tubes used for luminous
advertisements. Suppose such a tube is placed before a spectroscope. The
spectroscope is an instrument which acts like a prism, but with much
greater accuracy and sensitiveness; it splits light into its components,
that is, it analyses it. Light from the sun, seen through a
spectroscope, gives a continuous spectrum; all wave-lengths are
represented in it. If, however, the source of light is a gas through
which a current of electricity passes, the spectrum is of a different
character. Instead of the continuous, multi-coloured design of the sun’s
spectrum, bright, separated stripes appear on a continuous dark
background. Every stripe, if it is very narrow, corresponds to a
definite colour or, in the language of the wave theory, to a definite
wavelength. For example, if twenty lines are visible in the spectrum,
each of them will be designated by one of twenty numbers expressing the
corresponding wavelength. The vapours of the various elements
possess</p>
<p>different systems of lines, and thus different combinations of
numbers designating the wave-lengths composing the emitted light
spectrum. No two elements have identical systems of stripes in their
characteristic spectra, just as no two persons have exactly identical
finger-prints. As a catalogue of these lines was worked out by
physicists, the existence of laws gradually became evident, and it was
possible to replace some of the columns of seemingly disconnected
numbers expressing the length of the various waves by one simple
mathematical formula.</p>
<p>All that has just been said can now be translated into the photon
language. The stripes correspond to certain definite wave-lengths or, in
other words, to photons with a definite energy. Luminous gases do not,
therefore, emit photons with all possible energies, but only those
characteristic of the substance. Reality again limits the wealth of
possibilities.</p>
<p>Atoms of a particular element, say, hydrogen, can emit only photons
with definite energies. Only the emission of definite energy quanta is
permissible, all others being prohibited. Imagine, for the sake of
simplicity, that some element emits only one line, that is, photons of a
quite definite energy. The atom is richer in energy before the emission
and poorer afterwards. From the energy principle it must follow that the
energy level of an atom is higher before emission and lower afterwards,
and that the difference between the two levels must be equal to the
energy of the emitted photon. Thus the fact that an atom of a certain
element emits radiation of one wave-length only, that is photons of
a</p>
<p>definite energy only, could be expressed differently: only two energy
levels are permissible in an atom of this element and the emission of a
photon corresponds to the transition of the atom from the higher to the
lower energy level.</p>
<p>But more than one line appears in the spectra of the elements, as a
rule. The photons emitted correspond to many energies and not to one
only. Or, in other words, we must assume that many energy levels are
allowed in an atom and that the emission of a photon corresponds to the
transition of the atom from a higher energy level to a lower one. But it
is essential that not every energy level should be permitted, since not
every wave-length, not every photon-energy, appears in the spectra of an
element. Instead of saying that some definite lines, some definite
wave-lengths, belong to the spectrum of every atom, we can say that
every atom has some definite energy levels, and that the emission of
light quanta is associated with the transition of the atom from one
energy level to another. The energy levels are, as a rule, not
continuous but discontinuous. Again we see that the possibilities are
restricted by reality.</p>
<p>It was Bohr who showed for the first time why just these and no other
lines appear in the spectra. His theory, formulated twenty-five years
ago, draws a picture of the atom from which, at any rate in simple
cases, the spectra of the elements can be calculated and the apparently
dull and unrelated numbers are suddenly made coherent in the light of
the theory.</p>
<p>Bohr’s theory forms an intermediate step toward a</p>
<p>deeper and more general theory, called the wave or quantum mechanics.
It is our aim in these last pages to characterize the principal ideas of
this theory. Before doing so, we must mention one more theoretical and
experimental result of a more special character.</p>
<p>Our visible spectrum begins with a certain wavelength for the violet
colour and ends with a certain wave-length for the red colour. Or, in
other words, the energies of the photons in the visible spectrum are
always enclosed within the limits formed by the photon energies of the
violet and red lights. This limitation is, of course, only a property of
the human eye. If the difference in energy of some of the energy levels
is sufficiently great, then an ultraviolet photon will be sent out,
giving a line beyond the visible spectrum. Its presence cannot be
detected by the naked eye; a photographic plate must be used.</p>
<p>X-rays are also composed of photons of a much greater energy than
those of visible light, or in other words, their wave-lengths are much
smaller, thousands of times smaller in fact, than those of visible
light.</p>
<p>But is it possible to determine such small wavelengths
experimentally? It was difficult enough to do so for ordinary light. We
had to have small obstacles or small apertures. Two pinholes very near
to each other, showing diffraction for ordinary light, would have to be
many thousands of times smaller and closer together to show diffraction
for X-rays.</p>
<p>How then can we measure the wave-lengths of these rays? Nature
herself comes to our aid.</p>
<p>A crystal is a conglomeration of atoms arranged at very short
distances from each other on a perfectly regular plan. Our drawing shows
a simple model of the structure of a crystal. Instead of minute
apertures, there are extremely small obstacles formed by the atoms</p>
<p>of the element, arranged very close to each other in absolutely
regular order. The distances between the atoms, as found from the theory
of the crystal structure, are so small that they might be expected to
show the effect of diffraction for X-rays. Experiment proved that it is,
in fact, possible to diffract the X-ray wave by means of these closely
packed obstacles disposed in the regular three-dimensional arrangement
occurring in a crystal.</p>
<p>Suppose that a beam of X-rays falls upon a crystal and, after passing
through it, is recorded on a photo-</p>
<p>graphic plate. The plate then shows the diffraction pattern. Various
methods have been used to study the X-ray spectra, to deduce data
concerning the wavelength from the diffraction pattern. What has been
said here in a few words would fill volumes if all theoretical and
experimental details were set forth. In Plate III we give only one
diffraction pattern obtained by one of the various methods. We again see
the dark and light rings so characteristic of the wave theory. In the
centre the non-diffracted ray is visible. If the crystal were not
brought between the X-rays and the photographic plate, only the light
spot in the centre would be seen. From photographs of this kind the
wave-lengths of the X-ray spectra can be calculated and, on the other
hand, if the wave-length is known, conclusions can be drawn about the
structure of the crystal.</p>
<p>THE WAVES OF MATTER</p>
<p>How can we understand the fact that only certain characteristic
wave-lengths appear in the spectra of the elements?</p>
<p>It has often happened in physics that an essential advance was
achieved by carrying out a consistent analogy between apparently
unrelated phenomena. In these pages we have often seen how ideas created
and developed in one branch of science were afterwards successfully
applied to another. The development of the mechanical and field views
gives many examples of this kind. The association of solved problems
with those unsolved may throw new light on our difficulties</p>
<p>(Photographed by A. G“. Shenslone) Spectral lines</p>
<p>(Photographed by iMstowiecki and Gregor]</p>
<p>Diffraction of X-rays</p>
<p>(Photographed by Ijoria and Klinger) Diffraction of electronic
waves</p>
<p>by suggesting new ideas. It is easy to find a superficial analogy
which really expresses nothing. But to discover some essential common
features, hidden beneath a surface of external differences, to form, on
this basis, a new successful theory, is important creative work. The
development of the so-called wave mechanics, begun by de Broglie and
Schrodinger, less than fifteen years ago, is a typical example of the
achievement of a successful theory by means of a deep and fortunate
analogy.</p>
<p>Our starting-point is a classical example having nothing to do with
modern physics. We take in our</p>
<p>hand the end of a very long flexible rubber tube, or a very long
spring, and try to move it rhythmically up and down, so that the end
oscillates. Then, as we have seen in many other examples, a wave is
created by the oscillation which spreads through the tube with a certain
velocity. If we imagine an infinitely long tube, then the portions of
waves, once started, will pursue their endless journey without
interference.</p>
<p>Now another case. The two ends of the same tube are fastened. If
preferred, a violin string may be used. What happens now if a wave is
created at one end of the rubber tube or cord? The wave begins its
journey as in the previous example, but it is soon reflected by the
other end of the tube. We now have two waves:</p>
<p>one creation by oscillation, the other by reflection; they travel in
opposite directions and interfere with each other. It would not be
difficult to trace the interference of the two waves and discover the
one wave resulting from their superposition; it is called the standing
wave. The two words “standing“ and “wave“ seem to contradict each other;
their combination is, nevertheless, justified by the result of the
superposition of the two waves.</p>
<p>The simplest example of a standing wave is the motion of a cord with
the two ends fixed, an up-and-down motion, as shown in our drawing. This
motion is</p>
<p>the result of one wave lying on the other when the two are travelling
in opposite directions. The characteristic feature of this motion is:
only the two end-points are at rest. They are called nodes. The wave
stands, so to speak, between the two nodes, all points of the cord
reaching simultaneously the maxima and minima of their deviation.</p>
<p>But this is only the simplest kind of a standing wave. There are
others. For example, a standing wave can have three nodes, one at each
end and one in the centre.</p>
<p>In this case three points are always at rest. A glance at the
drawings shows that here the wave-length is half as great as the one
with two nodes. Similarly, standing</p>
<p>waves can have four, five, and more nodes. The wavelength in each
case will depend on the number of nodes. This number can only be an
integer and can change only by jumps. The sentence—“the number of</p>
<p>nodes in a standing wave is 3*576“—is pure nonsense. Thus the
wave-length can only change discontinuously. Here, in this most
classical problem, we recognize the familiar features of the quantum
theory. The standing wave produced by a violin player is, in fact, still
more complicated, being a mixture of very many waves with two, three,
four, five, and more nodes and, therefore, a mixture of several
wave-lengths. Physics can analyse such a mixture into the simple
standing waves from which it is composed. Or, using our previous
terminology, we could say that the oscillating string has its spectrum,
just as an element emitting radiation. And, in the same way as for the
spectrum of an element, only certain wave-lengths are allowed, all
others being prohibited.</p>
<p>We have thus discovered some similarity between the oscillating cord
and the atom emitting radiation. Strange as this analogy may seem, let
us draw further conclusions from it and try to proceed with the
comparison, once having chosen it. The atoms of every element are
composed of elementary particles, the heavier constituting the nucleus,
and the lighter the electrons. Such a system of particles behaves like a
small acoustical instrument in which standing waves are produced.</p>
<p>Yet the standing wave is the result of interference between two or,
generally, even more moving waves. If there is some truth in our
analogy, a still simpler arrangement than that of the atom should
correspond to a spreading wave. What is the simplest arrangement? In our
material world, nothing can be simpler than an electron, an elementary
particle, on which no forces are acting, that is, an electron at rest or
in uniform motion. We could guess a further link in the chain of our
analogy: electron moving uniformly-&gt;waves of a definite length. This
was de Broglie’s new and courageous idea.</p>
<p>It was previously shown that there are phenomena in which light
reveals its wave-like character and others in which light reveals its
corpuscular character. After becoming used to the idea that light is a
wave, we found, to our. astonishment, that in some cases, for instance
in the photoelectric effect, it behaves like a shower of photons. Now we
have just the opposite state of affairs for electrons. We accustomed
ourselves</p>
<p>QUANTA</p>
<p>to the idea that electrons are particles, elementary quanta of
electricity and matter. Their charge and mass were investigated. If
there is any truth in de Broglie’s idea, then there must be some
phenomena in which matter reveals its wave-like character. At first,
this conclusion, reached by following the acoustical analogy, seems
strange and incomprehensible. How can a moving corpuscle have anything
to do with a wave? But this is not the first time we have faced a
difficulty of this kind in physics. We met the same problem in the
domain of light phenomena.</p>
<p>Fundamental ideas play the most essential role in forming a physical
theory. Books on physics are full of complicated mathematical formulae.
But thought and ideas, not formulae, are the beginning of every physical
theory. The ideas must later take the mathematical form of a
quantitative theory, to make possible the comparison with experiment.
This can be explained by the example of the problem with which we are
now dealing. The principal guess is that the uniformly moving electron
will behave, in some phenomena, like a wave. Assume that an electron or
a shower of electrons, provided they all have the same velocity, is
moving uniformly. The mass, charge, and velocity of each individual
electron are known. If we wish to associate in some way a wave concept
with a uniformly moving electron or electrons, our next question must
be: what is the wave-length? This is a quantitative question and a more
or less quantitative theory must be built up to answer it. This is
indeed a simple matter. The mathe-</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>matical simplicity of de Broglie’s work, providing an answer to this
question, is most astonishing. At the time his work was done, the
mathematical technique of other physical theories was very subtle and
complicated, comparatively speaking. The mathematics dealing with the
problem of waves of matter is extremely simple and elementary but the
fundamental ideas are deep and far-reaching.</p>
<p>Previously, in the case of light waves and photons, it was shown that
every statement formulated in the wave language can be translated into
the language of photons or light corpuscles. The same is true for
electronic waves. For uniformly moving electrons, the corpuscular
language is already known. But every statement expressed in the
corpuscular language can be translated into the wave language, just as
in the case of photons. Two clues laid down the rules of translation.
The analogy between light waves and electronic waves or photons and
electrons is one clue. We try to use the same method of translation for
matter as for light. The special relativity theory furnished the other
clue. The laws of nature must be invariant with respect to the Lorentz
and not to the classical transformation. These two clues together
determine the wave-length corresponding to a moving electron. It follows
from the theory that an electron moving with a velocity of, say, 10,000
miles per second, has a wave-length which can be easily calculated, and
which turns out to lie in the same region as the X-ray wave-lengths.
Thus we conclude further that if the wave character of matter</p>
<p>can be detected, it should be done experimentally in an analogous way
to that of X-rays.</p>
<p>Imagine an electron beam moving uniformly with a given velocity, or,
to use the wave terminology, a homogeneous electronic wave, and assume
that it falls on a very thin crystal, playing the part of a diffraction
grating. The distances between the diffracting obstacles in the crystal
are so small that diffraction for X-rays can be produced. One might
expect a similar effect for electronic waves with the same order of
wave-length. A photographic plate would register this diffraction of
electronic waves passing through the thin layer of crystal. Indeed, the
experiment produces what is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of
the theory: the phenomenon of diffraction for electronic waves. The
similarity between the diffraction of an electronic wave and that of an
X-ray is particularly marked as seen from a comparison of the patterns
in Plate III. We know that such pictures enable us to determine the
wave-lengths of X-rays. The same holds good for electronic waves. The
diffraction pattern gives the length of a wave of matter and the perfect
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment confirms the chain
of our argument splendidly.</p>
<p>Our previous difficulties are broadened and deepened by this result.
This can be made clear by an example similar to the one given for a
light wave. An electron shot at a very small hole will bend like a light
wave. Light and dark rings appear on the photographic plate. There may
be some hope of explaining</p>
<p>this phenomenon by the interaction between the electron and the rim,
though such an explanation does not seem to be very promising. But what
about the two pinholes? Stripes appear instead of rings. How is it
possible that the presence of the other hole completely changes the
effect? The electron is indivisible and can, it would seem, pass through
only one of the two holes. How could an electron passing through a hole
possibly know that another hole has been made some distance away?</p>
<p>We asked before: what is light? Is it a shower of corpuscles or a
wave? We now ask: what is matter, what is an electron? Is it a particle
or a wave? The electron behaves like a particle when moving in an
external electric or magnetic field. It behaves like a wave when
diffracted by a crystal. With the elementary quanta of matter we came
across the same difficulty that we met with in the light quanta. One of
the most fundamental questions raised by recent advance in science is
how to reconcile the two contradictory views of matter and wave. It is
one of those fundamental difficulties which, once formulated, must lead,
in the long run, to scientific progress. Physics has tried to solve this
problem. The future must decide whether the solution suggested by modern
physics is enduring or temporary.</p>
<p>PROBABILITY WAVES</p>
<p>If, according to classical mechanics, we know the position and
velocity of a given material point and also what external forces are
acting, we can predict, from</p>
<p>the mechanical laws, the whole of its future path. The sentence: “The
material point has such-and-such position and velocity at such-and-such
an instant,“ has a definite meaning in classical mechanics. If this
statement were to lose its sense, our argument (p. 32) about foretelling
the future path would fail.</p>
<p>In the early nineteenth century, scientists wanted to reduce all
physics to simple forces acting on material particles that have definite
positions and velocities at any instant. Let us recall how we described
motion when discussing mechanics at the beginning of our journey through
the realm of physical problems. We drew points along a definite path
showing the exact positions of the body at certain instants and then
tangent vectors showing the direction and magnitude of the velocities.
This was both simple and convincing. But it cannot be repeated for our
elementary quanta of matter, that is electrons, or for quanta of energy,
that is photons. We cannot picture the journey of a photon or electron
in the way we imagined motion in classical mechanics. The example of the
two pinholes shows this clearly. Electron and photon seem to pass
through the two holes. It is thus impossible to explain the effect by
picturing the path of an electron or a photon in the old classical
way.</p>
<p>We must, of course, assume the presence of elementary actions, such
as the passing of electrons or photons through the holes. The existence
of elementary quanta of matter and energy cannot be doubted. But the
elementary laws certainly cannot be formulated by</p>
<p>specifying positions and velocities at any instant in the simple
manner of classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, try something different. Let us continually repeat
the same elementary processes. One after the other, the electrons are
sent in the direction of the pinholes. The word “electron“ is used here
for the sake of definiteness; our argument is also valid for
photons.</p>
<p>The same experiment is repeated over and over again in exactly the
same way; the electrons all have the same velocity and move in the
direction of the two pinholes. It need hardly be mentioned that this is
an idealized experiment which cannot be carried out in reality but may
well be imagined. We cannot shoot out single photons or electrons at
given instants, like bullets from a gun.</p>
<p>The outcome of repeated experiments must again be dark and light
rings for one hole and dark and light stripes for two. But there is one
essential difference. In the case of one individual electron, the
experimental result was incomprehensible. It is more easily understood
when the experiment is repeated many times. We can now say: light
stripes appear where many electrons fall. The stripes become darker at
the place where fewer electrons are falling. A completely dark spot
means that there are no electrons. We are not, of course, allowed to
assume that all the electrons pass through one of the holes. If this
were so, it could not make the slightest difference whether or not the
other is covered. But we already know that covering the</p>
<p>second hole does make a difference. Since one particle is
indivisible, we cannot imagine that it passes through both the holes.
The fact that the experiment was repeated many times points to another
way out. Some of the electrons may pass through the first hole and
others through the second. We do not know why individual electrons
choose particular holes, but the net result of repeated experiments must
be that both pinholes participate in transmitting the electrons from the
source to the screen. If we state only what happens to the crowd of
electrons when the experiment is repeated, not bothering about the
behaviour of individual particles, the difference between the ringed and
the striped pictures becomes comprehensible. By the discussion of a
sequence of experiments a new idea was born, that of a crowd with the
individuals behaving in an unpredictable way. We cannot foretell the
course of one single electron, but we can predict that, in the net
result, the light and dark stripes will appear on the screen.</p>
<p>Let us leave quantum physics for the moment.</p>
<p>We have seen in classical physics that if we know the position and
velocity of a material point at a certain instant and the forces acting
upon it, we can predict its future path. We also saw how the mechanical
point of view was applied to the kinetic theory of matter. But in this
theory a new idea arose from our reasoning. It will be helpful in
understanding later arguments to grasp this idea thoroughly.</p>
<p>There is a vessel containing gas. In attempting to</p>
<p>trace the motion of every particle one would have to commence by
finding the initial states, that is, the initial positions and
velocities of all the particles. Even if this were possible, it would
take more than a human lifetime to set down the result on paper, owing
to the enormous number of particles which would have to be considered.
If one then tried to employ the known methods of classical mechanics for
calculating the final positions of the particles, the difficulties would
be insurmountable. In principle, it is possible to use the method
applied for the motion of planets, but in practice this is useless and
must give way to the method of statistics. This method dispenses with
any exact knowledge of initial states. We know less about the system at
any given moment and are thus less able to say anything about its past
or future. We become indifferent to the fate of the individual gas
particles. Our problem is of a different nature. For example: we do not
ask, “What is the speed of every particle at this moment?“ But we may
ask: “How many particles have a speed between 1000 and uoo feet per
second?“ We care nothing for individuals. What we seek to determine are
average values typifying the whole aggregation. It is clear that there
can be some point in a statistical method of reasoning only when the
system consists of a large number of individuals.</p>
<p>By applying the statistical method we cannot foretell the behaviour
of an individual in a crowd. We can only foretell the chance, the
probability, that it will behave in some particular manner. If our
statistical</p>
<p>laws tell us that one-third of the particles have a speed between
1000 and uoo feet per second, it means that by repeating our
observations for many particles, we shall really obtain this average, or
in other words, that the probability of finding a particle within this
limit is equal to one-third.</p>
<p>Similarly, to know the birth rate of a great community does not mean
knowing whether any particular family is blessed with a child. It means
a knowledge of statistical results in which the contributing
personalities play no role.</p>
<p>By observing the registration plates of a great many cars we can soon
discover that one-third of their numbers are divisible by three. But we
cannot foretell whether the car which will pass in the next moment will
have this property. Statistical laws can be applied only to big
aggregations, but not to their individual members.</p>
<p>We can now return to our quantum problem.</p>
<p>The laws of quantum physics are of a statistical character. This
means: they concern not one single system but an aggregation of
identical systems; they cannot be verified by measurement of one
individual, but only by a series of repeated measurements.</p>
<p>Radioactive disintegration is one of the many events for which
quantum physics tries to formulate laws governing the spontaneous
transmutation from one element to another. We know, for example, that in
1600 years half of one gram of radium will disintegrate, and half will
remain. We can foretell approximately how</p>
<p>many atoms will disintegrate during the next half-hour, but we cannot
say, even in our theoretical descriptions, why just these particular
atoms are doomed. According to our present knowledge, we have no power
to designate the individual atoms condemned to disintegration. The fate
of an atom does not depend on its age. There is not the slightest trace
of a law governing their individual behaviour. Only statistical laws can
be formulated, laws governing large aggregations of atoms.</p>
<p>Take another example. The luminous gas of some element placed before
a spectroscope shows lines of definite wave-length. The appearance of a
discontinuous set of definite wave-lengths is characteristic of the
atomic phenomena in which the existence of elementary quanta is
revealed. But there is still another aspect of this problem. Some of the
spectrum lines are very distinct, others are fainter. A distinct line
means that a comparatively large number of photons belonging to this
particular wave-length are emitted; a faint line means that a
comparatively small number of photons belonging to this wave-length are
emitted. Theory again gives us statements of a statistical nature only.
Every line corresponds to a transition from higher to lower energy
level. Theory tells us only about the probability of each of these
possible transitions, but nothing about the actual transition of an
individual atom. The theory works splendidly because all these phenomena
involve large aggregations and not single individuals.</p>
<p>It seems that the new quantum physics resembles somewhat the kinetic
theory of matter, since both are of a statistical nature and both refer
to great aggregations. But this is not so ! In this analogy an
understanding not only of the similarities but also of the differences
is most important. The similarity between the kinetic theory of matter
and quantum physics lies chiefly in their statistical character. But
what are the differences?</p>
<p>If we wish to know how many men and women over the age of twenty live
in a city, we must get every citizen to fill up a form under the
headings “male“, “female “, and ’ c age’’. Provided every answer is
correct, we can obtain, by counting and segregating them, a result of a
statistical nature. The individual names and addresses on the forms are
of no account. Our statistical view is gained by the knowledge of
individual cases. Similarly, in the kinetic theory of matter, we have
statistical laws governing the aggregation, gained on the basis of
individual laws.</p>
<p>But in quantum physics the state of affairs is entirely different.
Here the statistical laws are given immediately. The individual laws are
discarded. In the example of a photon or an electron and two pinholes we
have seen that we cannot describe the possible motion of elementary
particles in space and time as we did in classical physics. Quantum
physics abandons individual laws of elementary particles and states
directly the statistical laws governing aggregations. It is impossible,
on the basis of quantum physics, to describe positions and velocities of
an elementary particle or to predict its</p>
<p>future path as in classical physics. Quantum physics deals only with
aggregations, and its laws are for crowds and not for individuals.</p>
<p>It is hard necessity and not speculation or a desire for novelty
which forces us to change the old classical view. The difficulties of
applying the old view have been outlined for one instance only, that of
diffraction phenomena. But many others, equally convincing, could be
quoted. Changes of view are continually forced upon us by our attempts
to understand reality. But it always remains for the future to decide
whether we chose the only possible way out and whether or not a better
solution of our difficulties could have been found.</p>
<p>We have had to forsake the description of individual cases as
objective happenings in space and time; we have had to introduce laws of
a statistical nature. These are the chief characteristics of modern
quantum physics.</p>
<p>Previously, when introducing new physical realities, such as the
electromagnetic and gravitational field, we tried to indicate in general
terms the characteristic features of the equations through which the
ideas have been mathematically formulated. We shall now do the same with
quantum physics, referring only very briefly to the work of Bohr, de
Broglie, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Dirac and Born.</p>
<p>Let us consider the case of one electron. The electron may be under
the influence of an arbitrary foreign electromagnetic field, or free
from all external influences. It may move, for instance, in the field of
an atomic</p>
<p>nucleus or it may diffract on a crystal. Quantum physics teaches us
how to formulate the mathematical equations for any of these
problems.</p>
<p>We have already recognized the similarity between an oscillating
cord, the membrane of a drum, a wind instrument, or any other acoustical
instrument on the one hand, and a radiating atom on the other. There is
also some similarity between the mathematical equations governing the
acoustical problem and those governing the problem of quantum physics.
But again the physical interpretation of the quantities determined in
these two cases is quite different. The physical quantities describing
the oscillating cord and the radiating atom have quite a different
meaning, despite some formal likeness in the equations. In the case of
the cord, we ask about the deviation of an arbitrary point from its
normal position at an arbitrary moment. Knowing the form of the
oscillating cord at a given instant, we know everything we wish. The
deviation from the normal can thus be calculated for any other moment
from the mathematical equations for the oscillating cord. The fact that
some definite deviation from the normal position corresponds to every
point of the cord is expressed more rigorously as follows: for any
instant, the deviation from the normal value is a function of the
co-ordinates of the cord. All points of the cord form a one-dimensional
continuum, and the deviation is a function defined in this
one-dimensional continuum, to be calculated from the equations of the
oscillating cord.</p>
<p>Analogously, in the case of an electron a certain function is
determined for any point in space and for any moment. We shall call this
function the probability wave. In our analogy the probability wave
corresponds to the deviation from the normal position in the acoustical
problem. The probability wave is, at a given instant, a function of a
three-dimensional continuum, whereas, in the case of the cord the
deviation was, at a given moment, a function of the one-dimensional
continuum. The probability wave forms the catalogue of our knowledge of
the quantum system under consideration and will enable us to answer all
sensible statistical questions concerning this system. It does not tell
us the position and velocity of the electron at any moment because such
a question has no sense in quantum physics. But it will tell us the
probability of meeting the electron on a particular spot, or where we
have the greatest chance of meeting an electron. The result does not
refer to one, but to many repeated measurements. Thus the equations of
quantum physics determine the probability wave just as Maxwell’s
equations determine the electromagnetic field and the gravitational
equations determine the gravitational field. The laws of quantum physics
are again structure laws. But the meaning of physical concepts
determined by these equations of quantum physics is much more abstract
than in the case of electromagnetic and gravitational fields; they
provide only the mathematical means of answering questions of a
statistical nature.</p>
<p>So far we have considered the electron in some ex-</p>
<p>ternal field. If it were not the electron, the smallest possible
charge, but some respectable charge containing billions of electrons, we
could disregard the whole quantum theory and treat the problem according
to our old pre-quantum physics. Speaking of currents in a wire, of
charged conductors, of electromagnetic waves, we can apply our old
simple physics contained in Maxwell’s equations. But we cannot do this
when speaking of the photoelectric effect, intensity of spectral lines,
radioactivity, diffraction of electric waves and many other phenomena in
which the quantum character of matter and energy is revealed. We must
then, so to speak, go one floor higher. Whereas in classical physics we
spoke of positions and velocities of one particle, we must now consider
probability waves, in a three-dimensional continuum corresponding to
this one-particle problem.</p>
<p>Quantum physics gives its own prescription for treating a problem if
we have previously been taught how to treat an analogous problem from
the point of view of classical physics.</p>
<p>For one elementary particle, electron or photon, we have probability
waves in a three-dimensional continuum, characterizing the statistical
behaviour of the system if the experiments are often repeated. But what
about the case of not one but two interacting particles, for instance,
two electrons, electron and photon, or electron and nucleus? We cannot
treat them separately and describe each of them through a probability
wave in three dimensions, just because of their mutual inter-</p>
<p>action. Indeed, it is not very difficult to guess how to describe in
quantum physics a system composed of two interacting particles. We have
to descend one floor, to return for a moment to classical physics. The
position of two material points in space, at any moment, is
characterized by six numbers, three for each of the points. All possible
positions of the two material points form a six-dimensional continuum
and not a three-dimensional one as in the case of one point. If we now
again ascend one floor, to quantum physics, we shall have probability
waves in a six-dimensional continuum and not in a three-dimensional
continuum as in the case of one particle. Similarly, for three, four,
and more particles the probability waves will be functions in a
continuum of nine, twelve, and more dimensions.</p>
<p>This shows clearly that the probability waves are more abstract than
the electromagnetic and gravitational field existing and spreading in
our three-dimensional space. The continuum of many dimensions forms the
background for the probability waves, and only for one particle does the
number of dimensions equal that of physical space. The only physical
significance of the probability wave is that it enables us to answer
sensible statistical questions in the case of many particles as well as
of one. Thus, for instance, for one electron we could ask about the
probability of meeting an electron in some particular spot. For two
particles our question could be: what is the probability of meeting the
two particles at two definite spots at a given instant?</p>
<p>Our first step away from classical physics was abandoning the
description of individual cases as objective events in space and time.
We were forced to apply the statistical method provided by the
probability waves. Once having chosen this way, we are obliged to go
further toward abstraction. Probability waves in many dimensions
corresponding to the many-particle problem must be introduced.</p>
<p>Let us, for the sake of briefness, call everything except quantum
physics, classical physics. Classical and quantum physics differ
radically. Classical physics aims at a description of objects existing
in space, and the formulation of laws governing their changes in time.
But the phenomena revealing the particle and wave nature of matter and
radiation, the apparently statistical character of elementary events
such as radioactive disintegration, diffraction, emission of spectral
lines, and many others, forced us to give up this view. Quantum physics
does not aim at the description of individual objects in space and their
changes in time. There is no place in quantum physics for statements
such as: “This object is so-and-so, has this-and-this property.’ 5
Instead we have statements of this kind: “There is such-and-such a
probability that the individual object is so-and-so and has
this-and-this property.’ 5 There is no place in quantum physics for laws
governing the changes in time of the individual object. Instead, we have
laws governing the changes in time of the probability. Only this
fundamental change, brought into physics by the quantum theory, made
possible an adequate</p>
<p>explanation of the apparently discontinuous and statistical character
of events in the realm of phenomena in which the elementary quanta of
matter and radiation reveal their existence.</p>
<p>Yet new, still more difficult problems arise which have not been
definitely settled as yet. We shall mention only some of these unsolved
problems. Science is not and will never be a closed book. Every
important advance brings new questions. Every development reveals, in
the long run, new and deeper difficulties.</p>
<p>We already know that in the simple case of one or many particles we
can rise from the classical to the quantum description, from the
objective description of events in space and time to probability waves.
But we remember the all-important field concept in classical physics.
How can we describe interaction between elementary quanta of matter and
field? If a probability wave in thirty dimensions is needed for the
quantum description of ten particles, then a probability wave with an
infinite number of dimensions would be needed for the quantum
description of a field. The transition from the classical field concept
to the corresponding problem of probability waves in quantum physics is
a very difficult step. Ascending one floor is here no easy task and all
attempts so far made to solve the problem must be regarded as
unsatisfactory. There is also one other fundamental problem. In all our
arguments about the transition from classical physics to quantum physics
we used the old pre-relativistic description in which space and time are
treated differently. If, however, we</p>
<p>try to begin from the classical description as proposed by the
relativity theory, then our ascent to the quantum problem seems much
more complicated. This is another problem tackled by modern physics, but
still far from a complete and satisfactory solution. There is still a
further difficulty in forming a consistent physics for heavy particles,
constituting the nuclei. In spite of the many experimental data and the
many attempts to throw light on the nuclear problem, we are still in the
dark about some of the most fundamental questions in this domain.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that quantum physics explained a very rich variety
of facts, achieving, for the most part, splendid agreement between
theory and observation. The new quantum physics removes us still further
from the old mechanical view, and a retreat to the former position
seems, more than ever, unlikely. But there is also no doubt that quantum
physics must still be based on the two concepts: matter and field. It
is, in this sense, a dualistic theory and does not bring our old problem
of reducing everything to the field concept even one step nearer
realization.</p>
<p>Will the further development be along the line chosen in quantum
physics, or is it more likely that new revolutionary ideas will be
introduced into physics? Will the road of advance again make a sharp
turn, as it has so often done in the past?</p>
<p>During the last few years all the difficulties of quantum physics
have been concentrated around a few principal points. Physics awaits
their solution impa-</p>
<p>tiently. But there is no way of foreseeing when and where the
clarification of these difficulties will be brought about.</p>
<p>PHYSICS AND REALITY</p>
<p>What are the general conclusions which can be drawn from the
development of physics indicated here in a broad outline representing
only the most fundamental ideas?</p>
<p>Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated
facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented
ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality
and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense
impressions. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is
whether and in what way our theories form such a link.</p>
<p>We have seen new realities created by the advance of physics. But
this chain of creation can be traced back far beyond the starting point
of physics. One of the most primitive concepts is that of an object. The
concepts of a tree, a horse, any material body, are creations gained on
the basis of experience, though the impressions from which they arise
are primitive in comparison with the world of physical phenomena. A cat
teasing a mouse also creates, by thought, its own primitive reality. The
fact that the cat reacts in a similar way toward any mouse it meets
shows that it forms concepts and theories which are its guide through
its own world of sense impressions.</p>
<p>“Three trees“ is something different from “two trees“. Again “two
trees“ is different from “two stones“. The concepts of the pure numbers
2, 3, 4, …, freed from the objects from which they arose, are creations
of the thinking mind which describe the reality of our world.</p>
<p>The psychological subjective feeling of time enables us to order our
impressions, to state that one event precedes another. But to connect
every instant of time with a number, by the use of a clock, to regard
time as a one-dimensional continuum, is already an invention. So also
are the concepts of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and our space
understood as a three-dimensional continuum.</p>
<p>Physics really began with the invention of mass, force, and an
inertial system. These concepts are all free inventions. They led to the
formulation of the mechanical point of view. For the physicist of the
early nineteenth century, the reality of our outer world consisted of
particles with simple forces acting between them and depending only on
the distance. He tried to retain as long as possible his belief that he
would succeed in explaining all events in nature by these fundamental
concepts of reality. The difficulties connected with the deflection of
the magnetic needle, the difficulties connected with the structure of
the ether, induced us to create a more subtle reality. The important
invention of the electromagnetic field appears. A courageous scientific
imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of
bodies, but</p>
<p>the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be
essential for ordering and understanding events.</p>
<p>Later developments both destroyed old concepts and created new ones.
Absolute time and the inertial co-ordinate system were abandoned by the
relativity theory. The background for all events was no longer the
one-dimensional time and the three-dimensional space continuum, but the
four-dimensional time-space continuum, another free invention, with new
transformation properties. The inertial co-ordinate system was no longer
needed. Every co-ordinate system is equally suited for the description
of events in nature.</p>
<p>The quantum theory again created new and essential features of our
reality. Discontinuity replaced continuity. Instead of laws governing
individuals, probability laws appeared.</p>
<p>The reality created by modern physics is, indeed, far removed from
the reality of the early days. But the aim of every physical theory
still remains the same.</p>
<p>With the help of physical theories we try to find our way through the
maze of observed facts, to order and understand the world of our sense
impressions. We want the observed facts to follow logically from our
concept of reality. Without the belief that it is possible to grasp the
reality with our theoretical constructions, without the belief in the
inner harmony of our world, there could be no science. This belief is
and always will remain the fundamental motive for all scientific
creation. Throughout all our efforts, in every dramatic</p>
<p>struggle between old and new views, we recognize the eternal longing
for understanding, the ever-firm belief in the harmony of our world,
continually strengthened by the increasing obstacles to
comprehension.</p>
<p>WE SUMMARIZE:</p>
<p>Again the rich variety of facts in the realm of atomic phenomena
forces us to invent new physical concepts. Matter has a granular
structure; it is composed of elementary particles, the elementary quanta
of matter. Thus, the electric charge has a granular structure and — most
important from the point of view of the quantum theory — so has energy.
Photons are the energy quanta of which light is composed.</p>
<p>Is light a wave or a shower of photons? Is a beam of electrons a
shower of elementary particles or a wave? These fundamental questions
are forced upon physics by experiment. In seeking to answer them we have
to abandon the description of atomic events as happenings in space and
time, we have to retreat still further from the old mechanical view.
Quantum physics formulates laws governing crowds and not individuals.
Not properties but probabilities are described, not laws disclosing the
future of systems are formulated, but laws governing the changes in time
of the probabilities and relating to great congregations of
individuals.</p>
