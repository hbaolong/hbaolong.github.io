<h4 id="vectors">VECTORS</h4>
<p>All motions we have been considering are rectilinear, that is, along
a straight line. Now we must go one step farther. We gain an
understanding of the laws of nature by analysing the simplest cases and
by leaving out of our first attempts all intricate complications. A
straight line is simpler than a curve. It is, however, impossible to be
satisfied with an understanding of rectilinear motion alone. The motions
of the moon, the earth and the planets, just those to which the
principles of mechanics have been applied with such brilliant success,
are motions along curved paths. Passing from rectilinear motion to
motion along a curved path brings new difficulties. We must have the
courage to overcome them if we wish to understand the principles</p>
<p>of classical mechanics which gave us the first clues and so formed
the starting-point for the development of science.</p>
<p>Let us consider another idealized experiment, in which a perfect
sphere rolls uniformly on a smooth table. We know that if the sphere is
given a push, that is, if an external force is applied, the velocity
will be changed. Now suppose that the direction of the blow is not, as
in the example of the cart, in the line of motion, but in a quite
different direction, say, perpendicular to that line. What happens to
the sphere? Three stages of the motion can be distinguished: the initial
motion, the action of the force, and the final motion after the force
has ceased to act. According to the law of inertia, the velocities
before and after the action of the force are both perfectly uniform. But
there is a difference between the uniform motion before and after the
action of the force: the direction is changed. The initial path of the
sphere and the direction of the force are perpendicular to each other.
The final motion will be along neither of these two lines, but somewhere
between them, nearer the direction of the force if the blow is a hard
one and the initial velocity small, nearer the original line of motion
if the blow is gentle and the initial velocity great. Our new
conclusion, based on the law of inertia, is: in general the action of an
external force changes not only the speed but also the direction of the
motion. An understanding of this fact prepares us for the generalization
introduced into physics by the concept of vectors.</p>
<p>We can continue to use our straightforward method of reasoning. The
starting-point is again Galileo’s law of inertia. We are still far from
exhausting the consequences of this valuable clue to the puzzle of
motion.</p>
<p>Let us consider two spheres moving in different directions on a
smooth table. So as to have a definite picture, we may assume the two
directions perpendicular to each other. Since there are no external
forces acting, the motions are perfectly uniform. Suppose, further, that
the speeds are equal, that is, both cover the same distance in the same
interval of time. But is it correct to say that the two spheres have the
same velocity? The answer can be yes or no ! If the speedometers of two
cars both show forty miles per hour, it is usual to say that they have
the same speed or velocity, no matter in which direction they are
travelling. But science must create its own language, its own concepts,
for its own use. Scientific concepts often begin with those used in
ordinary language for the affairs, of everyday life, but they develop
quite differently. They are transformed and lose the ambiguity
associated with them in ordinary language, gaining in rigor-ousness so
that they may be applied to scientific thought.</p>
<p>From the physicist’s point of view it is advantageous to say that the
velocities of the two spheres moving in different directions are
different. Although purely a matter of convention, it is more convenient
to say that four cars travelling away from the same traffic roundabout
on different roads do not have the same velocity</p>
<p>even though the speeds, as registered on the speedometers, are all
forty miles per hour. This differentiation between speed and velocity
illustrates how physics, starting with a concept used in everyday life,
changes it in a way which proves fruitful in the further development of
science.</p>
<p>If a length is measured, the result is expressed as a number of
units. The length of a stick may be 3 ft. 7 in.; the weight of some
object 2 Ib. 3 oz.; a measured time interval so many minutes or seconds.
In each of these cases the result of the measurement is expressed by a
number. A number alone is, however, insufficient for describing some
physical concepts. The recognition of this fact marked a distinct
advance in scientific investigation. A direction as well as a number is
essential for the characterization of a velocity, for example. Such a
quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction, is called a vector. A
suitable symbol for</p>
<p>it is an arrow. Velocity may be represented by an arrow or, briefly
speaking, by a vector whose length in some chosen scale of units is a
measure of the speed, and whose direction is that of the motion.</p>
<p>If four cars diverge with equal speed from a traffic roundabout,
their velocities can be represented by four vectors of the same length,
as seen from our last drawing. In the scale used, one inch stands for 40
m.p.h. In this way any velocity may be denoted by a vector, and
conversely, if the scale is known, one may ascertain the velocity from
such a vector diagram.</p>
<p>If two cars pass each other on the highway and their speedometers
both show 40 m.p.h., we characterize their velocities by two different
vectors with arrows pointing in opposite directions. So also the arrows
indicating “uptown“ and “downtown“ subway trains in New</p>
<p>York must point in opposite directions. But all trains moving uptown
at different stations or on different avenues with the same speed have
the same velocity, which may be represented by a single vector. There is
nothing about a vector to indicate which stations the train passes or on
which of the many parallel tracks it is running. In other words,
according to the accepted convention, all such vectors, as drawn below,
may be regarded as equal; they lie along the same or parallel lines, are
of equal length, and finally, have arrows</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW</p>
<p>pointing in the same direction. The next figure shows vectors all
different, because they differ either in length</p>
<p>or direction, or both. The same four vectors may be drawn in another
way, in which they all diverge from</p>
<p>&lt;*</p>
<p>a common point. Since the starting-point does not matter, these
vectors can represent the velocities of four cars moving away from the
same traffic roundabout, or the velocities of four cars in different
parts of the country travelling with the indicated speeds in the
indicated directions.</p>
<p>This vector representation may now be used to describe the facts
previously discussed concerning rectilinear motion. We talked of a cart,
moving uniformly in a straight line and receiving a push in the
direction of its motion which increases its velocity. Graphically this
may be represented by two vectors, a shorter one denoting the velocity
before the push and a longer one in the same direction denoting the
velocity after the</p>
<p>push. The meaning of the dotted vector is clear; it represents the
change in velocity for which, as we know, the push is responsible. For
the case where the force is directed against the motion, where the
motion is slowed down, the diagram is somewhat different.</p>
<p>-X-</p>
<p>Again the dotted vector corresponds to a change in velocity, but in
this case its direction is different. It is clear that not only
velocities themselves but also their changes are vectors. But every
change in velocity is</p>
<p>due to the action of an external force; thus the force must also be
represented by a vector. In order to characterize a force it is not
sufficient to state how hard we push the cart; we must also say in which
direction we push. The force, like the velocity or its change, must be
represented by a vector and not by a number alone. Therefore: the
external force is also a vector, and must have the same direction as the
change in velocity. In the two drawings the dotted vectors show the
direction of the force as truly as they indicate the change in
velocity.</p>
<p>Here the sceptic may remark that he sees no advantage in the
introduction of vectors. All that has been accomplished is the
translation of previously recognized facts into an unfamiliar and
complicated language. At this stage it would indeed be difficult to
convince him that he is wrong. For the moment he is, in fact, right. But
we shall see that just this strange language leads to an important
generalization in which vectors appear to be essential.</p>
