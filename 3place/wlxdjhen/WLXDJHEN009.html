<h4 id="the-rate-of-exchange">THE RATE OF EXCHANGE</h4>
<p>Less than a hundred years ago the new clue which led to the concept
of heat as a form of energy was guessed by Mayer and confirmed
experimentally by Joule. It is a strange coincidence that nearly all the
fundamental work concerned with the nature of heat was done by
non-professional physicists who regarded physics merely as their great
hobby. There was the versatile Scotsman Black, the German physician
Mayer, and the great American adventurer Count Rumford, who afterwards
lived in Europe and, among other activities, became Minister of War for
Bavaria. There was also the English brewer Joule who, in his spare time,
performed some most important experiments concerning the conservation of
energy.</p>
<p>Joule verified by experiment the guess that heat is a form of energy,
and determined the rate of exchange. It is worth our while to see just
what his results were.</p>
<p>The kinetic and potential energy of a system together constitute its
mechanical energy. In the case of</p>
<p>the switchback we made a guess that some of the mechanical energy was
converted into heat. If this is right, there must be here and in all
other similar physical processes a definite rate of exchange between the
two. This is rigorously a quantitative question, but the fact that a
given quantity of mechanical energy can be changed into a definite
amount of heat is highly important. We should like to know what number
expresses the rate of exchange, i.e., how much heat we obtain from a
given amount of mechanical energy.</p>
<p>The determination of this number was the object of Joule’s
researches. The mechanism of one of his experiments is very much like
that of a weight clock. The winding of such a clock consists of
elevating two weights, thereby adding potential energy to the system. If
the clock is not further interfered with, it may be regarded as a closed
system. Gradually the weights fall and the clock runs down. At the end
of a certain time the weights will have reached their lowest position
and the clock will have stopped. What has happened to the energy? The
potential energy of the weights has changed into kinetic energy of the
mechanism, and has then gradually been dissipated as heat.</p>
<p>A clever alteration in this sort of mechanism enabled Joule to
measure the heat lost and thus the rate of exchange. In his apparatus
two weights caused a paddle wheel to turn while immersed in water. The
potential energy of the weights was changed into kinetic energy of the
movable parts, and thence into heat which</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>raised the temperature of the water. Joule measured this change of
temperature and, making use of the known specific heat of water,
calculated the amount of heat absorbed. He summarized the results of
many trials as follows:</p>
<p>i st. That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies,
whether solid or liquid, is always proportional to the quantity of force
[by force Joule means energy] expended. And</p>
<p>2nd. That the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature
of a pound of water (weighed in vacuo and taken at between 55° and 60°)
by i° Fahr. requires for its evolution the expenditure of a mechanical
force [energy] represented by the fall of 772 Ib. through the space of
one foot.</p>
<p>In other words, the potential energy of 772 pounds elevated one foot
above the ground is equivalent to the quantity of heat necessary to
raise the temperature of one pound of water from 55° F. to 56° F. Later
experimenters were capable of somewhat greater accuracy,</p>
<p>but the mechanical equivalent of heat is essentially what Joule found
in his pioneer work.</p>
<p>Once this important work was done, further progress was rapid. It was
soon recognized that these kinds of energy, mechanical and heat, are
only two of its many forms. Everything which can be converted into
either of them is also a form of energy. The radiation given off by the
sun is energy, for part of it is transformed into heat on the earth. An
electric current possesses energy, for it heats a wire or turns the
wheels of a motor. Coal represents chemical energy, liberated as heat
when the coal burns. In every event in nature one form of energy is
being converted into another, always at some well-defined rate of
exchange. In a closed system, one isolated from external influences, the
energy is conserved and thus behaves like a substance. The sum of all
possible forms of energy in such a system is constant, although the
amount of any one kind may be changing. If we regard the whole universe
as a closed system, we can proudly announce with the physicists of the
nineteenth century that the energy of the universe is invariant, that no
part of it can ever be created or destroyed.</p>
<p>Our two concepts of substance are, then, matter and energy. Both obey
conservation laws: An isolated system cannot change either in mass or in
total energy. Matter has weight but energy is weightless. We have
therefore two different concepts and two conservation laws. Are these
ideas still to be taken seriously? Or has this apparently well-founded
picture been changed in</p>
<p>the light of newer developments? It has! Further changes in the two
concepts are connected with the theory of relativity. We shall return to
this point later.</p>
