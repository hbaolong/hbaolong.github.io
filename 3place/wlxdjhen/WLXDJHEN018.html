<h4 id="the-wave-theory-of-light">THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT</h4>
<p>Let us recall why we broke off the description of optical phenomena.
Our aim was to introduce another theory of light, different from the
corpuscular one, but also attempting to explain the same domain of
facts. To do this we had to interrupt our story and introduce the
concept of waves. Now we can return to our subject.</p>
<p>It was Huygens, a contemporary of Newton, who put forward quite a new
theory. In his treatise on light he wrote:</p>
<p>If, in addition, light takes time for its passage—which we are now
going to examine—it will follow that this movement, impressed on the
intervening matter, is successive; and consequently it spreads, as sound
does, by spherical surfaces and waves, for I call them waves from their
resemblance to those which are seen to be formed in water when a stone
is thrown into it, and which present a successive</p>
<p>spreading as circles, though these arise from another cause, and are
only in a flat surface.</p>
<p>According to Huygens, light is a wave, a transference of energy and
not of substance. We have seen that the corpuscular theory explains many
of the observed facts. Is the wave theory also able to do this? We must
again ask the questions which have already been answered by the
corpuscular theory, to see whether the wave theory can do the answering
just as well. We shall do this here in the form of a dialogue between N
and //, where N is a believer in Newton’s corpuscular theory, and H in
Huygen’s theory. Neither is allowed to use arguments developed after the
work of the two great masters was finished.</p>
<p>JV. In the corpuscular theory the velocity of light has a very
definite meaning. It is the velocity at which the corpuscles travel
through empty space. What does it mean in the wave theory?</p>
<p>H. It means the velocity of the light wave, of course. Every known
wave spreads with some definite velocity, and so should a wave of
light.</p>
<p>N. That is not as simple as it seems. Sound waves spread in air,
ocean waves in water. Every wave must have a material medium in which it
travels. But light passes through a vacuum, whereas sound does not. To
assume a wave in empty space really means not to assume any wave at
all.</p>
<p>H. Yes, that is a difficulty, although not a new one to me. My master
thought about it very carefully, and decided that the only way out is to
assume the existence</p>
<p>of a hypothetical substance, the ether, a transparent medium
permeating the entire universe. The universe is, so to speak, immersed
in ether. Once we have the courage to introduce this concept, everything
else becomes clear and convincing.</p>
<p>JV. But I object to such an assumption. In the first place it
introduces a new hypothetical substance, and we already have too many
substances in physics. There is also another reason against it. You no
doubt believe that we must explain everything in terms of mechanics. But
what about the ether? Are you able to answer the simple question as to
how the ether is constructed from its elementary particles and how it
reveals itself in other phenomena?</p>
<p>//. Your first objection is certainly justified. But by introducing
the somewhat artificial weightless ether we at once get rid of the much
more artificial light corpuscles. We have only one “mysterious“
substance instead of an infinite number of them corresponding to the
great number of colours in the spectrum. Do you not think that this is
real progress? At least all the difficulties are concentrated on one
point. We no longer need the factitious assumption that particles
belonging to different colours travel with the same speed through empty
space. Your second argument is also true. We cannot give a mechanical
explanation of ether. But there is no doubt that the future study of
optical and perhaps other phenomena will reveal its structure. At
present we must wait for new experiments and conclusions, but finally, I
hope, we shall be</p>
<p>able to clear up the problem of the mechanical structure of the
ether.</p>
<p>JV. Let us leave the question for the moment, since it cannot be
settled now. I should like to see how your theory, even if we waive the
difficulties, explains those phenomena which are so clear and
understandable in the light of the corpuscular theory. Take, for
example, the fact that light rays travel in vacuo or in air along
straight lines. A piece of paper placed in front of a candle produces a
distinct and sharply outlined shadow on the wall. Sharp shadows would
not be possible if the wave theory of light were correct, for waves
would bend around the edges of the paper and thus blur the shadow. A
small ship is not an obstacle for waves on the sea, you know; they
simply bend around it without casting a shadow.</p>
<p>H. That is not a convincing argument. Take short waves on a river
impinging on the side of a large ship. Waves originating on one side of
the ship will not be seen on the other. If the waves are small enough
and the ship large enough, a very distinct shadow appears. It is very
probable that light seems to travel in straight lines only because its
wave-length is very small in comparison with the size of ordinary
obstacles and of apertures used in experiments. Possibly, if we could
create a sufficiently small obstruction, no shadow would occur. We might
meet with great experimental difficulties in constructing apparatus
which would show whether light is capable of bending. Nevertheless, if
such an experiment could be devised it would be crucial</p>
<p>in deciding between the wave theory and the corpuscular theory of
light.</p>
<p>JV“. The wave theory may lead to new facts in the future, but I do
not know of any experimental data confirming it convincingly. Until it
is definitely proved by experiment that light may be bent, I do not see
any reason for not believing in the corpuscular theory, which seems to
me to be simpler, and therefore better, than the wave theory.</p>
<p>At this point we may interrupt the dialogue, though the subject is by
no means exhausted.</p>
<p>It still remains to be shown how the wave theory explains the
refraction of light and the variety of colours. The corpuscular theory
is capable of this, as we know. We shall begin with refraction, but it
will be useful to consider first an example having nothing to do with
optics.</p>
<p>There is a large open space in which there are walking two men
holding between them a rigid pole. At the beginning they are walking
straight ahead, both with the same velocity. As long as their velocities
remain the same, whether great or small, the stick will be undergoing
parallel displacement; that is, it does not turn or change its
direction. All consecutive positions of the pole are parallel to each
other. But now imagine that for a time which may be as short as a
fraction of a second the motions of the two men are not the same. What
will happen? It is clear that during this moment the stick will turn, so
that it will no longer be displaced parallel to its original position.
When the equal velocities</p>
<p>are resumed, it is in a direction different from the previous one.
This is shown clearly in the drawing.</p>
<p>The change in direction took place during the time interval in which
the velocities of the two walkers were different.</p>
<p>This example will enable us to understand the refraction of a wave. A
plane wave travelling through the ether strikes a plate of glass. In the
next drawing we see a wave which presents a comparatively wide front as
it marches along. The wave front is a plane on which at any given moment
all parts of the ether behave in precisely the same way. Since the
velocity depends on the medium through which the light is passing, it
will be different in glass from the velocity in empty space. During the
very short time in which the wave front enters the glass, different
parts of the wave front will have different velocities. It is clear that
the part which has reached the glass will travel with the velocity of
light in glass, while the other still moves with the velocity of light
in ether. Because of this difference in velocity</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>along the wave front during the time of “immersion“ in the glass, the
direction of the wave itself will be changed.</p>
<p>Thus we see that not only the corpuscular theory, but also the wave
theory, leads to an explanation of refraction. Further consideration,
together with a little mathematics, shows that the wave theory
explanation is simpler and better, and that the consequences are in
perfect agreement with observation. Indeed, quantitative methods of
reasoning enable us to deduce the velocity of light in a refractive
medium if we know how the beam refracts when passing into it. Direct
measurements splendidly confirm these predictions, and thus also the
wave theory of light.</p>
<p>There still remains the question of colour.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that a wave is characterized by two numbers,
its velocity and its wave-length. The essential assumption of the wave
theory of light is that different wave-lengths correspond to different
colours. The</p>
<p>wave-length of homogeneous yellow light differs from that of red or
violet. Instead of the artificial segregation of corpuscles belonging to
various colours we have the natural difference in wave-length.</p>
<p>It follows that Newton’s experiments on the dispersion of light can
be described in two different languages, that of the corpuscular theory
and that of the wave theory. For example:</p>

<p>The corpuscles belonging The rays of different wave to different

<p>White light is a composi- White light is a composition of corpuscles

lengths, whereas in the spec-in the spectrum they are trum they are
separated, separated.</p>
<p>It would seem wise to avoid the ambiguity resulting from the
existence of two distinct theories of the same phenomena, by deciding in
favour of one of them after a careful consideration of the faults and
merits of each. The dialogue between JV and H shows that this is no easy
task. The decision at this point would be more a matter of taste than of
scientific conviction. In Newton’s time, and for more than a hundred
years after, most physicists favoured the corpuscular theory.</p>
<p>History brought in its verdict, in favour of the wave theory of light
and against the corpuscular theory, at</p>
<p>a much later date, the middle of the nineteenth century. In his
conversation with //, JV stated that a decision between the two theories
was, in principle, experimentally possible. The corpuscular theory does
not allow light to bend, and demands the existence of sharp shadows.
According to the wave theory, on the other hand, a sufficiently small
obstacle will cast no shadow. In the work of Young and Fresnel this
result was experimentally realized and theoretical conclusions were
drawn.</p>
<p>An extremely simple experiment has already been discussed, in which a
screen with a hole was placed in front of a point source of light and a
shadow appeared on the wall. We shall simplify the experiment further by
assuming that the source emits homogeneous light. For the best results
the source should be a strong one. Let us imagine that the hole in the
screen is made smaller and smaller. If we use a strong source and
succeed in making the hole small enough, a new and surprising phenomenon
appears, something quite incomprehensible from the point of view of the
corpuscular theory. There is no longer a sharp distinction between light
and dark. Light gradually fades into the dark background in a series of
light and dark rings. The appearance of rings is very characteristic of
a wave theory. The explanation for alternating light and dark areas will
be clear in the case of a somewhat different experimental arrangement.
Suppose we have a sheet of dark paper with two pinholes through which
light may pass. If the holes are close together and very</p>
<p>PLATE II</p>
<p>(Photographed by V. Arkadiev)</p>
<p>Above, we see a photograph of light spots after two beams have passed
through two pin holes, one after the other. (One pin hole was opened,
then covered and the other opened.) Below, we sec stripes when light is
allowed to pass through both pin holes simultaneously</p>
<p>(Photographed by I’. Arkadiev)</p>
<p>Diffraction of light bending around a small obstacle</p>
<p>Diffraction of light passing through a small hole</p>
<p>small, and if the source of homogeneous light is strong enough, many
light and dark bands will appear on the wall, gradually fading off at
the sides into the dark background. The explanation is simple. “A dark
band is where a trough of a wave from one pinhole meets the crest of a
wave from the other pinhole, so that the two cancel. A band of light is
where two troughs or two crests from waves of the different pinholes
meet and reinforce each other,/ The explanation is more complicated in
the case of the dark and light rings of our previous example in which we
used a screen with one hole, but the principle is the same. This
appearance of dark and light stripes in the case of two holes and of
light and dark rings in the case of one hole should be borne in mind,
for we shall later return to a discussion of the two different pictures.
The experiments described here show the diffraction of light, the
deviation from the rectilinear propagation when small holes or obstacles
are placed in the way of the light wave.</p>
<p>With the aid of a little mathematics we are able to go much further.
It is possible to find out how great or, rather, how small the
wave-length must be to produce a particular pattern. Thus the
experiments described enable us to measure the wave-length of the
homogeneous light used as a source. To give an idea of how small the
numbers are we shall cite two wavelengths, those representing the
extremes of the solar spectrum, that is, the red and the violet.</p>
<p>The wave-length of red light is 0-00008 cm. The wave-length of violet
light is 0-00004 cm.</p>
<p>We should not be astonished that the numbers are so small. The
phenomenon of distinct shadow, that is, the phenomenon of rectilinear
propagation of light, is observed in nature only because all apertures
and obstacles ordinarily met with are extremely large in comparison with
the wave-lengths of light. It is only when very small obstacles and
apertures are used that light reveals its wave-like nature.</p>
<p>But the story of the search for a theory of light is by no means
finished. The verdict of the nineteenth century was not final and
ultimate. For the modern physicist the entire problem of deciding
between corpuscles and waves again exists, this time in a much more
profound and intricate form. Let us accept the defeat of the corpuscular
theory of light until we recognize the problematic nature of the victory
of the wave theory.</p>
