<h4 id="longitudinal-or-transverse-light-waves">LONGITUDINAL OR
TRANSVERSE LIGHT WAVES?</h4>
<p>All the optical phenomena we have considered speak for the wave
theory. The bending of light around small obstacles and the explanation
of refraction are the strongest arguments in its favour. Guided by the
mechanical point of view we realize that there is still one question to
be answered: the determination of the mechanical properties of the
ether. It is essential for the solution of this problem to know whether
light waves in the ether are longitudinal or transverse. In other words:
is light propagated like sound? Is the wave due to changes in the
density of the medium, so that the oscillations of the particles are in
the direction of the</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 121</p>
<p>propagation? Or does the ether resemble an elastic jelly, a medium in
which only transverse waves can be set up and whose particles move in a
direction perpendicular to that in which the wave itself travels?</p>
<p>Before solving this problem, let us try to decide which answer should
be preferred. Obviously, we should be fortunate if light waves were
longitudinal. The difficulties in designing a mechanical ether would be
much simpler in this case. Our picture of ether might very probably be
something like the mechanical picture of a gas that explains the
propagation of sound waves. It would be much more difficult to form a
picture of ether carrying transverse waves. To imagine a jelly as a
medium made up of particles in such a way that transverse waves are
propagated by means of it is no easy task. Huygens believed that the
ether would turn out to be “air-like“ rather than “jelly-like“. But
nature cares very little for our limitations. Was nature, in this case,
merciful to the physicists attempting to understand all events from a
mechanical point of view? In order to answer this question we must
discuss some new experiments.</p>
<p>We shall consider in detail only one of many experiments which are
able to supply us with an answer. Suppose we have a very thin plate of
tourmaline crystal, cut in a particular way which we need not describe
here. The crystal plate must be thin so that we are able to see a source
of light through it. But now let us take two such plates and place both
of them between our eyes and the light. What do we expect to</p>
<p>see? Again a point of light, if the plates are sufficiently thin. The
chances are very good that the experiment will confirm our expectation.
Without worrying about the statement that it may be chance, let us
assume we do see the light point through the two crystals. Now let us
gradually change the position of one of the crystals by rotating it.
This statement makes sense only if the position of the axis about which
the rotation takes place is fixed. We shall take as an axis the line
determined by the incoming ray. This means that we displace all the
points of the one crystal except those</p>
<p>on the axis. A strange thing happens! The light gets weaker and
weaker until it vanishes completely. It reappears as the rotation
continues and we regain the initial view when the initial position is
reached.</p>
<p>Without going into the details of this and similar</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 123</p>
<p>experiments we can ask the following question: can these phenomena be
explained if the light waves are longitudinal? In the case of
longitudinal waves the particles of the ether would move along the axis,
as the beam does. If the crystal rotates, nothing along the axis
changes. The points on the axis do not move, and only a very small
displacement takes place nearby. No such distinct change as the
vanishing and appearance of a new picture could possibly occur for a
longitudinal wave. This and many other similar phenomena can be
explained only by the assumption that light waves are transverse and not
longitudinal! Or, in other words, the “jelly-like“ character of the
ether must be assumed. This is very sad! We must be prepared to face
tremendous difficulties in the attempt to describe the ether
mechanically.</p>
<p>ETHER AND THE MECHANICAL VIEW The discussion of all the various
attempts to understand the mechanical nature of the ether as a medium
for transmitting light would make a long story. A mechanical
construction means, as we know, that the substance is built up of
particles with forces acting along lines connecting them and depending
only on the distance. In order to construct the ether as a jelly-like
mechanical substance physicists had to make some highly artificial and
unnatural assumptions. We shall not quote them here; they belong to the
almost forgotten past. But the result was significant and important. The
artificial character of all these assumptions,</p>
<p>the necessity for introducing so many of them all quite independent
of each other, was enough to shatter the belief in the mechanical point
of view.</p>
<p>But there are other and simpler objections to ether than the
difficulty of constructing it. Ether must be assumed to exist
everywhere, if we wish to explain optical phenomena mechanically. There
can be no empty space if light travels only in a medium.</p>
<p>Yet we know from mechanics that interstellar space does not resist
the motion of material bodies. The planets, for example, travel through
the ether-jelly without encountering any resistance such as a material
medium would offer to their motion. If ether does not disturb matter in
its motion, there can be no interaction between particles of ether and
particles of matter. Light passes through ether and also through glass
and water, but its velocity is changed in the latter substances. How can
this fact be explained mechanically? Apparently only by assuming some
interaction between ether particles and matter particles. We have just
seen that in the case of freely moving bodies such interactions must be
assumed not to exist. In other words, there is interaction between ether
and matter in optical phenomena, but none in mechanical phenomena! This
is certainly a very paradoxical conclusion !</p>
<p>There seems to be only one way out of all these difficulties. In the
attempt to understand the phenomena of nature from the mechanical point
of view, throughout the whole development of science up to the twentieth
century, it was necessary to introduce</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 125</p>
<p>artificial substances like electric and magnetic fluids, light
corpuscles, or ether. The result was merely the concentration of all the
difficulties in a few essential points, such as ether in the case of
optical phenomena. Here all the fruitless attempts to construct an ether
in some simple way, as well as the other objections, seem to indicate
that the fault lies in the fundamental assumption that it is possible to
explain all events in nature from a mechanical point of view. Science
did not succeed in carrying out the mechanical programme convincingly,
and today no physicist believes in the possibility of its
fulfilment.</p>
<p>In our short review of the principal physical ideas we have met some
unsolved problems, have come upon difficulties and obstacles which
discouraged the attempts to formulate a uniform and consistent view of
all the phenomena of the external world. There was the unnoticed clue in
classical mechanics of the equality of gravitational and inertial mass.
There was the artificial character of the electric and magnetic fluids.
There was, in the interaction between electric current and magnetic
needle, an unsolved difficulty. It will be remembered that this force
did not act in the line connecting the wire and the magnetic pole, and
depended on the velocity of the moving charge. The law expressing its
direction and magnitude was extremely complicated. And finally, there
was the great difficulty with the ether.</p>
<p>Modern physics has attacked all these problems and solved them. But
in the struggle for these solutions</p>
<p>new and deeper problems have been created. Our knowledge is now wider
and more profound than that of the physicist of the nineteenth century,
but so are our doubts and difficulties.</p>
<p>WE SUMMARIZE:</p>
<p>In the old theories of electric fluids, in the corpuscular and wave
theories of light, we witness the further attempts to apply the
mechanical view. But in the realm of electric and optical phenomena we
meet grave difficulties in this application.</p>
<p>A moving charge acts upon a magnetic needle. But the force, instead
of depending only upon distance, depends also upon the velocity of the
charge. The force neither repels not attracts but acts perpendicular to
the line connecting the needle and the charge.</p>
<p>In optics we have to decide in favour of the wave theory against the
corpuscular theory of light. Waves spreading in a medium consisting of
particles, with mechanical forces acting between them, are certainly a
mechanical concept. But what is the medium through which light spreads
and what are its mechanical properties? There is no hope of reducing the
optical phenomena to the mechanical ones before this question is
answered. But the difficulties in solving this problem are so great that
we have to give it up and thus give up the mechanical views as well.</p>

<p>THE FIELD AS REPRESENTATION DURING the second half of the nineteenth
century new and revolutionary ideas were introduced into physics; they
opened the way to a new philosophical view, differing from the
mechanical one. The results of the work of Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz
led to the development of modern physics, to the creation of new
concepts, forming a new picture of reality.</p>
<p>Our task now is to describe the break brought about in science by
these new concepts and to show how they gradually gained clarity and
strength. We shall try to reconstruct the line of progress logically,
without bothering too much about chronological order.</p>
<p>The new concepts originated in connection with the phenomena of
electricity, but it is simpler to introduce them, for the first time,
through mechanics. We know that two particles attract each other and
that this force of attraction decreases with the square of the distance.
EE 129 5</p>
<p>We can represent this fact in a new way, and shall do so even though
it is difficult to understand the advantage of this. The small circle in
our drawing represents</p>
<p>an attracting body, say, the sun. Actually, our diagram should be
imagined as a model in space and not as a drawing on a plane. Our small
circle, then, stands for a sphere in space, say, the sun. A body, the
so-called test body, brought somewhere within the vicinity of the sun
will be attracted along the line connecting the centres of the two
bodies. Thus the lines in our drawing indicate the direction of the
attracting force of the sun for different positions of the test body.
The arrow on each line shows that the force is directed toward the sun;
this means the force is an attraction. These are the lines of force of
the gravitational field. For the moment, this is merely a name and there
is no reason for stressing it further. There is one characteristic
feature of our drawing which will be emphasized later. The lines</p>
<p>of force are constructed in space, where no matter is present. For
the moment, all the lines of force, or briefly speaking, the field,
indicate only how a test body would behave if brought into the vicinity
of the sphere for which the field is constructed.</p>
<p>The lines in our space model are always perpendicular to the surface
of the sphere. Since they diverge from one point, they are dense near
the sphere and become less and less so farther away. If we increase the
distance from the sphere twice or three times, then the density of the
lines, in our space model, though not in the drawing, will be four or
nine times less. Thus the lines serve a double purpose. On the one hand,
they show the direction of the force acting on a body brought into the
neighbourhood of the sphere-sun. On the other hand, the density of the
lines of force in space shows how the force varies with the distance.
The drawing of the field, correctly interpreted, represents the
direction of the gravitational force and its dependence on distance. One
can read the law of gravitation from such a drawing just as well as from
a description of the action in words, or in the precise and economical
language of mathematics. This field representation, as we shall call it,
may appear clear and interesting, but there is no reason to believe that
it marks any real advance. It would be quite difficult to prove its
usefulness in the case of gravitation. Some may, perhaps, find it
helpful to regard these lines as something more than drawings, and to
imagine the real actions of force passing through them. This may be
done, but then the</p>
<p>5-2</p>
<p>speed of the actions along the lines of force must be assumed as
infinitely great! The force between two bodies, according to Newton’s
law, depends only on distance; time does not enter the picture. The
force has to pass from one body to another in no time! But, as motion
with infinite speed cannot mean much to any reasonable person, an
attempt to make our drawing something more than a model leads
nowhere.</p>
<p>We do not intend, however, to discuss the gravitational problem just
now It served only as an introduction, simplifying the explanation of
similar methods of reasoning in the theory of electricity.</p>
<p>We shall begin with a discussion of the experiment which created
serious difficulties in our mechanical interpretation. We had a current
flowing through a wire circuit in the form of a circle. In the middle of
the circuit was a magnetic needle. The moment the current began to flow
a new force appeared, acting on the magnetic pole, and perpendicular to
any line connecting the wire and the pole. This force, if caused by a
circulating charge, depended, as shown by Rowland’s experiment, on the
velocity of the charge. These experimental facts contradicted the
philosophical view that all forces must act on the line connecting the
particles and can depend only upon distance.</p>
<p>The exact expression for the force of a current acting on a magnetic
pole is quite complicated, much more so, indeed, than the expression for
gravitational forces. We can, however, attempt to visualize the actions
just as we did in the case of a gravitational force.</p>
<p>Our question is: with what force does the current act upon a magnetic
pole placed somewhere in its vicinity? It would be rather difficult to
describe this force in words. Even a mathematical formula would be
complicated and awkward. It is best to represent all we know about the
acting forces by a drawing, or rather by a spatial model, with lines of
force. Some difficulty is caused by the fact that a magnetic pole exists
only in connection with another magnetic pole, forming a dipole. We can,
however, always imagine the magnetic needle of such length that only the
force acting upon the pole nearer the current has to be taken into
account. The other pole is far enough away for the force acting upon it
to be negligible. To avoid ambiguity we shall say that the magnetic pole
brought nearer to the wire is the positive one.</p>
<p>The character of the force acting upon the positive magnetic pole can
be read from our drawing.</p>
<p>First we notice an arrow near the wire indicating the direction of
the current, from higher to lower</p>
<p>potential. All other lines are just lines offeree belonging to this
current and lying on a certain plane. If drawn properly, they tell us
the direction of the force vector representing the action of the current
on a given positive magnetic pole as well as something about the length
of this vector. Force, as we know, is a vector, and to determine it we
must know its direction as well as its length. We are chiefly concerned
with the problem of the direction of the force acting upon a pole. Our
question is: how can we find, from the drawing, the direction of the
force, at any point in space?</p>
<p>The rule for reading the direction of a force from such a model is
not as simple as in our previous example, where the lines of force were
straight. In our next diagram only one line of force is drawn in
order</p>
<p>to clarify the procedure. The force vector lies on the tangent to the
line of force, as indicated. The arrow of the force vector and the
arrows on the line of force point in the same direction. Thus this is
the direction in which the force acts on a magnetic pole at this</p>
<p>point. A good drawing, or rather a good model, also tells us
something about the length of the force vector at any point. This vector
has to be longer where the lines are denser, i.e., near the wire,
shorter where the lines are less dense, i.e., far from the wire.</p>
<p>In this way, the lines of force, or in other words, the field, enable
us to determine the forces acting on a magnetic pole at any point in
space. This, for the time being, is the only justification for our
elaborate construction of the field. Knowing what the field expresses,
we shall examine with a far deeper interest the lines of force
corresponding to the current. These lines are circles surrounding the
wire and lying on the plane perpendicular to that in which the wire is
situated. Reading the character of the force from the drawing, we come
once more to the conclusion that the force acts in a direction
perpendicular to any line connecting the wire and the pole, for the
tangent to a circle is always perpendicular to its radius. Our entire
knowledge of the acting forces can be summarized in the construction of
the field. We sandwich the concept of the field between that of the
current and that of the magnetic pole in order to represent the acting
forces in a simple way.</p>
<p>Every current is associated with a magnetic field, i.e., a force
always acts on a magnetic pole brought near the wire through which a
current flows. We may remark in passing that this property enables us to
construct sensitive apparatus for detecting the existence of a current.
Once having learned how to read the charac-</p>
<p>ter of the magnetic forces from the field model of a current, we
shall always draw the field surrounding the wire through which the
current flows, in order to represent the action of the magnetic forces
at any point in space. Our first example is the so-called solenoid. This
is, in fact, a coil of wire as shown in the drawing. Our aim is to
learn, by experiment, all we can about the magnetic field associated
with the current flowing through a solenoid and to incorporate this
knowledge in the construction of a field. A drawing</p>
<p>represents our result. The curved lines of force are closed, and
surround the solenoid in a way characteristic of the magnetic field of a
current.</p>
<p>The field of a bar magnet can be represented in the same way as that
of a current. Another drawing shows this. The lines of force are
directed from the positive to the negative pole. The force vector always
lies on^ the tangent to the line of force and is longest near the poles
because the density of the lines is greatest at these points. The force
vector represents the action of the</p>
<p>magnet on a positive magnetic pole. In this case the magnet and not
the current is the “ source“ of the field.</p>
<p>Our last two drawings should be carefully compared. In the first, we
have the magnetic field of a current flowing through a solenoid; in the
second, the field of a bar magnet. Let us ignore both the solenoid and
the bar and observe only the two outside fields. We immediately notice
that they are of exactly the same character; in each case the lines
offeree lead from one end of the solenoid or bar to the other.</p>
<p>The field representation yields its first fruit! It would be rather
difficult to see any strong similarity between the current flowing
through a solenoid and a bar magnet if this were not revealed by our
construction of the field.</p>
<p>The concept of field can now be put to a much more severe test. We
shall soon see whether it is anything more than a new representation of
the acting forces. We could reason: assume, for a moment, that the field
characterizes all actions determined by its sources in a unique way.
This is only a guess. It would mean that if a solenoid and a bar magnet
have the same</p>
<p>field, then all their influences must also be the same. It would mean
that two solenoids, carrying electric currents, behave like two bar
magnets, that they attract or repel each other, depending exactly as in
the case of bars, on their relative positions. It would also mean that a
solenoid and a bar attract or repel each other in the same way as two
bars. Briefly speaking, it would mean that all actions of a solenoid
through which a current flows and of a corresponding bar magnet are the
same, since the field alone is responsible for them, and the field in
both cases is of the same character. Experiment fully confirms our
guess!</p>
<p>How difficult it would be to find those facts without the concept of
field! The expression for a force acting between a wire through which a
current flows and a magnetic pole is very complicated. In the case of
two solenoids, we should have to investigate the forces with which two
currents act upon each other. But if we do this, with the help of the
field, we immediately notice the character of all those actions at the
moment when the similarity between the field of a solenoid and that of a
bar magnet is seen.</p>
<p>We have the right to regard the field as something much more than we
did at first. The properties of the field alone appear to be essential
for the description of phenomena; the differences in source do not
matter. The concept of field reveals its importance by leading to new
experimental facts.</p>
<p>The field proved a very helpful concept. It began as something placed
between the source and the magnetic</p>
<p>needle in order to describe the acting force. It was thought of as an
“agent“ of the current, through which all action of the current was
performed. But now the agent also acts as an interpreter, one who
translates the laws into a simple, clear language, easily
understood.</p>
<p>The first success of the field description suggests that it may be
convenient to consider all actions of currents, magnets and charges
indirectly, i.e., with the help of the field as an interpreter. A field
may be regarded as something always associated with a current. It is
there even in the absence of a magnetic pole to test its existence. Let
us try to follow this new clue consistently.</p>
<p>The field of a charged conductor can be introduced in much the same
way as the gravitational field, or the field of a current or magnet.
Again only the simplest example! To design the field of a positively
charged sphere, we must ask what kind of forces are acting on</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>a small positively charged test body brought near the source of the
field, the charged sphere. The fact that we use a positively and not a
negatively charged test body is merely a convention, indicating in which
direction the arrows on the line of force should be drawn. The model is
analogous to that of a gravitational field (p. 130) because of the
similarity between Coulomb’s law and Newton’s. The only difference
between the two models is that the arrows point in opposite directions.
Indeed, we have repulsion of two positive charges and attraction of two
masses. However, the field of a sphere with a negative charge will be
identical with a gravitational field since the small positive testing
charge will be attracted by the source of the field.</p>
<p>If both electric and magnetic poles are at rest, there is no action
between them, neither attraction nor repulsion. Expressing the same fact
in the field language,</p>
<p>we can say: an electrostatic field does not influence a magnetostatic
one and vice versa. The words “static field“ mean a field that does not
change with time. The magnets and charges would rest near one another
for an eternity if no external forces disturbed them. Electrostatic,
magnetostatic and gravitational fields are all of different character.
They do not mix; each preserves its individuality regardless of the
others.</p>
<p>Let us return to the electric sphere which was, until now, at rest,
and assume that it begins to move owing to the action of some external
force. The charged sphere moves. In the field language this sentence
reads: the field of the electric charge changes with time. But the
motion of this charged sphere is, as we already know from Rowland’s
experiment, equivalent to a current. Further, every current is
accompanied by a magnetic field. Thus the chain of our argument is:</p>
<p>motion of charge -&gt; change of an electric field</p>
<p>I current -&gt; associated magnetic field.</p>
<p>We, therefore, conclude: The change of an electric field produced by
the motion of a charge is always accompanied by a magnetic fold.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is based on Oersted’s experiment, but it covers much
more. It contains the recognition that the association of an electric
field, changing in time, with a magnetic field is essential for our
further argument.</p>
<p>As long as a charge is at rest there is only an electro-</p>
<p>static field. But a magnetic field appears as soon as the charge
begins to move. We can say more. The magnetic field created by the
motion of the charge will be stronger if the charge is greater and if it
moves faster. This also is a consequence of Rowland’s experiment. Once
again using the field language, we can say: the faster the electric
field changes, the stronger the accompanying magnetic field.</p>
<p>We have tried here to translate familiar facts from the language of
fluids, constructed according to the old mechanical view, into the new
language of fields. We shall see later how clear, instructive, and
far-reaching our new language is.</p>
<p>THE TWO PILLARS OF THE FIELD THEORY</p>
<p>“The change of an electric field is accompanied by a magnetic field.“
If we interchange the words “magnetic“ and “electric“, our sentence
reads: “The change of a magnetic field is accompanied by an electric
field.“ Only an experiment can decide whether or not this statement is
true. But the idea of formulating this problem is suggested by the use
of the field language.</p>
<p>Just over a hundred years ago, Faraday performed an experiment which
led to the great discovery of induced currents.</p>
<p>The demonstration is very simple. We need only a solenoid or some
other circuit, a bar magnet, and one of the many types of apparatus for
detecting the existence of an electric current. To begin with, a bar
magnet is kept at rest near a solenoid which forms a closed</p>
<p>circuit. No current flows through the wire, for no source is present.
There is only the magnetostatic field of the bar magnet which does not
change with time. Now, we quickly change the position of the magnet
either by removing it or by bringing it nearer the solenoid, whichever
we prefer. At this moment, a current will appear for a very short time
and then vanish.</p>
<p>Whenever the position of the magnet is changed, the current
reappears, and can be detected by a sufficiently sensitive apparatus.
But a current—from the point of view of the field theory—means the
existence of an electric field forcing the flow of the electric fluids
through the wire. The current, and therefore the electric field, too,
vanishes when the magnet is again at rest.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that the field language is unknown and the
results of this experiment have to be described, qualitatively and
quantitatively, in the language of old mechanical concepts. Our
experiment then shows: by the motion of a magnetic dipole a new force
was created, moving the electric fluid in the wire. The next question
would be: upon what does this force depend? This would be very difficult
to answer.</p>
<p>We should have to investigate the dependence of the force upon the
velocity of the magnet, upon its shape, and upon the shape of the
circuit. Furthermore, this experiment, if interpreted in the old
language, gives us no hint at all as to whether an induced current can
be excited by the motion of another circuit carrying a current, instead
of by motion of a bar magnet.</p>
<p>It is quite a different matter if we use the field language and again
trust our principle that the action is determined by the field. We see
at once that a solenoid through which a current flows would serve as
well as a bar magnet. The drawing shows two solenoids: one, small,
through which a current flows, and the other, in which the induced
current is detected, larger. We</p>
<p>could move the small solenoid, as we previously moved the bar magnet,
creating an induced current in the larger solenoid. Furthermore, instead
of moving the small solenoid, we could create and destroy a magnetic
field by creating and destroying the current, that is, by opening and
closing the circuit. Once again, new facts suggested by the field theory
are confirmed by experiment!</p>
<p>Let us take a simpler example. We have a closed wire</p>
<p>without any source of current. Somewhere in the vicinity is a
magnetic field. It means nothing to us whether the source of this
magnetic field is another circuit through which an electric current
flows, or a</p>
<p>bar magnet. Our drawing shows the closed circuit and the magnetic
lines of force. The qualitative and quantitative description of the
induction phenomena is very simple in terms of the field language. As
marked on the drawing, some lines of force go through the surface
bounded by the wire. We have to consider the lines of force cutting that
part of the plane which has the wire for a rim. No electric current is
present so long as the field does not change, no matter how great its
strength. But a current begins to flow through the rim-wire as soon as
the number of lines passing through the surface surrounded by wire
changes. The current is determined by the change, however it may be
caused, of the number of lines passing the surface. This change in the
number of lines of force is the only essential concept</p>
<p>for both the qualitative and the quantitative descriptions of the
induced current. “The number of lines changes’ 5 means that the density
of the lines changes and this, we remember, means that the field
strength changes.</p>
<p>These then are the essential points in our chain of reasoning: change
of magnetic field-&gt; induced current-emotion of charge -&gt; existence
of an electric field.</p>
<p>Therefore: a changing magnetic field is accompanied by an electric
field.</p>
<p>Thus we have found the two most important pillars of support for the
theory of the electric and magnetic field. The first is the connection
between the changing electric field and the magnetic field. It arose
from Oersted’s experiment on the deflection of a magnetic needle and led
to the conclusion: a changing electric field is accompanied by a
magnetic field.</p>
<p>The second connects the changing magnetic field with the induced
current and arose from Faraday’s experiment. Both formed a basis for
quantitative description.</p>
<p>Again the electric field accompanying the changing magnetic field
appears as something real. We had to imagine, previously, the magnetic
field of a current existing without the testing pole. Similarly, we must
claim here that the electric field exists without the wire testing the
presence of an induced current.</p>
<p>In fact, our two-pillar structure could be reduced to only one,
namely, to that based on Oersted’s experi-</p>
<p>ment. The result of Faraday’s experiment could be deduced from this
with the law of conservation of energy. We used the two-pillared
structure only for the sake of clearness and economy.</p>
<p>One more consequence of the field description should be mentioned.
There is a circuit through which a current flows, with, for instance, a
voltaic battery as the source of the current. The connection between the
wire and the source of the current is suddenly broken. There is, of
course, no current now! But during this short interruption an intricate
process takes place, a process which could again have been foreseen by
the field theory. Before the interruption of the current, there was a
magnetic field surrounding the wire. This ceased to exist the moment the
current was interrupted. Therefore, through the interruption of a
current, a magnetic field disappeared. The number of lines offeree
passing through the surface surrounded by the wire changed very rapidly.
But such a rapid change, however it is produced, must create an induced
current. What really matters is the change of the magnetic field making
the induced current stronger if the change is greater. This consequence
is another test for the theory. The disconnection of a current must be
accompanied by the appearance of a strong, momentary induced current.
Experiment again confirms the prediction. Anyone who has ever
disconnected a current must have noticed that a spark appears. This
spark reveals the strong potential differences caused by the rapid
change of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>The same process can be looked at from a different point of view,
that of energy. A magnetic field disappeared and a spark was created. A
spark represents energy, therefore so also must the magnetic field. To
use the field concept and its language consistently, we must regard the
magnetic field as a store of energy. Only in this way shall we be able
to describe the electric and magnetic phenomena in accordance with the
law of conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Starting as a helpful model, the field became more and more real. It
helped us to understand old facts and led us to new ones. The
attribution of energy to the field is one step farther in the
development in which the field concept was stressed more and more, and
the concepts of substances, so essential to the mechanical point of
view, were more and more suppressed.</p>
<p>THE REALITY OF THE FIELD</p>
<p>The quantitative, mathematical description of the laws of the field
is summed up in what are called Maxwell’s equations. The facts mentioned
so far led to the formulation of these equations, but their content is
much richer than we have been able to indicate. Their simple form
conceals a depth revealed only by careful study.</p>
<p>The formulation of these equations is the most important event in
physics since Newton’s time, not only because of their wealth of
content, but also because they form a pattern for a new type of law.</p>
<p>The characteristic features of Maxwell’s equations, appearing in all
other equations of modern physics, are</p>
<p>summarized in one sentence. Maxwell’s equations are laws representing
the structure of the field.</p>
<p>Why do Maxwell’s equations differ in form and character from the
equations of classical mechanics? What does it mean that these equations
describe the structure of the field? How is it possible that, from the
results of Oersted’s and Faraday’s experiments, we can form a new type
of law, which proves so important for the further development of
physics?</p>
<p>We have already seen, from Oersted’s experiment, how a magnetic field
coils itself around a changing electric field. We have seen, from
Faraday’s experiment, how an electric field coils itself around a
changing magnetic field. To outline some of the characteristic features
of Maxwell’s theory, let us, for the moment, focus all our attention on
one of these experiments, say, on that of Faraday. We repeat the drawing
in</p>
<p>which an electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field. We
already know that an induced current</p>
<p>appears if the number of lines of force, passing the surface bounded
by the wire, changes. Then the current will appear if the magnetic field
changes or the circuit is deformed or moved: if the number of magnetic
lines passing through the surface is changed, no matter how this change
is caused. To take into account all these various possibilities, to
discuss their particular influences, would necessarily lead to a very
complicated theory. But can we not simplify our problem? Let us try to
eliminate from our considerations everything which refers to the shape
of the circuit, to its length, to the surface enclosed by the wire. Let
us imagine that the circuit in our last drawing becomes smaller and
smaller, shrinking gradually to a very small circuit enclosing a certain
point in space. Then everything concerning shape and size is quite
irrelevant. In this limiting process where the closed curve shrinks to a
point, size and shape automatically vanish from our considerations and
we obtain laws connecting changes of magnetic and electric field at an
arbitrary point in space at an arbitrary instant.</p>
<p>Thus, this is one of the principal steps leading to Maxwell’s
equations. It is again an idealized experiment performed in imagination
by repeating Faraday’s experiment with a circuit shrinking to a
point.</p>
<p>We should really call it half a step rather than a whole one. So far
our attention has been focused on Faraday’s experiment. But the other
pillar of the field theory, based on Oersted’s experiment, must be
considered just as carefully and in a similar manner. In this</p>
<p>FIELD, RELATIVITY</p>
<p>experiment the magnetic lines of force coil themselves around the
current. By shrinking the circular magnetic lines of force to a point,
the second half-step is performed and the whole step yields a connection
between the changes of the magnetic and electric fields at an arbitrary
point in spacfc and at an arbitrary instant.</p>
<p>But still another essential step is necessary. According to Faraday’s
experiment, there must be a wire testing the existence of the electric
field, just as there must be a magnetic pole, or needle, testing the
existence of a magnetic field in Oersted’s experiment. But Maxwell’s new
theoretical idea goes beyond these experimental facts. The electric and
magnetic field or, in short, the electromagnetic field is, in Maxwell’s
theory, something real. The electric field is produced by a changing
magnetic field, quite independently, whether or not there is a wire to
test its existence; a magnetic field is produced by a changing electric
field, whether or not there is a magnetic pole to test its
existence.</p>
<p>Thus two essential steps led to Maxwell’s equations. The first: in
considering Oersted’s and Rowland’s experiments, the circular line of
the magnetic field coiling itself around the current and the changing
electric field had to be shrunk to a point; in considering Faraday’s
experiment, the circular line of the electric field coiling itself
around the changing magnetic field had to be shrunk to a point. The
second step consists of the realization of the field as something real;
the electromagnetic field once created exists, acts, and changes
according to Maxwell’s laws.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s equations describe the structure of the electromagnetic
field. All space is the scene of these laws and not, as for mechanical
laws, only points in which matter or charges are present.</p>
<p>We remember how it was in mechanics. By knowing the position and
velocity of a particle at one single instant, by knowing the acting
forces, the whole future path of the particle could be foreseen. In
Maxwell’s theory, if we know the field at one instant only, we can
deduce from the equations of the theory how the whole field will change
in space and time. Maxwell’s equations enable us to follow the history
of the field, just as the mechanical equations enabled us to follow the
history of material particles.</p>
<p>But there is still one essential difference between mechanical laws
and Maxwell’s laws. A comparison of Newton’s gravitational laws and
Maxwell’s field laws will emphasize some of the characteristic features
expressed by these equations.</p>
<p>With the help of Newton’s laws we can deduce the motion of the earth
from the force acting between the sun and the earth. The laws connect
the motion of the earth with the action of the far-off sun. The earth
and the sun, though so far apart, are both actors in the play of
forces.</p>
<p>In Maxwell’s theory there are no material actors. The mathematical
equations of this theory express the laws governing the electromagnetic
field. They do not, as in Newton’s laws, connect two widely separated
events; they do not connect the happenings here with</p>
<p>the conditions there. The field here and now depends on the field in
the immediate neighbourhood at a time just past. The equations allow us
to predict what will happen a little farther in space and a little later
in time, if we know what happens here and now. They allow us to increase
our knowledge of the field by small steps. We can deduce what happens
here from that which happened far away by the summation of these very
small steps. In Newton’s theory, on the contrary, only big steps
connecting distant events are permissible. The experiments of Oersted
and Faraday can be regained from Maxwell’s theory, but only by the
summation of small steps each of which is governed by Maxwell’s
equations.</p>
<p>A more thorough mathematical study of Maxwell’s equations shows that
new and really unexpected conclusions can be drawn and the whole theory
submitted to a test on a much higher level, because the theoretical
consequences are now of a quantitative character and are revealed by a
whole chain of logical arguments.</p>
<p>Let us again imagine an idealized experiment. A small sphere with an
electric charge is forced, by some external influence, to oscillate
rapidly and in a rhythmical way, like a pendulum. With the knowledge we
already have of the changes of the field, how shall we describe
everything that is going on here, in the field language?</p>
<p>The oscillation of the charge produces a changing electric field.
This is always accompanied by a changing magnetic field. If a wire
forming a closed circuit is placed in the vicinity, then again the
changing</p>
<p>magnetic field will be accompanied by an electric current in the
circuit. All this is merely a repetition of known facts, but the study
of Maxwell’s equations gives a much deeper insight into the problem of
the oscillating electric charge. By mathematical deduction from
Maxwell’s equations we can detect the character of the field surrounding
an oscillating charge, its structure near and far from the source and
its change with time. The outcome of such deduction is the
electromagnetic wave. Energy radiates from the oscillating charge
travelling with a definite speed through space; but a transference of
energy, the motion of a state, is characteristic of all wave
phenomena.</p>
<p>Different types of waves have already been considered. There was the
longitudinal wave caused by the pulsating sphere, where the changes of
density were propagated through the medium. There was the jelly-like
medium in which the transverse wave spread. A deformation of the jelly,
caused by the rotation of the sphere, moved through the medium. What
kind of changes are now spreading in the case of an electromagnetic
wave? Just the changes of an electromagnetic field! Every change of an
electric field produces a magnetic field; every change of this magnetic
field produces an electric field; every change of…, and so on. As field
represents energy, all these changes spreading out in space, with a
definite velocity, produce a wave. The electric and magnetic lines of
force always lie, as deduced from the theory, on planes perpendicular to
the direction of propagation. The wave</p>
<p>produced is, therefore, transverse. The original features of the
picture of the field we formed from Oersted’s and Faraday’s experiments
are still preserved, but we now recognize that it has a deeper
meaning.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic wave spreads in empty space. This, again, is a
consequence of the theory. If the oscillating charge suddenly ceases to
move, then its field becomes electrostatic. But the series of waves
created by the oscillation continues to spread. The waves lead an
independent existence and the history of their changes can be followed
just as that of any other material object.</p>
<p>We understand that our picture of an electromagnetic wave, spreading
with a certain velocity in space and changing in time, follows from
Maxwell’s equations only because they describe the structure of the
electromagnetic field at any point in space and for any instant.</p>
<p>There is another very important question. With what speed does the
electromagnetic wave spread in empty space? The theory, with the support
of some data from simple experiments having nothing to do with the
actual propagation of waves, gives a clear answer: the^ velocity of an
electromagnetic wave is equal to the velocity qf</p>
<p>lijjrz ~</p>
<p>Oersted’s and Faraday’s experiments formed the basis on which
Maxwell’s laws were built. All our results so far have come from a
careful study of these laws, expressed in the field language. The
theoretical discovery of an electromagnetic wave spreading with</p>
<p>the speed of light is one of the greatest achievements in the history
of science.</p>
<p>Experiment has confirmed the prediction of theory. Fifty years ago,
Hertz proved, for the first time, the existence of electromagnetic waves
and confirmed experimentally that their velocity is equal to that of
light. Nowadays, millions of people demonstrate that electromagnetic
waves are sent and received. Their apparatus is far more complicated
than that used by Hertz and detects the presence of waves thousands of
miles from their sources instead of only a few yards.</p>
<p>FIELD AND ETHER</p>
<p>The electromagnetic wave is a transverse one and is propagated with
the velocity of light in empty space. The fact that their velocities are
the same suggests a close relationship between optical and
electromagnetic phenomena.</p>
<p>When we had to choose between the corpuscular and the wave theory, we
decided in favour of the wave theory. The diffraction of light was the
strongest argument influencing our decision. But we shall not contradict
any of the explanations of the optical facts by also assuming that the
light wave is an electromagnetic one. On the contrary, still other
conclusions can be drawn. If this is really so, then there must exist
some connection between the optical and electrical properties of matter
that can be deduced from the theory. The fact that conclusions of this
kind can really be drawn</p>
<p>and that they stand the test of experiment is an essential argument
in favour of the electromagnetic theory of light.</p>
<p>This great result is due to the field theory. Two apparently
unrelated branches of science are covered by the same theory. The same
Maxwell’s equations describe both electric induction and optical
refraction. If it is our aim to describe everything that ever happened
or may happen with the help of one theory, then the union of optics and
electricity is, undoubtedly, a very great step forward. From the
physical point of view, the only difference between an ordinary
electromagnetic wave and a light wave is the wave-length: this is very
small for light waves, detected by the human eye, and great for ordinary
electromagnetic waves, detected by a radio receiver.</p>
<p>The old mechanical view attempted to reduce all events in nature to
forces acting between material particles. Upon this mechanical view was
based the first naive theory of the electric fluids. The field did not
exist for the physicist of the early years of the nineteenth century.
For him only substance and its changes were real. He tried to describe
the action of two electric charges only by concepts referring directly
to the two charges.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the field concept was no more than a means of
facilitating the understanding of phenomena from the mechanical point of
view. In the new field language it is the description of the field
between the two charges, and not the charges themselves, which is</p>
<p>essential for an understanding of their action. The recognition of
the new concepts grew steadily, until substance was overshadowed by the
field. It was realized that something of great importance had happened
in physics. A new reality was created, a new concept for which there was
no place in the mechanical description. Slowly and by a struggle the
field concept established for itself a leading place in physics and has
remained one of the basic physical concepts. The electromagnetic field
is, for the modern physicist, as real as the chair on which he sits.</p>
<p>But it would be unjust to consider that the new field view freed
science from the errors of the old theory of electric fluids or that the
new theory destroys the achievements of the old. The new theory shows
the merits as well as the limitations of the old theory and allows us to
regain our old concepts from a higher level. This is true not only for
the theories of electric fluids and field, but for all changes in
physical theories, however revolutionary they may seem. In our case, we
still find, for example, the concept of the electric charge in Maxwell’s
theory, though the charge is understood only as a source of the electric
field. Coulomb’s law is still valid and is contained in Maxwell’s
equations from which it can be deduced as one of the many consequences.
We can still apply the old theory, whenever facts within the region of
its validity are investigated. But we may as well apply the new theory,
since all the known facts are contained in the realm of its
validity.</p>
<p>To use a comparison, we could say that creating a new theory is not
like destroying an old barn and erect-uTits piarq, ^lt is rather like
climEing</p>
<p>a mountain, gaining new and wider views, discovering cuimeaions
b<sup>twe</sup>Trouf<sup>IarnHg</sup>point and</p>
<p>its rich environment. But the point from which we started out still
exists and can be seen, although it appears smaller and forms a tiny
part of our broad view gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our
adventurous way up.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, a long time before the full content of Maxwell’s
theory was recognized. The field was at first considered as something
which might later be interpreted mechanically with the help of ether. By
the time it was realized that this programme could not be carried out,
the achievements of the field theory had already become too striking and
important for it to be exchanged for a mechanical dogma. On the other
hand, the problem of devising the mechanical model of ether seemed to
become less and less interesting and the result, in view of the forced
and artificial character of the assumptions, more and more
discouraging.</p>
<p>Our only way out seems to be to take for granted the fact that space
has the physical property of transmitting electromagnetic waves, and not
to bother too much about the meaning of this statement. We may still use
the word ether, but only to express some physical property of space.
This word ether has changed its meaning many times in the development of
science. At the moment it no longer stands for a medium built up</p>
<p>of particles. Its story, by no means finished, is continued by the
relativity theory.</p>
<p>THE MECHANICAL SCAFFOLD</p>
<p>On reaching this stage of our story, we must turn back to the
beginning, to Galileo’s law of inertia. We quote once more:</p>
<p>Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a
right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed thereon.</p>
<p>Once the idea of inertia is understood, one wonders what more can be
said about it. Although this problem has already been thoroughly
discussed, it is by no means exhausted.</p>
<p>Imagine a serious scientist who believes that the law of inertia can
be proved or disproved by actual experiments. He pushes small spheres
along a horizontal table, trying to eliminate friction so far as
possible. He notices that the motion becomes more uniform as the table
and the spheres are made smoother. Just as he is about to proclaim the
principle of inertia, someone suddenly plays a practical joke on him.
Our physicist works in a room without windows and has no communication
whatever with the outside world. The practical joker installs some
mechanism which enables him to cause the entire room to rotate quickly
on an axis passing through its centre. As soon as the rotation begins,
the physicist has new and unexpected experiences. The sphere which has
been moving uniformly</p>
<p>tries to get as far away from the centre and as near to the walls of
the room as possible. He himself feels a strange force pushing him
against the wall. He experiences the same sensation as anyone in a train
or car travelling fast round a curve, or even more, on a rotating
merry-go-round. All his previous results go to pieces.</p>
<p>Our physicist would have to discard, with the law of inertia, all
mechanical laws. The law of inertia was his starting-point; if this is
changed, so are all his further conclusions. An observer destined to
spend his whole life in the rotating room, and to perform all his
experiments there, would have laws of mechanics differing from ours. If,
on the other hand, he enters the room with a profound knowledge and a
firm belief in the principles of physics, his explanation for the
apparent breakdown of mechanics would be the assumption that the room
rotates. By mechanical experiments he could even ascertain how it
rotates.</p>
<p>Why should we take so much interest in the observer in his rotating
room? Simply because we, on our earth, are to a certain extent in the
same position. Since the time of Copernicus we have known that the earth
rotates on its axis and moves around the sun. Even this simple idea, so
clear to everyone, was not left untouched by the advance of science. But
let us leave this question for the time being and accept Copernicus’
point of view. If our rotating observer could not confirm the laws of
mechanics, w^- on our earth, should also be unable to do so. But the
rotation of the earth is</p>
<p>comparatively slow, so that the effect is not very distinct.
Nevertheless, there are many experiments which show a small deviation
from the mechanical laws, and their consistency can be regarded as proof
of the rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot place ourselves between the sun and the
earth, to prove there the exact validity of the law of inertia and to
get a view of the rotating earth. This can be done only in imagination.
All our experiments must be performed on the earth on which we are
compelled to live. The same fact is often expressed more scientifically:
the earth is our co-ordinate system.</p>
<p>To show the meaning of these words more clearly, let us take a simple
example. We can predict the position, at any time, of a stone thrown
from a tower, and confirm our prediction by observation. If a
measuring-rod is placed beside the tower, we can foretell with what mark
on the rod the falling body will coincide at any given moment. The tower
and scale must, obviously, not be made of rubber or any other material
which would undergo any change during the experiment. In fact, the
unchangeable scale, rigidly connected with the earth, and a good clock
are all we need, in principle, for the experiment. If we have these, we
can ignore not only the architecture of the tower, but its very
presence. The foregoing assumptions are all trivial and not usually
specified in descriptions of such experiments. But this analysis shows
how many hidden assumptions there are in every one of our state-</p>
<p>ments. In our case, we assumed the existence of a rigid bar and an
ideal clock, without which it would be impossible to check Galileo’s law
for falling bodies. With this simple but fundamental physical apparatus,
a rod and a clock, we can confirm this mechanical law with a certain
degree of accuracy. Carefully performed, this experiment reveals
discrepancies between theory and experiment due to the rotation of the
earth or, in other words, to the fact that the laws of mechanics, as
here formulated, are not strictly valid in a co-ordinate system rigidly
connected with the earth.</p>
<p>In all mechanical experiments, no matter of what type, we have to
determine positions of material points at some definite time, just as in
the above experiment with a falling body. But the position must always
be described with respect to something, as in the previous case to the
tower and the scale. We must have what we call some frame of reference,
a mechanical scaffold, to be able to determine the positions of bodies.
In describing the positions of objects and men in a city, the streets
and avenues form the frame to which we refer. So far we have not
bothered to describe the frame when quoting the laws of mechanics,
because we happen to live on the earth and there is no difficulty in any
particular case in fixing a frame of reference, rigidly connected with
the earth. This frame, to which we refer all our observations,
constructed of rigid unchangeable bodies, is called the co-ordinate
system. Since this expression will be used very often, we shall simply
write c.s.</p>
<p>6-2</p>
<p>All our physical statements thus far have lacked something. We took
no notice of the fact that all observations must be made in a certain
c.s. Instead of describing the structure of this c.s., we just ignored
its existence. For example, when we wrote “ a body moves uniformly…“ we
should really have written, “a body</p>
<p>moves uniformly, relative to a chosen c.s “ Our</p>
<p>experience with the rotating room taught us that the results of
mechanical experiments may depend on the c.s. chosen.</p>
<p>If two c.s. rotate with respect to each other, then the laws of
mechanics cannot be valid in both. If the surface of the water in a
swimming pool, forming one of the co-ordinate systems, is horizontal,
then in the other the surface of the water in a similar swimming pool
takes the curved form similar to anyone who stirs his coffee with a
spoon.</p>
<p>When formulating the principal clues of mechanics we omitted one
important point. We did not state^for which c.s. they arej^aiuL-
JborlHis reason, the whole of</p>
<p>lid-air since we do not</p>
<p>know to which frame it refers. Let us, however, pass over mis
ditliculty for the moment. We shall make the slightly incorrect
assumption that in every c.s. rigidly connected with the earth the laws
of classical mechanics are valid. This is done in order to fix the c.s.
and to make our statements definite. Although our statement that the
earth is a suitable frame of reference is not wholly correct, we shall
accept it for the present. We assume, therefore, the existence of one
c.s. for</p>
<p>which the laws of mechanics are valid. Is this the only one? Suppose
we have a c.s. such as a train, a ship or an aeroplane moving relative
to our earth. Will the laws of mechanics be valid for these new c.s.? We
know definitely that they are not always valid, as for instance in the
case of a train turning a curve, a ship tossed in a storm or an
aeroplane in a tail spin. Let us begin with a simple example. A c.s.
moves uniformly, relative to our “good“ c.s., that is, one in which the
laws of mechanics are valid. For instance, an ideal train or a ship
sailing with delightful smoothness along a straight line and with a
never-changing speed. We know from everyday experience that both systems
will be “good“, that physical experiments performed in a uniformly
moving train or ship will give exactly the same results as on the earth.
But, if the train stops, or accelerates abruptly, or if the sea is
rough, strange things happen. In the train, the trunks fall off the
luggage racks; on the ship, tables and chairs are thrown about and the
passengers become seasick. From the physical point of view this simply
means that the laws of mechanics cannot be applied to these c.s., that
they are “bad“ c.s.</p>
<p>This result can be expressed by the so-called Galilean relativity
principle : if the laws of mechanics are valid in one c.s., then they
are valid in any other c.s. moving uniformly relative to the first.</p>
<p>If we have two c.s. moving non-uniformly, relative to each other,
then the laws of mechanics cannot be valid in both. “Good“ co-ordinate
systems, that is,</p>
<p>l66 . THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>those for which the laws of mechanics are valid, we call inertial
systems. The question as to whether an in-ertial system exists at all is
still unsettled. But if there is one such system, then there is an
infinite number of them. Every c.s. moving uniformly, relative to the
initial one, is also an inertial c.s.</p>
<p>Let us consider the case of two c.s. starting from a known position
and moving uniformly, one relative to the other, with a known velocity.
One who prefers concrete pictures can safely think of a ship or a train
moving relative to the earth. The laws of mechanics can be confirmed
experimentally with the same degree of accuracy, on the earth or in a
train or on a ship moving uniformly. But some difficulty arises if the
observers of two systems begin to discuss observations of the same event
from the point of view of their different c.s. Each would like to
translate the other’s observations into his own language. Again a simple
example: the same motion of a particle is observed from two c.s.—the
earth and a train moving uniformly. These are both inertial. Is it
sufficient to know what is observed in one c.s. in order to find out
what is observed in the other, if the relative velocities and positions
of the two c.s. at some moment are known? It is most essential, for a
description of events, to know how to pass from one c.s. to another,
since both c.s. are equivalent and both equally suited for the
description of events in nature. Indeed, it is quite enough to know the
results obtained by an observer in one c.s. to know those obtained by an
observer in the other.</p>
<p>Let us consider the problem more abstractly, without ship or train.
To simplify matters we shall investigate only motion along straight
lines. We have, then, a rigid bar with a scale and a good clock. The
rigid bar represents, in the simple case of rectilinear motion, a c.s.
just as did the scale on the tower in Galileo’s experiment. It is always
simpler and better to think of a c.s. as a rigid bar in the case of
rectilinear motion and a rigid scaffold built of parallel and
perpendicular rods in the case of arbitrary motion in space,
disregarding towers, walls, streets, and the like. Suppose we have, in
our simplest case, two c.s., that is, two rigid rods; we draw one above
the other and call them respectively the “upper“ and “lower“ c.s. We
assume that the two c.s. move with a definite velocity relative to each
other, so that one slides along the other. It is safe to assume that
both rods are of infinite length and have initial points but no
end-points. One clock is sufficient for the two c.s., for the time flow
is the same for both. When we begin our observation the starting-points
of the two rods coincide. The position of a material point is
characterized, at this moment, by the same number in both c.s. The
material point coincides with a point on the scale on the rod, thus
giving us a number determining the position of this material point. But,
if the rods move uniformly, relative to each other, the numbers
corresponding to the positions will be different after some time, say,
one second. Consider a material point resting on the upper rod. The
number determining its position on the upper c.s. does not change with
time.</p>
<p>But the corresponding number for the lower rod will change. Instead
of “the number corresponding to a position of the point“, we shall say
briefly, the coordinate of a point. Thus we see from our drawing
that</p>
<p>&lt; &gt;E</p>
<p>although the following sentence sounds intricate, it is nevertheless
correct and expresses something very simple. The co-ordinate of a point
in the lower c.s. is equal to its co-ordinate in the upper c.s. plus the
co-ordinate of the origin of the upper c.s. relative to the lower c.s.
The important thing is that we can always calculate the position of a
particle in one c.s. if we know the position in the other. For this
purpose we have to know the relative positions of the two co-ordinate
systems in question at every moment. Although all this sounds learned,
it is, really, very simple and hardly worth such detailed discussion,
except that we shall find it useful later.</p>
<p>It is worth our while to notice the difference between determining
the position of a point and the time of an event. Every observer has his
own rod which forms his c.s., but there is only one clock for them all,
Time is something “absolute“ which flows in the same way for all
observers in all c.s.</p>
<p>Now another example. A man strolls with a velocity of three miles per
hour along the deck of a large ship.</p>
<p>This is his velocity relative to the ship, or, in other words,
relative to a c.s. rigidly connected with the ship. If the velocity of
the ship is thirty miles per hour relative to the shore, and if the
uniform velocities of man and ship both have the same direction, then
the velocity of the stroller will be thirty-three miles per hour
relative to an observer on the shore, or three miles per hour relative
to the ship. We can formulate this fact more abstractly: the velocity of
a moving material point, relative to the lower c.s., is equal to that
relative to the upper c.s. plus or minus the velocity of the upper c.s.
relative to the lower, depending upon whether the velocities have the
same or opposite directions. We can, therefore, always transform not
only positions,</p>
<p>but also velocities from one c.s. to another if we know the realtive
velocities of the two c.s. The positions, or co-ordinates, and
velocities are examples of quantities which are different in different
c.s. bound together by certain, in this case very simple, transformation
laws.</p>
<p>There exist quantities, however, which are the same in both c.s. and
for which no transformation laws are needed. Take as an example not one,
but two fixed points on the upper rod and consider the distance between
them. This distance is the difference in the co-ordinates of the two
points. To find the positions</p>
<p>of two points relative to different c.s., we have to use
transformation laws. But in constructing the differences of two
positions the contributions due to the</p>
<p>different c.s. cancel each other and disappear, as is evident from
the drawing. We have to add and subtract the distance between the
origins of two c.s. The distance of two points is, therefore, invariant^
that is, independent of the choice of the c.s.</p>
<p>The next example of a quantity independent of the c.s. is the change
of velocity, a concept familiar to us from mechanics. Again, a material
point moving along a straight line is observed from two c.s. Its change
of velocity is, for the observer in each c.s., a difference between two
velocities, and the contribution due to the uniform relative motion of
the two c.s. disappears when the difference is calculated. Therefore,
the change of velocity is an invariant, though only, of course, on
condition that the relative motion of our two c.s. is uniform.
Otherwise, the change of velocity would be different in each of the two
c.s., the difference being brought in by the change of velocity of the
relative motion of the two rods, representing our co-ordinate
systems.</p>
<p>Now the last example ! We have two material points, with forces
acting between them which depend only</p>
<p>on the distance. In the case of rectilinear motion, the distance, and
therefore the force as well, is invariant. Newton’s law connecting the
force with the change of velocity will, therefore, be valid in both c.s.
Once again we reach a conclusion which is confirmed by everyday
experience: if the laws of mechanics are valid in one c.s., then they
are valid in all c.s. moving uniformly with respect to that one. Our
example was, of course, a very simple one, that of rectilinear motion in
which the c.s. can be represented by a rigid rod. But our conclusions
are generally valid, and can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We know of no rule for finding an inertial system. Given one,
however, we can find an infinite number, since all c.s. moving
uniformly, relative to each other, are inertial systems if one of them
is.</p></li>
<li><p>The time corresponding to an event is the same in all c.s. But
the co-ordinates and velocities are different, and change according to
the transformation laws.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the co-ordinates and velocity change when passing from
one c.s. to another, the force and change of velocity, and therefore the
laws of mechanics are invariant with respect to the transformation
laws.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The laws of transformation formulated here for coordinates and
velocities we shall call the transformation laws of classical mechanics,
or more briefly, the classical transformation.</p>
<p>ETHER AND MOTION</p>
<p>The Galilean relativity principle is valid for mechanical phenomena.
The same laws of mechanics apply to all inertial systems moving relative
to each other. Is this principle also valid for non-mechanical
phenomena, especially for those for which the field concepts proved so
very important? All problems concentrated around this question
immediately bring us to the starting-point of the relativity theory.</p>
<p>We remember that the velocity of light in vacuo, or in other words,
in ether, is 186,000 miles per second and that light is an
electromagnetic wave spreading through the ether. The electromagnetic
field carries energy which, once emitted from its source, leads an
independent existence. For the time being, we shall continue to believe
that the ether is a medium through which electromagnetic waves, and thus
also light waves, are propagated, even though we are fully aware of the
many difficulties connected with its mechanical structure.</p>
<p>We are sitting in a closed room so isolated from the external world
that no air can enter or escape. If we sit still and talk we are, from
the physical point of view, creating sound waves, which spread from
their resting source with the velocity of sound in air. If there were no
air or other material medium between the mouth and the ear, we could not
detect a sound. Experiment has shown that the velocity of sound in air
is the same in all directions, if there is no wind and the air is at
rest in the chosen c.s.</p>
<p>Let us now imagine that our room moves uniformly through space. A man
outside sees, through the glass walls of the moving room (or train if
you prefer), everything which is going on inside. From the measurements
of the inside observer he can deduce the velocity of sound relative to
his c.s. connected with his surroundings, relative to which the room
moves. Here again is the old, much discussed, problem of determining the
velocity in one c.s. if it is already known in another.</p>
<p>The observer in the room claims: the velocity of sound is, for me,
the same in all directions.</p>
<p>The outside observer claims: the velocity of sound, spreading in the
moving room and determined in my c.s., is not the same in all
directions. It is greater than the standard velocity of sound in the
direction of the motion of the room and smaller in the opposite
direction.</p>
<p>These conclusions are drawn from the classical transformation and can
be confirmed by experiment. The room carries within it the material
medium, the air through which sound waves are propagated, and the
velocities of sound will, therefore, be different for the inside and
outside observer.</p>
<p>We can draw some further conclusions from the theory of sound as a
wave propagated through a material medium. One way, though by no means
the simplest, of not hearing what someone is saying, is to run, with a
velocity greater than that of sound, relative to the air surrounding the
speaker. The sound waves produced will then never be able to reach
our</p>
<p>ears. On the other hand, if we missed an important word which will
never be repeated, we must run with a speed greater than that of sound
to reach the produced wave and to catch the word. There is nothing
irrational in either of these examples except that in both cases we
should have to run with a speed of about four hundred yards per second,
and we can very well imagine that further technical development will
make such speeds possible. A bullet fired from a gun actually moves with
a speed greater than that of sound and a man placed on such a bullet
would never hear the sound of the shot.</p>
<p>All these examples are of a purely mechanical character and we can
now formulate the important questions: could we repeat what has just
been said of a sound wave, in the case of a light wave? Do the Galilean
relativity principle and the classical transformation apply to optical
and electrical phenomena as well as to mechanical? It would be risky to
answer these questions by a simple “yes“ or “no“ without going more
deeply into their meaning.</p>
<p>In the case of the sound wave in the room moving uniformly, relative
to the outside observer, the following intermediate steps are very
essential for our conclusion : The moving room carries the air in which
the sound</p>
<p>wave is propagated. The velocities observed in two c.s. moving
uniformly,</p>
<p>relative to each other, are connected by the classical</p>
<p>transformation.</p>
<p>The corresponding problem for light must be formulated a little
differently. The observers in the room are no longer talking, but are
sending light signals, or light waves in every direction. Let us further
assume that the sources emitting the light signals are permanently
resting in the room. The light waves move through the ether just as the
sound waves moved through the air.</p>
<p>Is the ether carried with the room as the air was? Since we have no
mechanical picture of the ether, it is extremely difficult to answer
this question. If the room is closed, the air inside is forced to move
with it. There is obviously no sense in thinking of ether in this way,
since all matter is immersed in it and it penetrates everywhere. No
doors are closed to ether. The “moving room“ now means only a moving
c.s. to which the source of light is rigidly connected. It is, however,
not beyond us to imagine that the room moving with its light source
carries the ether along with it just as the sound source and air were
carried along in the closed room. But we can equally well imagine the
opposite: that the room travels through the ether as a ship through a
perfectly smooth sea, not carrying any part of the medium along but
moving through it. In our first picture, the room moving with its light
source carries the ether. An analogy with a sound wave is possible and
quite similar conclusions can be drawn. In the second, the room moving
with its light source does not carry the ether. No analogy with a sound
wave is possible and the conclusions drawn in the case</p>
<p>of a sound wave do not hold for a light wave. These are the two
limiting possibilities. We could imagine the still more complicated
possibility that the ether is only partially carried by the room moving
with its light source. But there is no reason to discuss the more
complicated assumptions before finding out which of the two simpler
limiting cases experiment favours.</p>
<p>We shall begin with our first picture and assume, for the present:
the ether is carried along by the room moving with its rigidly connected
light source. If we believe in the simple transformation principle for
the velocities of sound waves, we can now apply our conclusions to light
waves as well. There is no reason for doubting the simple mechanical
transformation law which only states that the velocities have to be
added in certain cases and subtracted in others. For the moment,
therefore, we shall assume both the carrying of the ether by the room
moving with its light source and the classical transformation.</p>
<p>If I turn on the light and its source is rigidly connected with my
room, then the velocity of the light signal has the well-known
experimental value 186,000 miles per second. But the outside observer
will notice the motion of the room, and, therefore, that of the
source—and, since the ether is carried along, his conclusion must be:
the velocity of light in my outside c.s. is different in different
directions. It is greater than the standard velocity of light in the
direction of the motion of the room and smaller in the opposite
direction. Our conclusion is: if ether is carried with the room</p>
<p>moving with its light source and if the mechanical laws are valid,
then the velocity of light must depend on the velocity of the light
source. Light reaching our eyes from a moving light source would have a
greater velocity if the motion is toward us and smaller if it is away
from us.</p>
<p>If our speed were greater than that of light, we should be able to
run away from a light signal. We could see occurrences from the past by
reaching previously sent light waves. We should catch them in a reverse
order to that in which they were sent, and the train of happenings on
our earth would appear like a film shown backward, beginning with a
happy ending. These conclusions all follow from the assumption that the
moving c.s. carries along the ether and the mechanical transformation
laws are valid. If this is so, the analogy between light and sound is
perfect.</p>
<p>But there is no indication as to the truth of these conclusions. On
the contrary, they are contradicted by all observations made with the
intention of proving them. There is not the slightest doubt as to the
clarity of this verdict, although it is obtained through rather indirect
experiments in view of the great technical difficulties caused by the
enormous value of the velocity of light. The velocity of light is always
the same in all c.s. independent of whether or not the emitting source
moves , or how it moves.</p>
<p>We shall not go into detailed description of the many experiments
from which this important conclusion can be drawn. We can, however, use
some very simple</p>
<p>arguments which, though they do not prove that the velocity of light
is independent of the motion of the source, nevertheless make this fact
convincing and understandable.</p>
<p>In our planetary system the earth and other planets move around the
sun. We do not know of the existence of other planetary systems similar
to ours. There are, however, very many double-star systems, consisting
of two stars moving around a point, called their centre of gravity.
Observation of the motion of these double stars reveals the validity of
Newton’s gravitational law. Now suppose that the speed of light depends
on the velocity of the emitting body. Then the message, that is, the
light ray from the star, will travel more quickly or more slowly,
according to the velocity of the star at the moment the ray is emitted.
In this case the whole motion would be muddled and it would be
impossible to confirm, in the case of distant double stars, the validity
of the same gravitational law which rules over our planetary system.</p>
<p>Let us consider another experiment based upon a very simple idea.
Imagine a wheel rotating very quickly. According to our assumption, the
ether is carried by the motion and takes a part in it. A light wave
passing near the wheel would have a different speed when the wheel is at
rest than when it is in motion. The velocity of light in ether at rest
should differ from that in ether which is being quickly dragged round by
the motion of the wheel, just as the velocity of a sound wave varies on
calm and windy days. But no such</p>
<p>difference is detected! No matter from which angle we approach the
subject, or what crucial experiment we may devise, the verdict is always
against the assumption of the ether carried by motion. Thus, the result
of our considerations, supported by more detailed and technical
argument, is: The velocity of light does not depend on the motion</p>
<p>of the emitting source. It must not be assumed that the moving body
carries</p>
<p>the surrounding ether along.</p>
<p>We must, therefore, give up the analogy between sound and light waves
and turn to the second possibility: that all matter moves through the
ether, which takes no part whatever in the motion. This means that we
assume the existence of a sea of ether with all c.s. resting in it, or
moving relative to it. Suppose we leave, for a while, the question as to
whether experiment proved or disproved this theory. It will be better to
become more familiar with the meaning of this new assumption and with
the conclusions which can be drawn from it.</p>
<p>There exists a c.s. resting relative to the ether-sea. In mechanics,
not one of the many c.s. moving uniformly, relative to each other, could
be distinguished. All such c.s. were equally “good“ or “bad“. If we have
two c.s. moving uniformly, relative to each other, it is meaningless, in
mechanics, to ask which of them is in motion and which at rest. Only
relative uniform motion can be observed. We cannot talk about absolute
uniform motion because of the Galilean relativity</p>
<p>principle. What is meant by the statement that absolute and not only
relative uniform motion exists? Simply that there exists one c.s. in
which some of the laws of nature are different from those in all others.
Also that every observer can detect whether his c.s. is at rest or in
motion by comparing the laws valid in it with those valid in the only
one which has the absolute monopoly of serving as the standard c.s. Here
is a different state of affairs from classical mechanics, where absolute
uniform motion is quite meaningless because of Galileo’s law of
inertia.</p>
<p>What conclusions can be drawn in the domain of field phenomena if
motion through ether is assumed? This would mean that there exists one
c.s. distinct from all others, at rest relative to the ether-sea. It is
quite clear that some of the laws of nature must be different in this
c.s., otherwise the phrase “motion through ether“ would be meaningless.
If the Galilean relativity principle is valid, then motion through ether
makes no sense at all. It is impossible to reconcile these two ideas.
If, however, there exists one special c.s. fixed by the ether, then to
speak of “absolute motion“ or “absolute rest“ has a definite
meaning.</p>
<p>We really have no choice. We tried to save the Galilean relativity
principle by assuming that systems carry the ether along in their
motion, but this led to a contradiction with experiment. The only way
out is to abandon the Galilean relativity principle and try out the
assumption that all bodies move through the calm ether-sea.</p>
<p>The next step is to consider some conclusions contradicting the
Galilean relativity principle and supporting the view of motion through
ether, and to put them to the test of an experiment. Such experiments
are easy enough to imagine, but very difficult to perform. As we are
concerned here only with ideas, we need not bother with technical
difficulties.</p>
<p>Again we return to our moving room with two observers, one inside and
one outside. The outside observer will represent the standard c.s.,
designated by the ether-sea. It is the distinguished c.s. in which the
velocity of light always has the same standard value. All light sources,
whether moving or at rest in the calm ether-sea, propagate light with
the same velocity. The room and its observer move through the ether.
Imagine that a light in the centre of the room is flashed on and off
and, furthermore, that the walls of the room are transparent so that the
observers, both inside and outside, can measure the velocity of the
light. If we ask the two observers what results they expect to obtain,
their answers would run something like this:</p>
<p>The outside observer: My c.s. is designated by the ether-sea. Light
in my c.s. always has the standard value. I need not care whether or not
the source of light or other bodies are moving, for they never carry my
ether-sea with them. My c.s. is distinguished from all others and the
velocity of light must have its standard value in this c.s., independent
of the direction of the light beam or the motion of its source.</p>
<p>The inside observer: My room moves through the</p>
<p>ether-sea. One of the walls runs away from the light and the other
approaches it. If my room travelled, relative to the ether-sea, with the
velocity of light, then the light emitted from the centre of the room
would never reach the wall running away with the velocity of light. If
the room travelled with a velocity smaller than that of light, then a
wave sent from the centre of the room would reach one of the walls
before the other. The wall moving toward the light wave would be reached
before the one retreating from the light wave. Therefore, although the
source of light is rigidly connected with my G.S., the velocity of light
will not be the same in all directions. It will be smaller in the
direction of the motion relative to the ether-sea as the wall runs away,
and greater in the opposite direction as the wall moves toward the wave
and tries to meet it sooner.</p>
<p>Thus, only in the one c.s. distinguished by the ether-sea should the
velocity of light be equal in all directions. For other c.s. moving
relatively to the ether-sea it should depend on the direction in which
we are measuring.</p>
<p>The crucial experiment just considered enables us to test the theory
of motion through the ether-sea. Nature, in fact, places at our disposal
a system moving with a fairly high velocity—the earth in its yearly
motion around the sun. If our assumption is correct, then the velocity
of light in the direction of the motion of the earth should differ from
the velocity of light in an opposite direction. The differences can be
calculated</p>
<p>and a suitable experimental test devised. In view of the small
time-differences following from the theory, very ingenious experimental
arrangements have to be thought out. This was done in the famous
Michelson-Morley experiment. The result was a verdict of “death “ to the
theory of a calm ether-sea through which all matter moves. No dependence
of the speed of light upon direction could be found. Not only the speed
of light, but also other field phenomena would show a dependence on the
direction in the moving c.s., if the theory of the ether-sea were
assumed. Every experiment has given the same negative result as the
Michelson-Morley one, and never revealed any dependence upon the
direction of the motion of the earth.</p>
<p>The situation grows more and more serious. Two assumptions have been
tried. The first, that moving bodies carry ether along. The fact that
the velocity of light does not depend on the motion of the source
contradicts this assumption. The second, that there exists one
distinguished c.s. and that moving bodies do not carry the ether but
travel through an ever calm ether-sea. If this is so, then the Galilean
relativity principle is not valid and the speed of light cannot be the
same in every c.s. Again we are in contradiction with experiment.</p>
<p>More artificial theories have been tried out, assuming that the real
truth lies somewhere between these two limiting cases: that the ether is
only partially carried by the moving bodies. But they all failed ! Every
attempt to explain the electromagnetic phenomena in</p>
<p>moving c.s. with the help of the motion of the ether, motion through
the ether, or both these motions, proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Thus arose one of the most dramatic situations in the history of
science. All assumptions concerning ether led nowhere! The experimental
verdict was always negative. Looking back over the development of
physics we see that the ether, soon after its birth, became the enfant
terrible of the family of physical substances. First, the construction
of a simple mechanical picture of the ether proved to be impossible and
was discarded. This caused, to a great extent, the breakdown of the
mechanical point of view. Second, we had to give up hope that through
the presence of the ether-sea one c.s. would be distinguished and lead
to the recognition of absolute, and not only relative, motion. This
would have been the only way, besides carrying the waves, in which ether
could mark and justify its existence. All our attempts to make ether
real failed. It revealed neither its mechanical construction nor
absolute motion. Nothing remained of all the properties of the ether
except that for which it was invented, i.e. its ability to transmit
electromagnetic waves. Our attempts to discover the properties of the
ether led to difficulties and contradictions. After such bad
experiences, this is the moment to forget the ether completely and to
try never to mention its name. We shall say: our space has the physical
property of transmitting waves, and so omit the use of a word we have
decided to avoid.</p>
<p>The omission of a word from our vocabulary is, of</p>
<p>course, no remedy. Our troubles are indeed much too profound to be
solved in this way!</p>
<p>Let us now write down the facts which have been sufficiently
confirmed by experiment without bothering any more about the “e r“
problem.</p>
<p>1i) The velocity of light in empty space always has its standard
value, independent of the motion of the source or receiver of light.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>In two c.s. moving uniformly, relative to each other, all laws of
nature are exactly identical and there is no way of distinguishing
absolute uniform motion.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many experiments to confirm these two statements and not a
single one to contradict either of them. The first statement expresses
the constant character of the velocity of light, the second generalizes
the Galilean relativity principle, formulated for mechanical phenomena,
to all happenings in nature.</p>
<p>In mechanics, we have seen: If the velocity of a material point is so
and so, relative to one c.s., then it will be different in another c.s.
moving uniformly, relative to the first. This follows from the simple
mechanical transformation principles. They are immediately given by our
intuition (man moving relative to ship and shore) and apparently nothing
can be wrong here ! But this transformation law is in contradiction to
the constant character of the velocity of light. Or, in other words, we
add a third principle:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Positions and velocities are transformed from one inertial system to
another according to the classical transformation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The contradiction is then evident. We cannot combine (i), (2), and
(3).</p>
<p>The classical transformation seems too obvious and simple for any
attempt to change it. We have already tried to change (i) and (2) and
came to a disagreement with experiment. All theories concerning the</p>
<p>motion of “e r“ required an alteration of (i) and</p>
<p>(2). This was no good. Once more we realize the serious character of
our difficulties. A new clue is needed. It is supplied by accepting the
fundamental assumptions (i) and (2), and, strange though it seems,
giving up (3). The new clue starts from an analysis of the most
fundamental and primitive concepts; we shall show how this analysis
forces us to change our old views and removes all our difficulties.</p>
<p>TIME, DISTANCE, RELATIVITY Our new assumptions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The velocity of light in vacuo is the same in all c.s. moving
uniformly, relative to each other.</p></li>
<li><p>All laws of nature are the same in all c.s. moving uniformly ’,
relative to each other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The relativity theory begins with these two assumptions. From now on
we shall not use the classical transformation because we know that it
contradicts our assumptions.</p>
<p>It is essential here, as always in science, to rid ourselves of
deep-rooted, often uncritically repeated, prejudices. Since we have seen
that changes in (i) and (2) lead to contradiction with experiment, we
must have</p>
<p>the courage to state their validity clearly and to attack the one
possibly weak point, the way in which positions and velocities are
transformed from one c.s. to another. It is our intention to draw
conclusions from (i) and (2), see where and how these assumptions
contradict the classical transformation, and find the physical meaning
of the results obtained.</p>
<p>Once more, the example of the moving room with outside and inside
observers will be used. Again a light signal is emitted from the centre
of the room and again we ask the two men what they expect to observe,
assuming only our two principles and forgetting what was previously said
concerning the medium through which the light travels. We quote their
answers:</p>
<p>The inside observer: The light signal travelling from the centre of
the room will reach the walls simultaneously, since all the walls are
equally distant from the light source and the velocity of light is the
same in all directions.</p>
<p>The outside observer: In my system, the velocity of light is exactly
the same as in that of the observer moving with the room. It does not
matter to me whether or not the light source moves in my c.s. since its
motion does not influence the velocity of light. What I see is a light
signal travelling with a standard speed, the same in all directions. One
of the walls is trying to escape from and the opposite wall to approach
the light signal. Therefore, the escaping wall will be met by the signal
a little later than the approaching one. Although the difference will be
very slight if the velocity of the room</p>
<p>is small compared with that of light, the light signal will
nevertheless not meet these two opposite walls, which are perpendicular
to the direction of the motion, quite simultaneously.</p>
<p>Comparing the predictions of our two observers, we find a most
astonishing result which flatly contradicts the apparently well-founded
concepts of classical physics. Two events, i.e., the two light beams
reaching the two walls, are simultaneous for the observer on the inside,
but not for the observer on the outside. In classical physics, we had
one clock, one time flow, for all observers in all c.s. Time, and
therefore such words as “simultaneously“, “sooner“, “later“, had an
absolute meaning independent of any c.s. Two events happening at the
same time in one c.s. happened necessarily simultaneously in all other
c.s.</p>
<p>Assumptions (i) and (2), i.e. the relativity theory, force us to give
up this view. We have described two events happening at the same time in
one c.s., but at different times in another c.s. Our task is to
understand this consequence, to understand the meaning of the sentence:
“Two events which are simultaneous in one c.s., may not be simultaneous
in another c.s.“</p>
<p>What do we mean by “two simultaneous events in one c.s.“? Intuitively
everyone seems to know the meaning of this sentence. But let us make up
our minds to be cautious and try to give rigorous definitions, as we
know how dangerous it is to over-estimate intuition. Let us first answer
a simple question.</p>
<p>What is a clock?</p>
<p>The primitive subjective feeling of time flow enables us to order our
impressions, to judge that one event takes place earlier, another later.
But to show that the time interval between two events is 10 seconds, a
clock is needed. By the use of a clock the time concept becomes
objective. Any physical phenomenon may be used as a clock, provided it
can be exactly repeated as many times as desired. Taking the interval
between the beginning and the end of such an event as one unit of time,
arbitrary time intervals may be measured by repetition of this physical
process. All clocks, from the simple hour-glass to the most refined
instruments, are based on this idea. With the hour-glass the unit of
time is the interval the sand takes to flow from the upper to the lower
glass. The same physical process can be repeated by inverting the
glass.</p>
<p>At two distant points we have two perfect clocks, showing exactly the
same time. This statement should be true regardless of the care with
which we verify it. But what does it really mean? How can we make sure
that distant clocks always show exactly the same time? One possible
method would be to use television. It should be understood that
television is used only as an example and is not essential to our
argument. I could stand near one of the clocks and look at a televised
picture of the other. I could then judge whether or not they showed the
same time simultaneously. But this would not be a good proof. The
televised picture is transmitted through electromagnetic waves and thus
travels with the speed of light. Through television I</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>see a picture which was sent some very short time before, whereas on
the real clock I see what is taking place at the present moment. This
difficulty can easily be avoided. I must take television pictures of the
two clocks at a point equally distant from each of them and observe them
from this centre point. Then, if the signals are sent out
simultaneously, they will all reach me at the same instant. If two good
clocks observed from the mid-point of the distance between them always
show the same time, then they are well suited for designating the time
of events at two distant points.</p>
<p>In mechanics we used only one clock. But this was not very
convenient, because we had to take all measurements in the vicinity of
this one clock. Looking at the clock from a distance, for example by
television, we have always to remember that what we see now really
happened earlier, just as in viewing the setting sun we note the event
eight minutes after it has taken place. We should have to make
corrections, according to our distance from the clock, in all our time
readings.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, inconvenient to have only one clock. Now, however,
as we know how to judge whether two, or more, clocks show the same time
simultaneously and run in the same way, we can very well imagine as many
clocks as we like in a given c.s. Each of them will help us to determine
the time of the events happening in its immediate vicinity. The clocks
are all at rest relative to the c.s. They are “good“ clocks and are
synchronized, which means that they show the same time
simultaneously.</p>
<p>There is nothing especially striking or strange about the arrangement
of our clocks. We are now using many synchronized clocks instead of only
one and can, therefore, easily judge whether or not two distant events
are simultaneous in a given c.s. They are if the synchronized clocks in
their vicinity show the same time at the instant the events happen. To
say that one of the distant events happens before the other has now a
definite meaning. All this can be judged by the help of the synchronized
clocks at rest in our c.s.</p>
<p>This is in agreement with classical physics, and not one
contradiction to the classical transformation has yet appeared.</p>
<p>For the definition of simultaneous events, the clocks are
synchronized by the help of signals. It is essential in our arrangement
that these signals travel with the velocity of light, the velocity which
plays such a fundamental role in the theory of relativity.</p>
<p>Since we wish to deal with the important problem of two c.s. moving
uniformly, relative to each other, we must consider two rods, each
provided with clocks. The observer in each of the two c.s. moving
relative to each other now has his own rod with his own set of clocks
rigidly attached.</p>
<p>When discussing measurements in classical mechanics, we used one
clock for all c.s. Here we have many clocks in each c.s. This difference
is unimportant. One clock was sufficient, but nobody could object to the
use of many, so long as they behave as decent synchronized clocks
should.</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>Now we are approaching the essential point showing where the
classical transformation contradicts the theory of relativity. What
happens when two sets of clocks are moving uniformly, relative to each
other? The classical physicist would answer: Nothing; they still have
the same rhythm, and we can use moving as well as resting clocks to
indicate time. According to classical physics, two events simultaneous
in one c.s. will also be simultaneous in any other c.s.</p>
<p>But this is not the only possible answer. We can equally well imagine
a moving clock having a different rhythm from one at rest. Let us now
discuss this possibility without deciding, for the moment, whether or
not clocks really change their rhythm in motion. What is meant by the
statement that a moving clock changes its rhythm? Let us assume, for the
sake of simplicity, that we have only one clock in the upper c.s. and
many in the lower. All the clocks have the same mechanism, and the lower
ones are synchronized, that is, they show the same time simultaneously.
We have drawn three subsequent positions of the two c.s. moving relative
to each other. In the first drawing the positions of the hands of the
upper and lower clocks are, by convention, the same because we arranged
them so. All the clocks show the same time. In the second drawing, we
see the relative positions of the two c.s. some time later. All the
clocks in the lower c.s. show the same time, but the clock in the upper
c.s. is out of rhythm. The rhythm is changed and the time differs
because the clock is moving relative to the lower c.s. In the third
drawing</p>
<p>FIELD, RELATIVITY</p>
<p>we see the difference in the positions of the hands in creased with
time.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>An observer at rest in the lower c.s. would find that a moving clock
changes its rhythm. Certainly the same result could be found if the
clock moved relative to an observer at rest in the upper c.s.; in this
case there would have to be many clocks in the upper c.s. and</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>only one in the lower. The laws of nature must be the same in both
c.s. moving relative to each other.</p>
<p>In classical mechanics it was tacitly assumed that a moving clock
does not change its rhythm. This seemed so obvious that it was hardly
worth mentioning. But nothing should be too obvious; if we wish to be
really careful, we should analyse the assumptions, so far taken for
granted, in physics.</p>
<p>An assumption should not be regarded as unreasonable simply because
it differs from that of classical physics. We can well imagine that a
moving clock changes its rhythm, so long as the law of this change is
the same for all inertial c.s.</p>
<p>Yet another example. Take a yardstick; this means that a stick is a
yard in length as long as it is at rest in a c.s. Now it moves
uniformly, sliding along the rod representing the c.s. Will its length
still appear to be one yard? We must know beforehand how to determine
its length. As long as the stick was at rest, its ends coincided with
markings one yard apart on the c.s. From this we concluded: the length
of the resting stick is one yard. How are we to measure this stick
during motion? It could be done as follows. At a given moment two
observers simultaneously take snapshots, one of the origin of the stick
and the other of the end. Since the pictures are taken simultaneously,
we can compare the marks on the c.s. rod with which the origin and the
end of the moving stick coincide. In this way we determine its length.
There must be two observers to take note of simultaneous events in
different parts of the</p>
<p>given c.s. There is no reason to believe that the result of such
measurements will be the same as in the case of a stick at rest. Since
the photographs had to be taken simultaneously, which is, as we already
know, a relative concept depending on the c.s., it seems quite possible
that the results of this measurement will be different in different c.s.
moving relative to each other.</p>
<p>We can well imagine that not only does the moving clock change its
rhythm, but also that a moving stick changes its length, so long as the
laws of the changes are the same for all inertial c.s.</p>
<p>We have only been discussing some new possibilities without giving
any justification for assuming them.</p>
<p>We remember: the velocity of light is the same in all inertial c.s.
It is impossible to reconcile this fact with the classical
transformation. The circle must be broken somewhere. Can it not be done
just here? Can we not assume such changes in the rhythm of the moving
clock and in the length of the moving rod that the constancy of the
velocity of light will follow directly from these assumptions? Indeed we
can! Here is the first instance in which the relativity theory and
classical physics differ radically. Our argument can be reversed: if the
velocity of light is the same in all c.s., then moving rods must change
their length, moving clocks must change their rhythm, and the laws
governing these changes are rigorously determined.</p>
<p>There is nothing mysterious or unreasonable in all this. In classical
physics it was always assumed that clocks in motion and at rest have the
same rhythm, that</p>
<p>7-2</p>
<p>rods in motion and at rest have the same length. If the velocity of
light is the same in all c.s., if the relativity theory is valid, then
we must sacrifice this assumption. It is difficult to get rid of
deep-rooted prejudices, but there is no other way. From the point of
view of the relativity theory the old concepts seem arbitrary. Why
believe, as we did some pages ago, in absolute time flowing in the same
way for all observers in all c.s.? Why believe in unchangeable distance?
Time is determined by clocks, space co-ordinates by rods, and the result
of their determination may depend on the behaviour of these clocks and
rods when in motion. There is no reason to believe that they will behave
in the way we should like them to. Observation shows, indirectly,
through the phenomena of electromagnetic field, that a moving clock
changes its rhythm, a rod its length, whereas on the basis of mechanical
phenomena we did not think this happened. We must accept the concept of
relative time in every c.s., because it is the best way out of our
difficulties. Further scientific advance, developing from the theory of
relativity, shows that this new aspect should not be regarded as a malum
necessarium, for the merits of the theory are much too marked.</p>
<p>So far we have tried to show what led to the fundamental assumptions
of the relativity theory, and how the theory forced us to revise and to
change the classical transformation by treating time and space in a new
way. Our aim is to indicate the ideas forming the basis of a new
physical and philosophical view. These ideas are simple; but in the form
in which they have been</p>
<p>formulated here, they are insufficient for arriving at not only
qualitative, but also quantitative conclusions. We must again use our
old method of explaining only the principal ideas and stating some of
the others without proof.</p>
<p>To make clear the difference between the view of the old physicist,
whom we shall call 0 and who believes in the classical transformation,
and that of the modern physicist, whom we shall call M and who knows the
relativity theory, we shall imagine a dialogue between them.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>I believe in the Galilean relativity principle in mechanics, because
I know that the laws of mechanics are the same in two c.s. moving
uniformly relative to each other, or in other words, that these laws are
invariant with respect to the classical transformation.</li>
</ol>
<p>M. But the relativity principle must apply to all events in our
external world. Not only the laws of mechanics but all laws of nature
must be the same in c.s. moving uniformly, relative to each other.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>But how can all laws of nature possibly be the same in c.s. moving
relative to each other? The field equations, that is, Maxwell’s
equations, are not invariant with respect to the classical
transformation. This is clearly shown by the example of the velocity of
light. According to the classical transformation, this velocity should
not be the same in two c.s. moving relative to each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>M. This merely shows that the classical transformation cannot be
applied, that the connection between</p>
<p>two c.s. must be different; that we may not connect co-ordinates and
velocities as is done in these transformation laws. We have to
substitute new laws and deduce them from the fundamental assumptions of
the theory of relativity. Let us not bother about the mathematical
expression for this new transformation law, and be satisfied that it is
different from the classical. We shall call it briefly the Lorentz
transformation. It can be shown that Maxwell’s equations, that is, the
laws of field, are invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation,
just as the laws of mechanics are invariant with respect to the
classical transformation. Remember how it was in classical physics. We
had transformation laws for co-ordinates, transformation laws for
velocities, but the laws of mechanics were the same for two c.s. moving
uniformly, relative to each other. We had transformation laws for space,
but not for time, because time was the same in all c.s. Here, however,
in the relativity theory, it is different. We have transformation laws
different from the classical for space, time, and velocity. But again
the laws of nature must be the same in all c.s. moving uniformly,
relative to each other. The laws of nature must be invariant, not, as
before, with respect to the classical transformation, but with respect
to a new type of transformation, the so-called Lorentz transformation.
In all inertial c.s. the same laws are valid and the transition from one
c.s. to another is given by the Lorentz transformation.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>I take your word for it, but it would interest me</li>
</ol>
<p>FIELD, RELATIVITY</p>
<p>to know the difference between the classical and Lorentz
transformations.</p>
<p>M. Your question is best answered in the following way. Quote some of
the characteristic features of the classical transformation and I shall
try to explain whether or not they are preserved in the Lorentz
transformation, and if not, how they are changed.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>If something happens at some point at some time in my c.s., then the
observer in another c.s. moving uniformly, relative to mine, assigns a
different number to the position in which this event occurs, but of
course the same time. We use the same clock in all our c.s. and it is
immaterial whether or not the clock moves. Is this also true for
you?</li>
</ol>
<p>M. No, it is not. Every c.s. must be equipped with its own clocks at
rest, since motion changes the rhythm. Two observers in two different
c.s. will assign not only different numbers to the position, but also
different numbers to the time at which this event happens.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>This means that the time is no longer an invariant. In the classical
transformation it is always the same time in all c.s. In the Lorentz
transformation it changes and somehow behaves like the co-ordinate in
the old transformation. I wonder how it is with distance? According to
classical mechanics a rigid rod preserves its length in motion or at
rest. Is this also true now?</li>
</ol>
<p>M. It is not. In fact, it follows from the Lorentz transformation
that a moving stick contracts in the direction of the motion and the
contraction increases if the speed increases. The faster a stick moves,
the shorter</p>
<p>it appears. But this occurs only in the direction of the motion. You
see in my drawing a moving rod which shrinks to half its length, when it
moves with a velocity approaching ca. 90 per cent of the velocity of
light. There is no contraction, however, in the direction perpendicular
to the motion, as I have tried to illustrate in my drawing.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>This means that the rhythm of a moving clock and the length of a
moving stick depend on the speed. But how?</li>
</ol>
<p>M. The changes become more distinct as the speed increases. It
follows from the Lorentz transformation that a stick would shrink to
nothing if its speed were to</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>l</p>
<p>reach that of light. Similarly the rhythm of a moving clock is slowed
down, compared to the clocks it passes along the rod, and would come to
a stop if the clock were to move with the speed of light, that is, if
the clock is a “good“ one.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>This seems to contradict all our experience. We know that a car does
not become shorter when in motion and we also know that the driver can
always compare his “good“ watch with those he passes on the way, finding
that they agree fairly well, contrary to your statement.</li>
</ol>
<p>M. This is certainly true. But these mechanical velocities are all
very small compared to that of light, and it is, therefore, ridiculous
to apply relativity to these phenomena. Every car driver can safely
apply classical physics even if he increases his speed a hundred
thousand times. We could only expect disagreement between experiment and
the classical transformation with velocities approaching that of light.
Only with very great velocities can the validity of the Lorentz
transformation be tested.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>But there is yet another difficulty. According to mechanics I can
imagine bodies with velocities even greater than that of light. A body
moving with the velocity of light relative to a floating ship moves with
a velocity greater than that of light relative to the shore. What will
happen to the stick which shrank to nothing when its velocity was that
of light? We can hardly expect a negative length if the velocity is
greater than that of light.</li>
</ol>
<p>M. There is really no reason for such sarcasm! From the point of view
of the relativity theory a material body cannot have a velocity greater
than that of light. The velocity of light forms the upper limit of
velocities for all material bodies. If the speed of a body is equal to
that of light relative to a ship, then it will also be equal to that of
light relative to the shore. The simple mechanical law of adding and
subtracting velocities is no longer valid or, more precisely, is only
approximately valid for small velocities, but not for those near the
velocity of light. The number expressing the velocity of light appears
explicitly in the Lorentz transformation, and plays the role of a
limiting case, like the infinite velocity in classical mechanics. This
more general theory does not contradict the classical transformation and
classical mechanics. On the contrary, we regain the old concepts as a
limiting case when the velocities are small. From the point of view of
the new theory it is clear in which cases classical physics is valid and
wherein its limitations lie. It would be just as ridiculous to apply the
theory of relativity to the motion of cars, ships, and trains as to use
a calculating machine where a multiplication table would be
sufficient.</p>
<p>RELATIVITY AND MECHANICS</p>
<p>The relativity theory arose from necessity, from serious and deep
contradictions in the old theory from which there seemed no escape. The
strength of the new theory lies in the consistency and simplicity with
which it</p>
<p>solves all these difficulties, using only a few very convincing
assumptions.</p>
<p>Although the theory arose from the field problem, it has to embrace
all physical laws. A difficulty seems to appear here. The field laws on
the one hand and the mechanical laws on the other are of quite different
kinds. The equations of electromagnetic field are invariant with respect
to the Lorentz transformation and the mechanical equations are invariant
with respect to the classical transformation. But the relativity theory
claims that all laws of nature must be invariant with respect to the
Lorentz and not to the classical transformation. The latter is only a
special, limiting case of the Lorentz transformation when the relative
velocities of two c.s. are very small. If this is so, classical
mechanics must change in order to conform with the demand of invariance
with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Or, in other words,
classical mechanics cannot be valid if the velocities approach that of
light. Only one transformation from one c.s. to another can exist,
namely, the Lorentz transformation.</p>
<p>It was simple to change classical mechanics in such a way that it
contradicted neither the relativity theory nor the wealth of material
obtained by observation and explained by classical mechanics. The old
mechanics is valid for small velocities and forms the limiting case of
the new one.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to consider some instance of a change in
classical mechanics introduced by the relativity theory. This might,
perhaps, lead us to some</p>
<p>conclusions which could be proved or disproved by experiment.</p>
<p>Let us assume a body, having a definite mass, moving along a straight
line, and acted upon by an external force in the direction of the
motion. The force, as we know, is proportional to the change of
velocity. Or, to be more explicit, it does not matter whether a given
body increases its velocity in one second from 100 to 101 feet per
second, or from 100 miles to 100 miles and one foot per second or from
180,000 miles to 180,000 miles and one foot per second. The force acting
upon a particular body is always the same for the same change of
velocity in the same time.</p>
<p>Is this sentence true from the point of view of the relativity
theory? By no means ! This law is valid only for small velocities. What,
according to the relativity theory, is the law for great velocities,
approaching that of light? If the velocity is great, extremely strong
forces are required to increase it. It is not at all the same thing to
increase by one foot per second a velocity of about 100 feet per second
or a velocity approaching that of light. The nearer a velocity is to
that of light the more difficult it is to increase. When a velocity is
equal to that of light it is impossible to increase it further. Thus,
the changes brought about by the relativity theory are not surprising.
The velocity of light is the upper limit for all velocities. No finite
force, no matter how great, can cause an increase in speed beyond this
limit. In place of the old mechanical law connecting force and change of
velocity, a more</p>
<p>complicated one appears. From our new point of view classical
mechanics is simple because in nearly all observations we deal with
velocities much smaller than that of light.</p>
<p>A body at rest has a definite mass, called the rest mass. We know
from mechanics that every body resists a change in its motion; the
greater the mass, the stronger the resistance, and the weaker the mass,
the weaker the resistance. But in the relativity theory, we have
something more. Not only does a body resist a change more strongly if
the rest mass is greater, but also if its velocity is greater. Bodies
with velocities approaching that of light would offer a very strong
resistance to external forces. In classical mechanics the resistance of
a given body was something unchangeable, characterized by its mass
alone. In the relativity theory it depends on both rest mass and
velocity. The resistance becomes infinitely great as the velocity
approaches that of light.</p>
<p>The results just quoted enable us to put the theory to the test of
experiment. Do projectiles with a velocity approaching that of light
resist the action of an external force as predicted by the theory? Since
the statements of the relativity theory have, in this respect, a
quantitative character, we could confirm or disprove the theory if we
could realize projectiles having a speed approaching that of light.</p>
<p>Indeed, we find in nature projectiles with such velocities. Atoms of
radioactive matter, radium for instance, act as batteries which fire
projectiles with enormous velocities. Without going into detail we can
quote only</p>
<p>one of the very important views of modern physics and chemistry. All
matter in the universe is made up of elementary particles of only a few
kinds. It is like seeing in one town buildings of different sizes,
construction and architecture, but from shack to skyscraper only very
few different kinds of bricks were used, the same in all the buildings.
So all known elements of our material world—from hydrogen the lightest,
to uranium the heaviest—are built of the same kinds of bricks, that is,
the same kinds of elementary particles. The heaviest elements, the most
complicated buildings, are unstable and they disintegrate or, as we say,
are radioactive. Some of the bricks, that is, the elementary particles
of which the radioactive atoms are constructed, are sometimes thrown out
with a very great velocity, approaching that of light. An atom of an
element, say radium, according to our present views, confirmed by
numerous experiments, is a complicated structure, and radioactive
disintegration is one of those phenomena in which the composition of
atoms from still simpler bricks, the elementary particles, is
revealed.</p>
<p>By very ingenious and intricate experiments we can find out how the
particles resist the action of an external force. The experiments show
that the resistance offered by these particles depends on the velocity,
in the way foreseen by the theory of relativity. In many other cases,
where the dependence of the resistance upon the velocity could be
detected, there was complete agreement between theory and experiment. We
see once</p>
<p>more the essential features of creative work in science: prediction
of certain facts by theory and their confirmation by experiment.</p>
<p>This result suggests a further important generalization. A body at
rest has mass but no kinetic energy, that is, energy of motion. A moving
body has both mass and kinetic energy. It resists change of velocity
more strongly than the resting body. It seems as though the kinetic
energy of the moving body increases its resistance. If two bodies have
the same rest mass, the one with the greater kinetic energy resists the
action of an external force more strongly.</p>
<p>Imagine a box containing balls, with the box as well as the balls at
rest in our c.s. To move it, to increase its velocity, some force is
required. But will the same force increase the velocity by the same
amount in the same time with the balls moving about quickly and in all
directions inside the box, like the molecules of a gas, with an average
speed approaching that of light? A greater force will now be necessary
because of the increased kinetic energy of the balls, strengthening the
resistance of the box. Energy, at any rate kinetic energy, resists
motion in the same way as ponderable masses. Is this also true of all
kinds of energy?</p>
<p>The theory of relativity deduces, from its fundamental assumption, a
clear and convincing answer to this question, an answer again of a
quantitative character: all energy resists change of motion; all energy
behaves like matter; a piece of iron weighs more when red-hot than when
cool; radiation travelling through</p>
<p>space and emitted from the sun contains energy and therefore has
mass; the sun and all radiating stars lose mass by emitting radiation.
This conclusion, quite general in character, is an important achievement
of the theory of relativity and fits all facts upon which it has been
tested.</p>
<p>Classical physics introduced two substances: matter and energy. The
first had weight, but the second was weightless. In classical physics we
had two conservation laws: one for matter, the other for energy. We have
already asked whether modern physics still holds this view of two
substances and the two conservation laws. The answer is: “No“. According
to the theory of relativity, there is no essential distinction between
mass and energy. Energy has mass and mass represents energy. Instead of
two conservation laws we have only one, that of mass-energy. This new
view proved very successful and fruitful in the further development of
physics.</p>
<p>How is it that this fact of energy having mass and mass representing
energy remained for so long obscured? Is the weight of a piece of hot
iron greater than that of a cold piece? The answer to this question is
now “Yes“, but on p. 43 it was “No“. The pages between these two answers
are certainly not sufficient to cover this contradiction.</p>
<p>The difficulty confronting us here is of the same kind as we have met
before. The variation of mass predicted by the theory of relativity is
immeasurably small and cannot be detected by direct weighing on even the
most</p>
<p>sensitive scales. The proof that energy is not weightless can be
gained in many very conclusive, but indirect, ways.</p>
<p>The reason for this lack of immediate evidence is the very small rate
of exchange between matter and energy. Compared to mass, energy is like
a depreciated currency compared to one of high value. An example will
make this clear. The quantity of heat able to convert thirty thousand
tons of water into steam would weigh about one gram! Energy was regarded
as weightless for so long simply because the mass which it represents is
so small.</p>
<p>The old energy-substance is the second victim of the theory of
relativity. The first was the medium through which light waves were
propagated.</p>
<p>The influence of the theory of relativity goes far beyond the problem
from which it arose. It removes the difficulties and contradictions of
the field theory; it formulates more general mechanical laws; it
replaces two conservation laws by one; it changes our classical concept
of absolute time. Its validity is not restricted to one domain of
physics; it forms a general framework embracing all phenomena of
nature.</p>
<p>THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM</p>
<p>“The French revolution began in Paris on the 1/j.th of July 1789.“ In
this sentence the place and time of an event are stated. Hearing this
statement for the first time, one who does not know what “ Paris“ means
could be taught: it is a city on our earth situated in long. 2°</p>
<p>East and lat. 49° North. The two numbers would then characterize the
place, and “i4th of July 1789“ the time, at which the event took place.
In physics, much more than in history, the exact characterization of
when and where an event takes place is very important, because these
data form the basis for a quantitative description.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we considered previously only motion
along a straight line. A rigid rod with an origin but no end-point was
our c.s. Let us keep this restriction. Take different points on the rod;
their positions can be characterized by one number only, by the
co-ordinate of the point. To say the co-ordinate of a point is 7<em>586
feet means that its distance is 7</em>586 feet from the origin of the
rod. If, on the contrary, someone gives me any number and a unit, I can
always find a point on the rod corresponding to this number. We can
state: a definite point on the rod corresponds to every number, and a
definite number corresponds to every point. This fact is expressed by
mathematicians in the following sentence: all points on the rod form a
one-dimensional continuum. There exists a point arbitrarily near every
point on the rod. We can connect two distant points on the rod by steps
as small as we wish. Thus the arbitrary smallness of the steps
connecting distant points is characteristic of the continuum.</p>
<p>Now another example. We have a plane, or, if you prefer something
more concrete, the surface of a rectangular table. The position of a
point on this table</p>
<p>can be characterized by two numbers and not, as before, by one. The
two numbers are the distances from two perpendicular edges of the table.
Not one number, but a pair of numbers corresponds to every point on the
plane; a definite point corresponds to every pair of numbers. In other
words: the plane is a two-dimensional continuum. There exist points
arbitrarily near every point on the plane. Two distant points can be
connected by a curve divided into steps as small as we wish. Thus</p>
<p>the arbitrary smallness of the steps connecting two distant points,
each of which can be represented by two numbers, is again characteristic
of a two-dimensional continuum.</p>
<p>One more example. Imagine that you wish to regard your room as your
c.s. This means that you want to describe all positions with respect to
the rigid walls of the room. The position of the end-point of the lamp,
if the lamp is at rest, can be described by three numbers: two of them
determine the distance from two perpendicular walls, and the third that
from the floor or ceiling. Three definite numbers correspond to every
point of the space; a definite point in space</p>
<p>corresponds to every three numbers. This is expressed by the
sentence: Our space is a three-dimensional continuum. There exist points
very near every point of the space. Again the arbitrary smallness of the
steps connecting the distant points, each of them represented by three
numbers, is characteristic of a three-dimensional continuum.</p>
<p>But all this is scarcely physics. To return to physics, the motion of
material particles must be considered. To observe and predict events in
nature we must consider not only the place but also the time of physical
happenings. Let us again take a very simple example.</p>
<p>A small stone, which can be regarded as a particle, is dropped from a
tower. Imagine the tower 256 feet high. Since Galileo’s time we have
been able to predict the co-ordinate of the stone at any arbitrary
instant after it was dropped. Here is a “timetable“ describing the
positions of the stone after o, 1,2, 3, and 4 seconds.</p>
<p>FIELD, RELATIVITY</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>Five events are registered in our “timetable“, each represented by
two numbers, the time and space coordinates of each event. The first
event is the dropping of the stone from 256 feet above the ground at the
zero second. The second event is the coincidence of the stone with our
rigid rod (the tower) at 240 feet above the ground. This happens after
the first second. The last event is the coincidence of the stone with
the earth.</p>
<p>We could represent the knowledge gained from our “timetable“ in a
different way. We could represent the five pairs of numbers in the “
timetable“ as five points on a surface. Let us first establish a scale.
One segment will correspond to a foot and another to a second. For
example:</p>
<p>100 Ft.</p>
<p>Jandandandandc.</p>
<p>We then draw two perpendicular lines, calling the horizontal one,
say, the time axis and the vertical one the space axis. We see
immediately that our “timetable“ can be represented by five points in
our time-space plane.</p>
<p>The distances of the points from the space axis represent the time
co-ordinates as registered in the first column of our “timetable“, and
the distances from the time axis their space co-ordinates.</p>
<p>Feet</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>•100</p>
<p>2 5 4</p>
<p>Time axis</p>
<p>’Seconds</p>
<p>Exactly the same thing is expressed in two different ways: by the
“timetable 5 ’ and by the points on the plane. Each can be constructed
from the other. The choice between these two representations is merely a
matter of taste, for they are, in fact, equivalent.</p>
<p>Let us now go one step farther. Imagine a better c ’timetable“ giving
the positions not for every second, but for, say, every hundredth or
thousandth of a second. We shall then have very many points on our
time-space plane. Finally, if the position is given for every instant
or, as the mathematicians say, if the space co-ordinate</p>
<p>is given as a function of time, then our set of points becomes a
continuous line. Our next drawing therefore represents not just a
fragment as before, but a complete knowledge of the motion.</p>
<p>Feet</p>
<p>Seconds</p>
<p>Time axis</p>
<p>The motion along the rigid rod (the tower), the motion in a
one-dimensional space, is here represented as a curve in a
two-dimensional time-space continuum. To every point in our time-space
continuum there corresponds a pair of numbers, one of which denotes the
time, and the other the space, co-ordinate. Conversely: a definite point
in our time-space plane corresponds to every pair of numbers
characterizing an event. Two adjacent points represent two events, two
happenings, at slightly different places and at slightly different
instants.</p>
<p>You could argue against our representation thus:</p>
<p>there is little sense in representing a unit of time by a segment, in
combining it mechanically with the space, forming the two-dimensional
continuum from the two one-dimensional continua. But you would then have
to protest just as strongly against all the graphs representing, for
example, the change of temperature in New York City during last summer,
or against those representing the changes in the cost of living during
the last few years, since the very same method is used in each of these
cases. In the temperature graphs the one-dimensional temperature
continuum is combined with the one-dimensional time continuum into the
two-dimensional temperature-time continuum.</p>
<p>Let us return to the particle dropped from a 256-foot tower. Our
graphic picture of motion is a useful convention since it characterizes
the position of the particle at an arbitrary instant. Knowing how the
particle moves, we should like to picture its motion once more. We can
do this in two different ways.</p>
<p>We remember the picture of the particle changing its position with
time in the one-dimensional space. We picture the motion as a sequence
of events in the one-dimensional space continuum. We do not mix time and
space, using a dynamic picture in which positions change with time.</p>
<p>But we can picture the same motion in a different way. We can form a
static picture, considering the curve in the two-dimensional time-space
continuum. Now the motion is represented as something which is, which
exists in the two-dimensional tim^space continuum,</p>
<p>and not as something which changes in the one-dimensional space
continuum.</p>
<p>Both these pictures are exactly equivalent, and preferring one to the
other is merely a matter of convention and taste.</p>
<p>Nothing that has been said here about the two pictures of the motion
has anything whatever to do with the relativity theory. Both
representations can be used with equal right, though classical physics
favoured rather the dynamic picture describing motion as happenings in
space and not as existing in time-space. But the relativity theory
changes this view. It was distinctly in favour of the static picture and
found in this representation of motion as something existing in
time-space a more convenient and more objective picture of reality. We
still have to answer the question: why are these two pictures,
equivalent from the point of view of classical physics, not equivalent
from the point of view of the relativity theory?</p>
<p>The answer will be understood if two c.s. moving uniformly, relative
to each other, are again taken into account.</p>
<p>According to classical physics, observers in two c.s. moving
uniformly, relative to each other, will assign different space
co-ordinates, but the same time coordinate, to a certain event. Thus in
our example, the coincidence of the particle with the earth is
characterized in our chosen c.s. by the time co-ordinate “4“ and by the
space co-ordinate “o“. According to classical mechanics, the stone will
still reach the earth after</p>
<p>four seconds for an observer moving uniformly, relative to the chosen
c.s. But this observer will refer the distance to his c.s. and will, in
general, connect different space co-ordinates with the event of
collision, although the time co-ordinate will be the same for him and
for all other observers moving uniformly, relative to each other.
Classical physics knows only an “absolute“ time flow for all observers.
For every c.s. the two-dimensional continuum can be split into two
one-dimensional con-tinua: time and space. Because of the “absolute“
character of time, the transition from the “static“ to the “dynamic“
picture of motion has an objective meaning in classical physics.</p>
<p>But we have already allowed ourselves to be convinced that the
classical transformation must not be used in physics generally. From a
practical point of view it is still good for small velocities, but not
for settling fundamental physical questions.</p>
<p>According to the relativity theory the time of the collision of the
stone with the earth will not be the same for all observers. The time
co-ordinate and the space co-ordinate will be different in two c.s., and
the change in the time co-ordinate will be quite distinct if the
relative velocity is close to that of light. The two-dimensional
continuum cannot be split into two one-dimensional continua as in
classical physics. We must not consider space and time separately in
determining the time-space co-ordinates in another c.s. The splitting of
the two-dimensional continuum into two one-dimensional ones seems, from
the point of view</p>
<p>of the relativity theory, to be an arbitrary procedure without
objective meaning.</p>
<p>It will be simple to generalize all that we have just said for the
case of motion not restricted to a straight line. Indeed, not two, but
four, numbers must be used to describe events in nature. Our physical
space as conceived through objects and their motion has three
dimensions, and positions are characterized by three numbers. The
instant of an event is the fourth number. Four definite numbers
correspond to every event; a definite event corresponds to any four
numbers. Therefore: The world of events forms a four-dimensional
continuum. There is nothing mysterious about this, and the last sentence
is equally true for classical physics and the relativity theory. Again,
a difference is revealed when two c.s. moving relatively to each other
are considered. The room is moving, and the observers inside and outside
determine the time-space co-ordinates of the same events. Again, the
classical physicist splits the four-dimensional continua into the
three-dimensional spaces and the one-dimensional time-continuum. The old
physicist bothers only about space transformation, as time is absolute
for him. He finds the splitting of the four-dimensional world-continua
into space and time natural and convenient. But from the point of view
of the relativity theory, time as well as space is changed by passing
from one c.s. to another, and the Lorentz transformation considers the
transformation properties of the four-dimensional time-space continuum
of our four-dimensional world of events.</p>
<p>The world of events can be described dynamically by a picture
changing in time and thrown on to the background of the
three-dimensional space. But it can also be described by a static
picture thrown on to the background of a four-dimensional time-space
continuum. From the point of view of classical physics the two pictures,
the dynamic and the static, are equivalent. But from the point of view
of the relativity theory the static picture is the more convenient and
the more objective.</p>
<p>Even in the relativity theory we can still use the dynamic picture if
we prefer it. But we must remember that this division into time and
space has no objective meaning since time is no longer “absolute“. We
shall still use the “dynamic“ and not the “static“ language in the
following pages, bearing in mind its limitations.</p>
<p>GENERAL RELATIVITY</p>
<p>There still remains one point to be cleared up. One of the most
fundamental questions has not been settled as yet: does an inertial
system exist? We have learned something about the laws of nature, their
invariance with respect to the Lorentz transformation, and their
validity for all inertial systems moving uniformly, relative to each
other. We have the laws but do not know the frame to which to refer
them.</p>
<p>In order to be more aware of this difficulty, let us interview the
classical physicist and ask him some simple questions:</p>
<p>“What is an inertial system? 5 ’</p>
<p>“ It is a c.s. in which the laws of mechanics are valid. A body on
which no external forces are acting moves uniformly in such a c.s. This
property thus enables us to distinguish an inertial c.s. from any
other.“</p>
<p>“But what does it mean to say that no forces are acting on a
body?“</p>
<p>“It simply means that the body moves uniformly in an inertial
c.s.“</p>
<p>Here we could once more put the question: “What is an inertial c.s.?“
But since there is little hope of obtaining an answer differing from the
above, let us try to gain some concrete information by changing the
question:</p>
<p>“Is a c.s. rigidly connected with the earth an inertial one?“</p>
<p>“No, because the laws of mechanics are not rigorously valid on the
earth, due to its rotation. A c.s. rigidly connected with the sun can be
regarded for many problems as an inertial c.s.; but when we speak of the
rotating sun, we again understand that a c.s. connected with it cannot
be regarded as strictly inertial.“</p>
<p>“Then what, concretely, is your inertial c.s., and how is its state
of motion to be chosen?“</p>
<p>“It is merely a useful fiction and I have no idea how to realize it.
If I could only get far away from all material bodies and free myself
from all external influences, my c.s. would then be inertial.“</p>
<p>“But what do you mean by a c.s. free from all external
influences?“</p>
<p>“I mean that the c.s. is inertial.“</p>
<p>Once more we are back at our initial question!</p>
<p>Our interview reveals a grave difficulty in classical physics. We
have laws, but do not know what frame to refer them to, and our whole
physical structure seems to be built on sand.</p>
<p>We can approach this same difficulty from a different point of view.
Try to imagine that there is only one body, forming our c.s., in the
entire universe. This body begins to rotate. According to classical
mechanics, the physical laws for a rotating body are different from
those for a non-rotating body. If the inertial principle is valid in one
case, it is not valid in the other. But all this sounds very suspicious.
Is it permissible to consider the motion of only one body in the entire
universe? By the motion of a body we always mean its change of position
in relation to a second body. It is, therefore, contrary to common sense
to speak about the motion of only one body. Classical mechanics and
common sense disagree violently on this point. Newton’s recipe is: if
the inertial principle is valid, then the c.s. is either at rest or in
uniform motion. If the inertial principle is invalid, then the body is
in non-uniform motion. Thus, our verdict of motion or rest depends upon
whether or not all the physical laws are applicable to a given c.s.</p>
<p>Take two bodies, the sun and the earth, for instance. The motion we
observe is again relative. It can be described by connecting the c.s.
with either the earth or the sun. From this point of view, Copernicus’
great</p>
<p>achievement lies in transferring the c.s. from the earth to the sun.
But as motion is relative and any frame of reference can be used, there
seems to be no reason for favouring one c.s. rather than the other.</p>
<p>Physics again intervenes and changes our common-sense point of view.
The c.s. connected with the sun resembles an inertial system more than
that connected with the earth. The physical laws should be applied to
Copernicus’ c.s. rather than to Ptolemy’s. The greatness of Copernicus’
discovery can be appreciated only from the physical point of view. It
illustrates the great advantage of using a c.s. connected rigidly with
the sun for describing the motion of planets.</p>
<p>No absolute uniform motion exists in classical physics. If two c.s.
are moving uniformly, relative to each other, then there is no sense in
saying, “This c.s. is at rest and the other is moving“. But if two c.s.
are moving non-uniformly, relative to each other, then there is very
good reason for saying, “This body moves and the other is at rest (or
moves uniformly)“. Absolute motion has here a very definite meaning.
There is, at this point, a wide gulf between common sense and classical
physics. The difficulties mentioned, that of an inertial system and that
of absolute motion, are strictly connected with each other. Absolute
motion is made possible only by the idea of an inertial system, for
which the laws of nature are valid.</p>
<p>It may seem as though there is no way out of these difficulties, as
though no physical theory can avoid them. Their root lies in the
validity of the laws of nature</p>
<p>for a special class of c.s. only, the inertial. The possibility of
solving these difficulties depends on the answer to the following
question. Can we formulate physical laws so that they are valid for all
c.s., not only those moving uniformly, but also those moving quite
arbitrarily, relative to each other? If this can be done, our
difficulties will be over. We shall then be able to apply the laws of
nature to any c.s. The struggle, so violent in the early days of
science, between the views of Ptolemy and Copernicus would then be quite
meaningless. Either c.s. could be used with equal justification. The two
sentences, u the sun is at rest and the earth moves“, or “the sun moves
and the earth is at rest“, would simply mean two different conventions
concerning two different c.s.</p>
<p>Could we build a real relativistic physics valid in all c.s.; a
physics in which there would be no place for absolute, but only for
relative, motion? This is indeed possible!</p>
<p>We have at least one indication, though a very weak one, of how to
build the new physics. Really relativistic physics must apply to all
c.s. and, therefore, also to the special case of the inertial c.s. We
already know the laws for this inertial c.s. The new general laws valid
for all c.s. must, in the special case of the inertial system, reduce to
the old, known laws.</p>
<p>The problem of formulating physical laws for every c.s. was solved by
the so-called general relativity theory  the previous theory, applying
only to inertial systems, is called the special relativity theory. The
two theories</p>
<p>cannot, of course, contradict each other, since we must always
include the old laws of the special relativity theory in the general
laws for an inertial system. But just as the inertial c.s. was
previously the only one for which physical laws were formulated, so now
it will form the special limiting case, as all c.s. moving arbitrarily,
relative to each other, are permissible.</p>
<p>This is the programme for the general theory of relativity. But in
sketching the way in which it was accomplished we must be even vaguer
than we have been so far. New difficulties arising in the development of
science force our theory to become more and more abstract. Unexpected
adventures still await us. But our final aim is always a better
understanding of reality. Links are added to the chain of logic
connecting theory and observation. To clear the way leading from theory
to experiment of unnecessary and artificial assumptions, to embrace an
ever-wider region of facts, we must make the chain longer and longer.
The simpler and more fundamental our assumptions become, the more
intricate is our mathematical tool of reasoning; the way from theory to
observation becomes longer, more subtle, and more complicated. Although
it sounds paradoxical, we could say: Modern physics is simpler than the
old physics and seems, therefore, more difficult and intricate. The
simpler our picture of the external world and the more facts it
embraces, the more strongly it reflects in our minds the harmony of the
universe.</p>
<p>Our new idea is simple: to build a physics valid for</p>
<p>all c.s. Its fulfilment brings formal complications and forces us to
use mathematical tools different from those so far employed in physics.
We shall show here only the connection between the fulfilment of this
programme and two principal problems: gravitation and geometry.</p>
<p>OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE LIFT</p>
<p>The law of inertia marks the first great advance in physics; in fact,
its real beginning. It was gained by the contemplation of an idealized
experiment, a body moving forever with no friction nor any other
external forces acting. From this example, and later from many others,
we recognized the importance of the idealized experiment created by
thought. Here again, idealized experiments will be discussed. Although
these may sound very fantastic, they will, nevertheless, help us to
understand as much about relativity as is possible by our simple
methods.</p>
<p>We had previously the idealized experiments with a uniformly moving
room. Here, for a change, we shall have a falling lift.</p>
<p>Imagine a great lift at the top of a skyscraper much higher than any
real one. Suddenly the cable supporting the lift breaks, and the lift
falls freely toward the ground. Observers in the lift are performing
experiments during the fall. In describing them, we need not bother
about air resistance or friction, for we may disregard their existence
under our idealized conditions. One of the observers takes a
handkerchief and a watch from his pocket and drops</p>
<p>them. What happens to these two bodies? For the outside observer, who
is looking through the window of the lift, both handkerchief and watch
fall toward the ground in exactly the same way, with the same
acceleration. We remember that the acceleration of a falling body is
quite independent of its mass and that it was this fact which revealed
the equality of gravitational and inertial mass (p. 37). We also
remember that the equality of the two masses, gravitational and
inertial, was quite accidental from the point of view of classical
mechanics and played no role in its structure. Here, however, this
equality reflected in the equal acceleration of all falling bodies is
essential and forms the basis of our whole argument.</p>
<p>Let us return to ofalling handkerchief and watch; for the outside
observer they are both falling with the same acceleration. But so is the
lift, with its walls, ceiling, and floor. Therefore: the distance
between the two bodies and the floor will not change. For the inside
observer the two bodies remain exactly where they were when he let them
go. The inside observer may ignore the gravitational field, since its
source lies outside his c.s. He finds that no forces inside the lift act
upon the two bodies, and so they are at rest, just as if they were in an
inertial c.s. Strange things happen in the lift! If the observer pushes
a body in any direction, up or down for instance, it always moves
uniformly so long as it does not collide with the ceiling or the floor
of the lift. Briefly speaking, the laws of classical mechanics are valid
for the observer</p>
<p>8-2</p>
<p>inside the lift. All bodies behave in the way expected by the law of
inertia. Our new c.s. rigidly connected with the freely falling lift
differs from the inertial c.s. in only one respect. In an inertial c.s.,
a moving body on which no forces are acting will move uniformly for
ever. The inertial c.s. as represented in classical physics is neither
limited in space nor time. The case of the observer in our lift is,
however, different. The inertial character of his c.s. is limited in
space and time. Sooner or later the uniformly moving body will collide
with the wall of the lift, destroying the uniform motion. Sooner or
later the whole lift will collide with the earth, destroying the
observers and their experiments. The c.s. is only a “pocket edition“ of
a real inertial c.s.</p>
<p>This local character of the c.s. is quite essential. If our imaginary
lift were to reach from the North Pole to the Equator, with the
handkerchief placed over the North Pole and the watch over the Equator,
then, for the outside observer, the two bodies would not have the same
acceleration; they would not be at rest relative to each other. Our
whole argument would fail! The dimensions of the lift must be limited so
that the equality of acceleration of all bodies relative to the outside
observer may be assumed.</p>
<p>With this restriction, the c.s. takes on an inertial character for
the inside observer. We can at least indicate a c.s. in which all the
physical laws are valid, even though it is limited in time and space. If
we imagine another c.s., another lift moving uniformly, relative to</p>
<p>the one falling freely, then both these c.s. will be locally
inertial. All laws are exactly the same in both. The transition from one
to the other is given by the Lorentz transformation.</p>
<p>Let us see in what way both the observers, outside and inside,
describe what takes place in the lift.</p>
<p>The outside observer notices the motion of the lift and of all bodies
in the lift, and finds them in agreement with Newton’s gravitational
law. For him, the motion is not uniform, but accelerated, because of the
action of the gravitational field of the earth.</p>
<p>However, a generation of physicists born and brought up in the lift
would reason quite differently. They would believe themselves in
possession of an inertial system and would refer all laws of nature to
their lift, stating with justification that the laws take on a specially
simple form in their c.s. It would be natural for them to assume their
lift at rest and their c.s. the inertial one.</p>
<p>It is impossible to settle the differences between the outside and
the inside observers. Each of them could claim the right to refer all
events to his c.s. Both descriptions of events could be made equally
consistent.</p>
<p>We see from this example that a consistent description of physical
phenomena in two different c.s. is possible, even if they are not moving
uniformly, relative to each other. But for such a description we must
take into account gravitation, building, so to speak, the “bridge“ which
effects a transition from one c.s. to the other.</p>
<p>The gravitational field exists for the outside observer; it does not
for the inside observer. Accelerated motion of the lift in the
gravitational field exists for the outside observer, rest and absence of
the gravitational field for the inside observer. But the “bridge“, the
gravitational field, making the description in both c.s. possible, rests
on one very important pillar: the equivalence of gravitational and
inertial mass. Without this clue, unnoticed in classical mechanics, our
present argument would fail completely.</p>
<p>Now for a somewhat different idealized experiment. There is, let us
assume, an inertial c.s., in which the law of inertia is valid. We have
already described</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>what happens in a lift resting in such an inertial c.s. But we now
change our picture. Someone outside has fastened a rope to the lift and
is pulling, with a constant force, in the direction indicated in our
draw-</p>
<p>ing. It is immaterial how this is done. Since the laws of mechanics
are valid in this c.s., the whole lift moves with a constant
acceleration in the direction of the motion. Again we shall listen to
the explanation of phenomena going on in the lift and given by both the
outside and inside observers.</p>
<p>The outside observer: My c.s. is an inertial one. The lift moves with
constant acceleration, because a constant force is acting. The observers
inside are in absolute motion, for them the laws of mechanics are
invalid. They do not find that bodies, on which no forces are acting,
are at rest. If a body is left free, it soon collides with the floor of
the lift, since the floor moves upward toward the body. This happens
exactly in the same way for a watch and for a handkerchief. It seems
very strange to me that the observer inside the lift must always be on
the “floor“, because as soon as he jumps the floor will reach him
again.</p>
<p>The inside observer: I do not see any reason for believing that my
lift is in absolute motion. I agree that my c.s., rigidly connected with
my lift, is not really inertial, but I do not believe that it has
anything to do with absolute motion. My watch, my handkerchief, and all
bodies are falling because the whole lift is in a gravitational field. I
notice exactly the same kinds of motion as the man on the earth. He
explains them very simply by the action of a gravitational field. The
same holds good for me.</p>
<p>These two descriptions, one by the outside, the other</p>
<p>by the inside, observer, are quite consistent, and there is no
possibility of deciding which of them is right. We may assume either one
of them for the description of phenomena in the lift: either non-uniform
motion and absence of a gravitational field with the outside observer,
or rest and the presence of a gravitational field with the inside
observer.</p>
<p>The outside observer may assume that the lift is in “absolute“
non-uniform motion. But a motion which is wiped out by the assumption of
an acting gravitational field cannot be regarded as absolute motion.</p>
<p>There is, possibly, a way out of the ambiguity of two such different
descriptions, and a decision in favour of one against the other could
perhaps be made. Imagine that a light ray enters the lift horizontally
through a side window and reaches the opposite wall after a very short
time. Again let us see how the path of the light would be predicted by
the two observers.</p>
<p>The outside observer, believing in accelerated motion of the lift,
would argue: The light ray enters the window and moves horizontally,
along a straight line and with a constant velocity, toward the opposite
wall. But the lift moves upward, and during the time in which the light
travels toward the wall the lift changes its position. Therefore, the
ray will meet at a point not exactly opposite its point of entrance, but
a little below. The difference will be very slight, but it exists
nevertheless, and the light ray travels, relative to the lift, not along
a straight, but along a slightly</p>
<p>curved line. The difference is due to the distance covered by the
lift during the time the ray is crossing the interior.</p>
<p>The inside observer, who believes in the gravitational field acting
on all objects in his lift, would say: there is no accelerated motion of
the lift, but only the action of the gravitational field. A beam of
light is weightless and, therefore, will not be affected by the
gravitational field. If sent in a horizontal direction, it will meet the
wall at a point exactly opposite to that at which it entered.</p>
<p>It seems from this discussion that there is a possibility of deciding
between these two opposite points of view as the phenomenon would be
different for the two observers. If there is nothing illogical in either
of the explanations just quoted, then our whole previous argument is
destroyed, and we cannot describe all phenomena in two consistent ways,
with and without a gravitational field.</p>
<p>But there is, fortunately, a grave fault in the reasoning of the
inside observer, which saves our previous conclusion. He said: “A beam
of light is weightless and, therefore, will not be affected by the
gravitational field.“ This cannot be right! A beam of light carries
energy and energy has mass. But every inertial mass is attracted by the
gravitational field, as inertial and gravitational masses are
equivalent. A beam of light will bend in a gravitational field exactly
as a body would if thrown horizontally with a velocity equal to that of
light. If the inside observer had reasoned correctly and had taken into
account the bending of light rays in a gravitational field, then his
results would have been exactly the same as those of an outside
observer.</p>
<p>The gravitational field of the earth is, of course, too weak for the
bending of light rays in it to be proved directly, by experiment. But
the famous experiments performed during the solar eclipses show,
conclusively though indirectly, the influence of a gravitational field
on the path of a light ray.</p>
<p>It follows from these examples that there is a well-founded hope of
formulating a relativistic physics. But for this we must first tackle
the problem of gravitation.</p>
<p>We saw from the example of the lift the consistency of the two
descriptions. Non-uniform motion may, or may not, be assumed. We can
eliminate “absolute“ motion from our examples by a gravitational field.
But then there is nothing absolute in the non-uniform motion. The
gravitational field is able to wipe it out completely.</p>
<p>The ghosts of absolute motion and inertial c.s. can be expelled from
physics and a new relativistic physics built. Our idealized experiments
show how the problem of the general relativity theory is closely
connected with that of gravitation and why the equivalence of
gravitational and inertial mass is so essential for this connection. It
is clear that the solution of the gravitational problem in the general
theory of relativity must differ from the Newtonian one. The laws of
gravitation must, just as all laws of nature, be formulated for all
possible c.s., whereas the laws of classical mechanics, as formulated by
Newton, are valid only in inertial c.s.</p>
<p>GEOMETRY AND EXPERIMENT</p>
<p>Our next example will be even more fantastic than the one with the
falling lift. We have to approach a new problem; that of a connection
between the general relativity theory and geometry. Let us begin with
the description of a world in which only two-dimensional and not, as in
ours, three-dimensional creatures live. The cinema has accustomed us to
two-dimensional creatures acting on a two-dimensional screen. Now let us
imagine that these shadow figures, that is, the actors on the screen,
really do exist, that they have the power of thought, that they can
create their own science, that for them a two-dimensional screen stands
for geometrical space. These creatures are unable to imagine, in a
concrete way, a three-dimensional space just as we are unable to imagine
a world of</p>
<p>four dimensions. They can deflect a straight line; they know what a
circle is, but they are unable to construct a sphere, because this would
mean forsaking their two-dimensional screen. We are in a similar
position. We are able to deflect and curve lines and surfaces, but we
can scarcely picture a deflected and curved three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>By living, thinking, and experimenting, our shadow figures could
eventually master the knowledge of the two-dimensional Euclidean
geometry. Thus, they could prove, for example, that the sum of the
angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. They could construct two circles
with a common centre, one very small, the other large. They would find
that the ratio of the circumferences of two such circles is equal to the
ratio of their radii, a result again characteristic of Euclidean
geometry. If the screen were infinitely great, these shadow beings would
find that once having started a journey straight ahead, they would never
return to their point of departure.</p>
<p>Let us now imagine these two-dimensional creatures living in changed
conditions. Let us imagine that someone from the outside, the “third
dimension“, transfers them from the screen to the surface of a sphere
with a very great radius. If these shadows are very small in relation to
the whole surface, if they have no means of distant communication and
cannot move very far, then they will not be aware of any change. The sum
of angles in small triangles still amounts to 180 degrees. Two small
circles with a common centre still show that the</p>
<p>ratio of their radii and circumferences are equal. A journey along a
straight line never leads them back to the starting-point.</p>
<p>But let these shadow beings, in the course of time, develop their
theoretical and technical knowledge. Let them find means of
communication which will enable them to cover large distances swiftly.
They will then find that starting on a journey straight ahead, they
ultimately return to their point of departure. “ Straight ahead“ means
along the great circle of the sphere. They will also find that the ratio
of two circles with a common centre is not equal to the ratio of the
radii, if one of the radii is small and the other great.</p>
<p>If our two-dimensional creatures are conservative, if they have
learned the Euclidean geometry for generations past when they could not
travel far and when this geometry fitted the facts observed, they will
certainly make every possible effort to hold on to it, despite the
evidence of their measurements. They could try to make physics bear the
burden of these discrepancies. They could seek some physical reasons,
say temperature differences, deforming the lines and causing deviation
from Euclidean geometry. But, sooner or later, they must find out that
there is a much more logical and convincing way of describing these
occurrences. They will eventually understand that their world is a
finite one, with different geometrical principles from those they
learned. They will understand that, in spite of their inability to
imagine it, their world is the two-dimensional surface of a sphere.
They</p>
<p>will soon learn new principles of geometry, which though differing
from the Euclidean can, nevertheless, be formulated in an equally
consistent and logical way for their two-dimensional world. For the new
generation brought up with a knowledge of the geometry of the sphere,
the old Euclidean geometry will seem more complicated and artificial
since it does not fit the facts observed.</p>
<p>Let us return to the three-dimensional creatures of our world.</p>
<p>What is meant by the statement that our three-dimensional space has a
Euclidean character? The meaning is that all logically proved statements
of the Euclidean geometry can also be confirmed by actual experiment. We
can, with the help of rigid bodies or light rays, construct objects
corresponding to the idealized objects of Euclidean geometry. The edge
of a ruler or a light ray corresponds to the line; the sum of the angles
of a triangle built of thin rigid rods is 180 degrees; the ratio of the
radii of two circles with a common centre constructed from thin
unbendable wire is equal to that of their circumference. Interpreted in
this way, the Euclidean geometry becomes a chapter of physics, though a
very simple one.</p>
<p>But we can imagine that discrepancies have been discovered: for
instance, that the sum of the angles of a large triangle constructed
from rods, which for many reasons had to be regarded as rigid, is not
180 degrees. Since we are already used to the idea of the concrete
representation of the objects of Euclidean geometry</p>
<p>by rigid bodies, we should probably seek some physical force as the
cause of such unexpected misbehaviour of our rods. We should try to find
the physical nature of this force and its influence on other phenomena.
To save the Euclidean geometry, we should accuse the objects of not
being rigid, of not exactly corresponding to those of Euclidean
geometry. We should try to find a better representation of bodies
behaving in the way expected by Euclidean geometry. If, however, we
should not succeed in combining Euclidean geometry and physics into a
simple and consistent picture, we should have to give up the idea of our
space being Euclidean and seek a more convincing picture of reality
under more general assumptions about the geometrical character of our
space.</p>
<p>The necessity for this can be illustrated by an idealized experiment
showing that a really relativistic physics cannot be based upon
Euclidean geometry. Our argument will imply results already learned
about inertial c.s. and the special relativity theory.</p>
<p>Imagine a large disc with two circles with a common centre drawn on
it, one very small, the other very large. The disc rotates quickly. The
disc is rotating relative to an outside observer, and there is an inside
observer on the disc. We further assume that the c.s. of the outside
observer is an inertial one. The outside observer may draw, in his
inertial c.s., the same two circles, small and large, resting in his
c.s. but coinciding with the circles on the rotating disc. Euclidean
geometry is valid in his c.s. since it is inertial, so that he will find
the ratio of</p>
<p>the circumferences equal to that of the radii. But how about the
observer on the disc? From the point of view of classical physics and
also the special relativity theory, his c.s. is a forbidden one. But if
we intend to find new forms for physical laws, valid in any c.s., then
we must treat the observer on the disc and the observer outside</p>
<p>with equal seriousness. We, from the outside, are now watching the
inside observer in his attempt to find, by measurement, the
circumferences and radii on the rotating disc. He uses the same small
measuring stick used by the outside observer. “The same“ means either
really the same, that is, handed by the outside observer to the inside,
or, one of two sticks having the same length when at rest in a c.s.</p>
<p>The inside observer on the disc begins measuring the</p>
<p>radius and circumference of the small circle. His result must be the
same as that of the outside observer. The axis on which the disc rotates
passes through the centre. Those parts of the disc near the centre have
very small velocities. If the circle is small enough, we can safely
apply classical mechanics and ignore the special relativity theory. This
means that the stick has the same length for the outside and inside
observers, and the result of these two measurements will be the same for
them both. Now the observer on the disc measures the radius of the large
circle. Placed on the radius, the stick moves, for the outside observer.
Such a stick, however, does not contract and will have the same length
for both observers, since the direction of the motion is perpendicular
to the stick. Thus three measurements are the same for both observers:
two radii and the small circumference. But it is not so with the fourth
measurement! The length of the large circumference will be different for
the two observers. The stick placed on the circumference in the
direction of the motion will now appear contracted to the outside
observer, compared to his resting stick. The velocity is much greater
than that of the inner circle, and this contraction should be taken into
account. If, therefore, we apply the results of the special relativity
theory, our conclusion here is: the length of the great circumference
must be different if measured by the two observers. Since only one of
the four lengths measured by the two observers is not the same for them
both, the ratio of the two radii cannot be equal to the ratio of</p>
<p>the two circumferences for the inside observer as it is for the
outside one. This means that the observer on the disc cannot confirm the
validity of Euclidean geometry in his c.s.</p>
<p>After obtaining this result, the observer on the disc could say that
he does not wish to consider c.s. in which Euclidean geometry is not
valid. The breakdown of the Euclidean geometry is due to absolute
rotation, to the fact that his c.s. is a bad and forbidden one. But, in
arguing in this way, he rejects the principal idea of the general theory
of relativity. On the other hand, if we wish to reject absolute motion
and to keep up the idea of the general theory of relativity, then
physics must all be built on the basis of a geometry more general than
the Euclidean. There is no way of escape from this consequence if all
c.s. are permissible.</p>
<p>The changes brought about by the general relativity theory cannot be
confined to space alone. In the special relativity theory we had clocks
resting in every c.s., having the same rhythm and synchronized, that is,
showing the same time simultaneously. What happens to a clock in a
non-inertial c.s.? The idealized experiment with the disc will again be
of use. The outside observer has in his inertial c.s. perfect clocks all
having the same rhythm, all synchronized. The inside observer takes two
clocks of the same kind and places one on the small inner circle and the
other on the large outer circle. The clock on the inner circle has a
very small velocity relative to the outside observer. We can, therefore,
safely conclude that its rhythm will be the</p>
<p>same as that of the outside clock. But the clock on the large circle
has a considerable velocity, changing its rhythm compared to the clocks
of the outside observer and, therefore, also compared to the clock
placed on the small circle. Thus, the two rotating clocks will have
different rhythms and, applying the results of the special relativity
theory, we again see that in our rotating c.s. we can make no
arrangements similar to those in an inertial c.s.</p>
<p>To make clear what conclusions can be drawn from this and previously
described idealized experiments, let us once more quote a dialogue
between the old physicist 0, who believes in classical physics, and the
modern physicist M, who knows the general relativity theory. 0 is the
outside observer, in the inertial c.s., whereas M is on the rotating
disc.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>In your c.s., Euclidean geometry is not valid. I watched your
measurements and I agree that the ratio of the two circumferences is
not, in your c.s., equal to the ratio of the two radii. But this shows
that your c.s. is a forbidden one. My c.s., however, is of an inertial
character, and I can safely apply Euclidean geometry. Your disc is in
absolute motion and, from the point of view of classical physics, forms
a forbidden c.s., in which the laws of mechanics are not valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>M. I do not want to hear anything about absolute motion. My c.s. is
just as good as yours. What I noticed was your rotation relative to my
disc. No one can forbid me to relate all motions to my disc.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>But did you not feel a strange force trying to</li>
</ol>
<p>keep you away from the centre of the disc? If your disc were not a
rapidly rotating merry-go-round, the two things which you observed would
certainly not have happened. You would not have noticed the force
pushing you toward the outside nor would you have noticed that Euclidean
geometry is not applicable in your c.s. Are not these facts sufficient
to convince you that your c.s. is in absolute motion?</p>
<p>M. Not at all! I certainly noticed the two facts you mention, but I
hold a strange gravitational field acting on my disc responsible for
them both. The gravitational field, being directed toward the outside of
the disc, deforms my rigid rods and changes the rhythm of my clocks. The
gravitational field, non-Euclidean geometry, clocks with different
rhythms are, for me, all closely connected. Accepting any c.s., I must
at the same time assume the existence of an appropriate gravitational
field with its influence upon rigid rods and clocks.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>But are you aware of the difficulties caused by your general
relativity theory? I should like to make my point clear by taking a
simple non-physical example. Imagine an idealized American town
consisting of parallel streets with parallel avenues running
perpendicular to them. The distance between the streets and also between
the avenues is always the same. With these assumptions fulfilled, the
blocks are of exactly the same size. In this way I can easily
characterize the position of any block. But such a construction would be
impossible without Euclidean geometry. Thus, for</li>
</ol>
<p>instance, we cannot cover our whole earth with one great ideal
American town. One look at the globe will convince you. But neither
could we cover your disc with such an “ American town construction“. You
claim that your rods are deformed by the gravitational field. The fact
that you could not confirm Euclid’s theorem about the equality of the
ratio of radii and circumferences shows clearly that if you carry such a
construction of streets and avenues far enough you will, sooner or
later, get into difficulties and find that it is impossible on your
disc. Your geometry on your rotating disc resembles that on a curved
surface, where, of course, the streets-and-avenues construction is
impossible on a great enough part of the surface. For a more physical
example take a plane irregularly heated with different temperatures on
different parts of the surface. Can you, with small iron sticks
expanding in length with temperature, carry out the
“parallel-perpendicular“ construction which I have drawn below? Of
course not! Your “gravitational field“ plays the same tricks</p>
<p>on your rods as the change of temperature on the small iron
sticks.</p>
<p>M. All this does not frighten me. The street-avenue construction is
needed to determine positions of points, with the clock to order events.
The town need not be American, it could just as well be ancient
European. Imagine your idealized town made of plasticine and then
deformed. I can still number the blocks and recognize the streets and
avenues, though these are no longer</p>
<p>straight and equidistant. Similarly, on our earth, longitude and
latitude denote the positions of points, although there is no “American
town“ construction.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>But I still see a difficulty. You are forced to use your “European
town structure’ 5 . I agree that you can order points, or events^ but
this construction will muddle all measurement of distances. It will not
give you the metric properties of space as does my construction. Take an
example. I know, in my American town, that to walk ten blocks I have to
cover twice the distance of</li>
</ol>
<p>five blocks. Since I know that all blocks are equal, I can
immediately determine distances.</p>
<p>M. That is true. In my “ European town“ structure, I cannot measure
distances immediately by the number of deformed blocks. I must know
something more; I must know the geometrical properties of my surface.
Just as everyone knows that from o° to 10° longitude on the Equator is
not the same distance as from o° to 10° longitude near the North Pole.
But every navigator knows how to judge the distance between two such
points on our earth because he knows its geometrical properties. He can
either do it by calculations based on the knowledge of spherical
trigonometry, or he can do it experimentally, sailing his ship through
the two distances at the same speed. In your case the whole problem is
trivial, because all the streets and avenues are the same distance
apart. In the case of our earth it is more complicated; the two
meridians o° and 10° meet at the earth’s poles and are farthest apart on
the Equator. Similarly, in my “European town structure“, I must know
something more than you in your “American town structure“, in order to
determine distances. I can gain this additional knowledge by studying
the geometrical properties of my continuum in every particular case.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>But all this only goes to show how inconvenient and complicated it
is to give up the simple structure of the Euclidean geometry for the
intricate scaffolding which you are bound to use. Is this really
necessary?</li>
</ol>
<p>M. I am afraid it is, if we want to apply our physics</p>
<p>to any c.s., without the mysterious inertial c.s. I agree that my
mathematical tool is more complicated than yours, but my physical
assumptions are simpler and more natural.</p>
<p>The discussion has been restricted to two-dimensional continua. The
point at issue in the general relativity theory is still more
complicated, since it is not the two-dimensional, but the
four-dimensional time-space continuum. But the ideas are the same as
those sketched in the two-dimensional case. We cannot use in the general
relativity theory the mechanical scaffolding of parallel, perpendicular
rods and synchronized clocks, as in the special relativity theory. In an
arbitrary c.s. we cannot determine the point and the instant at which an
event happens by the use of rigid rods, rhythmical and synchronized
clocks, as in the inertial c.s. of the special relativity theory. We can
still order the events with our non-Euclidean rods and our clocks out of
rhythm. But actual measurements requiring rigid rods and perfect
rhythmical and synchronized clocks can be performed only in the local
inertial c.s. For this the whole special relativity theory is valid; but
our “good“ c.s. is only local, its inertial character being limited in
space and time. Even in our arbitrary c.s. we can foresee the results of
measurements made in the local inertial c.s. But for this we must know
the geometrical character of our time-space continuum.</p>
<p>Our idealized experiments indicate only the general character of the
new relativistic physics. They show us that our fundamental problem is
that of gravitation.</p>
<p>They also show us that the general relativity theory leads to further
generalization of time and space concepts.</p>
<p>GENERAL RELATIVITY AND ITS VERIFICATION The general theory of
relativity attempts to formulate physical laws for all c.s. The
fundamental problem of the theory is that of gravitation. The theory
makes the first serious effort, since Newton’s time, to reformulate the
law of gravitation. Is this really necessary? We have already learned
about the achievements of Newton’s theory, about the great development
of astronomy based upon his gravitational law. Newton’s law still
remains the basis of all astronomical calculations. But we also learned
about some objections to the old theory. Newton’s law is valid only in
the inertia! c.s. of classical physics, in c.s. defined, we remember, by
the condition that the laws of mechanics must be valid in them. The
force between two masses depends upon their distance from each other.
The connection between force and distance is, as we know, invariant with
respect to the classical transformation. But this law does not fit the
frame of special relativity. The distance is not invariant with respect
to the Lorentz transformation. We could try, as we did so successfully
with the laws of motion, to generalize the gravitational law, to make it
fit the special relativity theory, or, in other words, to formulate it
so that it would be invariant with respect to the Lorentz and not to the
classical transformation. But Newton’s gravitational law op-</p>
<p>posed obstinately all our efforts to simplify and fit it into the
scheme of the special relativity theory. Even if we succeeded in this, a
further step would still be necessary: the step from the inertial c.s.
of the special relativity theory to the arbitrary c.s. of the general
relativity theory. On the other hand, the idealized experiments about
the falling lift show clearly that there is no chance of formulating the
general relativity theory without solving the problem of gravitation.
From our argument we see why the solution of the gravitational problem
will differ in classical physics and general relativity.</p>
<p>We have tried to indicate the way leading to the general relativity
theory and the reasons forcing us to change our old views once more.
Without going into the formal structure of the theory, we shall
characterize some features of the new gravitational theory as compared
with the old. It should not be too difficult to grasp the nature of
these differences in view of all that has previously been said.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The gravitational equations of the general relativity theory can
be applied to any c.s. It is merely a matter of convenience to choose
any particular c.s. in a special case. Theoretically all c.s. are
permissible. By ignoring the gravitation, we automatically come back to
the inertial c.s. of the special relativity theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Newton’s gravitational law connects the motion of a body here and
now with the action of a body at the same time in the far distance. This
is the law which formed a pattern for our whole mechanical view.
But</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the mechanical view broke down. In Maxwell’s equations we realized a
new pattern for the laws of nature. Maxwell’s equations are structure
laws. They connect events which happen now and here with events which
will happen a little later in the immediate vicinity. They are the laws
describing the changes of the electromagnetic field. Our new
gravitational equations are also structure laws describing the changes
of the gravitational field. Schematically speaking, we could say: the
transition from Newton’s gravitational law to general relativity
resembles somewhat the transition from the theory of electric fluids
with Coulomb’s law to Maxwell’s theory.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Our world is not Euclidean. The geometrical nature of our world is
shaped by masses and their velocities. The gravitational equations of
the general relativity theory try to disclose the geometrical properties
of our world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us suppose, for the moment, that we have succeeded in carrying
out consistently the programme of the general relativity theory. But are
we not in danger of carrying speculation too far from reality? We know
how well the old theory explains astronomical observations. Is there a
possibility of constructing a bridge between the new theory and
observation? Every speculation must be tested by experiment, and any
results, no matter how attractive, must be rejected if they do not fit
the facts. How did the new theory of gravitation stand the test of
experiment? This question can be answered in one sentence: The old
theory is a special</p>
<p>limiting case of the new one. If the gravitational forces are
comparatively weak, the old Newtonian law turns out to be a good
approximation to the new laws of gravitation. Thus all observations
which support the classical theory also support the general relativity
theory. We regain the old theory from the higher level of the new
one.</p>
<p>Even if no additional observation could be quoted in favour of the
new theory, if its explanation were only just as good as the old one,
given a free choice between the two theories, we should have to decide
in favour of the new one. The equations of the new theory are, from the
formal point of view, more complicated, but their assumptions are, from
the point of view of fundamental principles, much simpler. The two
frightening ghosts, absolute time and an inertial system, have
disappeared. The clue of the equivalence of gravitational and inertial
mass is not overlooked. No assumption about the gravitational forces and
their dependence on distance is needed. The gravitational equations have
the form of structure laws, the form required of all physical laws since
the great achievements of the field theory.</p>
<p>Some new deductions, not contained in Newton’s gravitational law, can
be drawn from the new gravitational laws. One, the bending of light rays
in a gravitational field, has already been quoted. Two further
consequences will now be mentioned.</p>
<p>If the old laws follow from the new one when the gravitational forces
are weak, the deviations from the</p>
<p>Newtonian law of gravitation can be expected only for comparatively
strong gravitational forces. Take our solar system. The planets, our
earth among them, move along elliptical paths around the sun. Mercury is
the planet nearest the sun. The attraction between the sun and Mercury
is stronger than that between the sun and any other planet, since the
distance is smaller. If there is any hope of finding a deviation from
Newton’s law, the greatest chance is in the case of Mercury. It follows,
from classical theory, that the path described by Mercury is of the same
kind as that of any other planet except that it is nearer the sun.
According to</p>
<p>the general relativity theory, the motion should be slightly
different. Not only should Mercury travel around the sun, but the
ellipse which it describes should rotate very slowly, relative to the
c.s. connected with the sun. This rotation of the ellipse expresses the
new effect of the general relativity theory. The new theory</p>
<p>predicts the magnitude of this effect. Mercury’s ellipse would
perform a complete rotation in three million years ! We see how small
the effect is, and how hopeless it would be to seek it in the case of
planets farther removed from the sun.</p>
<p>The deviation of the motion of the planet Mercury from the ellipse
was known before the general relativity theory was formulated, and no
explanation could be found. On the other hand, general relativity
developed without any attention to this special problem. Only later was
the conclusion about the rotation of the ellipse in the motion of a
planet around the sun drawn from the new gravitational equations. In the
case of Mercury, theory explained successfully the deviation of the
motion from the Newtonian law.</p>
<p>But there is still another conclusion which was drawn from the
general relativity theory and compared with experiment. We have already
seen that a clock placed on the large circle of a rotating disc has a
different rhythm from one placed on the smaller circle. Similarly, it
follows from the theory of relativity that a clock placed on the sun
would have a different rhythm from one placed on the earth, since the
influence of the gravitational field is much stronger on the sun than on
the earth.</p>
<p>We remarked on p. 103 that sodium, when incandescent, emits
homogeneous yellow light of a definite wave-length. In this radiation
the atom reveals one of its rhythms; the atom represents, so to speak, a
clock and the emitted wave-length one of its rhythms. Accord-</p>
<p>ing to the general theory of relativity, the wave-length of light
emitted by a sodium atom, say, placed on the sun should be very slightly
greater than that of light emitted by a sodium atom on our earth.</p>
<p>The problem of testing the consequences of the general relativity
theory by observation is an intricate one and by no means definitely
settled. As we are concerned with principal ideas, we do not intend to
go deeper into this matter, and only state that the verdict of
experiment seems, so far, to confirm the conclusions drawn from the
general relativity theory.</p>
<p>FIELD AND MATTER</p>
<p>We have seen how and why the mechanical point of view broke down. It
was impossible to explain all phenomena by assuming that simple forces
act between unalterable particles. Our first attempts to go beyond the
mechanical view and to introduce field concepts proved most successful
in the domain of electromagnetic phenomena. The structure laws for the
electromagnetic field were formulated; laws connecting events very near
to each other in space and time. These laws fit the frame of the special
relativity theory, since they are invariant with respect to the Lorentz
transformation. Later the general relativity theory formulated the
gravitational laws. Again they are structure laws describing the
gravitational field between material particles. It was also easy to
generalize Maxwell’s laws so that they could be applied to any G.S.,
like the gravitational laws of the general relativity theory.</p>
<p>We have two realities: matter and field. There is no doubt that we
cannot at present imagine the whole of physics built upon the concept of
matter as the physicists of the early nineteenth century did. For the
moment we accept both the concepts. Can we think of matter and field as
two distinct and different realities? Given a small particle of matter,
we could picture in a naive way that there is a definite surface of the
particle where it ceases to exist and its gravitational field appears.
In our picture, the region in which the laws of field are valid is
abruptly separated from the region in which matter is present. But what
are the physical criterions distinguishing matter and field? Before we
learned about the relativity theory we could have tried to answer this
question in the following way: matter has mass, whereas field has not.
Field represents energy, matter represents mass. But we already know
that such an answer is insufficient in view of the further knowledge
gained. From the relativity theory we know that matter represents vast
stores of energy and that energy represents matter. We cannot, in this
way, distinguish qualitatively between matter and field, since the
distinction between mass and energy is not a qualitative one. By far the
greatest part of energy is concentrated in matter; but the field
surrounding the particle also represents energy, though in an
incomparably smaller quantity. We could therefore say: Matter is where
the concentration of energy is great, field where the concentration of
energy is small. But if this is the case, then the difference between
matter</p>
<p>and field is a quantitative rather than a qualitative one. There is
no sense in regarding matter and field as two qualities quite different
from each other. We cannot imagine a definite surface separating
distinctly field and matter.</p>
<p>The same difficulty arises for the charge and its field. It seems
impossible to give an obvious qualitative criterion for distinguishing
between matter and field or charge and field.</p>
<p>Our structure laws, that is, Maxwell’s laws and the gravitational
laws, break down for very great concentrations of energy or, as we may
say, where sources of the field, that is electric charges or matter, are
present. But could we not slightly modify our equations so that they
would be valid everywhere, even in regions where energy is enormously
concentrated?</p>
<p>We cannot build physics on the basis of the matter-concept alone. But
the division into matter and field is, after the recognition of the
equivalence of mass and energy, something artificial and not clearly
defined. Could we not reject the concept of matter and build a pure
field physics? What impresses our senses as matter is really a great
concentration of energy into a comparatively small space. We could
regard matter as the regions in space where the field is extremely
strong. In this way a new philosophical background could be created. Its
final aim would be the explanation of all events in nature by structure
laws valid always and everywhere. A thrown stone is, from this point of
view, a changing field, where the states of greatest field</p>
<p>intensity travel through space with the velocity of the stone. There
would be no place, in our new physics, for both field and matter, field
being the only reality. This new view is suggested by the great
achievements of field physics, by our success in expressing the laws of
electricity, magnetism, gravitation in the form of structure laws, and
finally by the equivalence of mass and energy. Our ultimate problem
would be to modify our field laws in such a way that they would not
break down for regions in which the energy is enormously
concentrated.</p>
<p>But we have not so far succeeded in fulfilling this programme
convincingly and consistently. The decision, as to whether it is
possible to carry it out, belongs to the future. At present we must
still assume in all our actual theoretical constructions two realities:
field and matter.</p>
<p>Fundamental problems are still before us. We know that all matter is
constructed from a few kinds of particles only. How are the various
forms of matter built from these elementary particles? How do these
elementary particles interact with the field? By the search for an
answer to these questions new ideas have been introduced into physics,
the ideas of the quantum theory.</p>
<p>WE SUMMARIZE:</p>
<p>A new concept appears in physics, the’ most important invention since
Newton’s time: the field. It needed great scientific imagination to
realize that it is not the charges</p>
<p>nor the particles but the field in the space between the charges and
the particles which is essential for the description of physical
phenomena. The field concept proves most successful and leads to the
formulation of MaxweWs equations describing the structure of the
electromagnetic field and governing the electric as well as the optical
phenomena.</p>
<p>The theory of relativity arises from the field problems. The
contradictions and inconsistencies of the old theories force us to
ascribe new properties to the time-space continuum, to the scene of all
events in our physical world.</p>
<p>The relativity theory develops in two steps. The first step leads to
what is known as the special theory of relativity, applied only to
inertial co-ordinate systems, that is, to systems in which the law of
inertia, as formulated by Newton, is valid. The special theory of
relativity is based on two fundamental assumptions: physical laws are
the same in all co-ordinate systems moving uniformly, relative to each
other; the velocity of light always has the same value. From these
assumptions, fully confirmed by experiment, the properties of moving
rods and clocks, their changes in length and rhythm depending on
velocity, are deduced. The theory of relativity changes the laws of
mechanics. The old laws are invalid if the velocity of the moving
particle approaches that of light. The new laws for a moving body as
reformulated by the relativity theory are splendidly confirmed by
experiment. A further consequence of the (special) theory of relativity
is the connection between mass and energy. Mass is energy and energy has
mass. The two conservation laws of mass and energy are combined by
the</p>
<p>9-2</p>
<p>S»6o THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS</p>
<p>relativity theory into one, the conservation law of mass-energy.</p>
<p>The general theory of relativity gives a still deeper analysis of the
time-space continuum. The validity of the theory is no longer restricted
to inertial co-ordinate systems. The theory attacks the problem of
gravitation and formulates new structure laws for the gravitational
field. It forces us to analyse the role played by geometry in the
description of the physical world. It regards the fact that
gravitational and inertial mass are equal, as essential and not merely
accidental, as in classical mechanics. The experimental consequences of
the general relativity theory differ only slightly from those of
classical mechanics. Thy stand the test of experiment well wherever
comparison is possible. But the strength of the theory lies in its inner
consistency and the simplicity of its fundamental assumptions.</p>
<p>The theory of relativity stresses the importance of the field concept
in physics. But we have not yet succeeded in formulating a pure field
physics. For the present we must still assume the existence of both:
field and matter.</p>
