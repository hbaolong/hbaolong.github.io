<h4 id="the-two-electric-fluids">THE TWO ELECTRIC FLUIDS</h4>
<p>THE following pages contain a dull report of some very simple
experiments. The account will be boring not only because the description
of experiments is uninteresting in comparison with their actual
performance, but also because the meaning of the experiments does not
become apparent until theory makes it so. Our purpose is to furnish a
striking example of the role of theory in physics.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>A metal bar is supported on a glass base, and each end of the bar is
connected by means of a wire to an electroscope. What is an
electroscope? It is a simple apparatus consisting essentially of two
leaves of gold foil hanging from the end of a short piece of metal. This
ii enclosed in a glass jar or flask and the metal is in contact only
with non-metallic bodies, called insulators. In addition to the
electroscope and metal bar we are equipped with a hard rubber rod and a
piece of flannel.</li>
</ol>
<p>The experiment is performed as follows: we look</p>
<p>to see whether the leaves hang close together, for this is their
normal position. If by chance they do not, a touch of the finger on the
metal rod will bring them together. These preliminary steps being taken,
the</p>
<p>rubber rod is rubbed vigorously with the flannel and brought into
contact with the metal. The leaves separate at once! They remain apart
even after the rod is removed.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>We perform another experiment, using the same apparatus as
before, again starting with the gold leaves hanging close together. This
time we do not bring the rubbed rod into actual contact with the metal,
but only near it. Again the leaves separate. But there is a difference !
When the rod is taken away without having touched the metal, the leaves
immediately fall back to their normal position instead of remaining
separated.</p></li>
<li><p>Let us change the apparatus slightly for a third experiment.
Suppose that the metal bar consists of two pieces, joined together. We
rub the rubber rod with</p></li>
</ol>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 73</p>
<p>flannel and again bring it near the metal. The same phenomenon
occurs, the leaves separate. But now let</p>
<p>us divide the metal rod into its two separate parts and then take
away the rubber rod. We notice that in this case the leaves remain
apart, instead of falling back to their normal position as in the second
experiment.</p>
<p>It is difficult to evince enthusiastic interest in these simple and
naive experiments. In the Middle Ages their performer would probably
have been condemned; to us they seem both dull and illogical. It would
be very difficult to repeat them, after reading the account only once,
without becoming confused. Some notion of the theory makes them
understandable. We could say more: it is hardly possible to imagine such
experiments performed as accidental play, without the pre-existence of
more or less definite ideas about their meaning.</p>
<p>We shall now point out the underlying ideas of a very simple and
naive theory which explains all the facts described.</p>
<p>There exist two electric fluids, one called positive ( 4-) and the
other negative ( —). They are somewhat like substance in the sense
already explained, in that the amount can be enlarged or diminished, but
the total in any isolated system is preserved. There is, how-</p>
<p>ever, an essential difference between this case and that of heat,
matter or energy. We have two electrical substances. It is impossible
here to use the previous analogy of money unless it is somehow
generalized. A body is electrically neutral if the positive and negative
electric fluids exactly cancel each other. A man has nothing, either
because he really has nothing, or because the amount of money put aside
in his safe is exactly equal to the sum of his debts. We can compare the
debit and credit entries in his ledger to the two kinds of electric
fluids.</p>
<p>The next assumption of the theory is that two electric fluids of the
same kind repel each other, while two of the opposite kind attract. This
can be represented graphically in the following way:</p>
<p>-f* —•</p>
<p>A final theoretical assumption is necessary: There are two kinds of
bodies, those in which the fluids can move freely, called conductors,
and those in which they cannot, called insulators. As is always true in
such cases, this division is not to be taken too seriously. The ideal
conductor or insulator is a fiction which can</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 75</p>
<p>never be realized. Metals, the earth, the human body, are all
examples of conductors, although not equally good. Glass, rubber, china,
and the like are insulators. Air is only partially an insulator, as
everyone who has seen the described experiments kqows. It is always a
good excuse to ascribe the bad results of electrostatic experiments to
the humidity of the air, which increases its conductivity.</p>
<p>These theoretical assumptions are sufficient to explain the three
experiments described. We shall discuss them once more, in the same
order as before, but in the light of the theory of electric fluids.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The rubber rod, like all other bodies under normal conditions, is
electrically neutral. It contains the two fluids, positive and negative,
in equal amounts. By rubbing with flannel we separate them. This
statement is pure convention, for it is the application of the
terminology created by the theory to the description of the process of
rubbing. The kind of electricity that the rod has in excess afterwards
is called negative, a name which is certainly only a matter of
convention. If the experiments had been performed with a glass rod
rubbed with cat’s fur we should have had to call the excess positive, to
conform with the accepted convention. To proceed with the experiment, we
bring electric fluid to the metal conductor by touching it with the
rubber. Here it moves freely, spreading over the whole metal including
the gold leaves. Since the action of negative on negative is repulsion,
the two leaves try to get as far from each other as possible and the
result is</li>
</ol>
<p>the observed separation. The metal rests on glass or some other
insulator so that the fluid remains on the conductor, as long as the
conductivity of the air permits. We understand now why we have to touch
the metal before beginning the experiment. In this case the metal, the
human body, and the earth form one vast conductor, with the electric
fluid so diluted that practically nothing remains on the
electroscope.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>This experiment begins just in the same way as the previous one.
But instead of being allowed to touch the metal the rubber is now only
brought near it. The two fluids in the conductor, being free to move,
are separated, one attracted and the other repelled. They mix again when
the rubber rod is removed, as fluids of opposite kinds attract each
other.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we separate the metal into two parts and afterwards remove
the rod. In this case the two fluids cannot mix, so that the gold leaves
retain an excess of one electric fluid and remain apart.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the light of this simple theory all the facts mentioned here seem
comprehensible. The same theory does more, enabling us to understand not
only these, but many other facts in the realm of “electrostatics“. The
aim of every theory is to guide us to new facts, suggest new
experiments, and lead to the discovery of new phenomena and new laws. An
example will make this :lear. Imagine a change in the second experiment.
Suppose I keep the rubber rod near the metal and at the same time touch
the conductor with my finger. What will happen now? Theory answers: the
repelled</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 77</p>
<p>fluid (—) can now make its escape through my body, with the result
that only one fluid remains, the positive.</p>
<p>Only the leaves of the electroscope near the rubber rod will remain
apart. An actual experiment confirms this prediction.</p>
<p>The theory with which we are dealing is certainly naive and
inadequate from the point of view of modern physics. Nevertheless it is
a good example showing the characteristic features of every physical
theory.</p>
<p>There are no eternal theories in science. It always happens that some
of the facts predicted by a theory are disproved by experiment. Every
theory has its period of gradual development and triumph, after which it
may experience a rapid decline. The rise and fall of the substance
theory of heat, already discussed here, is one of many possible
examples. Others, more profound and important, will be discussed later.
Nearly every great advance in science arises from a crisis in the old
theory, through an endeavour to find a way out of the difficulties
created. We must examine old ideas, old</p>
<p>theories, although they belong to the past, for this is the only way
to understand the importance of the new ones and the extent of their
validity.</p>
<p>In the first pages of our book we compared the role of an
investigator to that of a detective who, after gathering the requisite
facts, finds the right solution by pure thinking. In one essential this
comparison must be regarded as highly superficial. Both in life and in
detective novels the crime is given. The detective must look for
letters, fingerprints, bullets, guns, but at least he knows that a
murder has been committed. This is not so for a scientist. It should not
be difficult to imagine someone who knows absolutely nothing about
electricity, since all the ancients lived happily enough without any
knowledge of it. Let this man be given metal, gold foil, bottles,
hard-rubber rod, flannel, in short, all the material required for
performing our three experiments. He may be a very cultured person, but
he will probably put wine into the bottles, use the flannel for
cleaning, and never once entertain the idea of doing the things we have
described. For the detective the crime is given, the problem formulated:
who killed Cock Robin? The scientist must, at least in part, commit his
own crime, as well as carry out the investigation. Moreover, his task is
not to explain just one case, but all phenomena which have happened or
may still happen.</p>
<p>In the introduction of the concept of fluids we see the influence of
those mechanical ideas which attempt to explain everything by substances
and simple forces</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 79</p>
<p>acting between them. To see whether the mechanical point of view can
be applied to the description of electrical phenomena, we must consider
the following problem. Two small spheres are given, both with an
electric charge, that is, both carrying an excess of one electric fluid.
We know that the spheres will either attract or repel each other. But
does the force depend only on the distance, and if so, how? The simplest
guess seems to be that this force depends on the distance in the same
way as gravitational force, which diminishes, say, to one-ninth of its
former strength if the distance is made three times as great. The
experiments performed by Coulomb showed that this law is really valid. A
hundred years after Newton discovered the law of gravitation, Coulomb
found a similar dependence of electrical force on distance. The two
major differences between Newton’s law and Coulomb’s law are:
gravitational attraction is always present, while electric forces exist
only if the bodies possess electric charges. In the gravitational case
there is only attraction, but electric forces may either attract or
repel.</p>
<p>There arises here the same question which we considered in connection
with heat. Are the electrical fluids weightless substances or not? In
other words, is the weight of a piece of metal the same whether neutral
or charged? Our scales show no difference, ^e conclude that the electric
fluids are also members of the family of weightless substances^</p>
<p>Further progress in the theory of electricity requires the
introduction of two new concepts. Again we shall</p>
<p>avoid rigorous definitions, using instead analogies with concepts
already familiar. We remember how essential it was for an understanding
of the phenomena of heat to distinguish between heat itself and
temperature. It is equally important here to distinguish between
electric potential and electric charge. The difference between the two
concepts is made clear by the analogy:</p>
<p>7 Electric potential—Temperature Electric charge—Heat /</p>
<p>Two conductors, for example two spheres of different size, may have
the same electric charge, that is the same excess of one electric fluid,
but the potential will be different in the two cases, being higher for
the smaller and lower for the larger sphere. The electric fluid will
have greater density and^thus be more compressed on the small conductor.
Since the repulsive forces must increase with the density, the tendency
of the charge to escape will be greater in the case of the smaller
sphere than in that of the larger. This tendency of charge to escape
from a conductor is a direct measure of its potentials/In order to show
clearly the difference between charge and potential we shall formulate a
few sentences describing the behaviour of heated bodies, and the
corresponding sentences concerning charged conductors.</p>

<p>ture and therefore the tern- trie potential and therefore</p>
<p>perature of the body. the electric potential of the</p>
<p>conductor.</p>
<p>But this analogy must not be pushed too far. An example shows the
differences as well as the similarities. If a hot body is brought into
contact with a cold one, the heat flows from the hotter to the colder.
On the other hand, suppose that we have two insulated conductors having
equal but opposite charges, one positive and the other negative. The two
are at different potentials. By convention we regard the potential
corresponding to a negative charge as lower than that corresponding to a
positive charge. If the two conductors are brought together or connected
by a wire, it follows from the theory of electric fluids that they will
show no charge and thus no difference of electric potential at all. We
must imagine a “flow“ of electric charge from one conductor to the other
during the short time in which the potential difference is equalized.
But how?</p>
<p>Does the positive fluid flow to the negative body, or the negative
fluid to the positive body?</p>
<p>In the material presented here we have no basis for deciding between
these two alternatives. We can assume either of the two possibilities,
or that the flow is simultaneous in both directions. It is only a matter
of adopting a convention, and no significance can be attached to the
choice, for we know no method of deciding the question experimentally.
Further development leading to a much more profound theory of
electricity gave an answer to this problem, which is quite meaningless
when formulated in terms of the simple and primitive theory of electric
fluids. Here we shall simply adopt the following mode of expression. The
electric fluid flows from the conductor having the higher potential to
that having the lower. In the case of our two conductors, the
electricity thus flows from</p>
<p>positive to negative. This expression is only a matter of convention
and is at this point quite arbitrary. The whole difficulty indicates
that the analogy between heat and electricity is by no means
complete.</p>
<p>We have seen the possibility of adapting the mechanical view to a
description of the elementary facts of electrostatics. The same is
possible in the case of magnetic phenomena.</p>
