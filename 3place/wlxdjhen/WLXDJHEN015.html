<h4 id="the-velocity-of-light">THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT</h4>
<p>In Galileo’s Two New Sciences we listen to a conversation of the
master and his pupils about the velocity of light:</p>
<p>SAGREDO: But of what kind and how great must we consider this speed
of light to be? Is it instantaneous or momentary or does it, like other
motion, require time? Can we not decide this by experiment?</p>
<p>SIMPLICIO: Everyday experience shows that the propagation of light is
instantaneous; for when we see a piece of artillery fired, at great
distance, the flash reaches our eyes without lapse of time; but the
sound reaches the ear only after a noticeable interval.</p>
<p>SAGREDO: Well, Simplicio, the only thing I am able to infer from this
familiar bit of experience is that sound, in reaching our ears, travels
more slowly than light; it does not inform me whether the coming of the
light is instantaneous or whether, although extremely rapid, it still
occupies time ….</p>
<p>SALVIATI: The small conclusiveness of these and other similar
observations once led me to devise a method by which one might
accurately ascertain whether illumination, i.e., propagation of light,
is really instantaneous….</p>
<p>Salviati goes on to explain the method of his experiment. In order to
understand his idea let us imagine that the velocity of light is not
only finite, but also</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 95</p>
<p>small, that the motion of light is slowed down, like that in a
slow-motion film. Two men, A and J5, have covered lanterns and stand,
say, at a distance of one mile from each other. The first man, A, opens
his lantern. The two have made an agreement that B will open his the
moment he sees A’s light. Let us assume that in our “slow motion“ the
light travels one mile in a second. A sends a signal by uncovering his
lantern. B sees it after one second and sends an answering signal. This
is received by A two seconds after he had sent his own. That is to say,
if light travels with a speed of one mile per second, then two seconds
will elapse between .4’s sending and receiving a signal, assuming that B
is a mile away. Conversely, if A does not know the velocity of light but
assumes that his companion kept the agreement, and he notices the
opening of 5’s lantern two seconds after he opened his, he can conclude
that the speed of light is one mile per second.</p>
<p>With the experimental technique available at that time Galileo had
little chance of determining the velocity of light in this way. If the
distance were a mile, he would have had to detect time intervals of the
order of one hundred-thousandth of a second !</p>
<p>Galileo formulated the problem of determining the velocity of light,
but did not solve it. The formulation of a problem is often more
essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of
mathematical or experimental skill. To raise new questions, new
possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires
creative imagination and marks real advance in science.</p>
<p>The principle of inertia, the law of conservation of energy were
gained only by new and original thoughts about already well-known
experiments and phenomena. Many instances of this kind will be found in
the following pages of this book, where the importance of seeing known
facts in a new light will be stressed and new theories described.</p>
<p>Returning to the comparatively simple question of determining the
velocity of light, we may remark that it is surprising that Galileo did
not realize that his experiment could be performed much more simply and
accurately by one man. Instead of stationing his companion at a distance
he could have mounted there a mirror, which would automatically send
back the signal immediately after receiving it.</p>
<p>About two hundred and fifty years later this very principle was used
by Fizeau, who was the first to determine the velocity of light by
terrestrial experiments. It had been determined by Roemer much earlier,
though less accurately, by astronomical observation.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that in view of its enormous magnitude, the
velocity of light could be measured only by taking distances comparable
to that between the earth and another planet of the solar system or by a
great refinement of experimental technique. The first method was that of
Roemer, the second that of Fizeau. Since the days of these first
experiments the very important number representing the velocity of light
has been determined many times, with increasing accuracy. In our own
century a highly refined technique was</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 97</p>
<p>devised for this purpose by Michelson. The result of these
experiments can be expressed simply: The velocity of light in vacua is
approximately 186,000 miles per second, or 300,000 kilometres per
second.</p>
<p>LIGHT AS SUBSTANCE</p>
<p>Again we start with a few experimental facts. The number just quoted
concerns the velocity of light in vacuo. Undisturbed, light travels with
this speed through empty space. We can see through an empty glass vessel
if we extract the air from it. We see planets, stars, nebulae, although
the light travels from them to our eyes through empty space. The simple
fact that we can see through a vessel whether or not there is air inside
shows us that the presence of air matters very little. For this reason
we can perform optical experiments in an ordinary room with the same
effect as if there were no air.</p>
<p>One of the simplest optical facts is that the propagation of light is
rectilinear. We shall describe a primitive and naive experiment showing
this. In front of a point source is placed a screen with a hole in it. A
point source is a very small source of light, say, a small opening in a
closed lantern. On a distant wall the hole in the screen will be
represented as light on a dark background. The next drawing shows how
this phenomenon is connected with the rectilinear propagation of light.
All such phenomena, even the more complicated cases in which light,
shadow, and half-shadows appear, can</p>
<p>be explained by the assumption that light, in vacua or in air,
travels along straight lines.</p>
<p>Let us take another example, a case in which light passes through
matter. We have a light beam travelling through a vacuum and falling on
a glass plate. What</p>
<p>happens? If the law of rectilinear motion were still valid, the path
would be that shown by the dotted line. But actually it is not. There is
a break in the path, such as is shown in the drawing. What we observe
here is the phenomenon known as refraction. The familiar appear-</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 99</p>
<p>ance of a stick which seems to be bent in the middle if half-immersed
in water is one of the many manifestations of refraction.</p>
<p>These facts are sufficient to indicate how a simple mechanical theory
of light could be devised. Our aim here is to show how the ideas of
substances, particles, and forces penetrated the field of optics, and
how finally the old philosophical point of view broke down.</p>
<p>The theory here suggests itself in its simplest and most primitive
form. Let us assume that all lighted bodies emit particles of light, or
corpuscles, which, falling on our eyes, create the sensation of light.
We are already so accustomed to introduce new substances, if necessary
for a mechanical explanation, that we can do it once more without any
great hesitation. These corpuscles must travel along straight lines
through empty space with a known speed, bringing to our eyes messages
from the bodies emitting light. All phenomena exhibiting the rectilinear
propagation of light support the corpuscular theory, for just this kind
of motion was prescribed for the corpuscles. The theory also explains
very simply the reflection of light by mirrors as the same kind of
reflection as that shown in the mechanical experiment of elastic balls
thrown against a wall, as the next drawing indicates.</p>
<p>The explanation of refraction is a little more difficult. Without
going into details, we can see the possibility of a mechanical
explanation. If corpuscles fall on the surface of glass, for example, it
may be that a force is exerted on them by the particles of the matter, a
force</p>
<p>which strangely enough acts only in the immediate neighbourhood of
matter. Any force acting on a</p>
<p>moving particle changes the velocity, as we already know. If the net
force on the light-corpuscles is an attraction perpendicular to the
surface of the glass, the new motion will lie somewhere between the line
of the original path and the perpendicular. This simple explanation
seems to promise success for the corpuscular theory of light. To
determine the usefulness and range of validity of the theory, however,
we must investigate new and more complicated facts.</p>
