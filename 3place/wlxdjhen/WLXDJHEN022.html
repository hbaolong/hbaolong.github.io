<h4 id="elementary-quanta-of-matter-and-electricity">ELEMENTARY QUANTA
OF MATTER AND ELECTRICITY</h4>
<p>In the picture of matter drawn by the kinetic theory, all elements
are built of molecules. Take the simplest case of the lightest element,
that is hydrogen. On p. 66 we saw how the study of Brownian motions led
to the determination of the mass of one hydrogen molecule. Its value
is:</p>
<p>0*000 ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0033 gram.</p>
<p>This means that mass is discontinuous. The mass of a portion of
hydrogen can change only by a whole number of small steps each
corresponding to the mass of one hydrogen molecule. But chemical
processes show that the hydrogen molecule can be broken up into two
parts, or, in other words, that the hydrogen molecule is composed of two
atoms. In chemical processes it is the atom and not the molecule which
plays the role of an elementary quantum. Dividing the above number by
two, we find the mass of a hydrogen atom. This is about</p>
<p>0*000 ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0017 gram.</p>
<p>Mass is a discontinuous quantity. But, of course, we need not bother
about this when determining weight. Even the most sensitive scales are
far from attaining the degree of precision by which the discontinuity in
mass variation could be detected.</p>
<p>Let us return to a well-known fact. A wire is connected with the
source of a current. The current is flowing through the wire from higher
to lower potential. We remember that many experimental facts were
explained by the simple theory of electric fluids flowing through the
wire. We also remember (p. 82) that the decision as to whether the
positive fluid flows from higher to lower potential, or the negative
fluid flows from lower to higher potential, was merely a matter of
convention. For the moment we disregard all the further progress
resulting from the field concepts. Even when thinking in the simple
terms of electric fluids,</p>
<p>there still remain some questions to be settled. As the name “fluid“
suggests, electricity was regarded, in the early days, as a continuous
quantity. The amount of charge could be changed, according to these old
views, by arbitrarily small steps. There was no need to assume
elementary electric quanta. The achievements of the kinetic theory of
matter prepared us for a new question: do elementary quanta of electric
fluids exist? The other question to be settled is: does the current
consist of a flow of positive, negative or perhaps of both fluids? The
idea of all the experiments answering these questions is to tear the
electric fluid from the wire, to let it travel through empty space, to
deprive it of any association with matter and then to investigate its
properties, which must appear most clearly under these conditions. Many
experiments of this kind were performed in the late nineteenth century.
Before explaining the idea of these experimental arrangements, at least
in one case, we shall quote the results. The electric fluid flowing
through the wire is a negative one, directed, therefore, from lower to
higher potential. Had we known this from the start, when the theory of
electric fluids was first formed, we should certainly have interchanged
the words, and called the electricity of the rubber rod positive, that
of the glass rod negative. It would then have been more convenient to
regard the flowing fluid as the positive one. Since our first guess was
wrong, we now have to put up with the inconvenience. The next important
question is whether the structure of this negative fluid is “granular“,
whether</p>
<p>or not it is composed of electric quanta. Again a number of
independent experiments show that there is no doubt as to the existence
of an elementary quantum of this negative electricity. The negative
electric fluid is constructed of grains, just as the beach is composed
of grains of sand, or a house built of bricks. This result was
formulated most clearly by J. J. Thomson, about forty years ago. The
elementary quanta of negative electricity are called electrons. Thus
every negative electric charge is composed of a multitude of elementary
charges represented by electrons. The negative charge can, like mass,
vary only discontinuously. The elementary electric charge is, however,
so small that in many investigations it is equally possible and
sometimes even more convenient to regard it as a continuous quantity.
Thus the atomic and electron theories introduce into science
discontinuous physical quantities which can vary only by jumps.</p>
<p>Imagine two parallel metal plates in some place from which all air
has been extracted. One of the plates has a positive, the other a
negative charge. A positive test charge brought between the two plates
will be repelled by the positively charged and attracted by the
negatively charged plate. Thus the lines of force of the electric field
will be directed from the positively to the negatively charged plate. A
force acting on a negatively charged test body would have the opposite
direction. If the plates are sufficiently large, the lines of force
between them will be equally dense everywhere; it is immaterial where
the test body is placed, the force and,</p>
<p>therefore, the density of the lines of force will be the same.
Electrons brought somewhere between the plates</p>
<p>would behave like raindrops in the gravitational field of the earth,
moving parallel to each other from the negatively to the positively
charged plate. There are many known experimental arrangements for
bringing a shower of electrons into such a field which directs them all
in the same way. One of the simplest is to bring a heated wire between
the charged plates. Such a heated wire emits electrons which are
afterwards directed by the lines of force of the external field. For
instance, radio tubes, familiar to everyone, are based on this
principle.</p>
<p>Many very ingenious experiments have been performed on a beam of
electrons. The changes of their path in different electric and magnetic
external fields have been investigated. It has even been possible to
isolate a single electron and to determine its elementary charge and its
mass, that is, its inertial resistance to the</p>
<p>action of an external force. Here we shall only quote the value of
the mass of an electron. It turned out to be about two thousand times
smaller than the mass of a hydrogen atom. Thus the mass of a hydrogen
atom, small as it is, appears great in comparison with the mass of an
electron. From the point of view of a consistent field theory, the whole
mass, that is, the whole energy, of an electron is the energy of its
field; the bulk of its strength is within a very small sphere, and away
from the “centre“ of the electron it is weak.</p>
<p>We said before that the atom of any element is its smallest
elementary quantum. This statement was believed for a very long time.
Now, however, it is no longer believed ! Science has formed a new view
showing the limitations of the old one. There is scarcely any statement
in physics more firmly founded on facts than the one about the complex
structure of the atom. First came the realization that the electron, the
elementary quantum of the negative electric fluid, is also one of the
components of the atom, one of the elementary bricks from which all
matter is built. The previously quoted example of a heated wire emitting
electrons is only one of the numerous instances of the extraction of
these particles from matter. This result closely connecting the problem
of the structure of matter with that of electricity, follows, beyond any
doubt, from very many independent experimental facts.</p>
<p>It is comparatively easy to extract from an atom some of the
electrons from which it is composed. This can be done by heat, as in our
example of a heated wire, or in</p>
<p>a different way, such as by bombarding atoms with other
electrons.</p>
<p>Suppose a thin, red-hot, metal wire is inserted into rarefied
hydrogen. The wire will emit electrons in all directions. Under the
action of a foreign electric field a given velocity will be imparted to
them. An electron increases its velocity just like a stone falling in
the gravitational field. By this method we can obtain a beam of
electrons rushing along with a definite speed in a definite direction.
Nowadays, we can reach velocities comparable to that of light by
submitting electrons to the action of very strong fields. What happens,
then, when a beam of electrons of a definite velocity impinges on the
molecules of rarefied hydrogen? The impact of a sufficiently speedy
electron will not only disrupt the hydrogen molecule into its two atoms
but will also extract an electron from one of the atoms.</p>
<p>Let us accept the fact that electrons are constituents of matter.
Then, an atom from which an electron has been torn out cannot be
electrically neutral. If it was previously neutral, then it cannot be so
now, since it is poorer by one elementary charge. That which remains
must have a positive charge. Furthermore, since the mass of an electron
is so much smaller than that of the lightest atom, we can safely
conclude that by far the greater part of the mass of the atom is not
represented by electrons but by the remainder of the elementary
particles which are much heavier than the electrons. We call this heavy
part of the atom its nucleus.</p>
<p>Modern experimental physics has developed methods</p>
<p>of breaking up the nucleus of the atom, of changing atoms of one
element into those of another, and of extracting from the nucleus the
heavy elementary particles of which it is built. This chapter of
physics, known as “nuclear physics“, to which Rutherford contributed so
much, is, from the experimental point of view, the most interesting. But
a theory, simple in its fundamental ideas and connecting the rich
variety of facts in the domain of nuclear physics, is still lacking.
Since, in these pages, we are interested only in general physical ideas,
we shall omit this chapter in spite of its great importance in modern
physics.</p>
