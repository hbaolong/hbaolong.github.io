<h4 id="the-quanta-of-light">THE QUANTA OF LIGHT</h4>
<p>Let us consider a wall built along the seashore. The waves from the
sea continually impinge on the wall, wash away some of its surface, and
retreat, leaving the way clear for the incoming waves. The mass of the
wall decreases and we can ask how much is washed away in, say, one year.
But now let us picture a different process. We want to diminish the mass
of the wall by the same amount as previously but in a different way. We
shoot at the wall and split it at the places where the bullets hit. The
mass of the wall will be decreased and we can well imagine that the same
reduction in mass is achieved in both cases. But from the appearance of
the wall we could easily detect whether the continuous sea wave or the
discontinuous shower of bullets has been acting. It will be helpful, in
understanding the phenomena which we are about to describe, to bear
in</p>
<p>mind the difference between sea waves and a shower of bullets.</p>
<p>We said, previously, that a heated wire emits electrons. Here we
shall introduce another way of extracting electrons from metal.
Homogeneous light, such as violet light, which is, as we know, light of
a definite wave-length, is impinging on a metal surface. The light
extracts electrons from the metal. The electrons are torn from the metal
and a shower of them speeds along with a certain velocity. From the
point of view of the energy principle we can say: the energy of light is
partially transformed into the kinetic energy of expelled electrons.
Modern experimental technique enables us to register these
electron-bullets, to determine their velocity and thus their energy.
This extraction of electrons by light falling upon metal is called the
photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>Our starting-point was the action of a homogeneous light wave, with
some definite intensity. As in every experiment, we must now change our
arrangements to see whether this will have any influence on the observed
effect.</p>
<p>Let us begin by changing the intensity of the homogeneous violet
light falling on the metal plate and note to what extent the energy of
the emitted electrons depends upon the intensity of the light. Let us
try to find the answer by reasoning instead of by experiment. We could
argue: in the photoelectric effect a certain definite portion of the
energy of radiation is transformed into energy of motion of the
electrons. If we again</p>
<p>illuminate the metal with light of the same wave-length but from a
more powerful source, then the energy of the emitted electrons should be
greater, since the radiation is richer in energy. We should, therefore,
expect the velocity of the emitted electrons to increase if the
intensity of the light increases. But experiment again contradicts our
prediction. Once more we see that the laws of nature are not as we
should like them to be. We have come upon one of the experiments which,
contradicting our predictions, breaks the theory on which they were
based. The actual experimental result is, from the point of view of the
wave theory, astonishing. The observed electrons all have the same
speed, the same energy, which does not change when the intensity of the
light is increased.</p>
<p>This experimental result could not be predicted by the wave theory.
Here again a new theory arises from the conflict between the old theory
and experiment.</p>
<p>Let us be deliberately unjust to the wave theory of light, forgetting
its great achievements, its splendid explanation of the bending of light
around very small obstacles. With our attention focused on the
photoelectric effect, let us demand from the theory an adequate
explanation of this effect. Obviously, we cannot deduce from the wave
theory the independence of the energy of electrons from the intensity of
light by which they have been extracted from the metal plate. We shall,
therefore, try another theory. We remember that Newton’s corpuscular
theory, explaining many of the observed phenomena of light, failed to
account</p>
<p>for the bending of light, which we are now deliberately disregarding.
In Newton’s time the concept of energy did not exist. Light corpuscles
were, according to him, weightless; each colour preserved its own
substance character. Later, when the concept of energy was created and
it was recognized that light carries energy, no one thought of applying
these concepts to the corpuscular theory of light. Newton’s theory was
dead and, until our own century, its revival was not taken
seriously.</p>
<p>To keep the principal idea of Newton’s theory, we must assume that
homogeneous light is composed of energy-grains and replace the old light
corpuscles by light quanta, which we shall call photons, small portions
of energy, travelling through empty space with the velocity of light.
The revival of Newton’s theory in this new form leads to the quantum
theory of light. Not only matter and electric charge, but also energy of
radiation has a granular structure, i.e., is built up of light quanta.
In addition to quanta of matter and quanta of electricity there are also
quanta of energy.</p>
<p>The idea of energy quanta was first introduced by Planck at the
beginning of this century in order to explain some effects much more
complicated than the photoelectric effect. But the photo-effect shows
most clearly and simply the necessity for changing our old concepts.</p>
<p>It is at once evident that this quantum theory of light explains the
photoelectric effect. A shower of photons is falling on a metal plate.
The action between radiation</p>
<p>and matter consists here of very many single processes in which a
photon impinges on the atom and tears out an electron. These single
processes are all alike and the extracted electron will have the same
energy in every case. We also understand that increasing the intensity
of the light means, in our new language, increasing the number of
falling photons. In this case, a different number of electrons would be
thrown out of the metal plate, but the energy of any single one would
not change. Thus we see that this theory is in perfect agreement with
observation.</p>
<p>What will happen if a beam of homogeneous light of a different
colour, say, red instead of violet, falls on the metal surface? Let us
leave experiment to answer this question. The energy of the extracted
electrons must be measured and compared with the energy of electrons
thrown out by violet light. The energy of the electron extracted by red
light turns out to be smaller than the energy of the electron extracted
by violet light. This means that the energy of the light quanta is
different for different colours. The photons belonging to the colour red
have half the energy of those belonging to the colour violet. Or, more
rigorously: the energy of a light quantum belonging to a homogeneous
colour decreases proportionally as the wave-length increases. There is
an essential difference between quanta of energy and quanta of
electricity. Light quanta differ for every wave-length, whereas quanta
of electricity are always the same. If we were to use one of our
previous analogies, we should compare</p>
<p>light quanta to the smallest monetary quanta, differing in each
country.</p>
<p>Let us continue to discard the wave theory of light and assume that
the structure of light is granular and is formed by light quanta, that
is, photons speeding through space with the velocity of light. Thus, in
our new picture, light is a shower of photons, and the photon is the
elementary quantum of light energy. If, however, the wave theory is
discarded, the concept of a wave-length disappears. What new concept
takes its place? The energy of the light quanta! Statements expressed in
the terminology of the wave theory can be translated into statements of
the quantum theory of radiation. For example:</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY OF THE TERMINOLOGY OF THE WAVE THEORY QUANTUM THEORY</p>
<p>Homogeneous light has a Homogeneous light con-definite wave-length.
The tains photons of a definite wave-length of the red end energy. The
energy of the of the spectrum is twice photon for the red end of that of
the violet end. the spectrum is half that of</p>
<p>the violet end.</p>
<p>The state of affairs can be summarized in the following way: there
are phenomena which can be explained by the quantum theory but not by
the wave theory. Photo-effect furnishes an example, though other
phenomena of this kind are known. There are phenomena which can be
explained by the wave theory but not by the quantum theory. The bending
of light around obstacles is a typical example. Finally, there are</p>
<p>phenomena, such as the rectilinear propagation of light, which can be
equally well explained by the quantum and the wave theory of light.</p>
<p>But what is light really? Is it a wave or a shower of photons? Once
before we put a similar question when we asked: is light a wave or a
shower of light corpuscles? At that time there was every reason for
discarding the corpuscular theory of light and accepting the wave
theory, which covered all phenomena. Now, however, the problem is much
more complicated. There seems no likelihood of forming a consistent
description of the phenomena of light by a choice of only one of the two
possible languages. It seems as though we must use sometimes the one
theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are
faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures
of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of
light, but together they do!</p>
<p>How is it possible to combine these two pictures? How can we
understand these two utterly different aspects of light? It is not easy
to account for this new difficulty. Again we are faced with a
fundamental problem.</p>
<p>For the moment let us accept the photon theory of light and try, by
its help, to understand the facts so far explained by the wave theory.
In this way we shall stress the difficulties which make the two theories
appear, at first sight, irreconcilable.</p>
<p>We remember: a beam of homogeneous light passing</p>
<p>through a pinhole gives light and dark rings (p. 118). How is it
possible to understand this phenomenon by the help of the quantum theory
of light, disregarding the wave theory? A photon passes through the
hole. We could expect the screen to appear light if the photon passes
through and dark if it does not. Instead, we find light and dark rings.
We could try to account for it as follows: perhaps there is some
interaction between the rim of the hole and the photon which is
responsible for the appearance of the diffraction rings. This sentence
can, of course, hardly be regarded as an explanation. At best, it
outlines a programme for an explanation holding out at least some hope
of a future understanding of diffraction by interaction between matter
and photons.</p>
<p>But even this feeble hope is dashed by our previous discussion of
another experimental arrangement. Let us take two pinholes. Homogeneous
light passing through the two holes gives light and dark stripes on the
screen. How is this effect to be understood from the point of view of
the quantum theory of light? We could argue: a photon passes through
either one of the two pinholes. If a photon of homogeneous light
represents an elementary light particle, we can hardly imagine its
division and its passage through the two holes. But then the effect
should be exactly as in the first case, light and dark rings and not
light and dark stripes. How is it possible then that the presence of
another pinhole completely changes the effect? Apparently the hole
through which the photon does not pass, even though it may be</p>
<p>at a fair distance, changes the rings into stripes! If the photon
behaves like a corpuscle in classical physics, it must pass through one
of the two holes. But in this case, the phenomena of diffraction seem
quite incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Science forces us to create new ideas, new theories. Their aim is to
break down the wall of contradictions which frequently blocks the way of
scientific progress. All the essential ideas in science were born in a
dramatic conflict between reality and our attempts at understanding.
Here again is a problem for the solution of which new principles are
needed. Before we try to account for the attempts of modern physics to
explain the contradiction between the quantum and the wave aspects of
light, we shall show that exactly the same difficulty appears when
dealing with quanta of matter instead of quanta of light.</p>
