<h4 id="what-is-a-wave">WHAT IS A WAVE?</h4>
<p>A bit of gossip starting in London reaches Edinburgh very quickly,
even though not a single individual who takes part in spreading it
travels between these two cities. There are two quite different motions
involved, that of the rumour, London to Edinburgh, and that of the
persons who spread the rumour. The</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 105</p>
<p>wind, passing over a field of grain, sets up a wave which spreads our
across the whole field. Here again we must distinguish between the
motion of the wave and the motion of the separate plants, which undergo
only small oscillations. We have all seen the waves that spread in wider
and wider circles when a stone is thrown into a pool of water. The
motion of the wave is very different from that of the particles of
water. The particles merely go up and down. The observed motion of the
wave is that of a state of matter and not of matter itself. A cork
floating on the wave shows this clearly, for it moves up and down in
imitation of the actual motion of the water, instead of being carried
along by the wave.</p>
<p>In order to understand better the mechanism of the wave let us again
consider an idealized experiment. Suppose that a large space is filled
quite uniformly with water, or air, or some other “medium“. Somewhere in
the centre there is a sphere. At the beginning of the experiment there
is no motion at all. Suddenly the sphere begins to “breathe“
rhythmically, expanding and contracting in volume, although retaining
its spherical shape. What will happen in the medium? Let us begin our
examination at the moment the sphere begins to expand. The particles of
the medium in the immediate vicinity of the sphere are pushed out, so
that the density of a spherical shell of water, or air, as the case may
be, is increased above its normal value. Similarly, when the sphere
contracts, the density of that part of the medium immediately
surrounding it will be</p>
<p>decreased. These changes of density are propagated throughout the
entire medium. The particles constituting the medium perform only small
vibrations, but the whole motion is that of a progressive wave. The
essentially new thing here is that for the first time we consider the
motion of something which is not matter, but energy propagated through
matter.</p>
<p>Using the example of the pulsating sphere, we may introduce two
general physical concepts, important for the characterization of waves.
The first is the velocity with which the wave spreads. This will depend
on the medium, being different for water and air, for example. The
second concept is that of wave-length. In the case of waves on a sea or
river it is the distance from the trough of one wave to that of the
next, or from the crest of one wave to that of the next. Thus sea waves
have greater wave-length than river waves. In the case of our waves set
up by a pulsating sphere the wave-length is the distance, at some
definite time, between two neighbouring spherical shells showing maxima
or minima of density. It is evident that this distance will not depend
on the medium alone. The rate of pulsation of the sphere will certainly
have a great effect, making the wave-length shorter if the pulsation
becomes more rapid, longer if the pulsation becomes slower.</p>
<p>This concept of a wave proved very successful in physics. It is
definitely a mechanical concept. The phenomenon is reduced to the motion
of particles which, according to the kinetic theory, are constituents
of</p>
<p>matter. Thus every theory which uses the concept of wave can, in
general, be regarded as a mechanical theory. For example, the
explanation of acoustical phenomena is based essentially on this
concept. Vibrating bodies, such as vocal cords and violin strings, are
sources of sound waves which are propagated through the air in the
manner explained for the pulsating sphere. It is thus possible to reduce
all acoustical phenomena to mechanics by means of the wave concept.</p>
<p>It has been emphasized that we must distinguish between the motion of
the particles and that of the wave itself, which is a state of the
medium. The two are very different, but it is apparent that in our
example of the pulsating sphere both motions take place in the</p>
<p>same straight line. The particles of the medium oscillate along short
line segments, and the density increases and decreases periodically in
accordance with this motion.</p>
<p>The direction in which the wave spreads and the line on which the
oscillations lie are the same. This type of wave is called longitudinal.
But is this the only kind of wave? It is important for our further
considerations to realize the possibility of a different kind of wave,
called transverse.</p>
<p>Let us change our previous example. We still have the sphere, but it
is immersed in a medium of a different kind, a sort of jelly instead of
air or water. Furthermore, the sphere no longer pulsates but rotates in
one direction through a small angle and then back again,</p>
<p>always in the same rhythmical way and about a definite axis. The
jelly adheres to the sphere and thus the adhering portions are forced to
imitate the motion. These portions force those situated a little farther
away to imitate the same motion, and so on, so that a wave is set up in
the medium. If we keep in mind the distinction</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW IOQ</p>
<p>between the motion of the medium and the motion of the wave, we see
that here they do not lie on the same line. The wave is propagated in
the direction of the radius of the sphere, while the parts of the medium
move perpendicularly to this direction. We have thus created a
transverse wave.</p>
<p>Waves spreading on the surface of water are transverse. A floating
cork only bobs up and down, but the wave spreads along a horizontal
plane. Sound waves, on the other hand, furnish the most familiar example
of longitudinal waves. ^</p>
<p>One more remark: the wave produced by a pulsating or oscillating
sphere in a homogeneous medium is a spherical wave. It is called so
because at any given moment all points on any sphere surrounding the
source behave in the same way// Let us consider a portion of such a
sphere at a great distance from the source. The farther away the portion
is, and the smaller we choose to take it, the more it resembles a plane.
We can say, without trying to be too rigorous, that there is no
essential difference between a part of a plane and</p>
<p>a part of a sphere whose radius is sufficiently large. We very often
speak of small portions of a spherical wave far removed from the source
as plane waves. The farther we place the shaded portion of our drawing
from the centre of the spheres and the smaller the angle between the two
radii, the better our representation of a plane wave. The concept of a
plane wave, like many other physical concepts, is no more than a fiction
which can be realized with only a certain degree of accuracy. It is,
however, a useful concept which we shall need later.</p>
