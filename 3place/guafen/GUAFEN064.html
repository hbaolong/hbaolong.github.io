<h4 id="chapter-63">Chapter 63</h4>
<p>Alan did not inquire about his overnight plans, and Simon didn’t
offer because he had none. He found a room at a motel that appeared to
have been constructed in the past thirty years, and would have felt
better if the rate for one night had been more than 5, but he was in no
position to be selective. The other two motels along the highway were
far older, cheaper, and had yet to pave their parking lots. He had corn
chips and beer for dinner, and at 9 P.M. called Raymond, who, of course,
was at the office. Simon could almost smell the cigar smoke.</p>
<p>Raymond’s customary crankiness vanished after Simon’s opening. The
old windbag was speechless and allowed Simon to deliver his narrative
for at least twenty minutes before uttering a sound. It was, “Hang on. I
need another shot.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Alan agreed to meet for breakfast at the same diner at seven-thirty
before he took his boys to school. Still no mention of a wife or woman
in his life, not that Simon cared.</p>
<p>He was only ten minutes late. Simon had just taken his first bite of
oatmeal—prepackaged—and flagged the waitress over for more coffee. Alan
ordered wheat toast and honey.</p>
<p>“Get any sleep last night?” he asked with a grin.</p>
<p>“No, not much. A lot to think about.”</p>
<p>Alan pulled a folded sheet of paper from his shirt pocket, and
thanked the waitress for the coffee. “I have three priorities, in order
of importance.”</p>
<p>The small sheet of notebook paper had scribblings on both sides.</p>
<p>“Number one: I want Kofie off the street and locked away somewhere. I
can’t help with that because I’m not a direct witness to his crimes. And
you can’t trust our local boys because they’ve already solved the crime
and got their conviction. This is a matter for the FBI.”</p>
<p>“How’d they get Kofie out of town without raising suspicions?”</p>
<p>“Another sad part of the story. They suddenly had some layoffs at the
hospital and he got his walking papers. Since no one filed a complaint
against him, he kept his technician’s license. Pretty sick, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. His license to poison others.”</p>
<p>“And, apparently, that’s what has happened. May I continue?”</p>
<p>“Proceed, sir.”</p>
<p>“Number two: I want to help you walk away from this. I see where
you’ve filed a motion to vacate the guilty verdict. What are the chances
of getting before the judge on this?”</p>
<p>“Quite good. So far, she’s held hearings on all motions from both
sides. We consider her to be sympathetic.”</p>
<p>“She should be. She presided over a trial that convicted an innocent
man. As a believer in our system of justice, I’m appalled by any
wrongful conviction. You’re innocent and we know who’s guilty. Let’s
nail him.”</p>
<p>“Will you testify at the hearing?”</p>
<p>“I knew this was coming and the answer is yes, with conditions. I’m
not sure of the procedure in Virginia, but around here it’s possible to
have a closed hearing, on the record, of course. If we can have a closed
hearing to vacate—empty courtroom, no press, no spectators, no one there
who’s not supposed to be there—then I’ll testify. The Fendamar file is
under lock and key and it must remain buried. Which goes hand in hand
with number three: I have to protect the NDA. The hospital can never
know about my involvement. If it finds out it will come after me and the
entire Mulrooney firm. That would not be pleasant. The NDA has some
clawback provisions that allow the hospital to recoup some serious money
should the lawyers develop loose tongues.”</p>
<p>“How do we get the file?”</p>
<p>Alan smiled and pulled out a thumb drive. “It’s all right here. I
kept copies and recorded everything, even have the video of Kofie’s
apartment. Surprisingly, not a very cool pad.”</p>
<p>“Are you offering that to me?”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll bring it to court and share it with the judge.”</p>
<p>“Okay. My lawyer will start pushing for a hearing right now.”</p>
<p>“You told him?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, had a long talk last night and we’ll have another when I
leave here and drive home. This changes everything, Alan. I can’t thank
you enough.”</p>
<p>“You’re an innocent man, Simon.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<hr />
<p>He would have called Zander with the news but it was not yet noon. He
should be in Braxton by then. Perhaps he could buy her lunch.</p>
<p>He called Raymond, who was far more talkative now that he’d had some
sleep and time to digest the news. Raymond was full of ideas about legal
procedures and maneuverings Simon had never heard of.</p>
<p>He called Landy and they discussed the FBI’s involvement. She was
certain a file would be opened and an investigation would be ramped up
soon enough. She would call her supervisor as soon as she hung up.</p>
<p>As he drove past the sign for the city limits of Braxton, Simon asked
himself, and certainly not for the first time, why he was returning to
the town. It wasn’t home anymore. For the past nineteen years, ever
since he finished law school, Braxton had been the center of his world.
His home and office, real estate he’d once owned, were there. His three
children had been born in the very hospital where Oscar Kofie was still
working. He and Paula had raised the kids in the public schools and
rarely missed a teacher conference, a play, a concert, a graduation, or
a game. His church was there, though over the years the family had
attended less and less. The Latches were now considered Easter
Christians. His friends still lived in Braxton, though he felt abandoned
by all of them.</p>
<p>The only thing Simon wanted from Braxton at the moment was a clear
name. He had been wrongfully convicted by a jury far away but harshly
condemned by the people closest to him. He wanted to be able to walk
through the courthouse and then down Main Street, his final walk on his
way out of town, with his head high as he looked down on all those who
doubted him. He wanted them to feel rotten for misjudging him. He wanted
retribution.</p>
<p>It was a sad commentary on his life that the only acquaintance he
could meet for lunch was a young, talented criminal with hair that was
the color of a tangerine this week and lavender last week. Zander
managed to pull things together by 2 P.M. and meet at her favorite tea
shop, where the antisocial chef/owner was advertising ginger cookies as
a special.</p>
<p>“Let’s skip those,” Simon said, but Zander missed the connection. She
ordered a breakfast tea loaded with caffeine and slugged it down. She
was emaciated and needed to add at least twenty pounds. So did Simon,
and he ordered two sandwiches. As he devoured them, he gave her a
sanitized version of Alan Teel’s story, careful to avoid the sensitive
areas.</p>
<p>He thanked her again, and she again waved him off. It was just
something she and Cooley did for fun, sometimes for profit.</p>
