<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>Professional duties returned and required Simon’s presence in the
courtroom down the street. It was a docket call, an antiquated waste of
time wherein most of the town’s lawyers gathered in front of an old
judge who could barely turn on a computer and dickered about the
scheduling of trials for cases that should never have been filed.</p>
<p>As they waited for the judge, the lawyers mingled and gossiped and
tried to look important before the crowd of spectators and litigants.
They were allowed to drink coffee in the courtroom, but not eat the
doughnuts one of the clerks had, for some reason, placed on the
stenographer’s table.</p>
<p>Simon went out of his way to engage Wally Thackerman in a pleasant
conversation about a new shopping center one of Wally’s clients was
planning. As he chatted on, Simon feigned interest in the shopping
center while thinking of nothing but the outrageous last will and
testament Wally had written for himself and convinced Eleanor Barnett to
sign two months earlier.</p>
<p>That he, Simon, was drafting one very similar did not seem
relevant.</p>
<p>What will Wally do when she dies and he sprints to the courthouse to
probate his version of Eleanor’s last will and testament, only to learn
almost immediately that it had just been renounced and held void by a
subsequent one prepared by Simon F. Latch, Attorney and Counselor at
Law? It was not a pleasant thought.</p>
<p>Wally rattled on about his shopping center. The breathtaking news was
that an exciting new chain of sandwich shops from California was near a
deal on a long-term lease, one that would certainly attract other classy
tenants.</p>
<p>The problem was that Eleanor had no idea what to do with her fortune
and needed serious advice, wisdom she was not getting from anyone else.
Someone, and certainly not the windbag going on about avocado hoagies,
had to help her. There was no one but Simon.</p>
<p>Mercifully, His Honor rallied long enough to make his appearance and
get settled behind his bench. Simon managed to extricate himself from
Wally’s deal-making and took a seat at one of the counsel tables. Salmon
Subs? Didn’t exactly make your mouth water. Simon shuddered with the
thought that some of Eleanor’s money might get invested in such
ventures. Wally had a reputation for getting tangled up in bad
deals.</p>
<p>The judge picked up some papers, frowned, and said good morning. He
went through his tired old routine of thanking the lawyers for being
such good lawyers and thanking the clerks, and so on. He read the name
of the first case and said the trial would start in an hour. He droned
on.</p>
<p>Simon nodded off but caught himself. His mind came back to life when
he tried to visualize a hot will contest in that very courtroom. He
became dizzy at the visual of him sitting at counsel table being gawked
at by everyone else—jurors, lawyers, clerks, spectators—all convinced
that he had been caught red-handed trying to con an old woman out of her
money.</p>
<p>That, of course, would not be true, since the old woman still had her
money up until the moment she died, but nonetheless, the case would
quickly devolve into a public relations nightmare for Simon. With time,
he could endure the nightmare and eventually survive it, if, of course,
he had control of the money.</p>
<p>There were too many bad scenarios.</p>
<hr />
<p>Spade was only fifteen minutes late. Simon was at the bar hovering
over a video poker screen and glancing occasionally at a basketball game
that held little interest. He ordered two beers and some onion rings and
they retired to the same dark corner as the night before.</p>
<p>“Who you got?” Spade asked, nodding at a widescreen above the
bar.</p>
<p>“Neither. Tulsa versus Tulane. Not exactly life-or-death.”</p>
<p>“So you only play the teams you like. That’s a bad strategy.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the advice. About Eleanor Barnett.”</p>
<p>“Some progress. Harry Korsak checks out. Born in 1941 in Knoxville,
married Betsy in 1965, had two sons, Clyde and Jerry. Betsy died in 1981
and he married Eleanor Barnett in 1989. For decades he worked for Coke,
first in a warehouse then got promoted to a district sales job. As such,
he qualified for the company’s profit-sharing and began buying stock.
Retired in 2002, croaked four years later.” Spade stopped long enough to
take a gulp of beer and wipe his mouth with a sleeve.</p>
<p>Simon said, “Nice, but how much stock?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting there. Truth is we can’t know. In 1990, for example,
Coke had sixty million common shares outstanding and these were owned by
roughly half a million people and entities. Most of it by the big
players—mutual funds, hedge funds, retirement funds. They have to report
what they own. It’s all public record. For example, the Michigan public
employees’ retirement fund, in 1990, owned eight hundred million
dollars’ worth of Coke stock.”</p>
<p>“That’s certainly good to know.”</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to explain things to you, Latch, and I’m going real
slow, okay?”</p>
<p>The onion rings arrived and Spade began chomping on one. Before
swallowing, he continued, “But getting individual names is more
difficult, especially when purchased through the company’s stock plan.
There is a record of old Harry buying the Coke stock from 1965 until he
retired, but no record of how much. And, no record of how much he might
have sold along the way.”</p>
<p>“She says he sold nothing.”</p>
<p>“And you always believe your client?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think so. Think about it, Latch. Today about nine million
shares of Coke stock was traded on the Big Board, same yesterday, same
tomorrow. It’s virtually impossible to keep up with who owns the stock.
Same for Wal-Mart.”</p>
<p>“How many shares of Wal-Mart were traded?” Simon asked innocently and
immediately wished he had not.</p>
<p>“You gotta computer? If you can turn it on, takes about ten
seconds.”</p>
<p>Simon gave a goofy laugh to deflect his stupidity. He crunched on an
onion ring, glanced at the game, and said, “So, we don’t know how much
stock she might have.”</p>
<p>“It would take a subpoena. Here’s the interesting part. That
Appletree outfit she mentioned got swallowed several times years ago.
What’s left of it is now known as Rumke-Brown, a quiet little money
management firm in an unmarked office in Buckhead. Guess who Brown
is?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t begin to guess.”</p>
<p>“You could if you tried. Buddy Brown, probably our gal’s longtime
manager.”</p>
<p>“Our gal? You taking an interest?”</p>
<p>“Maybe, because Buddy and his gang don’t mess with the common folk.
Takes twenty-five million to get in the door.”</p>
<p>“Leave her alone. She’s eighty-five.”</p>
<p>“I know, means she’ll croak soon and I’ll get a bigger house.”</p>
<p>“Knock it off, Spade.”</p>
<p>“I know. She’s all yours.”</p>
<p>“Can we keep things on a professional level?”</p>
<p>Spade laughed as if he were joking and took another onion ring. He
washed it down with another gulp and said, “They moved here, bought the
house at the bottom of the market. Two months after they moved in, Harry
had the big one and checked out. At the time he was still a registered
voter in Atlanta, where they had lived for a long time. Get this—there
was no probate. Kinda unusual for a big estate, right?”</p>
<p>“I’d say so, but not if all assets were jointly owned.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Everything they had was jointly owned, with survivorship
rights, so it all passed immediately to Eleanor without the need for
probate. Ole Harry was a pretty slick dude. With the full marital
deduction and jointly owned assets, he outfoxed the IRS and she got
everything.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like he really wanted to keep things away from his two
sons.”</p>
<p>“And those bloodsucking estate lawyers. No offense.”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>Spade was watching the game and said, “I put a thousand on Tulsa
minus eight and they’re losing by twenty. Remember that cash you gave me
last night?”</p>
<p>“It appears to be leaving your wallet. Do we have a next step?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. We could pay a hacker to take a peek at the firm’s
books and her account.”</p>
<p>“That’s a crime.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it. I almost got busted three years ago, remember? I
used a hacker in Russia who was about to rat me out when somebody got to
him first. Ate a bullet. I ain’t going to jail, Latch.”</p>
<p>“Nor am I. So, it’s fair to say Ms. Barnett is loaded?”</p>
<p>“I’d bet on it, but I wouldn’t bet the ranch. Too many unknowns. Did
dear Harry sell some stock? Did Ms. Barnett? Is she worth a lot less but
Buddy watches her money because he’s done it for years? Was she
grandfathered in when the firms merged? Safe to say she’s got a lot of
stock but who knows how much.”</p>
<p>“She knows but I doubt she’ll show me a statement. I tried once and
got a stiff arm.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Latch. As charming as you are? Just tell the old gal you
can’t represent her if you don’t know her assets.”</p>
<p>“I’ve tried that.”</p>
<p>“Want me to talk to her?</p>
<p>“Hell no!”</p>
<p>“Just joking, Latch. I’d like the rest of my retainer, gotta pay
Chub. Tulsa!”</p>
<p>“Always a pleasure, Spade.”</p>
