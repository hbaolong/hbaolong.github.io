<h4 id="chapter-45">Chapter 45</h4>
<p>The more “important” witnesses testified Tuesday morning. They were
all doctors with busy schedules that prevented them from having to hang
around the hallway outside the courtroom and waste time, like the other
witnesses. They were given firm dates on which to testify, with
approximate hours.</p>
<p>At 9 A.M. sharp, just after Judge Shyam welcomed everyone back and
quizzed the jurors about their general health and happiness, Dr. Samuel
Lilly was sworn in and took the stand. Cora Cook led him through the
preliminaries and established that he was well educated, suitably
experienced, and had been the chief of staff at Blue Ridge Memorial
Hospital for the past four years. He had also been the attending
physician for Eleanor Barnett and described the injuries that brought
her to the hospital.</p>
<p>In non-medical terms, she was banged up with cuts and bruises and two
broken ribs, but her condition was not life-threatening. However,
because of her age, a lengthy convalescence was expected. Referring to
his notes, he told the jury that after four days she began to show signs
of something else, which he and the nurses thought was pneumonia. Fever,
fatigue, nausea, even more aches and pains. But she was stable and there
was no sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Dr. Lilly met the defendant the day after Eleanor was admitted and
spoke with him almost every day until she died. Dr. Lilly was present
when the defendant presented a power of attorney and advance directive
to the patient as she sat propped up in her bed. Others were present,
including Dr. Connor Wilkes. Dr. Lilly viewed the situation as unusual,
but the defendant did a thorough job of explaining the necessity of the
documents and, more important, making sure Eleanor understood what she
was doing. At no time did Dr. Lilly feel as though Eleanor was being
unduly pressured or taken advantage of. However, given the situation, it
was obvious she was being advised by her attorney, the defendant.</p>
<p>Earlier, in a private conversation in the hallway, the defendant had
admitted to Dr. Lilly that he felt uncomfortable having control over the
patient’s medical directives, but there was simply no one else to do so.
No family, no friends.</p>
<p>As her condition deteriorated, the defendant was close by and
appeared deeply concerned with what was happening. The patient was
placed on a ventilator, as she could not breathe on her own. During her
last twenty-four hours, Dr. Lilly, Dr. Wilkes, and two other doctors,
along with the defendant, met to discuss their options. Mr. Latch was
adamant that he would not make the decision to terminate care. He said
it was a medical decision. Once they were unable to detect activity in
the brain, Dr. Lilly decided to remove the ventilator. The defendant
agreed, but once again said it was a medical decision. The patient died
ninety minutes later. Dr. Lilly and his staff were of the unanimous
opinion that she had died of acute viral pneumonia. At no time did they
suspect the patient had been poisoned.</p>
<p>During a lengthy and methodical cross-examination, Raymond slowly
walked the doctor through the last two days of Eleanor’s treatment, and
repeatedly drove home the point that Simon Latch had been reluctant to
take part in the conversations about her care. He was obviously troubled
by what was happening and felt out of place.</p>
<p>When Dr. Lilly was excused and walked out of the courtroom, Simon and
Raymond knew his testimony could not have been better.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next expert was Dr. Dendra Brock, the longtime medical examiner
for the Commonwealth. She was a highly respected pathologist with
thousands of autopsies under her belt. She had taught, lectured here and
there, and published dozens of articles, even a book. An impressive
résumé. As Cora began the stock questions to establish her preeminence
in the field, Raymond stood with a smile and said, “Your Honor, if I may
interrupt. The defense is perfectly willing to stipulate that Dr. Brock
is more than qualified as an expert in her field. Indeed, we feel
honored to have her in Virginia and are grateful for her long record of
outstanding public service.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cook nodded and smiled at Raymond. Judge Shyam smiled at both and
said, “Very well, Dr. Brock is hereby qualified as an expert in the
field of forensic pathology. You may proceed.”</p>
<p>In a QandandandandA that was obviously well rehearsed, Ms. Cook and
Dr. Brock went back and forth to establish the groundwork for the
autopsy of Eleanor Barnett. Her body arrived from Braxton on December 31
and was kept in the freezer until Monday, January 4, the day Dr. Brock
performed the autopsy. She had been advised by Detective Roger Barr that
there was a possibility of poisoning, and she explained in layman’s
terms how important this was to her work. There were no external signs
of a crime, though the body was badly bruised. At first glance, she knew
the bruises were several days old and not related to whatever caused her
death. She read Dr. Lilly’s notes and knew the deceased had been in an
automobile accident.</p>
<p>It was standard procedure to video and photograph each autopsy.
Eleanor’s lasted for two hours and ten minutes. Simon and Raymond had
watched it in his office, with Simon barely keeping it together. He
swore he would never watch another one.</p>
<p>Raymond stood again and said, “May it please the court, we are
stipulating that Eleanor Barnett died not from pneumonia but from acute
toxic poisoning. We have never denied this, not denying it now. It is
simply not necessary to drag this jury through the details of the
autopsy. We know how she died. We know the cause of death.”</p>
<p>Judge Shyam agreed and said, “How in-depth do you plan to go,
Ms. Cook?”</p>
<p>“Well, Your Honor, we want the jury to get a clear picture of what
caused her death.”</p>
<p>“But the defense is stipulating that the cause of death was acute
toxic poisoning.”</p>
<p>“Just some background, Your Honor, if I may.”</p>
<p>“We will proceed slowly.”</p>
<p>Raymond sat down, but was on the edge of his seat, ready for more
objections.</p>
<p>Dr. Brock had testified many times and was completely at ease. She
knew her stuff and connected with the jurors by avoiding most of the
medical jargon. Working with two assistants, she had begun the autopsy
by draining the bladder and collecting urine samples. She drained the
blood. The deceased had eaten very little but she was able to retrieve
about 11 grams of ingested food. One sample was large enough to be
dissected, and it was composed of bleached flour, white sugar, processed
ginger root, and molasses. As Cora was preparing to flash on the screen
a photo of the remains of the cookie, Raymond stood and, quite
exasperated, said, “Your Honor, really? Do we need to subject the jurors
to viewing this?”</p>
<p>“No. Sustained. We get the picture, Ms. Cook, please move along.”</p>
<p>The urine and blood contained moderate levels of an unusual
substance, later identified as thallium. Dr. Brock compared specimens of
urine and blood taken from the corpse with those taken upon admission to
the hospital, to prove the thallium was ingested while the deceased was
a patient. On the screen opposite the jurors, Ms. Cook projected a color
photograph of the liver on a lab plate, all two pounds, thirteen ounces
of it. The average weight of a human liver is 3.3 pounds, but it varies,
Dr. Brock casually explained to the jury. It was generally pink in
color, but around the left side there were darker blotches, clear signs,
to her anyway, that the liver had been heavily damaged. Next to it,
Ms. Cook projected an image of a healthy liver, no splotches. Much like
an expert chatting with students, Dr. Brock explained that the liver is
where the body metabolizes most drugs and toxicants; thus, they are
concentrated there.</p>
<p>While watching the video of the autopsy two weeks earlier, Simon
could almost feel a pain in his own liver, and vowed again to cut back
on the bourbon.</p>
<p>Other bright color photos followed: microscopic images of liver
tissues from both a once-healthy person and from the deceased; the right
kidney, weighing in at 1.6 pounds and showing darkened areas that, at
least in her opinion, proved irreversible damage due to toxins; slides
of kidney tissues; then on to the gallbladder with the spleen on
deck.</p>
<p>After an hour of gawking at Eleanor’s organs, the jurors had had
enough. Raymond stood again, even more exasperated, and said, “Please,
Your Honor, we’re trying to stipulate to the obvious here. Ms. Barnett
died of toxic poisoning. Someone poisoned her. The problem is that the
Commonwealth has the wrong defendant.”</p>
<p>If he sounded like a broken record, it was intentional. Say something
over and over and eventually folks will start to believe it. Ms. Cook
was tired of the self-serving nature of Raymond’s objections and
snapped, “Oh, we have the right defendant, Your Honor.”</p>
<p>“Please, please,” Judge Shyam said, both hands in the air. “How much
longer with this witness?”</p>
<p>Ms. Cook lost her cool and said, “Oh, I don’t know, Judge. I didn’t
realize we had a time limit.”</p>
<p>“There is no time limit, Ms. Cook. It’s just that you have proven
what needs to be proven with this witness, and the defense has agreed.
Can we please move along?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>Dr. Brock went through the procedures of collecting biological fluids
and tissue samples, labeling and storing them, then delivering them to
her preferred lab in Bethesda. The day after the autopsy, a special
courier drove the samples to the lab. At each step of the process, the
chain of custody was certified.</p>
<p>Raymond said more than once, “Your Honor, we are not questioning the
chain of custody. We’re not questioning anything pertaining to the cause
of death.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Henry Roster was a forensic toxicologist who Dr. Brock used
whenever he was available. The pair had worked several poisoning cases
together, though, thankfully, such crimes were rare. Dr. Roster’s résumé
was just as thick as Dr. Brock’s, and Raymond wanted no part of it. He
politely stipulated that the witness was a “preeminent” toxicologist and
was willing to believe anything he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Roster began by cautioning the jury that the post-mortem analysis
of drugs and poisons was extremely complicated and involved a large
number of analytical techniques in special toxicological labs. After a
lengthy description of how difficult the task was, Raymond finally
interrupted. “Your Honor, I hate to be a pest, but we are willing, once
again, to stipulate that the analysis by this esteemed researcher proves
without a doubt that Ms. Barnett died of acute toxic poisoning.”</p>
<p>“Overruled. We’ll see where it goes.”</p>
<p>Dr. Roster was not as skilled at testifying as was Dr. Brock. He
began by saying that the most commonly used drug screening tests
involved techniques known as “immunoassays.” Since perhaps three people
in the courtroom had ever heard that word, Ms. Cook pressed a key and it
appeared on the big screen. Seeing it in print did nothing to help
explain it. Dr. Roster tried. Immunoassays are tests that use antibodies
to detect reactions with suspicious substances. What’s an antibody? A
protein produced by the body to provide a defense against an antigen.
What’s an antigen? Any foreign substance that is injected into the body
and stimulates the production of antibodies.</p>
<p>Simon glanced at the jurors. Of the twelve, four had college degrees,
two had not finished high school. Three were retired, two were
unemployed, one was laid off from a job driving a forklift. As a group
they were reasonably well read and intelligent and had been attentive so
far. Roster had already lost them.</p>
<p>He was explaining the four interpretations of a drug-screening test:
a true positive, a false positive, a true negative, and a false
negative. He went on and on, trying hard to be interesting while knowing
full well that his was an impenetrable subject. One by one, the jurors
began looking around, casting about for someone to rescue them. Raymond
decided not to help. He had tried repeatedly to speed things along, only
to be stymied by Her Honor.</p>
<p>Ms. Cook tried to liven things up with more color slides, and
Dr. Roster managed to inch away from the boredom. He drowned, though,
when he was forced to confront a “chromatographic detection.” Sorry, but
the term could not be avoided. Nor could it be suitably explained in
under five minutes. It was an analytical procedure used to separate
compounds and drugs.</p>
<p>To save them all, Judge Shyam interrupted with “Ms. Cook, it’s ten
minutes after twelve and the jury is ready for lunch. How much longer
with this witness?” Her tone left no doubt that this witness had said
enough.</p>
<p>“Oh, not much, Your Honor. Less than ten minutes.”</p>
<p>“And Mr. Lassiter, how much time for your cross-examination?”</p>
<p>“My cross? Hell, Judge, I’ve been trying to agree with everything the
expert said, what little of it I can understand.”</p>
<p>It was a smart retort and not overly humorous, but in pressurized
settings like packed courtrooms the slightest effort at levity or
mockery was often rewarded with roaring laughter. The crowd guffawed and
bellowed and seemed to savor the moment by blowing off steam. Judge
Shyam saw the humor and grinned along, until it was time to call for
order. She tapped her gavel and said, “Very well. We’ll wrap up this
witness and go to lunch.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Raymond enjoyed bantering with highly educated and erudite experts in
front of common-folk jurors who were not always that sophisticated. He
began with “Now, Dr. Roster, I live in the town of Braxton, population
thirty thousand, same as my client, Simon Latch. Let’s say I had a
problem with rats in my barn and I wanted to get rid of them. Where
would I go to purchase some thallium?”</p>
<p>“It’s not possible. Thallium is not sold in this country.”</p>
<p>“And why not?”</p>
<p>“Well, its production was outlawed years ago. For a while it was
used, legally, in rat and mouse poison, but then that was stopped,
too.”</p>
<p>“Why was it removed from rat poison?”</p>
<p>“Because too many domestic animals were eating it and dying.”</p>
<p>“It’s very dangerous, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes.”</p>
<p>“And why is that?”</p>
<p>“Well, in layman’s terms, it’s tasteless, odorless, colorless, and
lethal.”</p>
<p>“In fact, Dr. Roster, it has a long and sordid history of being the
preferred poison for murderers, correct?”</p>
<p>“That’s the legend, sir. I’m not sure that’s been proven
scientifically. That’s a bit out of my field.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough. You work for one of the leading labs in the country,
correct?”</p>
<p>“We like to think so, yes.”</p>
<p>“And does your lab keep an inventory of various poisons, toxins, and
so on?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s crucial to our work.”</p>
<p>“How many?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Hundreds. We have a procurement staff that does
nothing but find and inventory compounds, illicit drugs, toxins,
poisons, all with approval of the Food and Drug Administration, I might
add.”</p>
<p>“So you keep a supply of thallium?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where do you get it?”</p>
<p>Dr. Roster thought for a second then shrugged. “I wasn’t prepared to
answer that question, sir. If given an hour or so, I could contact the
lab and get the answer to your question.”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother. Where does thallium originate?”</p>
<p>“It’s a metal that’s found just under the crust of the earth and is
collected as a by-product to the mining of other metals, such as zinc
and copper.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s say I wanted to poison someone and decided to use
thallium. Where would I find it?”</p>
<p>“I have no experience with that, sir.”</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s been the favorite choice for murderers for decades,
both here and abroad, then somebody somewhere has to know where to find
it, right?”</p>
<p>Dr. Roster shrugged again, as if playing along. “I suppose.”</p>
<p>“So who would you contact to ask around, you know? How would you
begin your search for a little box of thallium?”</p>
<p>“Sir, again, that is outside the scope of my knowledge and
experience.”</p>
<p>“That’s kinda bizarre, Doctor, if you ask me. You, one of the premier
forensic toxicologists in the nation, if not the world, do not have a
clue where to go or who to call to purchase thallium. Is this what
you’re telling the jury?”</p>
<p>“I guess, Mr. Lassiter. I would not know who to call.”</p>
<p>“Then how in the world would a small-town lawyer from Braxton,
Virginia, an honest man who’s never heard of thallium, know how to get
his hands on the perfect poison?”</p>
<p>“I suppose you’ll have to ask him.”</p>
<p>“You’re confused, sir. He’s not on the witness stand. You are. Can
you answer my question?”</p>
<p>“I cannot.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think so. You say you’ve worked as a forensic toxicologist
for twenty-seven years. How many times have you testified in a murder
case involving thallium?”</p>
<p>“Twice. This is the third one.”</p>
<p>“Where was the first one?”</p>
<p>Cora Cook stood and said, “Your Honor, objection. Relevancy. Are we
really going to revisit these old cases that have absolutely nothing to
do with this one?”</p>
<p>Before Judge Shyam could speak, Raymond thundered in with “Hang on,
Judge. This is a cross-examination! I’m allowed to explore all manner of
irrelevant material. The Commonwealth has certainly been doing so.”</p>
<p>Judge Shyam patiently said, “Okay, overruled for now. But there are
limits, Mr. Lassiter.”</p>
<p>Raymond glared at Roster as if he’d caught him lying. “Where was the
first one, sir?”</p>
<p>“Ohio, 1998.”</p>
<p>“That was the McGregor case, right?” Raymond asked as he looked at
the jurors, as if to say, “Aren’t I clever?”</p>
<p>“I believe so.” Roster suddenly realized Raymond knew as much about
the old case as he did, so he added, “Yes, McGregor.”</p>
<p>“And he was found not guilty, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct.”</p>
<p>“And where did Mr. McGregor get the poison, the thallium?”</p>
<p>“Well, it was alleged that he stole it from a lab in Cincinnati, but
I don’t believe that was ever proven.”</p>
<p>Raymond turned for his seat and said loudly, “Not guilty. Not guilty
on all counts.”</p>
