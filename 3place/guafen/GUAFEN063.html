<h4 id="chapter-62">Chapter 62</h4>
<p>Three days later, on July 18, Simon drove four hours nonstop to
Scranton, Pennsylvania, and found Mulrooney’s law firm in a
nineteenth-century warehouse overlooking a river. The massive redbrick
building was as long as a football field and had once been a foundry
before being abandoned for decades. Now it was bustling with shops,
offices, and condos. The firm’s expansive suite occupied one corner of
the second floor and was beautifully decorated with subtle paint colors,
Persian rugs, local art, and hidden lights. The old, worn floors had
been refurbished. The steel ceiling beams were exposed. The place reeked
of money, of big verdicts and even more lucrative settlements. Its
opulence reminded Simon of Marshall Graff’s spread in Virginia Beach,
and that reminded him of his trial, a nightmare he tried to avoid. It
also reminded him that he had practiced law in another world, one far
away in his quaint little office at the corner of Main and Maple,
downtown Braxton. Former office.</p>
<p>Victor Mulrooney was old-school and still wearing dark suits and silk
ties, even around the office. His associate, Hilary, wore jeans and
sneakers. They met Simon in a small conference room with three walls of
glass and impressive views. They sipped coffee for a moment, but only as
a formality. Hilary, a senior associate, was allowed to speak whenever
she wanted to.</p>
<p>“We’ve gone through your file, Mr. Latch,” she said. “Quite a lot of
press.”</p>
<p>“It’s Simon. You’ve probably seen more news reports than I have. I’ve
been dodging reporters and their outlets for many months. I know it’s
all bad.”</p>
<p>“I had a nice conversation with Raymond Lassiter. He says the defense
was surprised by the verdict.”</p>
<p>“Still stunned. I didn’t testify because we were confident the
Commonwealth did not prove its case. That was a miscalculation. I’d
rather not talk about the trial. You know why I’m here.”</p>
<p>Mulrooney said, “Yes. Raymond and I discussed it. He seems quite the
character.”</p>
<p>Simon nodded politely but had no interest in talking about Raymond,
regardless of how colorful he might seem. “Can you answer a few basic
questions?”</p>
<p>“We’ll see. You understand our situation, Mr. Latch.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and you understand mine. In a month I go before the trial judge
to be sentenced to prison for something I didn’t do.”</p>
<p>“I believe you’re innocent, Mr. Latch.”</p>
<p>“Then help me.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that easy. We have an agreement with the defendant—”</p>
<p>“Fendamar Health.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and we cannot discuss the matter. There are some rather harsh
penalties for violating the nondisclosure agreement.”</p>
<p>“Got that. Did your client have a claim that involved an X-ray
technician by the name of Oscar Kofie?”</p>
<p>Mulrooney looked at Hilary. The answer was obvious. He said,
“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Was your client either Mr. Herbert Grasskie or Ms. Ruth Abercrombie?
Both died here in Fendamar Hospital under mysterious circumstances. We
have their medical records and we know that Kofie was at the hospital
when they died.”</p>
<p>“You have their records?” Hilary asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Enough piles of paper to cover this desk.”</p>
<p>“But how?”</p>
<p>“I have secrets too. But the answer is easy. Just hire the right
people and turn ’em loose. Illegal as hell but for some reason I really
don’t care right now. If I have to break a few more laws, what’s the
downside? I’m looking for the truth.”</p>
<p>Mulrooney’s facial expressions were almost noncommittal, but he
absorbed this with a hint of admiration, even satisfaction. He said, “We
represented both families.”</p>
<p>“Were they poisoned?”</p>
<p>“Here’s the way we’ll handle this, Mr. Latch. I’m not willing to run
the risk of violating the nondisclosure agreement. Wouldn’t be fair to
me, this firm, or our clients. But there might be a way around it, a way
to give you what you’re looking for while keeping us safe. The hospital
has some very tough lawyers and will not hesitate to seek damages from a
breach. But, sir, you are indeed on the right track.”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>Hilary cleared her throat, flashed a conspiratorial look at
Mulrooney, and said, “There is a person who might talk. His name is Alan
Teel, and he was a junior partner in this firm until he left three years
ago. He burned out, to put it mildly. If you need to know more about
that, ask him. Alan was our colleague and a truly gifted trial lawyer,
very hard worker, very committed, some would say overly zealous. When he
crashed and burned he quit the law. Resigned from the firm, surrendered
his license, the works. It was a fairly dramatic exit from the legal
profession.”</p>
<p>Mulrooney said, “We tried to help him, paid for therapists and
doctors and such. And he got better, but he was completely fed up with
litigation and the law.”</p>
<p>Simon asked, “Was he a member of the firm when it settled the cases
and signed the nondisclosure agreements?”</p>
<p>Mulrooney said, “No. He knows everything, but the NDA is not binding
on him. That’s why he might talk.”</p>
<p>“Where is he?”</p>
<p>“A small town about an hour from here.”</p>
<p>“Do you mind calling him?”</p>
<p>“He knows you’re coming,” Hilary said.</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon was eating a BLT in the town’s only diner when Alan Teel walked
in, twenty minutes late. He wore a beard, shorts, a T-shirt, and hiking
boots, and nothing in his appearance suggested he had ever been a star
in the courtroom. They were the same age—forty-three. Simon offered to
buy lunch but it was already 3:15.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late,” he said. “We had a fire call and I’m on duty.”</p>
<p>“You’re a fireman?”</p>
<p>“Volunteer. Town’s too small for a professional department.”</p>
<p>“Mind if I ask how you picked this place?”</p>
<p>“How much did Mulrooney tell you about me?”</p>
<p>“Some of the basics. I assume your story has many chapters.”</p>
<p>Teel laughed and asked the waitress for some coffee. “I try to avoid
Mulrooney, another long story. I’m still friendly with Hilary and she
made the call, gave me the heads-up. I went online and read about your
recent adventures. Quite the media star these days.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Had you seen the story before now?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t read newspapers and I ignore the television and use the
internet only when necessary.”</p>
<p>“That’s enviable.”</p>
<p>“You flamed out of the profession with headlines. I left it in the
middle of the night.” The waitress placed a cup of steaming coffee on
the table and Teel took a long drink without the slightest grimace.</p>
<p>“I’m facing prison for the rest of my life, Alan, and I haven’t
killed anyone. I need some help.”</p>
<p>A long slow minute passed as Alan stared at something on the floor.
Simon finished his sandwich and drank some tea.</p>
<p>Alan asked, “Ms. Barnett was poisoned, right?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Thallium.”</p>
<p>“Was Oscar Kofie working at the hospital when she was a patient?”</p>
<p>“He was.”</p>
<p>Alan glanced at his watch and said, “Look, I can’t talk right now. My
son has a baseball game at six and I have to get the field ready. I’m
the grounds crew. Pays as much as a volunteer fireman. Come to the game
and we’ll sit together, have a long talk.”</p>
<p>“How old is your son?”</p>
<p>“Ten. My youngest.”</p>
<p>“I have a daughter who’s ten, a soccer star.”</p>
<p>“Can you handle a weed-eater?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t had much practice but I’m sure I can.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<hr />
<p>At six, they were sitting in lawn chairs just beyond the left-field
fence, under the shade of an old tree, sipping cold lemonade and
admiring their handiwork. The field was pristine, and Alan took full
credit for its perfect condition. He did everything, from fertilizing
the grass, trimming it three times a week, grooming the dirt infield,
raking the mound and batter’s boxes, and pulling and cutting weeds. He
had even painted the dugouts and repaired an old scoreboard.</p>
<p>After three hours together, Simon was still uncertain as to what,
exactly, the man did for a living, if anything. He appeared to be a
full-time volunteer.</p>
<p>And he was content to get out of the way and let others do the
coaching. Once the field was ready and the perfect chalk lines were
down, he retreated to his favorite spot in the shade, far away from home
plate. He had yet to mention a wife, either current or ex. Simon figured
they would never meet again and didn’t press for details. Hayden, his
son, played second base for the Marlins and struggled at the plate. When
he struck out to end the first inning, Alan, showing no disappointment
at all, began talking.</p>
<p>“A secretary in the law firm got an anonymous phone call about the
death of Herbert Grasskie, age eighty-one, lived somewhere around
Scranton or Wilkes-Barre. Said his death was not caused by pneumonia.
Rather, he was poisoned. Mulrooney assigned me the case and I started
digging. Autopsy, toxicology tests, the works. Took about two weeks to
confirm the cause of death was thallium. I’m sure you know all about the
toxin.”</p>
<p>“More than enough.”</p>
<p>“The perfect poison to kill with. More digging and we found another
case in the same hospital. Two months earlier a seventy-two-year-old
woman named Ruth Abercrombie died a similar death. We really opened the
bank at that point, eventually spent over three hundred thousand dollars
on the investigation. Mulrooney took charge, as only he could do, which
wasn’t a bad thing. He’s brilliant, both in court and out. And we knew
that Fendamar Health has very deep pockets. It’s owned by a private
equity fund out of Boston that’s worth zillions. You can imagine how
valuable the cases were—two wrongful deaths caused by a demented
hospital employee who likes to play with poisons. The cases were pots of
gold and we were all losing sleep with excitement. For various reasons I
won’t waste time with, our suspicions soon centered around an X-ray tech
named Oscar Kofie, a truly strange character.”</p>
<p>“Slow down. How did you choose Kofie?”</p>
<p>“Bribery and espionage. Mulrooney managed to keep the cases away from
the police because he didn’t want to frighten the killer. We found a
nurse who claimed she saw Kofie in Ms. Abercrombie’s room when he had no
business being there. We paid the nurse cold cash to dig some more. And
we hired a technician from another hospital, a spy really, to get a job
at Fendamar. He did and it worked beautifully. We were in no hurry, you
see, because another poisoning would only bolster our case. Pretty sick,
really, looking back now, but at the time we were out of control and
terribly excited. Our spy befriended Kofie, which wasn’t difficult
because he didn’t have many friends, and they became drinking buddies.
Then they did drugs. Kofie liked to talk about poisons and toxins. We
also hired an ex-DEA guy, called himself a consultant, to poke around in
the black market. Thallium is not that hard to find because it’s not
illegal to possess. It’s just against the law to produce it. Our
consultant found a broker in a shady lab in New Jersey and was able to
track a shipment to Scranton, to a post office box rented to a guy with
a fake name. The trail ended there, but the shipment confirmed our
suspicions. Our spy finally got inside Kofie’s apartment, which had
security alarms and cameras at both exterior doors, but nothing more
inside. The boys from the hospital, three or four of them, including our
mole, had a late-night vodka and coke binge while watching porn videos.
Keep in mind these are the people we entrust with our health care. The
spy managed to stay somewhat lucid, and when the others passed out, he
looked around the apartment. Wasn’t much to see. Two small bedrooms, a
den and a kitchen. One bedroom door was locked solid but there were no
visible alarms. A weekend trip to watch a Steelers game materialized,
with our guy suddenly in possession of four tickets, plus he found cheap
rooms. He said that Kofie admitted he’d never had so many friends. When
they were at the game, a security team entered his apartment, disabled
the alarms, opened the locked bedroom door, and found two metal boxes,
similar to toolboxes. They removed them from the apartment and rushed
them to a hotel room where their technicians were waiting. Got one open
and found enough coke and assorted pills to put him away for years. In
the other they found a little pharmacy, with several plastic bottles of
poisons—arsenic, cyanide, strychnine, aconitine, and of course,
thallium. They were not labeled and the team was not equipped to
identify them, so they took a small sample from each container and,
later, ran them through a lab. Everything was put back in order, and, as
far as we could tell, Kofie never suspected the break-in.”</p>
<p>Teel’s son made a diving catch at second and doubled-up the runner at
first. It was a spectacular play for a ten-year-old, yet Teel showed no
reaction. He was lost in his story.</p>
<p>“At that point, we made a strategic decision. ‘We’? It was really
Mulrooney, the one and only boss. I didn’t like the way the case was
going so I took a back seat, though I was still in the room. Mulrooney
decided to deal with the hospital directly and not involve the police.
He demanded a huge settlement in hush money. If Fendamar would pay him
the fortune and get rid of Kofie, he would not file a billion-dollar
lawsuit, nor would he go to the cops. The hospital’s lawyers were tough,
but so is Mulrooney. They beat each other up for a few months then
reached a settlement. Pay the fortune, sign a nondisclosure in blood,
bury the story, run Kofie out of town, and everybody’s happy. That was
about the time I left the firm.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Why? Because I was disgusted with Mulrooney. He was agreeing to take
the money and in return allow a murderer to walk away unpunished. We
fought and I remember asking Mulrooney what he would do one day when he
heard that Kofie had killed again.”</p>
<p>“And that day is here.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“What was his response?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much. A shrug that said, ‘So what?’ ”</p>
<p>Simon’s mouth was dry and he sipped some lemonade.</p>
<p>Teel had a dip in his lip and spat on the grass. “I had two allies in
the firm who wanted to stand our ground, file a big suit, and go the
distance. We wanted Kofie brought to trial and sent to prison. We wanted
to expose Fendamar, though, in all fairness, the hospital is
well-thought-of around here. But we were no match for Mulrooney. He just
wanted the money.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say because it’s in the NDA.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit. Everything you’ve just told me is covered by the NDA,
which you’re not subject to, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s far from certain and it has not been tested. It’s a thick and
complicated document that, believe me, nobody on our side wants to
litigate. I could get in trouble for talking.”</p>
<p>“You’re obviously not afraid of it.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t care. I have few assets and have no plans to acquire
anything else. Life is simple. I like it this way.”</p>
<p>“Mulrooney’s life is not simple.”</p>
<p>“No, he’s quite complicated. But he’s struggling right now because he
knows his own greed has led to more killings. The man’s got a soul,
buried deep somewhere.”</p>
<p>“He also got a lot of money.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he did. He got a huge slice of the deal and took his fee
offshore, tax-free.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“Lots of rumors around the firm. No one in the firm knows for sure
because Mulrooney routed the money through Singapore and parts unknown,
but the best guess is that Fendamar paid around fifty million.”</p>
