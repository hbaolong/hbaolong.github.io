<h4 id="chapter-42">Chapter 42</h4>
<p>In the first week of May two events occurred at virtually the same
time, and though neither could rescue Simon from the ugly prospect of
being put on trial for murder, they provided the first glimmer of good
luck he had seen in months.</p>
<p>First, Paula sold the house in Braxton for more than the list price.
After paying off both mortgages, she netted 8,000, a windfall no one was
expecting. Simon did the paperwork and charged nothing for the closing.
At the last minute, Paula told her ex that she would pay ,000 in legal
fees for his services. It was a fine, generous gesture and, after first
protesting meekly, Simon agreed to take the money.</p>
<p>Two days later, his mother called with the welcome news that after
twenty-seven unhappy years she was splitting with Arn. Things were
somewhat amicable, and they had agreed to a division of the assets. With
Arn’s name off her bank accounts, she was now in charge of her money.
She was sending her son 0,000 to help with his legal bills. He accepted
the money, called it a loan, and promised to repay it at some
undetermined time in the future. He was proud of her for showing the
courage to walk away from a bad marriage at the age of seventy-three and
take her savings with her. He did not know how much money she had
squirreled away and he was not about to ask. Never, ever again would he
pry into the financial affairs of a senior citizen. On the phone, she
sounded ten years younger and was planning a trip to the Greek Isles
with some friends. However, if he needed her to be in the courtroom she
would happily postpone the trip. He thanked her and promised to consider
it.</p>
<p>Off to the Greek Isles with a pocketful of money. He was headed to a
courtroom where he would either be condemned to prison or narrowly
escape with nothing but the shirt on his back. He had not envied his
mother in many years; indeed, he had pitied her because she was stuck
with a turd like Arn. Now, she seemed like the luckiest person he
knew.</p>
<p>Simon did not want his mother or his children anywhere near the
courtroom. He and Paula had discussed the trial at length. It would be
impossible to shield the kids from the publicity. Even if the local news
in Danville ignored the story, there would be an avalanche of crap
online. On the phone, he and Paula had floated the idea of a nightly
recap of the trial with the children. She could review the news stories
and hold a discussion that would include the facts as presented by the
press. It seemed a slightly better idea than simply ignoring the trial
and dreaming the kids might somehow escape it. Simon was not afraid of
the truth and wanted his children to know that he was not guilty of
anything, other than perhaps a little bad judgment. Still, the visual of
him going to and from the courthouse, with a horde following and all
manner of sensational coverage by the talking heads, was not
pleasant.</p>
<p>When the check arrived from his mother, Simon promptly deposited it
in his firm’s account and wrote another one to Raymond for legal fees.
0,000. He walked it over to Raymond’s office that night and handed it to
him. “One eighty to go,” he said proudly.</p>
<p>“Where’d you get this?” Raymond asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>Simon told him the story. The lawyer put the check in a drawer.</p>
<p>Raymond had talked to some attorney friends in the Tidewater area and
was now firmly convinced that moving the case there was of great benefit
to Simon. It was far away from the Blue Ridge Mountains and in another
world.</p>
<p>To replace Mary Blankenship Pointer, the supreme court had appointed
Padma Shyam, one of three female judges on the Virginia Beach Circuit
Court. She was forty-six years old, had been on the bench for nine
years, and annually received the highest ratings not only from her
colleagues, but also from lawyers who appeared before her.</p>
<p>Simon had a good friend from law school who practiced in Chesapeake,
next door to Virginia Beach, and the guy raved about Judge Shyam.</p>
<p>Both Raymond and Simon had fretted over Judge Pointer’s recusal. They
knew her well and thought they understood her leanings and
eccentricities. She was a tough law-and-order judge, but she was
unfailingly fair to both sides. Simon was still smarting from the 00,000
bond she had required for his release, not to mention the seven nights
in jail, but he had forgiven her and had convinced himself she would
give him a break if needed.</p>
<p>Now, though, she was forgotten, at least for the murder trial.
Raymond had chatted twice with Judge Shyam and felt comfortable with
her. She, too, was worried about publicity and too much press. She had
the idea of selecting the jury a week before the announced trial date of
May 23. The court clerk could quietly summons fifty or so prospects to
an empty courtroom, and the lawyers could grill them about serving on
the jury. If more were needed, call another fifty. If they could keep
the story away from the press, the majority of the jurors would not know
about the case. But if they waited until Monday, May 23, the courthouse
would be a circus and the prospective jurors would have to walk through
a throng just to get to the courtroom. By then, the story would be
front-page. An uninformed and impartial jury would be almost
impossible.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam warmed up to her own idea. The lawyers thought it would
work well. She had never held jury selection before the actual start
date of a trial, but there was no procedural rule against it. She also
liked the idea of a gag order to quieten the lawyers and witnesses.
Raymond, a trial lawyer who loved to see his name in the newspapers,
agreed wholeheartedly. He promised not to say a word about the trial and
to keep Simon quiet as well.</p>
<p>Simon had no intention of showing his face outside the courtroom.</p>
<hr />
<p>Through many late-night meetings they had slowly pieced together a
defense strategy that was both bold and risky. There was no direct
evidence against Simon—no one had seen him buy the thallium and there
was nothing to link him to its acquisition. No one had seen him lace the
ginger cookies with the poison, nor feed them to Eleanor Barnett. The
indirect evidence would undoubtedly be used to create a great deal of
suspicion around his actions, but it was not enough to convict. The
prosecution would be forced to rely on circumstantial evidence to
convince jurors of his guilt.</p>
<p>Raymond had leaned on a friend who knew a pathologist who agreed to
study the autopsy for only ,000, a greatly reduced fee. Dr. Brock, the
state medical examiner who performed it, had impressive credentials and
experience and would make a believable witness for the Commonwealth.
Same for the forensic toxicologist. To attack both would require finding
other experts with unimpeachable qualifications who were willing to
testify. And they would cost a fortune.</p>
<p>Raymond’s friend agreed with the conclusions of the autopsy.</p>
<p>So why bother? Why attack the experts? The smarter approach was to
admit almost everything. Admit Eleanor died of thallium poisoning. Admit
Simon bought the ginger cookies at Tan Lu’s, a place he had taken her
for lunch three times. Admit she liked the food there and so did he.
Admit Matilda visited Eleanor in the hospital on three occasions, twice
taking her ginger cookies and other goodies. Admit the will. Admit the
power of attorney. Admit the retainer agreement. Admit everything that
was true and obvious.</p>
<p>But deny vehemently that Simon poisoned the cookies. Obviously,
someone did, but it wasn’t Simon.</p>
<p>So who did it? That was a problem for the police and prosecutors, not
for Simon. He was under no obligation to solve the crime.</p>
<p>His only obligation was to save his own skin.</p>
