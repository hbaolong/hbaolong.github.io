<h4 id="chapter-43">Chapter 43</h4>
<p>Monday, May 23.</p>
<p>Simon was awake staring at the digital clock when it chirped at 5
A.M.</p>
<p>It was depressing to begin a day knowing full well that the day would
be one of the worst in his life. It was even more depressing to think
that tomorrow would be even worse and the following days would only
spiral down. He needed strong coffee but there was none in the budget
hotel “suite” he had reserved for the next five days. After two nights
he was having fond memories of the Braxton city jail.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only bright spot at the moment was the fact that his head
was clear; no cobwebs, no dull pain. If Raymond could swear off booze
during the trial, then so could his client. He allowed himself five
minutes to stare at the dark ceiling and listen to the grind of diesel
engines in eighteen-wheelers passing each other on one of the
Tidewater’s endless six-lane bypasses. Dawn was an hour away but the
traffic was already making noise. Where was he and how did he get there?
That question had dogged him for months now, and with effort he could
almost piece together a narrative. For the much larger question—Where
was he going?—there was no answer, only fear.</p>
<p>The awful day was not going away. It had to be confronted, and if not
outright challenged then at least stared down with a faux confidence
that he could handle anything the mighty Commonwealth of Virginia threw
at him. He kicked off the covers, planted his feet on the cheap carpet,
and realized he was already tired. Then he showered quickly and dressed
as he had been told. Raymond suggested a dark suit, white shirt, bland
tie, nothing that might irritate a juror. As a former gambler, Simon
would bet ,000 on the spot that none of the seven male jurors waiting to
judge him would be wearing a tie.</p>
<p>Seven men, five women; nine whites, two blacks, one Asian. Two
alternates. He knew their names, occupations, religions, educational
backgrounds, and so on. The previous Wednesday, they had been selected
in an empty courtroom in less than three hours. Of the forty-eight in
the first panel summoned by the clerk, only seven raised their hands
when asked if they knew anything about the case. Over half had never
heard of Braxton, Virginia. The defense was thrilled with the lack of
notoriety. A second panel was not needed. Judge Shyam was a wizard in
the courtroom and flawlessly officiated the selection of the jury.
Raymond said it was the fairest process he had ever seen in his
forty-plus years.</p>
<p>Her Honor was also quite prescient in anticipating publicity. The
Sunday edition of the Tidewater Times had a front-page story with a
stock photo of Simon, complete with all of the sensational allegations
against him. It included hints about the mysterious last will and
testament, the alleged fortune, the power of attorney signed on her
deathbed, the advance directive which allowed him to pull the plug, the
fortuitous passing on December 30, the cremation angle, then the proof
of poisoning. On page two there were other stories, one filled with
random man-on-the-street comments from folks in Braxton. Most hid behind
requests for anonymity. Another story traced the history of
murder-by-poison in America and used FBI statistics. Thallium has a long
and sordid history with murder.</p>
<p>Simon was nauseous when he read the stories, but also grateful the
jury had already been selected. Now that it was empaneled, it had been
strongly admonished by Her Honor to avoid the press if possible, speak
to no one about the case, and, most important, keep an open mind until
all the evidence had been presented. She had dwelt on the presumption of
innocence and lectured the jury on the basic principle that Simon Latch
was innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>It certainly sounded strong last Wednesday in an empty courtroom.
Today, though, the courtroom would be crowded with journalists of every
stripe and ilk, along with dozens of spectators and courthouse regulars.
Additional bailiffs and guards had been summoned by Judge Shyam.</p>
<p>As he left his room he stopped to examine himself in the mirror. His
pants were loose because he was quite a bit thinner than he’d been
before the indictment. Landy, his de facto girlfriend, had said more
than once that his face was gaunt and he had bags under his eyes.
Raymond said it was important for him to maintain a pleasant look on his
face, nothing fake or goofy, just an occasional quick smile, maybe a nod
here and there, and never a frown nor a look of concern, though, at the
same time, never a look of cockiness or indignation.</p>
<p>Thanks, Raymond. Anything else? Any other tricks to try with my face
while I’m trying to listen, analyze, and remember every word spoken in
court, and also taking pages of notes while stealing glances at the
jurors?</p>
<p>It was still dark when he left the hotel and headed toward Virginia
Beach, three miles away. He saw an all-night pancake house and stopped
for coffee. He bought the Monday edition of the Tidewater Times, and
once again saw his face on the front page.</p>
<hr />
<p>Raymond had no shortage of trial lawyer buddies around the
Commonwealth. Marshall Graff was the king of torts in Virginia Beach and
had offered his offices to the defense. They were impressive, a far cry
from anything in Braxton. Expensive, ultra-modern furnishings, a
splendid conference room with twenty leather chairs around a long, wide
table, enough offices to house his twenty-five-lawyer team and support
staff, and on the third floor a small workroom where Raymond set up shop
with a view of the courthouse.</p>
<p>Simon walked in at 7 A.M. and found the coffeepot. Raymond and Casey
Noland arrived a few minutes later. Raymond said he was ready, said it
was “showtime,” said if you weren’t nervous the first day of the trial,
then something was wrong. He told a couple first-day stories that were
hard to follow.</p>
<p>Simon listened as he kept an eye on the street in front of the
courthouse. The television vans were arriving and being herded to the
proper spots by a small army of city policemen. Barricades were in place
to keep the sidewalks clear of reporters and onlookers. The jurors would
enter through a side door, away from the press. Simon had his own
strategy, one that Marshall Graff had put together with his
paralegals.</p>
<p>At 8:30, Raymond and Casey loaded their thick briefcases and walked
to the front entrance of the courthouse. They attracted plenty of
attention, and a smiling Raymond enjoyed bantering with the reporters
while saying nothing. They wanted to know where his client was hiding.
Raymond said Simon was sleeping in that morning.</p>
<p>An associate of Marshall Graff’s drove Simon to a service entrance,
where he jumped out by the dumpsters and entered, unseen. At 8:55, he
strode into the courtroom with Raymond and Casey, took a seat at the
defense table, and tried not to notice the crowd watching him.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam assumed the bench at precisely 9 A.M. and said good
morning. She went through her usual spiel about the trial and her rules
governing the decorum in her courtroom. She gave a general outline of
how the trial would progress and predicted it would be completed by the
end of the week, but there was no rush. She informed the crowd that the
jury had already been selected and asked the bailiffs to bring the
jurors. They entered, some rather tentatively, and assumed their
numbered chairs in the jury box.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam nodded at Cora Cook, who rose and walked purposefully to
the podium in front of the jurors. Not a single garment in her closet
could be considered conservative, but she was still quite impressive in
solid black. The heels were not quite as high and the skirt wasn’t quite
as tight, but she kept a nice figure and knew how to display it. The
jurors looked her over while she smiled and said hello. Then she began
with an obsequious opening in which she thanked the jurors repeatedly
for their service, and so on.</p>
<p>Simon scribbled on his legal pad, “as if they have a choice???”</p>
<p>Cora got to the heart of the matter soon enough. “This is a case of
murder driven by greed.” Her words were delivered solemnly, with a nice
dramatic flair. Simon could feel the jurors’ eyes boring down upon him.
He did not look up.</p>
<p>“In March of last year, in the town of Braxton, up in the Blue Ridge
Mountains, a lovely lady named Eleanor Barnett, a widow with no
children, made an appointment to see a lawyer named Simon Latch, the
defendant.” Cora paused for more drama and pointed at Simon. He nodded
gravely at her finger as if to say, Yes, that’s me but you got the wrong
person.</p>
<p>“Ms. Barnett was eighty-five years old and wanted to make a new will.
The defendant had been a lawyer in Braxton for eighteen years, was well
known, and had prepared many simple, inexpensive wills. The meeting took
place as scheduled on March the tenth in his office on Main Street. At
some point during the first meeting, the defendant realized that a
simple will would not be sufficient for Ms. Barnett, at least not in his
opinion. She was not an average client. Indeed, she said she had
millions of dollars in assets, and no debts. She claimed to own stock in
Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart and said she kept several million dollars in cash
in a bank in Atlanta. Greed entered the picture and the defendant
decided on a different course of action. For the previous twelve years,
his secretary, Matilda Clark, had typed every will in the office. It’s
fairly routine legal work. But for some reason, the defendant did not
allow Ms. Clark to prepare the will, but rather typed it himself and
said nothing to his secretary about it. From that moment on, the
defendant had a scheme to ingratiate himself to Ms. Barnett and get as
much of her money as possible.”</p>
<p>Simon scribbled, “So far, so good, pretty much on point, got her
facts straight. Why am I sweating already?”</p>
<p>Raymond had warned him that most prosecutors try to dehumanize their
targets by referring to them only as the defendant. Cora was following
the playbook.</p>
<p>She said, “Unfortunately, the scheme ended in the poisoning and death
of Ms. Barnett.” In another effort at high drama, she pointed at him
again and said, “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Ms. Barnett died at
the hands of her own lawyer, this defendant sitting right here.”</p>
<p>Cora then made a harmless mistake by talking about the will the
defendant prepared and typed himself. She lost the jury for the moment
when she tried to explain some of the trusts. Simon watched them and
knew they were either confused or bored.</p>
<p>His mind wandered. To be called a murderer and put on trial would be
a nightmarish ordeal even for a guilty person. The horror was the
potential punishment: death by lethal injection, or decades in prison.
But for an innocent man, the entire charade was overwhelming and
surreal. Simon kept telling himself that it wasn’t really happening,
that at some pivotal moment the judge would stop everything, dismiss the
jury, admonish the prosecutor, and instruct the defendant to walk out of
the courthouse, an innocent man. And, oh by the way, sorry for the
trouble. But with each hour of each day, he was quietly growing
accustomed to the role of the accused. The grinding machinery of
American justice was often slow to start, but once the disparate
elements finally came together at one time and in one place—the
courtroom—there was no stopping the train wreck.</p>
<p>Cora returned to his scheming ways and the jury perked up. The
defendant typed the will, then convinced an insurance agent and his wife
next door to witness it, then tried his best to keep it quiet. Because
of a quirk in our estate tax laws, it would be greatly advantageous to
the heirs if Ms. Barnett died in calendar year 2015. Thus, the defendant
had a deadline. He slowly befriended Ms. Barnett, spent more time with
her, took her to many long lunches, all of which he paid for. During one
outing, the couple discovered a Vietnamese restaurant in Braxton.
Ms. Barnett especially liked the Saigon ginger cookies the place was
known for.</p>
<p>On a large screen hung from the wall across from the jury, Cora
flashed a color photo of one of the ginger cookies. Flat, about two
inches in diameter. Then she added a photo of the Tan Lu’s box. For .25
you got a dozen cookies. The last photo was a small mound of white
powder on a lab test tray. It resembled baking soda. She said it was a
sample of thallium, a poison no longer produced in America but not
illegal to possess. Until recently it was commonly used in rat poison.
Most of it came from China and India. It was odorless, tasteless,
invisible when mixed with other substances, and lethal.</p>
<p>In a movement that was quite dramatic, Cora walked to the exhibit
table near the bench and from a cardboard box removed a standard,
plastic hospital tray. Two of Tan Lu’s boxes were in the center of it.
She held it in front of the jury and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, here’s
the murder weapon. Eleven cookies. Nine in one box, two in the other,
all laced with thallium. The thirteen that are missing were consumed by
the victim. All were purchased by the defendant on two separate days
last December, then taken by his secretary to the hospital room of
Eleanor Barnett. After the cookies were consumed over a one-week period,
Ms. Barnett died of acute toxic poisoning. Her death was slow, painful,
and agonizing. The state medical examiner will describe the condition of
her body.”</p>
<p>The courtroom was perfectly still. Everyone watched as Cora carefully
placed the tray back in the cardboard box. She handled it as if the
slightest jiggle might unleash the thallium and kill her, the court
reporter, maybe the judge as well.</p>
<p>She returned to the podium and flipped through her notes. Simon could
almost feel the stares from some of the jurors, and they were not
conveying sympathy.</p>
<p>“Now, once Ms. Barnett was dead, the defendant tried desperately to
cover his tracks, to hide the evidence.” She lifted a document and waved
it around. “This is called an advance directive. Also known as a living
will. Typed up by the defendant, presented to Ms. Barnett in the
hospital, probably while she was eating the cookies, and signed by her
there, upon his advice.”</p>
<p>Raymond startled everyone by standing and yelling, “Objection, Your
Honor. Pure speculation. Ms. Cook doesn’t know when the deceased ate the
cookies.”</p>
<p>Her Honor was as shaken as everyone else by the outburst and took a
second to react. Raymond thundered away, “Please instruct the prosecutor
to stick to the facts, Your Honor.” He turned and glared at Cora and
said, “Or maybe you do know if she was eating and what she was eating
when she signed the document, and if you do know then please tell us,
but don’t just fabricate facts.”</p>
<p>“Order, order, Mr. Lassiter,” the judge said. “That’s enough. This is
an opening statement and great latitude is allowed. You’ll get your
chance in a moment, Mr. Lassiter. Objection is overruled.”</p>
<p>Raymond angrily fell into his chair, still glaring at Cora as if
she’d committed a major sin. She had not. She had simply massaged the
facts a bit, something that happened all the time and was routinely
allowed. Raymond’s loud interruption was nothing but drama, an attempt
to intimidate Cora and also set the tone for the trial. He would not be
pushed around.</p>
<p>Cora was flustered for a moment and lost her place. She shuffled some
papers, checked her notes, and lifted another document, holding each by
a corner as if they were sticky and odorous. “And this is a power of
attorney signed by Ms. Barnett as she was signing her advance directive.
Taken together, both documents gave the defendant the power to terminate
her medical care with, of course, the advice of her doctors. On
Wednesday, December 30, while on a ventilator and showing no brain
activity, the defendant, along with the doctors, decided to pull the
plug. She died ninety minutes later.”</p>
<p>Simon glanced at his watch, though there was no need. A large clock
hung on the wall high above the bench. Cora had been going strong for
almost an hour, and the jury was still captivated. Simon felt ill and
struggled to maintain a look of concerned confidence.</p>
<p>Cora Cook was good and quite effective. She didn’t yell or preach or
overplay the facts. She stuck to them, probably because they were in her
favor. She walked the jury through the actions taken by the defendant
immediately after Ms. Barnett died. Within two hours he called the
funeral home and arranged to have her picked up from the hospital and
whisked away to be…cremated!</p>
<p>Burning a corpse, even when done intentionally by a mortician, was
such a dramatic visual and Cora banged the drum too long. Simon
scribbled, “Enough already!”</p>
<p>What was the killer’s motive? Greed, money, absolute control of the
estate, huge fees. The will the defendant typed himself and signed by
Ms. Barnett gave him complete control of her assets. Her home, her
stocks, everything she owned would be sold and the proceeds put in a
trust and there was only one trustee—the defendant. He controlled the
checkbook. He could play Santa Claus and give it all away. And while
doing so he could pay himself rather generously to the tune of 00 an
hour. Such a rate might seem low on Wall Street where billionaires and
giant corporations sue each other, but for a general practice lawyer
doing simple estate work in small-town America, the rate was
excessive.</p>
<p>Again, she went on a bit too long as she found the greed angle
irresistible. But she seemed to realize it, and moved quickly to the
punch line, to the joke, to the hoax. It seemed as if the defendant’s
scheme to collect huge fees was all for naught. At one point in her life
Eleanor Barnett was a very wealthy woman, but the money vanished in bad
investments. There was no fortune. Perhaps she was living in the past,
still dreaming, but we’ll never know.</p>
<p>Cora finally began to wind down. Judge Shyam had not set a time limit
and perhaps that was a mistake. Cora read the situation right and rushed
through her final comments. She promised the jurors that when all the
proof was in, they would have no problem believing the defendant
poisoned his client. It would be their sworn duty to return a verdict of
guilty.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam recessed for twenty minutes.</p>
