<h4 id="chapter-36">Chapter 36</h4>
<p>The street was still dark and empty when Paula opened the garage door
a few minutes after five on Monday morning. A police cruiser pulled into
the driveway, on schedule, and the officer got out and said hello. She
herded the three kids out of the house, each carrying an overnight bag
and a backpack. They hustled to the car and sped away behind the
officer. No one noticed them. One mile past the city limits, the cruiser
turned into the parking lot of a convenience store. Paula tapped the
horn and never slowed down. She had no idea when she might return.</p>
<p>She had spent the night in her bed with her laptop, never bothering
to put on pajamas and with no thoughts of sleep. The story was huge and
growing by the hour, though almost no new facts had surfaced in the past
twenty-four hours. The news cycle was now spinning what had already been
spun and recycling every tidbit of speculation. Simon’s face was on
every major newspaper’s online edition, with print on the way. The story
was simply too sensational to ignore. When she saw the headline from a
newspaper in Oregon that screamed: “Virginia Lawyer Arrested for
Poisoning Rich Client” she knew any hope of fairness was gone. There was
no tempering, no throttling, no effort whatsoever to play by the old
rules. What rules? Not too long ago any reputable newspaper would try to
control itself and cautiously use language like “alleged poisoning.” Not
now. Now Simon had been caught and declared guilty.</p>
<p>The comments from the average readers were so mean-spirited and
scathing that Paula forced herself to stop reading them. She spent hours
throughout the night answering thoughtful emails from many of their
friends. By phone, she spoke to her boss and informed him she was taking
a week of vacation. Getting out of Braxton couldn’t happen fast
enough.</p>
<p>Mercifully, the three kids were asleep within minutes, and as she
drove Paula tried to enjoy the solitude without worrying about being
watched. She felt sorry for Simon, but there was nothing she could do at
the moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>The chief of police arrived to take charge, and sent for the
prisoner. When Simon stepped into the visitation room the chief said,
“Look, Simon, you got a packed house today with lots of cameras. Raymond
asked for a big favor and I said yes. It might be embarrassing for you
to walk into court in your orange coveralls, so take ’em off and put
these on again.” He nodded at Simon’s jeans and jacket.</p>
<p>“Thanks Chief.” Simon seemed grateful, but what he really wanted to
do was to ask the chief why his jail used bright orange, practically
neon orange, coveralls in the first place.</p>
<p>The jail was soon busy with officers. The moment offered excitement
and the chief wanted a show of force. Simon wanted to ask why. The
victim was an old woman with no family and few friends. Where was the
security risk? Who were the cops afraid of?</p>
<p>A pack of dogs waited outside the jail and readied their cameras as
the cops filed out. Some couldn’t resist the opportunity and yelled such
banalities as “Hey, Simon, how much money is in the estate?” and “Hey,
Simon, where’d you get the thallium? It’s banned in the U.S.”</p>
<p>The van was fifteen feet from the back door of the jail and Simon
ducked into it. Two motorcycles and a cruiser led the way, with another
behind the van. Simon could have walked from the jail to the courthouse
in five minutes, but a little parade was necessary. They went down Main
Street so everyone could have a look, then circled the square. Simon sat
high in the seat and looked through the window. If not handcuffed, he
would have waved at his spectators.</p>
<p>Protected by the same security force, he entered the courtroom from a
side door and did not look at the crowd. The place was full, and he had
no desire to make eye contact with anyone. He took a seat near the jury
box and studied his feet, a cop on each side. Raymond bent down and they
whispered. When Judge Pointer finished with some paperwork, she called
his name. He and Raymond approached the bench. Simon gritted his teeth,
looked Her Honor dead in the eyes, and refused to blink.</p>
<p>Staring right back, she said, “Mr. Latch, this is not an arraignment,
we’ll do that later. There are two pressing issues here, one is your
representation, the other is the matter of bail. Mr. Lassiter is here as
a matter of courtesy, as I understand the relationship. Will he continue
to represent you?”</p>
<p>“No ma’am. If I can make bail, I will find another lawyer.
Mr. Lassiter has advised me, pro bono, until now. He is here only as a
friend.”</p>
<p>Evidently, Raymond was quite taken with the size of the crowd and the
number of cameras and reporters. Simon’s would be the biggest trial in
the recent history of Braxton, and Raymond’s office was not far from the
courthouse. It would be a shame to miss it, fee or no fee. He said,
“Your Honor, if it’s okay with you, I will continue to represent
Mr. Latch until he hires other counsel. Show me as his attorney of
record.”</p>
<p>Simon looked to his right, nodded humbly at Raymond, and whispered,
“Thank you.” Simon, and the other lawyers in the courtroom, knew damned
well that Raymond Lassiter was now on the hook for the trial. He could
not dare allow another defense lawyer to trespass on his turf.</p>
<p>Her Honor said, “Moving right along. Mr. Lassiter, what are your
thoughts on bail?”</p>
<p>“Only one, Your Honor. My client has practiced law in this town and
in this courtroom for almost nineteen years now. He is well known in
this community. He owns an office building on Main Street. He will
surrender his passport and agree to leave the state only with your
permission. He is not a flight risk and should be released on his own
recognizance.”</p>
<p>“And for the Commonwealth, Ms. Cook?”</p>
<p>The Cougar was well aware that public sentiment, for the moment
anyway, was running strongly against the defendant. She said, “Your
Honor, this is first-degree murder and bail is always required. A high
bond should be set for Mr. Latch, same as any other defendant facing
such a serious charge. Just because he’s a member of the bar doesn’t
mean he gets special treatment. Releasing him on recognizance would send
the wrong message to the rest of the community.”</p>
<p>Raymond was quick to jump in with “Bail is not used to send messages
to the community, Your Honor. The purpose of bail is to guarantee an
appearance in court to face the charges. Nothing more or less. Do you
really believe, Ms. Cook, that Simon Latch will skip town and
disappear?”</p>
<p>Lawyer Latch was dreaming of skipping town on the first bus and
getting off somewhere in Canada.</p>
<p>Ms. Cook said, “Stranger things have happened. I never dreamed he
would be indicted for murder.”</p>
<p>Judge Pointer raised her hands and said, “Okay, okay. Give me a
figure, Ms. Cook.”</p>
<p>“Five hundred thousand.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Lassiter?”</p>
<p>He wanted to say Zero, but then he would not be taken seriously. So
he said, “One hundred thousand.”</p>
<p>“Okay, here are the terms of bail, Mr. Latch. Turn in your passport,
pledge the title to your office building, and post a bond in the amount
of three hundred thousand dollars.”</p>
<p>Simon nodded in agreement as if he had plenty of spare cash, but he
really wanted to scream.</p>
<p>Scheduling was the next issue and the lawyers went back and forth.
Judge Pointer finally raised her hands again for quiet and said, “All
right. We’ll have an arraignment next Wednesday at nine A.M. Anything
further?”</p>
<p>Both lawyers shook their heads no. Simon was escorted out of the
courtroom after being there for less than fifteen minutes. Judge Pointer
tapped her gavel and disappeared from the bench. For a few moments, the
spectators didn’t move, as if they were waiting for more drama.
Realizing there would be none, they slowly rose and began filing
out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Raymond followed Simon out of the courtroom and asked the officers if
he could speak to his client. Simon was handcuffed again and permitted
to follow his lawyer. They stepped into the law library, which was
always empty, and closed the door.</p>
<p>“How you doing?” Raymond asked.</p>
<p>“I guess I need thirty thousand dollars, right?”</p>
<p>“Yep. That’s what it costs to post the bond. I’ve talked to a good
bondsman, one I’ve used before. He’ll meet us at the jail. You said you
could scrape together ten grand.”</p>
<p>“Scrape is the word. Can you loan me twenty?”</p>
<p>Raymond laughed and Simon managed a grin, a brief one. “Can’t do it.
Against the ethics. Any equity in your office building?”</p>
<p>“I told you, Raymond. Everything I own is double-mortgaged. I could
probably squeeze ten thousand out of our home, but I don’t own it
anymore. It’s all Paula’s, as per our property settlement
agreement.”</p>
<p>“Can you ask her?”</p>
<p>“No. And I can’t go to the bank. No one will loan me a dime right
now. Can’t really blame them.”</p>
<p>“All right. What’s the plan?”</p>
<p>“I’ll call my mother.”</p>
<p>“Is she loaded?”</p>
<p>“No, but she’ll try. And I’d like to pay you too, Raymond, I swear I
would. I’ll put the office building on the market and hope for a
miracle, and if I can find the right buyer maybe—”</p>
<p>Raymond held up a hand as he shook his head. “We’ll talk about it
later.”</p>
<hr />
<p>At 1 P.M., Judge Pointer convened another hearing, a much different
one with no spectators. In Courtroom B, she stationed two bailiffs at
the door with instructions to allow no one to enter.</p>
<p>Teddy Hammer had filed a petition to establish a conservatorship for
the estate of Eleanor Barnett. There were several pressing matters, the
most obvious being the burial of the deceased. Her bills needed to be
paid and her assets inventoried. Hammer had requested that his client,
Jerry Korsak, be appointed to handle everything, on a temporary basis.
Jerry was called to the witness stand and put under oath. He began lying
immediately when he tried to convince the court that he and Ms. Barnett,
or “Mom” as he called her, had actually been quite close over the years.
Since she had no children of her own, she had always relied on Jerry for
advice on a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>Hammer was careful not to let him go too far. He knew that phone
records would be subpoenaed and scrutinized and would show little
contact.</p>
<p>Clyde Korsak was not in the courtroom and his brother had no idea
where he was.</p>
<p>Judge Pointer was skeptical. She knew the story of Clyde’s last visit
and his arrest for pummeling Wally, and she had heard plenty of rumors
since Eleanor’s death. There was no one to cross-examine Jerry, and
Judge Pointer was dismissive of his testimony. And, she already had a
plan.</p>
<p>When Jerry stepped down, and when Teddy had nothing else to say, she
announced she was appointing a young lawyer named Clement Gelly as
conservator. He was a local attorney with a good reputation. Her
instructions were strict: There would be no probate until a few weeks
passed. The last will and testament prepared by Simon Latch and signed
by the deceased would be held in abeyance until further orders. In the
meantime, Mr. Gelly would make sure the bills were paid and the assets
identified. The file would remain sealed and she would keep it on her
desk.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, Raymond went to the jail and informed Simon of
the new conservatorship. He was intrigued by it but had more pressing
matters to worry about. He wanted to get out of jail, get out of town,
and go see his kids.</p>
<p>After Raymond left, Simon called Paula and they talked for half an
hour. She and the kids were at her parents’ home in Richmond and felt
safe, no one was bothering them. They discussed the hearing that
morning, and the ins and outs of bail procedure, but at no time did she
offer financial assistance. Simon did not ask for any. In addition to
her future as a single mother, she was afraid she was about to lose her
job. Her parents were semi-retired. They had worked hard, saved
religiously, and had a nice retirement fund that was off-limits.</p>
<p>Simon would waste away in jail before he asked them for help.</p>
