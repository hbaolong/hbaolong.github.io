<h4 id="chapter-28">Chapter 28</h4>
<p>The cough persisted and did not respond to the usual medications. It
became more worrisome when Eleanor began spitting mucus. Her fevers and
headaches came and went, but always returned with sweating, followed by
chills. She complained of a heavy chest and difficulty breathing. Her
appetite was gone and she refused everything but the ginger cookies and
green tea. She was fatigued but couldn’t sleep because of all the
coughing. Two days after Christmas, Dr. Lilly informed Simon that she
had pneumonia, but it was under control. A few rounds of strong
antibiotics should do the trick.</p>
<p>The pneumonia kept her in bed and prevented physical therapy. She had
been in the hospital for a week with little improvement. The antibiotics
did nothing to help and her breathing became even more labored. When a
monitor erupted she was put on a ventilator. On the morning of December
28, Simon and Tillie went to the hospital to check on Eleanor. While
Tillie sat by her bed, Simon met with Dr. Lilly, Dr. Wilkes, and two
other physicians, and listened as they discussed options. They would
immediately begin draining her lungs. She was conscious, most of the
time.</p>
<p>Simon was practically living at the hospital, where he camped out in
a waiting room. A couple of her girlfriends from the “poker club” showed
up, but they were not allowed into her room.</p>
<p>After ten hours on the ventilator, her lungs were filling up faster
than they could be drained. Simon whispered in her ear and, for the
first time, there was no response. He huddled with Dr. Lilly who said,
“She cannot breathe on her own. I’m afraid she’s choking. There is
virtually no brain activity.”</p>
<p>Simon was well aware that what he said and did in the next few hours
would probably be reviewed by lawyers, so he said as little as
possible.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Lilly said, “Let’s wait a few more hours.”</p>
<p>Simon mumbled a soft “Okay.” He left the hospital, drove to his
office, and tried to nap.</p>
<p>Tillie woke him up and said he was needed at the hospital. He asked
her to go with him. He might need a witness, though that was not
mentioned. As always, he carried his briefcase. In it was the file with
the advance directive and power of attorney signed by Eleanor.</p>
<p>Her condition was even more hopeless. Even with the ventilator at
full throttle, her frail and aged body could barely breathe. Her brain
had already ceased showing any activity, and her lungs and heart were
working only with the aid of a machine.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilkes said, “Simon, it looks like the decision is yours.”</p>
<p>He had been anticipating this moment and was already shaking his
head. “No, I’m not doing that, not going there. It’s a medical
decision.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wilkes said, “The advance directive is quite clear. No
resuscitation, no ventilators, no feeding tubes, no device to prolong a
heartbeat.”</p>
<p>“I know, I wrote it. But I’m not making the decision. I’m not a blood
relative and I do not feel comfortable being in this room.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lilly tossed the advance directive on the table and said, “Okay,
let’s meet here at eight in the morning.” He walked out of the room,
followed by two other doctors and Loretta Goodwin.</p>
<hr />
<p>The same group reconvened at eight the following morning. Dr. Lilly
said, “The patient’s condition has not improved, in fact it’s only
worsened. She can’t breathe by herself and the monitors show no brain
activity. It is my advice to turn off the ventilator.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wilkes said, “Mr. Latch?”</p>
<p>“I’ll follow the advice of my client’s medical team. Do you all
agree?”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded in agreement. Simon retired to the cafeteria and
tried to drink some coffee. Ninety minutes passed before Loretta Goodwin
walked in and whispered, “It’s over.”</p>
<p>Eleanor Barnett was pronounced dead at 10:02 A.M., December 30, 2015,
at the Blue Ridge Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>Simon went to the main office to plow through the paperwork with
Dr. Wilkes and her staff. She said, “I’m sure you’ve made final
arrangements.”</p>
<p>“I have, with Cupit andandandand Moke. When will the body be
released?”</p>
<p>“The death certificate is being prepared. A medical examiner will be
here in an hour to sign it. We should be finished by one P.M.”</p>
<hr />
<p>An informant entered the picture with a tip that arrived not long
after the pronouncement of death; 10:26 to be exact, according to the
phone records that would be analyzed for months. The person who made the
call was thought to be a male, though that was never certain. The
anonymous voice was obviously disguised. The call bounced off a tower on
top of the hospital. A cheap burner phone, probably tossed in the pond
after the call. It was recorded and listened to a thousand times:</p>
<p>“Eleanor Barnett just passed away at Blue Ridge Memorial. The doctors
say it’s pneumonia. But her death is suspicious. It should be
investigated.”</p>
<p>The 911 dispatcher called the Braxton Police Department and sent the
recording to a Detective Roger Barr. At the moment, Barr was the only
detective on duty. If the BPD had a homicide unit, it was Barr. The last
murder had been seventeen months earlier and witnessed by four people,
so the investigation had been easy. Barr listened to the recording, then
listened again with his chief, who shrugged and said, “Give it a
go.”</p>
<p>Detective Barr called the hospital, talked to Dr. Wilkes, got enough
details, and drove to the funeral home of Cupit andandandand Moke. He
was loitering in the front parlor when Eleanor was rolled through the
back door and taken to the cooling unit. An elderly secretary brought
forth Mr. Douglas Gregg, the owner and mortician, in his daily black
suit. He smiled and asked, “How may I help you?”</p>
<p>Barr, in his customary battered navy jacket, wrinkled khakis, and
worn cowboy boots, said, “Sure, thanks, so what are your plans right now
with Ms. Barnett?”</p>
<p>“She is to be cremated and buried next to her husband at Eternal
Springs Cemetery.”</p>
<p>“Okay, and who’s in charge of her arrangements?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Simon Latch, her attorney.”</p>
<p>“Heard of him, but don’t know him. Look, hold off on the cremation
until I find Mr. Latch, okay?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Officer. We never rush these things. Is there a
problem?”</p>
<p>“Don’t know yet.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon was at his desk examining an egg salad sandwich that had been
in the fridge for at least two weeks. Store-bought. Surely there were
enough chemicals in it to ward off spoilage, but there was a strange,
tangy smell to it. There was nothing else in the fridge, at least on his
side. On Tillie’s side there was an impressive row of veggie drinks and
fruit flushes, all of which were working superbly.</p>
<p>How could he be thinking of her figure at a time like this?</p>
<p>Eleanor Barnett had just died. She had been a huge part of his life
for the past nine months and would, most likely, dominate his future. He
had warm feelings for her and a great deal of sympathy, a lovely woman
who spent her last years with no family and few friends. He was also
relieved to be free of the worries and responsibility of her care,
though tidying up her affairs might take years. He wouldn’t miss the
lunches, though some were enjoyable.</p>
<p>He fought off his emotions by telling himself that Netty lived a
long, happy life and died with little suffering. He doubted he would see
his eighty-fifth year.</p>
<p>Tillie interrupted his solitude by tapping on the door as she entered
with the look that only meant trouble. She handed him the business card
of Detective Roger Barr, Braxton Police.</p>
<p>“What does he want?”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t say. I’m going to lunch.”</p>
<p>Barr settled into his chair in such a way as to reveal a black Glock
on his hip. What an amateur. Simon had never met him, but then he tried
to avoid criminal work.</p>
<p>Barr’s thick mustache covered his top lip. From under it the gruff
words came out: “Just left the funeral home. What’s the hurry with
cremating Ms. Barnett?”</p>
<p>“She died two hours ago. How did you get involved so soon?”</p>
<p>“That’s my business, Mr. Latch. Are you in a hurry or something?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. When she was pronounced dead, I called the funeral home.
That’s what usually happens. Either the family or the hospital will make
the call.”</p>
<p>“Are you family?”</p>
<p>“I am not. There is no family to speak of.” Everything about Barr was
irritating. His sudden involvement, his cocky smirk, as if he knew
something fishy was in the works. Simon decided to push back. “What’s
your involvement with Ms. Barnett?”</p>
<p>“Right now, nothing but a lot of curiosity. The death certificate
says she died of pneumonia, that right?”</p>
<p>“What’s your question?”</p>
<p>“Did she die of pneumonia?”</p>
<p>“Look, I’m not a doctor and I didn’t sign her death certificate. If
it says pneumonia, then it’s pneumonia. Why don’t you ask her
doctor?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I will. I have a lot of questions. But for now, let’s hold off
on the cremation, okay?”</p>
<p>“By what authority are you making this request?”</p>
<p>“I’ll get a court order. What’s the big hurry?”</p>
<p>“There is no hurry. I’ve never been in this position before. The
hospital released the body to the funeral home, and Ms. Barnett’s
advance directive calls for a cremation, then a burial. I’m just
following my client’s wishes.”</p>
<p>“Got that. I’ll get a court order anyway.”</p>
<p>Simon was exasperated and trying to think two steps ahead. A court
order might mean more publicity, and for some reason that was not what
he wanted. He said, “That won’t be necessary. I’ll call the funeral home
and tell them to wait.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already done that.”</p>
