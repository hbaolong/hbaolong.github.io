<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>Eleanor was getting pushier about their lunches, which she was now
describing as their “dates.” Simon was suffering through them because
they might lead to a pot of gold. However, the culinary adventure had
been his idea and he couldn’t stop it. Plus, he was getting closer to
Netty and she was relying on him more and more. She even let it slip
that she “needed” him.</p>
<p>Her friend Doris had eaten twice at the Bombay Oven, a quaint little
café in a converted gas station five miles west of town. Eleanor was
determined to go there, if for no other reason than to keep up with
Doris, who was quite envious that her friend was lunching with a
handsome young lawyer. The more Simon heard about Doris, the less he
wanted to meet her.</p>
<p>He arrived early as always so he could scope out the parking
situation and position himself, low behind the wheel, to study Eleanor’s
driving ability. It was a county road with little traffic, but Netty
managed to find plenty of it. When she came into view, puttering along
in the old Lincoln at no more than thirty miles an hour, there were a
dozen cars bumper-to-bumper behind her. As she slowed even more and
began to pull off the road, the idea of a turning signal never crossed
her mind. Horns were blowing as the traffic passed.</p>
<p>He helped her out of her car. She looked great, as always, ready for
church in a pretty blue dress, one he’d seen several times, a floral
scarf bunched around her neck, dark hose, low heels. As they entered the
café, Simon half-expected to smell diesel fuel and axle grease, but the
interior was ultra-modern with black and white tiled floors, mirrors,
glass, and tables adorned with linen cloths.</p>
<p>So much for a cheap lunch, he thought to himself. They ordered tea
and a baked flatbread to get started. The restaurant was quiet and not
crowded, the tables spaced reasonably apart. Simon had an agenda but did
not want to hurry. These outings meant a lot to Eleanor.</p>
<p>After some chitchat about their complete lack of knowledge of Indian
cuisine, they put down the menus. She got serious with “Wally Thackerman
called again this morning.”</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s been calling for a month now, wants me to come to his
office to review my estate and such.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Simon could think of nothing in his complicated life
that was as important as Eleanor’s estate. The idea of another lawyer,
especially a worm like Wally, getting anywhere near it was quite
unsettling.</p>
<p>He gave a nonchalant shrug and asked, “What did you tell him?”</p>
<p>“I’m not a liar, Simon,” she said, with a look that implied he
thought she would lie.</p>
<p>“Who said you were?” he asked, defensively.</p>
<p>“I told him I wasn’t feeling well, which at that moment was a true
statement because his calls were upsetting me. But he isn’t going away,
evidently. What are we going to do?”</p>
<p>Shoot the little bastard, Simon instantly thought, but let it pass.
“Well, we could always call Clyde and tell him to come on back and
finish the job.” Simon was smiling at his own humor. Eleanor was
not.</p>
<p>“Sorry, just joking.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious here, Simon. I still feel deceitful for not telling
Wally the truth, that I’ve signed another will and the one he prepared
is no good. This just doesn’t seem right.”</p>
<p>“And you think Wally’s been up-front with you? Keep in mind, Netty,
he secretly hid a gift to himself in your will and didn’t tell you about
it. Almost half a million dollars. You’re not dealing with an ethical
person here. As I have explained, more than once, you have no obligation
to inform Wally about our will. And why worry, Netty? You have at least
ten more years, maybe twenty.”</p>
<p>That made her smile. The waitress brought over a platter of naan with
a bowl of spiced garlic hummus. They each took a bite. She said, “Well,
what if I go to his office and talk to him, just to see what he’s up to?
I don’t have to tell him anything and I don’t have to agree to anything,
right?”</p>
<p>“Right. Great idea. Go sit with Wally, talk about his episode with
Clyde, and so on. See what he’s thinking.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’ll do.”</p>
<p>When the waitress returned, Simon said, “An Indian friend recommended
the kofta, meatballs stuffed with pork and onions and other things, and
your chicken curry.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take the same,” Eleanor said.</p>
<p>The waitress sized them up and said, “I recommend that you go pretty
light on the spices, okay?”</p>
<p>They agreed and she took their menus.</p>
<p>Simon said, “I’d like to finish the conversation about your final
arrangements, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“That’s not one of my favorite topics.”</p>
<p>“Understood. But we’re talking about dying, Netty, otherwise you
would never have called my office in the first place. As soon as we can
get all the paperwork done, then we can stop talking about dying.”</p>
<p>She crunched on some flatbread and looked like she was about to cry.
“Do you really think I’ll live ten more years?”</p>
<p>“Yes, at least ten,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>“And you think I should do the cremation thing?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I really do. It’s quick, easy, and more sustainable for the
environment.”</p>
<p>“Okay. If you insist.”</p>
<p>Simon scribbled some meaningless notes on a small scrap of paper.
“What about your funeral service? I asked you to write down some
ideas.”</p>
<p>“That’s ten years away.”</p>
<p>“Look, Netty, I really don’t want to be doing this. I’m your lawyer,
not a blood relative. This is a job for someone in your family, you
understand? I don’t really care how you want to be buried.”</p>
<p>She burst into tears and he felt like a heel for whatever he’d said.
She removed her glasses and wiped her eyes. Simon looked around to see
if anyone was watching. She put her glasses back on, swallowed hard, and
said, “I have no one. I’ve told you this.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Netty. I didn’t mean to upset you. But, again, the sooner
we get these matters wrapped up, the sooner we can stop talking about
them.”</p>
<p>“I’ve made some notes about my service and I’ll bring them next time.
It will be a small affair in the chapel at the funeral home with the
Lutheran minister doing the honors. Just a few friends, that’s all. My
niece and nephew will never know I’m gone. So sad, isn’t it, Simon? To
have no one.”</p>
<p>She looked as if she might cry some more and he truly felt sorry for
her. The chicken curry arrived first in small bowls. The aroma was
delicious and they ate in silence for a few minutes.</p>
<p>She took a drink of tea and said, “Well, sorta glad we asked them to
go light on the spices. This stuff is hot.”</p>
<p>“It’s delicious though,” Simon said. He drank some tea and decided to
lunge forward. There was really no way around it. “There’s another
matter, Netty, that is somewhat delicate.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear. You lawyers.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re spot-on. Lawyers work by the hour. Our time is all we
have to sell, and I’m spending a lot of it handling your legal
matters.”</p>
<p>“Where is this going?” she asked suspiciously. Her look and tone were
so cautious, Simon thought he was making a mistake. But it didn’t matter
anymore. He couldn’t work for free.</p>
<p>“I need to get paid, Netty, same as any other lawyer in town. You’re
my favorite client right now, but all clients have to pay their lawyers.
It’s that simple.”</p>
<p>“Harry didn’t believe in paying lawyers.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and Harry’s been dead for ten years. I’m not being
disrespectful, but I really don’t care what Harry thought about lawyers.
I have an office to pay for and a family to support, and I need to be
paid.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>What a question. Simon had struggled with it for weeks. If he went
high she might be offended and walk out the door. He doubted that would
happen, but he did not want to appear greedy. Bigger bucks were around
the corner. He had to keep Netty happy. And if he went low, he would not
get the fees he had earned and so desperately needed. He had decided to
aim for the middle, and said, “Just over three thousand dollars.”</p>
<p>She waved him off with a casual flick of the wrist and said, “Is that
all?”</p>
<p>What beautiful words. He could always make up later with a heftier
bill. “Yes, Netty, my fees are very fair. I enjoy my clients.”</p>
<p>What a lie.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of it,” she said as she took a bite. “When do we go
to court?”</p>
<p>She was thinking of traffic court. Simon had his mind on probate.
They were in different worlds.</p>
<p>“Couple of weeks. I’ll check the docket.” Oh how lawyers loved the
word docket. It implied important trials and hearings in crowded
courtrooms with justice hanging in the balance. But in traffic court it
was little more than a sign-up sheet hanging on a clipboard.</p>
<p>The meatballs arrived with an aroma that was even more sumptuous.
Netty said, “You promised me I’d meet your family, Simon. I’ll bet your
wife and kids are adorable.”</p>
<p>Not exactly. Janie was a delight to be around, but the others were
too troubled. Paula would never consent to meeting someone like Netty,
not with the divorce hanging over their heads. She wanted nothing to do
with her husband or his practice. Buck and Danny were awkward teenagers
who had never learned to shake hands and introduce themselves to adults.
They had no desire to meet anyone over the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>Simon smiled and lied, “I promise, I promise. Everybody is just so
busy. School, soccer, drama, choir, piano, homework. Seems like every
day is booked. I’ll try to get them all together sometime.”</p>
<p>Dessert was rice pudding topped with pistachios and sliced almonds,
with strong coffee that Simon needed for the afternoon. Ninety minutes
after they sat down, the waitress placed the check on the table. Once
again, Eleanor, who constantly gazed about the dining room while eating
and seemed to miss nothing, commenting occasionally on other dishes
being served, on the decor, on what another cultured lady might be
wearing, was totally oblivious to the bill.</p>
<p>This was at least their seventh lunch. Simon finally put down a
credit card and paid again. 7.35. An expensive lunch for rural Virginia.
He’d get it back.</p>
<p>Driving to the office, he schemed to rework his monthly bill, add in
a lunch or two, and pad things a bit. She had scoffed at his initial
amount with words he would remember: Is that all? He vowed to send her a
more impressive bill.</p>
<p>Truthfully, he didn’t care what the lunch had cost because he and
Netty had cleared the air about his fees. He was about to get paid for
the first time in the many months he had known her.</p>
<p>Since it would be impossible to hide the billing and receipts from
his secretary, he met with her that afternoon and described his business
with Eleanor Barnett. Some of it. He was billing her several hours for
two matters: (1) representation in traffic court, and (2) consultation
for estate planning. The bill was ,650 and Tillie mailed it that
afternoon.</p>
<p>He did not tell Tillie that he had prepared a will for Eleanor,
saying only that they were still discussing her estate, one that had
become more “complicated.” Tillie took this in stride, knowing full well
that he was lying.</p>
