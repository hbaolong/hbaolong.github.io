<h4 id="chapter-25">Chapter 25</h4>
<p>Simon did not want to be in the house after dark, with a strange car
in the driveway. He did not want nosy neighbors ringing the doorbell and
asking questions. He did not want to look like a lawyer or a person with
authority so he wore jeans and a sports coat. And, he did not want to be
rushed.</p>
<p>At 3 P.M. he parked where the old Lincoln once parked and turned off
the engine. He had just left Netty’s car in the city lot, waiting to be
hauled to the scrap heap. It was a total loss, and he considered her
lucky to escape with minor injuries. He took some photos for the file
but would never need them.</p>
<p>The house had no alarm system. She said Harry didn’t believe in them
and wouldn’t spend the money. Harry had been dead for ten years and she
often talked about him as if he were still around.</p>
<p>Once inside the den he inhaled a pleasant aroma, probably the remains
of a scented candle. Maybe pine. He switched on lights in the den and
kitchen and paused to take inventory. The house was spotless, with
everything in order. The kitchen counters were uncluttered, with only a
toaster and coffeepot, both at least thirty years old. He wiped a finger
across a wooden snack bar. Not a trace of dust. The furniture was fairly
modern, nothing ancient, nothing new. The television was a bit dated,
though, an old Motorola with two remotes. There was an upright piano
against one wall. He could not remember Netty ever saying anything about
a piano. He stepped into her small study and went straight to her desk,
a government surplus throwback from the 1960s with chrome legs and metal
panels. As she said, the current mail was in a tray in the right
corner.</p>
<p>Her chair was a wicker straight-back that was fragile and shaky and
seemed designed for a woman who weighed less than a hundred pounds. He
settled into it, moving slowly to make sure it would not collapse. The
desktop was covered in glass and well organized with nothing out of
place. A large cup held the usual collection of pens, pencils, paper
clips, etc. Netty was very neat and tidy. There was no computer, no
iPad, no devices at all. He took a stack of mail and began sifting
through it, at first careful not to misplace anything. He did not find a
bill for an internet provider. Perhaps it was packaged with her cable,
as was his. He knew that the stack did not include all of her monthly
bills. Others would arrive later.</p>
<p>Though his curiosity was piqued, he felt like some creepy voyeur
looking at the private affairs of an old woman. He kept telling himself
that he had no choice. Someone had to do it.</p>
<p>He found the rather abrupt letters from Allstate canceling her auto
insurance. He found several other past-due notices and unpaid bills. The
checkbook was in the bottom drawer, left side, exactly where she said.
It was in a blue leather notebook-style binder, with three checks to a
page and stubs that dated back two years. He flipped through the stubs
and got a clear picture of where she shopped and what she bought, and
nothing was unusual or surprising. She did indeed have a credit card, a
Visa, which she had been forced to use when she checked out of the lake
cabin two months earlier. But she used it sparingly. In another drawer
he found the old Visa statements filed in perfect monthly order. Behind
them were the monthly statements from the local bank. The latest was for
October and showed a balance in her checking account of ,100. There was
no sign of the past-due bill from his office. An hour passed before he
realized it.</p>
<p>In the bottom right drawer was a stack of old magazines—AARP,
Southern Living, Medicare Bulletin, Travel andandandand Leisure. Some
were ten years old and there was nothing to indicate why they had been
kept.</p>
<p>What Simon wanted to find was a monthly statement from Rumke-Brown,
the wealth management firm in Atlanta that handled her stocks. And he
wanted bank statements from East Federal, the bank where she allegedly
stashed her cash. The fact that he found neither was troubling. Why
would she hide them?</p>
<p>She said her important papers were in a locked safe hidden in the
bottom of her closet. He did not ask for the key and she did not
offer.</p>
<p>When he had gone through every drawer it was dark outside. He had
been there long enough for the first visit, though he had more questions
now than when he arrived.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang and Simon jumped out of his skin, as if he’d been
caught in a burglary. He rushed to the front door, opened it, and smiled
at a couple in their sixties.</p>
<p>“We live next door and saw the car,” the man said.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” the woman demanded.</p>
<p>“My name is Simon Latch, I’m Eleanor’s attorney. She’s in the
hospital.”</p>
<p>“We know. We heard all about it.”</p>
<p>Simon looked them over as they examined him. He said, “Relax. I’m
helping take care of her business.”</p>
<p>“How’s she doing?” the man asked.</p>
<p>“Okay, I guess. She’ll be there for a few days.”</p>
<p>“We heard she was drunk,” the woman said. “Drinking and driving, but
that doesn’t sound like Eleanor.”</p>
<p>“I can’t comment, sorry.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name again?” the man asked.</p>
<p>“And what’s yours?”</p>
<p>“Frazier, Norris Frazier. And my wife Rose.”</p>
<p>“Great. Nice to meet you. I’m Simon Latch, attorney. I’ll tell
Eleanor that you checked on things.”</p>
<p>“You do that. Can we visit her in the hospital? We probably won’t
though. Last year Rose was in the hospital for a week and not a word
from Eleanor. No sir.”</p>
<p>For a second Simon wasn’t sure of a response. He said, “Not yet,
maybe in a couple of days. I’ll let you know. And you’ll probably see my
car parked here off and on for some time. Feel free to say hello.” He
was closing the door as he spoke.</p>
<p>Was it Frazier Norris or Norris Frazier? He would have to report it
to Netty and he couldn’t even remember the name. Rose was the wife. His
head was spinning with questions and possibilities and his heart was
still racing from the interruption. He needed to get out of the house.
Avoiding her fragile chair, he sat on a leather stool near her desk,
closed his eyes, and took ten deep breaths. An ugly reality was falling
slowly around him as he sunk into a dark gloom.</p>
<p>There was no money, no fortune, no pot of gold filled with shares of
stock in Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart, no pile of cash in an Atlanta bank. He
was a sucker, the victim of a nutty old woman with a devious mind, a
lonely soul who had duped him and probably others into believing she was
rich. Rich? He looked around her small study and saw nothing to indicate
Eleanor Barnett had the slightest bit of real wealth. Sure, everything
was paid for, and given his current state of affairs that was a dream,
but she was no richer than many elderly widows whose husbands had been
frugal. In the nine months he had known her, he had not seen her spend
one dime on anything that wasn’t necessary. She wouldn’t even pay her
bills. She had stiffed him for a dozen lunches. She wore the same
clothes over and over. She never traveled, never talked about doing
so.</p>
<p>And now she was banged up in the hospital facing lawsuits and a nasty
drunk driving charge. Why in hell was he in the middle of this mess?</p>
<p>Greed.</p>
<p>At least he could admit it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dinner was a tuna melt in the rear of Ethel’s Diner, four doors down
from his office. There was a small aluminum tree by the front cash
register. “Jingle Bells” played softly in the background. It would be
his first Christmas away from home, away from the kids, which saddened
him greatly.</p>
<p>Uglier thoughts, though, were more pressing. It was time to confront
Eleanor and demand all of her financial records. And once he had them,
and once he knew for sure that her last will and testament was a scam,
he would immediately take steps to get rid of her as a client. She was
facing enormous legal troubles, all of her own making, and he was not
about to get roped in as her lawyer. She wouldn’t even pay his first
bill for ,650. If he didn’t cut the cord and do so immediately, he could
be on the hook for her DUI, normally a ,000 fee, and the lawsuits from
her car wreck. There was no way to calculate those fees, not to mention
the damages, when the lawsuits started flying.</p>
<p>He managed to chuckle at the irony of himself, a bankruptcy lawyer,
being forced to file a bankruptcy for Eleanor Barnett, a wacky old gal
who’d probably gone through life lying about her assets. The humor
didn’t last. He paid for his dinner and stepped onto the sidewalk.
Across the street, carolers serenaded a small crowd in front of the
Episcopal church. For a moment, he missed home.</p>
<p>Dessert was a bourbon and ginger ale, the first of the evening, and
he needed it because of the unpleasant task at hand. On a small table in
the corner of his office, he spread out Netty’s monthly bills, current
and past due, and opened the bulky notebook that held her checks. He
unclipped the three rings and removed the stubs. He flipped to the back
to see how many checks were available. There were plenty. In the back
binder there was a folder that was almost undetectable. Inside it,
carefully tucked away, was a small, thin notebook, eight inches by five.
He removed it, opened it, and looked at the first lined page. In the
center was the year: 2015. At the bottom, in small, neat cursive was the
name: Eleanor Barnett. He turned the page. In blue ink, she wrote:</p>
<p>April 4, per BB: Coca-cola at 1, 238,000 shares, total ,758,000</p>
<p>WMart at 1, 127,000 shares, total ,400,000</p>
<p>Per Albert, East Federal Atlanta, cash acct: 62,000</p>
<p>East Fed money mkt acct: 90,000</p>
<p>East Fed jumbo cd: 44,000</p>
<p>East Fed T-bills acct: 01,000</p>
<p>Third Fed 2016 cd: 22,000</p>
<p>East Fed 2017 cd: ,330,000</p>
<p>Simon stared at the numbers without breathing for a long time, then
he tried to tally them mentally. He was afraid to move, but eventually
turned the page to July 6. The numbers varied slightly. Evidently, Netty
preferred to round things off to the nearest ten grand.</p>
<p>Then to October 7. It was obvious that BB and Albert called her
during the first week after each quarter with the updates. He assumed BB
was Buddy Brown. He had no idea who Albert was but he worked for East
Federal.</p>
<p>He sipped his drink and felt his entire body relax as a mountain of
pressure drifted from his shoulders. The bourbon had wound its way to
his brain and calmed things considerably.</p>
<p>The notebook made perfect sense. Eleanor was obsessed with secrecy
and perpetually afraid that someone would discover her stocks and cash.
So, she kept no evidence of them. Rumke-Brown and East Federal did not
send her monthly statements because she didn’t want them. They did,
though, call with the quarterly summaries. Eleanor was a smart woman who
kept tabs on her money.</p>
<p>The last entry was December 6, almost three weeks earlier. At the
bottom of the page she noted: Coke up 4% for year; WMart up 2.5%. CD
rates still too low.</p>
<p>Simon could almost see her taking careful notes during the quarterly
calls, then sliding the notebook back into its hiding place. It had only
twenty-five sheets of onionskin paper, a slightly beige color. He
wondered where she hid the notebooks from previous years.</p>
<p>Santa had just arrived and Simon felt a measure of vindication. He
hadn’t been such a fool after all. His dear Netty was loaded to the max
and he would be in charge of her estate one day. He poured out his
drink, brushed his teeth, gargled with mouthwash, left his office, and
drove to the hospital.</p>
<p>She was watching television in the dark when he eased into the room,
tapping on the door. “Netty, it’s me. Are you awake?”</p>
<p>Her face glowed with a huge smile and she held out her right arm, IVs
and all. He squeezed her fragile, bony hand and whispered, “How are you
doing?”</p>
<p>“Much better now,” she said warmly and with a voice stronger than he
expected. “Thanks for stopping by again, Simon.”</p>
<p>It was his third visit of the day. He glanced at the counter near her
bed. There were three bouquets of flowers, all sent by his office.</p>
<p>“Any other visitors?” he asked. As always, he was afraid Wally
Thackerman or some other lawyer might be slithering around.</p>
<p>“No, no one but you,” she said sadly.</p>
<p>“I stopped by your house. Everything is fine. Your neighbors, Norris
and Rose, knocked on the door.”</p>
<p>“What did they want?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, just saw my car and thought they should check into things.
I told them I was your lawyer and things were fine.”</p>
<p>“He’s okay. She’s rather snooty, thinks she’s a notch above. They
tried to join the country club but couldn’t get in.”</p>
<p>Simon really didn’t care. “They were very nice. Just curious.”</p>
<p>“Too curious.” She muted the television and said, “Pull up a chair
and let’s talk. I’m worried sick about this accident, Simon. I don’t
think it was my fault.”</p>
<p>He wrestled the chair over and squeezed into it.</p>
<p>“Are those people okay? The ones in the other car?”</p>
<p>“They’ll be fine,” he said. Both had broken bones and were missing
work. They would hire a lawyer, and when they realized she had no
insurance, they would probably file suit. However, at the moment, Simon
wasn’t worried about litigation, for now he knew the truth about Netty’s
assets. He could easily negotiate a generous settlement and put the
matter to rest. As for the DUI, he couldn’t make it go away, but he
doubted the prosecutor would be too harsh, given her age. Plus, Simon
would offer to pay a huge fine. Money usually allowed the guilty to get
off light.</p>
<p>How pleasant it is to have money, he thought.</p>
<p>“How’s the food?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Dreadful. Typical hospital stuff.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what do you want? How about some egg rolls from that Korean
place? Or Chinese dumplings? We’ve tried everything in town.”</p>
<p>“What a marvelous idea, Simon. I’ll take a bunch of egg rolls, those
stuffed with shrimp.”</p>
<p>“You got ’em. I’ll be there when they open in the morning.”</p>
<p>“What would I do without you, Simon?”</p>
