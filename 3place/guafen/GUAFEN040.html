<h4 id="chapter-39">Chapter 39</h4>
<p>Raymond convinced Judge Pointer to skip a formal arraignment and
allow Simon to enter a not-guilty plea on paper. It was a formality
anyway, and given the throng that showed up for the simple bail hearing,
Raymond preferred to avoid the attention. The not-guilty plea was
recorded, and Commonwealth of Virginia v. Simon F. Latch entered the
docket. Simon and Raymond agreed that there was no benefit in stalling
and decided to request a speedy trial, the speedier the better. Cora
Cook was not in a position to object. As the chief prosecutor, it was
important for her to aggressively go after the criminals. She had, after
all, ramrodded the indictment through the grand jury, then asked for a
huge bond in an effort to keep Simon in jail. She could never show
weakness, not that she was inclined to anyway. The voters expected
nothing less. She agreed to fast-track the case, and joined the defense
in a motion to place it on what was informally known as the “rocket
docket.” Judge Pointer was happy to accommodate both sides and set a
trial date of May 23.</p>
<p>The reality was that Simon’s was the only murder case in Braxton at
the moment, and the town had never seen such attention. Journalists
snooped around, digging for unique angles. Every lawyer in town was
approached for a comment, though most declined. Two true-crime shows,
allegedly from Hollywood but actually from Reno and St. Paul, excited
the locals with their equipment trailers and bulky cameras. What they
were filming was anybody’s guess. At least twice a day a reporter with a
film crew stood on the edge of Main Street and shot footage of Simon’s
office, with its permanently locked door. Tillie was just behind it,
always jittery. She was monitoring the story in the press and online,
and her scrapbook was filling up quickly. Simon had no desire to look at
it.</p>
<p>“Simon sightings” were rare because he seldom left his building. He
peeked through the shades upstairs and often saw reporters lurking in
the alley. He was isolated, depressed, and frightened about the trial
and his future. He seldom ate and Tillie fussed at him about his weight,
as she continued to tone up.</p>
<p>He spent hours at his desk writing, by hand—nothing in the
computer—and compiling his notes on Netty’s final days. He broke down
each one, almost hour by hour, with as much detail as he could recall.
Her movements, his movements, her auto accident, his trips to the
hospital, who else was there, who were the doctors and nurses, and so
on. She had been admitted on December 17, and died on Wednesday,
December 30. He charted every day and asked Tillie to double-check her
calendars and phone calls. She had made three trips to the hospital to
check on Netty and take brownies. She took those damned ginger cookies
that Simon had bought at Tan Lu’s. Who did she see at the hospital? Did
she log in at the front desk, as required? Yes, the first time, but not
for the second and third visits. The hospital was not strict about
monitoring visitors.</p>
<p>The long dreary days of January gave way to more of the same in
February. The phone simply wasn’t ringing, and for a street practice
that depended on word of mouth, the traffic was far too slow. Word of
mouth was out there somewhere, but it was not being kind to Simon
Latch.</p>
<p>In the second week of February, Paula called with the news that she
had found a promising job with a new retirement village in the town of
Danville, four hours south on the North Carolina state line. Danville
was roughly the size of Braxton, with good schools and even a small
college, and about as far away as possible while still being in
Virginia. She had found an apartment and they would be moving in a
matter of days. Her parents were driving her crazy and the kids were
climbing the walls. Yes, it was all quite unsettling, but finally they
were making progress. He volunteered to help with the move-in and she
invited him to join the party.</p>
<p>Landy’s reluctant efforts to find manufacturers, markets, and dealers
for banned poisons was not going well. What she had found so far was
something she already knew: there were thousands of banned and/or
illegal chemicals, compounds, and drugs smuggled into America every
year, for every reason, and from every entry point. Billions were spent
trying to stop the flood of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Poisons were
not a priority and almost impossible to track.</p>
<p>Landy and her husband had filed their no-fault divorce and shook
hands on the deal. As career FBI agents who moved frequently, they did
not own a home. Their condo lease was up in a few months and she would
remain in it until she found another apartment. Simon became a regular
guest. He enjoyed being away from Braxton almost as much as he enjoyed
the high-octane sex life they had jump-started. It was like a flashback
twenty years to law school when they almost flunked out due to
extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>But they were no longer twenty, and after a few weeks things cooled
off as they slowly realized there was a good reason their old romance
had not survived outside the bedroom. In late February, she surprised
him with the news that she would be gone for a month on an assignment
she could not discuss.</p>
<hr />
<p>On a snowy day in early March, Tillie walked into Simon’s office and
took a seat. She was obviously troubled and got right to the point. “I
think it’s time for me to move on.”</p>
<p>He slowly put down a contract he was mulling over and said,
“Okay.”</p>
<p>“I cannot in good conscience keep getting paid when we’re so low on
cash and the business has dried up. We’re fooling ourselves, Simon, if
we think things are going to improve. I keep the books. I see the
income, what little there is of it. The phones might as well be
unplugged. The front door stays locked, and if anyone knocks it’s
usually a reporter. We get at least two prank calls every day from
idiots who want you dead. I can’t take it anymore.” She was wiping her
eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“Leave town and go find a job somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Any ideas?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I have a good friend down in Sarasota, a kid from school. She
says there are plenty of jobs and I can stay with her for a few months.
I’ll find something.”</p>
<p>“So it’s come to this?”</p>
<p>“Afraid so. I’ll always cherish these days, Simon, the good ones
anyway. There weren’t many bad ones.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been wonderful and I don’t want to see you go.”</p>
<p>“I know. And I know that if you had the income and the business I’d
stay forever, but that’s where we are. I’m so worried about you,
Simon.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Unfortunately, there’s plenty to worry about.”</p>
<p>They were silent for a long time as they stared at the walls and
remembered the good days. She touched her eyes with a tissue and he felt
like crying too. Finally, she said, “I’ll leave Friday.”</p>
<p>“You can always come back, you know?”</p>
<p>“I wish I could believe that, Simon, I really do.”</p>
<p>They stood and hugged for the first time, then hugged again for the
last time.</p>
