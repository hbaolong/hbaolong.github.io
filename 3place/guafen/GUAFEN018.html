<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>For the next two weeks things were quiet as Clyde remained in jail
and Netty fell back into her routine of doing almost nothing. Simon
filed bankruptcy petitions by the pound and was busier than ever. He and
Paula continued their silent war as they ignored each other and hoped
that something would force them to sign the divorce papers.</p>
<p>Each morning, Simon checked with his source at the jail to make sure
Clyde was still there. Each afternoon, he checked with a secretary in
the prosecutor’s office to monitor any activity in the case. The
secretary was thirty-five, divorced, and a legendary flirt. She was on
his list, if he could ever find the time or energy to chase women
again.</p>
<p>The gossip finally died down, without a peep about a suspicious will
prepared by Wally. As far as Simon could tell, Eleanor’s name had not
been linked to the story of the “attack.” Nor had his. There was also
gossip that Wally’s nose was as big as a football and his entire face
was rainbow-colored as the bruises matured and blended together. He was
hiding, with his cases being continued while he was on medical
leave.</p>
<p>Fran enjoyed a brief moment of fame as the fearless secretary who’d
fired away and threatened to castrate Clyde with a single bullet. The
backstory was that she had been raised with three older brothers who
hunted year-round, with or without proper licenses. Any deer was always
in season. She had killed her first buck when she was thirteen.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, though, Wally was working a deal, as Simon
predicted. He offered to drop all charges but a simple assault if Clyde
agreed to leave town and never return. It would be a misdemeanor,
nothing permanent on his record, with one year suspended. No fine. Just
get out of town. Clyde jumped at the deal, and after eighteen days
walked out. He never answered a question from a cop, never spoke to
anyone about the incident. He got in his old car and left town, leaving
nothing behind but a few stitches in Wally’s face.</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon returned to the office after another hectic day in bankruptcy
court. He was pleasant enough to Tillie, who, as always, was busy with a
mountain of paperwork. He took off his jacket and tie and settled behind
his desk to check his phone calls. Tillie walked through the door as she
tapped it and said, “You need to call Eleanor Barnett. Says it’s an
emergency.”</p>
<p>Simon looked at his phone, the only one Netty was supposed to call,
and saw nothing from her. “What’s the emergency?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Something about going to court this afternoon. She didn’t say
much.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Thanks.”</p>
<p>Tillie turned and left the office, but not before he noticed that she
was losing weight and looking better than she had in years. Evidently,
the asparagus and celery shakes were working, along with a full hour in
the gym each morning. Go girl.</p>
<p>She closed the door and Simon tapped a key. “It’s about time you
called,” Netty snapped, quite irritated. “I’ve been calling all
morning.”</p>
<p>“Hello Netty. I guess my phone is on the blink. It’s not showing any
calls from you.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you need a new phone,” she snapped again.</p>
<p>A new phone cost a thousand dollars and Simon was not ready to spring
for one. Besides, the one he was holding was working just fine. He had a
hunch why her calls were not coming through, but it was not the time to
bicker. “What’s going on, Netty?”</p>
<p>“I’m in court this afternoon at four and I think I might need a
lawyer.”</p>
<p>The only court in session at 4 P.M. on a Wednesday afternoon was the
city traffic court. “Okay, what’s the case about?”</p>
<p>“Well, this really rude policeman pulled me over and gave me a
ticket. I didn’t do a thing wrong.”</p>
<p>“Why haven’t you called me before now?”</p>
<p>“Because I thought I could take care of this, it’s all a
misunderstanding, you see, but now that I’m here in court it looks like
everyone else has a lawyer. Do I need one?”</p>
<p>There were several guys in town who advertised their ability to get
traffic tickets reduced or even dismissed, and they usually hung around
traffic court hustling people who really didn’t need a lawyer.</p>
<p>“What are the charges?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, several. Speeding, I think. Wrong way. Something about
an expired license. It’s all so confusing. I’m not going to jail, am I,
Simon? This is truly frightening.”</p>
<p>Speeding seemed unlikely since she drove with one foot on the brake.
“I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>The courtroom was four blocks away, in an annex behind city hall.
Simon reluctantly put his jacket back on, but not his tie since there
was no dress code in traffic court. The judge was a part-timer who had a
law license but had never practiced and spent four hours a week
refereeing parking and traffic disputes for 00 a month. If he owned a
black robe he never wore it.</p>
<p>Simon eased into the crowded courtroom at 3:50 and found Netty in the
back row. She was visibly relieved to see him and squeezed his hand.
Simon patted hers and whispered, “It’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>He looked at her ticket and managed to maintain a poker face. Five
infractions. It was issued by a Lieutenant Andy Reece, one of several
city cops Simon did not know. “Do you see Officer Reece in the
courtroom?” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said and nodded at a door where several officers were
hanging around. “That tall one with red hair.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>Simon walked to the front of the courtroom, spoke to two lawyers he
knew, and drifted over to the cops, who were coming and going. He
introduced himself to Officer Reece and asked if he had a minute for a
chat. Sure. They stepped out of the courtroom and into a hallway. Simon
handed him the ticket and he glanced at it. “Oh, her? She’s
dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what happened?”</p>
<p>“Sure. We had radar set up down on Kidder Extended, one way, you
know, two blocks behind the Kroger.”</p>
<p>“I know the area.” It was a notorious speed trap.</p>
<p>“She came busting down the wrong way, clocked her at forty-five in a
twenty-five zone. Speeding, reckless, wrong way, no lights, plus expired
tags.”</p>
<p>“When did they expire?”</p>
<p>“Uh, last week, I believe.”</p>
<p>“No lights?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you see it was raining and her wipers were on. If wipers are
on, then lights too.”</p>
<p>“Were you solo?”</p>
<p>“Oh, in other words, Do I have a witness?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was solo, but I have the video. Dashcam. Slow-motion and
living color. Ask me nicely and I’ll send you the link.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Look, I need to talk to the judge. Any objections if we bump
it for a few weeks?”</p>
<p>“No problem here.”</p>
<p>It was routine in the city courts to continue cases for a month or
so, especially when lawyers got involved.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“No problem,” the officer said. “But, look, has she told you about
the other charges?”</p>
<p>“Afraid not.”</p>
<p>“Two pending, both moving violations. Ran a red last week, and used a
wrong lane two weeks ago. Dashcam, more footage. If this reckless
sticks, it’s probably time to sell the car.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Inside the courtroom, Simon stopped by the clerk’s desk and filed a
short request for a continuance. He and Eleanor left the annex and
walked two blocks to a coffee shop where he paid for two cups and they
sat in a corner.</p>
<p>With a warm smile, Simon began with “You should’ve told me about
these traffic tickets, Netty. This is more serious than I first
thought.”</p>
<p>Her eyes watered and she said, “I know. I just didn’t want to worry
you with them. You’ve done so much for me. My will, getting me out of
town when Clyde was here. I just hate to bother. I know how busy you
are.”</p>
<p>He kept smiling as he listened, nothing but warmth and understanding.
“I’m never too busy to help my clients, Netty. That’s what I’m for. Now,
who is your insurance agent?”</p>
<p>She frowned, then closed her eyes for a second. “Oh, what’s her name?
Sells Allstate up north of town, by the mall. I’ll think of it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll find her. This could pose a real problem, Netty. Reckless
driving is a serious charge and insurance companies don’t like them.
Plus you have other charges you never told me about.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. Will they take away my license?” The fear was obvious,
and Simon felt sorry for her. Mobility was life, and losing it only
brought the end closer.</p>
<p>“I don’t know but probably not. The bigger problem is losing your
insurance. You can’t drive if you have no insurance.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear.”</p>
<p>“But I’ll get to work on it. Now, about the expired tags. You’ve told
me that you still pay all of your own bills.”</p>
<p>“I do indeed,” she bristled. “Every Monday morning, I pay my bills
first thing. It’s an old habit Harry had.”</p>
<p>“I see. So how did you miss the license renewal?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Something must have fallen through the cracks. It’s
not a monthly bill, you know?” She was indignant for a moment and tried
to seem offended. Then, from nowhere, “Doris wants to do lunch with us.
She knows an Indian place out in the country in an old service station.
Said the food is great.”</p>
<p>Doris was a friend she mentioned occasionally, one of few. Simon
wasn’t thrilled with the idea of lunching with a stranger. “Is Doris
still driving?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. She’s only seventy-nine.”</p>
<p>“Married.”</p>
<p>“Sort of. Delbert is in a facility, out of it. Hasn’t said a word in
two years. Really sad. I’ve told her all about our lunches and she would
really like to join us.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Netty. We discuss some pretty serious matters over
lunch and there are things we need to decide. Let’s wait a while before
we include anyone else.”</p>
<p>She did not like to be told no and began to pout.</p>
