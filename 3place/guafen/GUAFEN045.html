<h4 id="chapter-44">Chapter 44</h4>
<p>Over coffee that morning, Raymond had told Casey and Simon that he
was prepared to make one of three opening statements, depending on
Cora’s tactics. She had a lot of ground to cover and he suspected she
might ramble a bit. All in all, though, he gave her high marks for her
presentation. The jury stayed with her as she told a compelling story
and piled plenty of suspicion upon Simon.</p>
<p>Raymond’s approach would be that the defense had nothing to prove and
would need only to poke holes in the prosecution’s case. Once the jurors
had settled into their chairs after the recess, he walked to the podium,
with no notes, and offered a charming smile.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to remind you that nothing you just
heard from Ms. Cook has been proven, none of it is evidence, all of it
just her speculation, her hopes and dreams maybe, of what the
Commonwealth might try to prove against Simon Latch. She tells a nice
story. She’s an experienced prosecutor. The problem is that she has
promised too much. She can’t deliver all that she promised, nearly two
hours’ worth, because she doesn’t have the proof.”</p>
<p>He stepped away from the podium and stuck both hands deep into his
pants pockets. “There are so many important facts that she conveniently
left out. For example, she said that Ms. Barnett was in the hospital
being treated for injuries received in a car wreck. What she failed to
include was that Ms. Barnett was driving too fast late at night, ran a
red light, and T-boned another car, seriously injuring its occupants. At
the time of the crash, she was driving and she was, well, let’s just say
she was intoxicated. Point zero-nine, over the limit. It seems that she
had been out partying with the girls, they had some type of ‘poker’ club
they called it, and it was their annual Christmas party. She got
hammered, got behind the wheel, and as her friend Doris rode shotgun
they took off down the streets of Braxton at ten-thirty at night. She
damned near killed Doris.”</p>
<p>He managed to make killing Doris sound almost humorous. Simon was
impressed with his oratorical skills. For years he had heard stories
about Raymond’s courtroom antics and abilities, but he had never seen
him in action. With a packed house, an attentive jury, and everything on
the line, Raymond was in the center of the ring and completely at
home.</p>
<p>“Greed!” he snarled loudly. Then he managed a belly laugh that
startled everyone. “Greed. For the simple will, Simon Latch charged
Eleanor Barnett the greedy sum of two hundred and fifty dollars. And she
never paid him! And for the retainer that she insisted on, he got really
greedy and charged her one thousand dollars. And she never paid that
bill either! For almost nine months of legal work, and not counting the
long lunches she insisted on, nor the coffees, nor the late-night phone
calls, nor the hospital visits, not counting anything but the hours
spent at his desk tending to her legal matters, over sixty hours of
billable time, the defendant, Simon Latch, received a total sum of…zero!
Nothing, not a dime. Why are we talking about greed?”</p>
<p>Raymond wandered away from the podium, shaking his head at such
foolishness.</p>
<p>“Something else Ms. Cook neglected. Mr. Simon Latch, a well-respected
member of the bar with no ethics complaints or malpractice suits filed
against him throughout his entire career in Braxton, was immediately
suspicious of Ms. Barnett’s assertions of being rich. How often does a
client walk into a law office to meet an attorney for the first time and
claim to have twenty million or so in assets? In Braxton, Virginia? It
never happens, I can assure you of that. Simon Latch was no fool. He saw
the signs of modest affluence—the absence of debt, a nice pension
inherited from her husband, a lovely home free and clear—but those
things were not unusual. He immediately suspected she wasn’t being
truthful. He repeatedly asked her for proof, as in periodic brokerage
statements or bank records. When she resisted, he became even more
suspicious.”</p>
<p>And here the fiction began. Only Simon could tell the jury what went
on between himself and Eleanor. Only he could re-invent what his
thoughts were at the beginning. There was an element of truth in what
Raymond was telling the jury, but the fiction was taking over.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t driven by greed. The poor woman had no one else. No
husband, no children, no siblings, no close relatives. She needed a
friend, a counselor, a lawyer to help her through the legal maze. She
was eighty-five, single and lonely, and she claimed to have a lot of
assets. Perhaps she really believed the money was still there. Perhaps,
ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Eleanor Barnett was already a bit off her
rocker, as we sometimes say.”</p>
<p>Simon had never really believed Netty was unbalanced or losing her
mental acuity, but something was wrong. A screw was loose somewhere. To
build an elaborate charade and pursue it with such detail was still
difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p>“Ms. Cook makes hay from this cremation issue. Again, her facts are
wrong. Years ago Simon and his wife signed new wills and advance
directives providing for their own cremations and interments in a
mausoleum. Nothing new. They were convinced it was a cheaper, more
sustainable way to go. Cremation is rapidly gaining popularity across
the country, with a thirty percent increase every year for the past ten.
Simon recommended cremation to many of his clients. Eleanor Barnett was
one. He wasn’t trying to destroy evidence by having her cremated.
Nonsense.”</p>
<p>Raymond spat out “nonsense” as if only a fool could believe such
stupidity.</p>
<p>“And the bit about pulling the plug. Oh, that’s rich, that’s juicy.
But, alas, it’s not true either. Again, Ms. Cook leaves out some very
important facts. You’ll hear from Dr. Connor Wilkes, the hospital’s CEO,
and she will tell you that Simon wanted no part of the decision to take
Ms. Barnett off the ventilator. He flat-out told her and the doctors
that it was a medical decision to be made by them, and not him.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he was sad and frustrated. He spoke softly, as if confiding
in the jurors. “The truth is, we don’t know who poisoned Eleanor
Barnett. And the Commonwealth of Virginia is going to waste this entire
week trying to pin a murder on an innocent man, while the killer laughs
at us. The killer could be in this courtroom at this very moment.”
Raymond allowed those words to settle upon the crowd, then he, a bit too
dramatically, paused and gazed at the audience, as if searching for the
murderer. As if he knew the person was watching and listening.</p>
<p>He returned to the jurors and said, “At the rate we’re going, her
murder will never be solved. The police picked the wrong suspect,
arrested him, then stopped their investigation. The prosecutor ran to
the grand jury, got an indictment, and never considered other suspects.
Now we’re here, in this courtroom, watching and listening as the
Commonwealth of Virginia tries in vain to pin the murder on Simon Latch.
He didn’t do it, ladies and gentlemen. No one saw him buy the poison.
There are no records of him doing so. No one saw him tamper with the
ginger cookies, because he didn’t. No one saw him feed them to
Ms. Barnett, because he didn’t. There is simply no proof.”</p>
<p>Simon scribbled, “Brilliant, but a good time to quit.”</p>
<p>Raymond knew it too. With a look of total frustration, he wrapped it
up with “When all the witnesses are finished, and the proof is in, and
you deliberate and realize that Simon Latch is not guilty, then you will
march back into this courtroom, take your seats, declare his innocence,
and go home having done your civic duty, and the real killer will still
be out there. Laughing. No doubt, laughing.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Detective Roger Barr was sworn in as the first witness for the
prosecution. It was 1:15 Monday, and he was in for a long afternoon.
Cora Cook walked him through his training and experience and so on,
though he was not testifying as an expert in any field. His task was to
present the framework of the case. Others would fill in the gaps and
nail down the proof.</p>
<p>His involvement began on December 30 of the prior year, when a
dispatcher at the city desk informed him that an anonymous phone call
had been received and recorded. A distorted voice said, “Eleanor Barnett
just passed away at Blue Ridge Memorial. The doctors say it’s pneumonia.
But her death is suspicious. It should be investigated.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cook walked to the exhibit table where a recorder had been
prepared. She got the nod from Judge Shyam and pressed a key. The
message boomed from the courtroom’s PA system. Ms. Cook waited a few
seconds, and played it again.</p>
<p>Detective Barr went through an exhaustive description of the efforts
by the state crime lab to identify and track the caller, but it was not
possible. The technicians could not agree on the gender of the
informant. He or she had used a cheap throwaway phone with a temporary
number. The voice was disguised. At any rate, Detective Barr was given
the green light to investigate by the chief, and he went straight to the
hospital. Referring to his detailed notes, he walked the jury step by
step, minute by minute, through his initial actions. The interviews with
the doctors and staff, the collection of items from Eleanor’s hospital
room, the visit to the funeral home to stop the cremation, and so
on.</p>
<p>Simon pretended to listen with great interest, but he had read all of
Barr’s reports. He had read everything in the police files, every
exhibit the Commonwealth would throw at him. He had read and re-read and
memorized every detail known to the lawyers, experts, and investigators.
So he made notes, the same ones he had scribbled onto paper a hundred
times in the past four months. Who was the leaker, the informant, the
person close enough to Eleanor to know when she died? His top suspect
was Jerry Korsak, who had been to the hospital at least once and
probably more than that. He clearly had an interest in the estate and
had even hired an expensive lawyer to get involved. Jerry was slippery
and evil enough to poison his dear stepmother. He was broke and crooked
enough to go for her money. He was also thick between the ears and not
smart enough to pull it off. The one great question Simon always
confronted when suspecting Jerry was: How did he know about the
cremation? The leaker stopped it cold. If two more hours had passed,
what was left of dear Eleanor would have gone up in smoke.</p>
<p>His next suspect was Tillie, primarily because she handled the ginger
cookies. Simon bought them and put them on her desk to take to the
hospital. Tillie knew about the plans to cremate because she typed the
advance directive. She knew the time of Eleanor’s death. But Simon could
not force himself to believe that a gentle soul like Matilda Clark would
commit such a horrible crime.</p>
<p>Wally Thackerman’s name was always on Simon’s list, for obvious
reasons. Two days before Eleanor died, he checked in at the hospital’s
front desk, as all visitors were supposed to do. He visited Eleanor for
half an hour and signed out. Simon was not aware of his visit until much
later when he saw the hospital logs. In Simon’s world, Wally remained a
suspect, though not a serious one. If he was planning to poison her, why
would he bother signing in and out and leaving clear proof that he had
been there?</p>
<p>He forgot about his sleuthing when Raymond began barking. The
Commonwealth was attempting to introduce into evidence the last will and
testament Simon had drafted for Eleanor. Raymond objected, but only
because he had to. There was no way to keep the will from the jury. Two
weeks earlier, in an all-day motion hearing, the two sides had fought
vigorously over which documents would be admitted into evidence. The
defense took the position that the will was the private work-product of
an attorney, and thus privileged and protected. The will had not been
probated and was not a matter of public record. The Commonwealth argued
that the privilege expired when Eleanor died, so Simon had no right to
conceal the will. It was a crucial issue and both sides submitted
lengthy briefs. Simon wrote his own, all thirty pages of it. Judge Shyam
promptly ruled in favor of the prosecution. The will, advance directive,
and power of attorney could be admitted. Raymond was not surprised with
the ruling.</p>
<p>Detective Barr explained to the jury how he came to possess the
documents, but was not prepared to discuss them. He was not a
lawyer.</p>
<p>At 3:30, everyone needed a break, and Judge Shyam recessed until 4
P.M. The courtroom emptied quickly as folks raced for the toilets. Simon
remained at the defense table and watched the crowd. He was surprised to
see Teddy Hammer, evidently there to keep an eye on things. With the
value of Eleanor’s estate now greatly diminished, Simon had assumed
Teddy would move on to hunt bigger game. Maybe not. Maybe he was still
sniffing around, plotting to grab a hundred grand or so in fees from
whatever was left. Oh well. The chaos of Eleanor’s estate would be
handled by someone else. Simon was much more concerned with his own
problems.</p>
<p>A ballsy reporter thrust herself toward him and was about to pop a
question when a bailiff practically clotheslined her. “No press, no
press!” he growled as he shooed her away.</p>
<p>Simon chatted with Casey Noland. “I assume the horde is still out
there in full force.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Dozens of them.”</p>
<p>“Have they convicted me yet?”</p>
<p>“That happened months ago.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for nothing.”</p>
<p>Detective Barr returned to the witness stand and proceeded to answer
questions about Eleanor Barnett’s driving record and her accident.
Copies of her tickets and court transcripts were admitted. Such evidence
was not needed nor was it relevant, but Raymond had mentioned it during
his opening remarks and Judge Shyam saw no harm in allowing it. Raymond
had no plans to criticize Ms. Barnett, may she rest in peace.</p>
<p>When Cora Cook was finally finished with Detective Barr, she tendered
the witness for cross-examination. Raymond carried a legal pad to the
podium and tossed it down. “Detective Barr, where does one purchase
thallium?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Have you tried to purchase it, as a law enforcement officer?”</p>
<p>“No. Why should I?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe to better understand the murder weapon.
Maybe to better inform the jury. Maybe to gain knowledge that might be
useful later on. I can think of several reasons.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. Never tried it.”</p>
<p>“But you believe that Mr. Latch purchased it, right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how he got it. Why don’t you ask him?”</p>
<p>“I’m in charge of the questions right now, Detective. Certainly
you’ve talked to other homicide detectives, and perhaps toxicologists,
perhaps other experts in the field, to gain some understanding of where
the poison comes from. Right?”</p>
<p>“Is that a question?”</p>
<p>“It is. Answer it,” Judge Shyam snapped, obviously ticked off at
Barr’s cockiness.</p>
<p>“Well, I spoke with the toxicologist at the crime lab right after the
autopsy. We had a general discussion about thallium, but nothing
specific.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Now, back in January, you asked Mr. Latch if he would
voluntarily surrender his laptops and desktop computers, is that
right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And did he?”</p>
<p>“Not at first. He was rather reluctant.”</p>
<p>“Has it been your experience that most people are reluctant to hand
over their computers to a homicide detective?”</p>
<p>“I guess you could say so.”</p>
<p>“And did he eventually give you his computers?”</p>
<p>“Yes, after I got a warrant. You were there, Mr. Lassiter. The entire
meeting is on video.”</p>
<p>“Okay, now why did you want his computers?”</p>
<p>“We were looking for evidence, for any entry or any reference to
poisons, specifically to thallium.”</p>
<p>“Who examined Mr. Latch’s computers?”</p>
<p>“Charles Pettigrew, a tech analyst with the state crime lab.”</p>
<p>“Did Mr. Pettigrew find what he was looking for?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Did Mr. Pettigrew find any evidence that Mr. Latch or someone else
had erased or scrubbed or in any way deleted files or references from
either computer?”</p>
<p>“No, there was none of that.”</p>
<p>“So your search of Mr. Latch’s computers turned up nothing relative
to poisons?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct.”</p>
<p>“Did you also have a look at Mr. Latch’s phone records, both his cell
and his office landline?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we got a search warrant and collected those records.”</p>
<p>“Searching for what?”</p>
<p>“The same. Any reference to poisons, poisoning deaths, thallium, the
like.”</p>
<p>“And what did you find?”</p>
<p>“Nothing of interest.”</p>
<p>“Not a hint of anything remotely related to poisons in general and
thallium specifically?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been a police officer in Braxton?”</p>
<p>“Eleven years.”</p>
<p>“And how long have you been a homicide detective?”</p>
<p>“The past six years.”</p>
<p>“How many homicides have you investigated?”</p>
<p>“About half a dozen. We don’t have many homicides in Braxton.”</p>
<p>“Did any of these homicides involve thallium?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Did you seek assistance from the Virginia State Police?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we normally consult with them in homicide cases, but they were
not officially involved in this one.”</p>
<p>“Did they have any idea where one might procure thallium?”</p>
<p>“Well, uh, I don’t recall the state police having knowledge of other
poisoning cases such as this one.”</p>
<p>“They knew of no one who might deal in lethal poisons?”</p>
<p>“If they did, they didn’t mention it to me.”</p>
<p>With a heavy sigh and a frustrated look, Raymond said, “Your Honor,
that’s all I have at this time. I’d like to reserve the right to recall
this witness in the morning.”</p>
<p>“As you wish. We are adjourned until nine A.M. tomorrow.”</p>
