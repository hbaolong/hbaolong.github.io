<h4 id="chapter-64">Chapter 64</h4>
<p>He loathed the prospect of returning to his dark, empty office and
The Closet with nothing to do but dig through more research. Hadn’t he
just solved the mystery, or had it been solved for him? Had he not found
the killer? His phone buzzed as he pulled into the alley behind his
office. Landy said, “There’s an FBI office in Charlottesville. Can you
be there at nine in the morning?”</p>
<p>“I have nothing else to do. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“The FBI and the U.S. Attorney.”</p>
<p>“Is that all? Sure I’ll be there.”</p>
<p>“Bring your research. Bring everything.”</p>
<p>“I have at least three boxes of files. And umpteen gigabytes on my
laptop.”</p>
<p>“Zip me that stuff tonight and bring the boxes.”</p>
<p>“So you and your pals are interested?”</p>
<p>“The investigation is now open. Congratulations.”</p>
<p>He didn’t feel like celebrating, nor did he feel like working. He
fell asleep on the sofa, napped for an hour, then jogged for another
one. He talked to Paula and the kids for a long time and got the latest
scoop on their back-to-school adventures. Buck was entering his senior
year. With some luck, Simon would not miss it.</p>
<p>When the sun faded, he changed into jeans and slinked through the
alleys and back streets, and entered Chub’s a few minutes after nine.
Valerie brought him a drink, then a cheeseburger. Chub was not around
and that was okay. Simon didn’t feel like discussing his problems. He
played video poker for two hours, won thirty-one dollars before finally
quitting, and left a twenty-dollar bill on the bar for Valerie.</p>
<hr />
<p>Landy pulled an all-nighter and put together a ten-page memo, a very
rough draft of Mr. Oscar Kofie’s adventures with thallium. She had
plenty of facts on the Eleanor Barnett case, but fewer on the
others.</p>
<p>It was an all-girls show, except for Simon, who sat on one side of
the table with Landy as they faced Carmen Riddle, the assistant U.S.
attorney (AUSA), and Shelia Wycoff, supervisor in charge (SIC), FBI.
Once Simon had the alphabet untangled and somewhat clear, he was ready
to proceed.</p>
<p>He explained that he possessed an extensive collection of materials
regarding the suspect: his personnel, employment, HR files from the four
hospitals where he had worked in the past decade; the voluminous medical
records of patients in those hospitals who had died either by poisoning
or similar, though undiagnosed, symptoms; along with a mountain of
materials regarding the claims of two deceased patients in Scranton,
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Shelia Wycoff asked, “How did you obtain the personnel records from
the hospitals?”</p>
<p>“I paid a hacker. I don’t know anything about hacking, so I found
someone who did.”</p>
<p>“Did you violate statutes?”</p>
<p>“Oh hell yeah, and maybe I’ll do it again. What are you gonna do,
indict me? Look, Ms. Wycoff, I’ve already been convicted, wrongfully,
you see, and I’m headed to prison for a long time. I really don’t give a
damn about breaking laws at this point. Pile it on. I don’t care if you
indict me.”</p>
<p>Carmen Riddle asked, “Okay, what about the claims, the lawsuits, in
Scranton. Where did that information come from?”</p>
<p>“It started with the same hacker, you see. A young lady with a
boyfriend who’s in a federal prison camp with two laptops and three
phones, all contraband. They’re a great team, unless they get caught.
You guys should really tighten up security at your camps. Anyway, they
picked up the trail of the Scranton claims and located a lawyer who was
involved. I went to see him three days ago and I learned all we need to
know about Oscar Kofie. He’s a serial homicidal poisoner with at least
three dead bodies notched in his belt, maybe as many as five more. But
you don’t have to prove those. Prove only one. Prove only Eleanor
Barnett, and send him away for life.”</p>
<p>It was obvious Simon was miles ahead of them, not only on the facts
but also with strategies. Carmen Riddle was curious about the role of
the local police.</p>
<p>Simon dismissed it immediately. “Don’t waste your time. Their case is
closed. They got the killer, the wrong one, and they’ll probably defend
their bogus investigation until hell freezes over. Standard procedure
for law enforcement. Sorry, but that includes the FBI. In wrongful
convictions the stakes are too great, and the mistakes are so
catastrophic, that no one can ever admit getting the wrong guy. Forget
the locals. Nice boys and all that, but you don’t need them. I’m handing
you the case, okay?”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Carmen Riddle looked at Landy and asked, “Should we put Kofie under
surveillance?”</p>
<p>Simon barged in with “Why? He’s not going anywhere, unless he gets
spooked. Play it cool, don’t tip him off, grab him one day at work, then
trash his apartment.”</p>
<p>Riddle said, “We’ll handle that part, Mr. Latch. For now, I advise
you to stop your illegal monitoring of his email.”</p>
<p>Simon shrugged as if he’d think about it. “Will you get a warrant and
watch the apartment?”</p>
<p>“That’s what we usually do. We’ll tap his phone and his
computer.”</p>
<p>Simon found it funny and said, “Well, if your boys need any help,
just let me know. My hackers are already there.”</p>
<p>The three women seemed startled and glanced at each other. Carmen
Riddle took a deep breath and asked Simon, “Do you know the medical
director at the hospital in Braxton?”</p>
<p>“Yes, quite well. Dr. Connor Wilkes.”</p>
<p>“Well, how should we approach her?”</p>
<p>“Simple. The most urgent matter right now, other than me saving my
own neck, is to make sure this guy does not poison anyone else. Right
now the hospital has no clue. They think the Barnett murder is solved,
life goes on as usual. Though I’ve heard through the grapevine that
they’ve banned all carry-in food. No more cookies and brownies for
Grandma. Which is a shame because they should ban all the food from
their own cafeteria.”</p>
<p>Simon paused for a bit of laughter, or at least a nod to his quick
wit. Nothing.</p>
<p>“And I’ve also heard that Tan Lu’s Vietnamese restaurant can’t give
the damned ginger cookies away these days. Too bad.”</p>
<p>Carmen said, “If we could get back to the issues.”</p>
<p>“Sure. If I were you, I’d have a powwow with the hospital brass soon,
tomorrow if possible, and make sure their lawyers are there. Tell them
the truth. Tell them that Eleanor Barnett was not poisoned by me. Tell
them they have a probable serial killer on their payroll, and that the
FBI has the place surrounded.</p>
<p>“Their exposure is enormous. A trial lawyer’s dream. A public
relations nightmare that could easily bankrupt the hospital. Who would
want to go there for critical care? Make sure someone inside is watching
Kofie to keep him away from the patients. You need the hospital’s
cooperation right now, at least until he’s in custody. Once that
happens, the shit hits the fan. It’s front-page headlines and the
hospital turns into a bunker. I don’t really care. Kofie is their
employee. He’ll go to prison and the hospital will be mired in lawsuits
for years.”</p>
<p>Riddle and Wycoff scribbled furiously. Landy looked at some notes. To
Simon, the silence indicated they would like to hear some additional
thoughts from him. He continued, “Once you meet with the hospital and
drop that bomb, you lose control of the story. You can’t trust everyone
to keep quiet. If I were in charge, I’d move quickly but carefully. Get
your warrants, go through his apartment, where you’re probably going to
find one or two locked toolboxes where he keeps his little pharmacy, his
collection of poisons. I’ve seen pictures. It’s quite impressive.
Includes thallium, which appears to be his favorite. When you find that,
you have probable cause.”</p>
<p>Riddle asked, “And what’s your schedule?”</p>
<p>“As you know, I’m trying to set aside my guilty verdict. We have a
hearing next week, a closed one. You should be there. Let me know and
I’ll get you front-row seats.”</p>
