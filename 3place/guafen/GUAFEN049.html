<h4 id="chapter-48">Chapter 48</h4>
<p>When Clement Gelly agreed to serve as the conservator of Eleanor
Barnett’s estate back in January, he was practically guaranteed by Judge
Pointer that he would not get tangled up in any criminal proceedings. He
certainly did not want to testify against Simon Latch, a lawyer he liked
and respected. Now that he was entangled and even subpoenaed, he tried
to avoid taking the stand by filing a motion with the court. Said motion
was denied. He pleaded with Judge Pointer to remove him as conservator,
but she refused. She apologized for the mess he was in, but had no
choice because no other lawyer in Braxton would get near the case.</p>
<p>He swore to tell the truth and sat in the witness chair with the firm
intention of saying as little as necessary. If at all possible, he would
say nothing to harm Simon’s defense.</p>
<p>Using real estate tax records, bank statements, and quarterly notices
from Rumke-Brown, he quickly laid out the value of Ms. Barnett’s estate.
The house was unencumbered by debt and appraised last year for 92,000. A
checking account at Security Bank in Braxton had a balance of ,300.
There were two certificates of deposit held by the East Federal bank in
Atlanta, one for 1,000 and one for 3,000. A money market account at the
same bank had a balance of 8,400. The estate owned 6,775 shares of
common stock in the Coca-Cola corporation, market value the day before
of 71,000. Add another ,000 for furniture and assorted personal items,
and the total value was slightly more than 30,000. No state or federal
estate taxes were anticipated.</p>
<p>As Simon scribbled the numbers down and tallied them up, he had to
admit that most of the wills he had prepared in his career involved
estates with far fewer assets. It was an impressive estate for Braxton,
Virginia, but a far, lonely, and pathetic cry from what he once dreamed
of. He could not help but remember the first time he tallied up the
value of her estate. It had been more than a year earlier, in his
conference room, as Netty softly dabbed her eyes with a tissue and lied
through those natural yellow teeth. What a smooth and convincing liar
she had been. What a gullible and greedy fool he had been.</p>
<p>Relying on brokerage statements provided by Buddy Brown, Clement gave
a succinct summary of Harry Korsak’s investment history and the
accumulation of wealth. Because he could not verify the story, he
skipped the best part, the volcano that blew Montrouge out of the
Caribbean and off the map, and said that Harry had lost most of his
money through bad investments. It was a colorful subplot but thoroughly
irrelevant.</p>
<p>Clement showed the jury the mysterious notebook Ms. Barnett kept
partially hidden in a check binder, but refused to speculate on why she
did so. The jury would have to speculate too. Apparently, the old gal
lost her marbles not long after she lost her money, and still pretended
she was loaded. In great detail, she had lied to two lawyers and kept
her fiction straight.</p>
<p>Simon thought of the hours lost with her, primarily eating in ethnic
restaurants and discussing strange food. And all on his beleaguered
credit card.</p>
<p>She never offered to pay for the first meal.</p>
<p>The estate was liquid and would provide a nice windfall for someone,
probably Jerry and Clyde Korsak. There was enough money to keep a
bigshot like Teddy Hammer sticking around. He was back in the courtroom
for the third day, second row from the rear, left side, a regular
vulture. Praying for a conviction to keep Simon on the sideline for
years to come.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth wanted to use Clement to further its theory that
Simon became convinced his client was wealthy; thus, the motive to use
her estate as a vehicle to collect some fat fees. In Simon’s opinion,
that motive had already been established.</p>
<p>The next witness piled on. Dirk Wheeler had been subpoenaed by the
prosecutor and reluctantly took the stand. Cora established that he was
a lawyer in D.C. and had gone to law school with the defendant. They
were old friends who kept in touch.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wheeler, on March the tenth of last year, you received a call on
your office phone from the defendant, correct?”</p>
<p>“Simon Latch called me, yes.”</p>
<p>“According to your phone records, the call lasted for almost fifteen
minutes.”</p>
<p>“Is that a question?”</p>
<p>“Let’s say it is.”</p>
<p>“You have my phone records, Ms. Cook, and Simon’s as well. You know
exactly how long the call lasted.”</p>
<p>“What did you talk about?”</p>
<p>“The weather, college basketball, life in general, a law school
friend who has some medical issues.”</p>
<p>“What prompted the call?”</p>
<p>“Simon placed the call. You’ll have to ask him.”</p>
<p>“What did he want?”</p>
<p>“Well, among other things, he said he had a client with a substantial
net worth and wanted some off-the-cuff tax advice.”</p>
<p>“And you’re a tax lawyer, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, estate and tax.”</p>
<p>“What kind of off-the-cuff tax advice?”</p>
<p>“Rates, primarily.”</p>
<p>“Can you explain this to the jury?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can.”</p>
<p>After an awkward pause during which Cora glared at the witness and
the witness never blinked, she said, “Then please do so.”</p>
<p>“We never got into the current rate structure for estate taxes
because there were no estate taxes for last year. It was a loophole
Congress overlooked. I explained this to Simon.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t know it?”</p>
<p>“If he had known it, he wouldn’t have called and asked me.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t this rather basic knowledge at the time?”</p>
<p>Dirk snickered as if she was an idiot and said, “Absolutely not. Very
few lawyers were aware of the loophole last year. It’s a tax issue, and
most lawyers stay away from tax work. It’s all I do.”</p>
<p>“How often does the defendant call you for advice?”</p>
<p>“I don’t log my personal phone calls, Ms. Cook. Simon and I talk all
the time. Last year I had a bankruptcy question so I called him. Back
and forth. That’s what lawyers do. There was nothing at all unusual
about the call you’re referring to.”</p>
<p>Dirk was believable and Cora was on her heels, six-inch ones.
Actually, lawyers, or at least the ones Simon knew, rarely relied on one
another for legal advice. To do so would be to admit ignorance. But Dirk
was scoring points for the defense and the Commonwealth was losing
interest.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Raymond asked, “Mr. Wheeler, what’s the going
hourly rate for estate tax lawyers these days in Washington, D.C.?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they vary, same as most legal fees. The big firms with the big
clients are charging fifteen hundred an hour. Smaller tax firms are
trying to catch up.”</p>
<p>“May I ask how much you charge per hour?”</p>
<p>“Sure. It’s no secret. We post all of our fees for any new client.
Right now my rate is nine hundred an hour.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a lot of money?”</p>
<p>“It is indeed, but we deal with wealthy clients with many assets,
often in different countries. They owe a lot in taxes and prefer to
avoid them as much as possible. These are complicated situations that
require a high level of skill.”</p>
<p>“Do you think five hundred an hour is a fair rate for the legal work
involved in Ms. Barnett’s estate?”</p>
<p>“More than fair.”</p>
<p>Simon glanced at the jury box and made eye contact with Number
Eleven, Mindy Rutledge, a thirty-four-year-old mother of three whose
husband had just been kicked out of the Navy. The disgusted look she
gave Simon meant only one thing: How dare you expect me to believe that
anybody is worth five hundred dollars an hour?</p>
<hr />
<p>During lunch, they hustled back to the offices of Marshall Graff and
met in the “war room,” as they called it. They were standing and eating
cold sandwiches when Landy arrived and shut the door behind her. “This
meeting never happened, okay?”</p>
<p>They agreed and gathered around her laptop on the table. She pressed
a key and the video began. Landy narrated, “At eight-oh-four this
morning, Matilda Clark left the Hampton Inn. That’s her in front, behind
is Jerry Korsak. They stopped, said goodbye, quick peck on the cheek,
and they got in separate cars.”</p>
<p>She froze the video for a close-up of Tillie. Simon, Raymond, and
Casey leaned in closer.</p>
<p>“Ms. Clark drove three hours to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where she
parked in a lot next to an apartment building in a large complex. Unit
614 has been rented by Jerry Korsak since February of this year. About
an hour after she entered the building, a repairman knocked on the door,
she answered, and he apologized, said he had the wrong place. He works
for us and verified her identity. Meanwhile, Jerry returned to the
courtroom and found a seat on the back row. He’s wearing glasses and may
be trying to disguise himself.”</p>
<p>Simon said, “I saw him. He’s been here every day.”</p>
<p>Casey: “I guess he’s an interested party.”</p>
<p>Simon said, “His lawyer, Teddy Hammer, is back there too. They smell
blood.”</p>
<p>“And money.”</p>
<p>Landy closed her laptop and said, “Okay, boys, I could get fired for
this, so mum’s the word. The agency takes a very dim view of
moonlighting.”</p>
<p>“Not a word,” Raymond said.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot, Landy.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. Good luck.”</p>
<p>She nodded and left, no handshake, no peck on the cheek of her old
boyfriend. Strictly business.</p>
<p>Raymond crunched on some chips and said, “Fascinating, yes, but right
now it’s a diversion, one that we have to ignore.”</p>
<p>Simon was bewildered by the images of Tillie and Jerry together. He
said, “I don’t understand. Shouldn’t we tell the judge about this?”</p>
<p>Both defense lawyers shook their heads. Raymond said, “No, you can’t
simply call time-out and say, ‘Hey Judge, we might have some more clues
here.’ ”</p>
<p>Casey said, “It’s suspicious as hell, all right, but we have no proof
of anything even remotely relevant.”</p>
<p>Simon sat down loudly, raked his fingers through his hair, and said,
“This jury is going to crush me, I can tell.”</p>
<p>Raymond took another large bite of his smoked tuna on rye and said,
with a mouthful, “I don’t think so. The trial is going our way, Simon. I
think the prosecution is out of witnesses. The last two helped us more
than Cora. Her case is sputtering to a close.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Casey?”</p>
<p>“The Commonwealth has proven the facts that we stipulated to. It has
done a decent job of making you look suspicious, but it has not placed
you at the scene of the crime. And I agree with Raymond—they have
nothing else. I’m pretty confident right now.”</p>
<p>“So, will I testify?”</p>
<p>“Do you want to?” Raymond asked.</p>
<p>“What I want to do is save my neck, and I’ll do anything, and say
anything, that will help me walk out of here a free man. Do you know
what it’s like to think about going to prison for the rest of your life?
Carry that around with you all day long, okay? Try to get a decent
night’s sleep with that nightmare screaming at you. It’s terrifying.
I’ll do anything, say anything.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The final witness for the prosecution was Sami Lu, the
eighteen-year-old daughter of Tan Lu, the restaurant owner. She had
worked part-time in the family business since she could walk and would
soon enroll at Virginia Tech with a full scholarship. Sami did not want
to get involved in the trial and would not agree to testify; thus, she
had been served with a subpoena. She took the stand holding some notes,
copies of which had been provided to the defense.</p>
<p>Cora asked her if she remembered serving the defendant and his
client, Ms. Eleanor Barnett. She replied that she did not know the name
of the client, but yes, they had eaten in the restaurant on three
occasions the previous year and she had waited on them. Using her notes,
she gave the dates and said that each meal was paid with Mr. Latch’s
credit card.</p>
<p>Almost on cue, Raymond stood, appeared to be thoroughly exasperated,
and said, “Your Honor, please. Why are we wasting so much time?”</p>
<p>“State your objection, Mr. Lassiter,” Her Honor said sharply, as if
irritated by him.</p>
<p>“Your Honor, we have tried and tried to stipulate that Simon Latch
dined there several times, then later stopped on two occasions to buy
two boxes of ginger cookies. He bought them for Ms. Barnett while she
was in the hospital. But he didn’t poison them.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough! Overruled. Please continue, Ms. Cook.”</p>
<p>Sami produced the credit card receipts as the prosecutor projected
them on the screen. Simon used the diversion to glance at the jury.
Number two was Linda Garfield, age thirty-seven, a real estate appraiser
for a bank, an attractive woman with large, sad, brown eyes. If it was
possible to flirt with a cute woman sitting on your jury, then Simon had
been flirting. There was no way Linda would convict him.</p>
<p>Cora picked up two exhibits, the carryout containers for Tan Lu’s
orders to go, and Sami identified them as being identical to the ones
she had sold to Mr. Latch.</p>
<p>At first, Raymond thought about waving off the witness and forgoing
any cross-examination, but decided to poke some fun at the prosecution’s
case. He ambled over to the podium and asked, “Now, young lady, who
bakes these Saigon ginger cookies in your restaurant?”</p>
<p>Sami offered a lovely smile, her first of the day, and said, “Oh,
everyone. Me, my parents, my sister, my aunt. The entire family works in
the restaurant.”</p>
<p>“So you can bake these cookies all by yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And for how long have you been doing this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Many years.”</p>
<p>“What are the ingredients?”</p>
<p>“White flour, cane sugar, brown sugar, butter, baking powder, eggs,
ground ginger, molasses, a little salt, some ground cinnamon. I think
that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Sounds delicious. Do you need to use a recipe when you bake these
cookies?”</p>
<p>“No. I’ve done it many times.”</p>
<p>“And they’re baked fresh every day?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Approximately how many are baked each day?”</p>
<p>“About ten dozen.”</p>
<p>“Did you bake the cookies purchased by Mr. Simon Latch?”</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s no way to know. We sell a lot of them and, as I said,
the entire family works in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“Has anyone ever complained about getting sick from eating your
cookies?”</p>
<p>“Not to my knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Are you familiar with a poison called thallium?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Have you or anyone in your family ever added thallium to your
cookies?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“So, as far as you know, when Mr. Latch bought the cookies, both to
carry out and to eat in the restaurant, they were free of thallium and
all other poisons?”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, has Mr. Latch complained of being poisoned by your
cookies?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Not to my knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Judge Shyam said, “You may step down.”</p>
<p>It came as no surprise when Cora stood and said, “Your Honor, the
Commonwealth of Virginia rests.”</p>
<p>Her Honor thought for a second as she reviewed some notes. She
directed the bailiff to dismiss the jury, then adjourned until 9 A.M.
Thursday morning. With the early adjournment, Simon, Raymond, and Casey
disappeared into an empty courtroom down the hall. Raymond was of the
opinion that the Commonwealth had mismanaged its case and allowed it to
end without a punch. It simply ran out of gas. The last witnesses were
ineffective and Cora Cook appeared to be stalling, trying to burn some
clock.</p>
<p>Casey was more pessimistic. Because he was not on his feet
interrogating witnesses, he spent more time watching the jurors, and he
was worried about most of them.</p>
<p>Simon was still praying for a miracle but expecting the worst. From a
third-floor window, he watched the news vans close up shop and leave the
courthouse. When all was clear, he said, “I’m going for a drive. Call me
if you need me.”</p>
<p>Raymond said, “What about tomorrow? Do you want to testify?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ll sleep on it. Let’s meet for coffee at seven and
we’ll decide.”</p>
