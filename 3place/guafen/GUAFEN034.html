<h4 id="chapter-33">Chapter 33</h4>
<p>What do you wear to your arrest? It was one of those questions that
one never thinks about, not even hardened criminals. Simon chose jeans,
a sports coat, and a white shirt. Raymond said to pack some toiletries,
so he filled a paper shopping bag with a few necessities, some clean
underwear, and two paperbacks. He took one last look in the mirror and
despised what he saw, then turned off the lights in his office with no
idea when he might turn them on again.</p>
<p>In the reception area, he fell into a chair and looked at Tillie in
absolute defeat.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” she asked, alarmed.</p>
<p>“About two hours ago the grand jury indicted me for the murder of
Eleanor Barnett.” The words sounded as if they were spoken by an unseen
voice from above. She was stunned and couldn’t speak.</p>
<p>“I’m on my way to the city jail where Raymond Lassiter is waiting.
I’ll be processed like the other criminals and put in a cell. I don’t
know when I’ll get out.”</p>
<p>“Murder!” she blurted.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and said, “Evidently, someone poisoned Eleanor
when she was in the hospital. Those damned ginger cookies I sent were
laced with poison. All eyes are on me.”</p>
<p>She swallowed hard and kept her composure, then wiped her cheeks with
tissues and managed to say, “This is ridiculous, Simon. You’re not
capable of doing something like that.”</p>
<p>He nodded his agreement but said nothing. Another long moment passed
as they ignored the buzzing of the landline on her desk. She asked,
“What about Paula and the kids?”</p>
<p>“Pretty ugly. I told her last night after the kids were in bed. She
was horrified, angry, frightened, the works. Our greatest concern is
protecting our children, but there’s no way. They are about to be
humiliated and I can’t stop it. I can’t protect them.” His voice cracked
and he couldn’t go on. She wiped her eyes again and seemed determined to
contain her emotions.</p>
<p>He said, “I’ll call from the jail as soon as I can. Lock up the
office and stay away. I’m sure reporters will be banging on the door
very soon, so lay low.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe this, Simon.”</p>
<p>“I’m sleepwalking through a nightmare, Tillie, and no one has a clue
how it will end. There are so many unknowns. The best scenario for next
week is that I can make bond and get out. If so, we can try to keep this
place afloat until trial.”</p>
<p>“A trial?”</p>
<p>“That’s what usually happens once you’re charged, unless, of course,
you plead guilty. I’m not doing that.”</p>
<p>“When is the trial?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Months.”</p>
<p>He stood and thought about giving her an awkward hug, but since they
had never done that, he simply said, “Be strong,” and opened the
door.</p>
<p>“You’ll need a coat.”</p>
<p>The temperature was in the twenties and the wind was howling. He
walked down Main Street, past the shops and offices he knew so well, and
tried not to guess what those people would think and say when they heard
the gossip, the unbelievable news. He slowed in front of Ethel’s Diner,
empty at 4 P.M. on a dreary Friday, but Bella, his favorite waitress,
was at the counter drying tea glasses and gabbing at someone in the
kitchen. Bella would never believe that Simon would do something so
awful and would volunteer for jury service if possible.</p>
<p>He crossed the street and walked along Monroe until he came to the
courthouse, a neoclassical masterpiece that Braxton was so proud of. A
hundred years earlier, the city won a lawsuit against a railroad and
wisely chose to put the money into a new monument to itself, with no
expense spared. With its grand arches, vaulted ceilings, and marble
columns, it was routinely voted the most beautiful courthouse in
Virginia.</p>
<p>He thought of all the clerks, secretaries, janitors, bailiffs,
lawyers, and judges who worked there, people he had known for almost
twenty years, and tried to picture their faces when they heard the news.
It was almost too painful to think about. On the second floor, the
lights were on in the main courtroom where in a few short days he would
be led in, not as a lawyer but as a criminal defendant and facing a
judge for an arraignment, his first appearance of many.</p>
<p>He kept walking through the streets of downtown, his town, somewhat
aimlessly but in the general direction of the jail.</p>
<p>Sleepwalking.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was no crowd waiting at the entrance. No reporters yelling at
him. No photographers clicking away. That would come later, but not late
enough. He stepped inside and saw Raymond chatting with a uniformed
officer. The arrest of a lawyer for murder was a momentous occasion in
Braxton, but, thankfully, the police were downplaying it. Simon had
feared a gang of cops loitering about, waiting for a glimpse of their
new trophy, but there were only a couple trying their best to ignore
him.</p>
<p>Raymond handed him a copy of the indictment, hot off the press, and
he read it slowly. The chief of police appeared and said, “I’m sorry,
Simon.” They had known each other for a few years and it was obvious the
chief preferred to be elsewhere. “I have no choice.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Let’s get it over with.”</p>
<p>The processing took an hour. Simon handed over his wallet, which
contained nothing but his driver’s license, and his cell phone. Because
his wristwatch had a leather band he was allowed to keep it, for the
logical reason that it might be difficult to murder another inmate with
a leather band. He posed for his mug shot, then surrendered his
clothing. He changed into a pair of bright orange overalls with the
words City Jail across the back. He was allowed to keep his socks and
running shoes. He was fingerprinted and voluntarily gave a sample of
blood. The paperwork took fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>It was a humiliating process, to say the least, and frightening, but
he was determined to keep a firm jaw and clenched teeth and act as
though nothing they dished out could faze him. He was an innocent man,
and once that was proven to the world he could look back and boast, to
himself, that he had survived the worst. On his office desk he kept a
tall coffee cup filled with pens, pencils, and markers, and on one side
was his favorite slogan: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Tougher.</p>
<p>Once officially an inmate in the city jail, he was led, unshackled,
to a small room where lawyers met their clients. In eighteen years, he’d
been there a few times, but never as the poor schmuck in coveralls.</p>
<p>“You look nice in orange,” Raymond said.</p>
<p>“You trying to be funny?”</p>
<p>“No. I just talked to Judge Pointer again and she’s not willing to
set bond until Monday at the arraignment.”</p>
<p>“No surprise.”</p>
<p>“I practically begged for a release on recognition, but she wouldn’t
budge. Didn’t seem too sympathetic. Looks like you’re here for the
weekend.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be all right. I brought some books. It’ll be a good time to
think, try to sort things out.”</p>
<p>“Good luck with that.”</p>
<p>“Raymond, I really thank you for being here. I know it’s pro bono and
all that, but it means a lot.”</p>
<p>“I’m with you, Simon.”</p>
<p>“Could I ask a favor?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Could I borrow your phone? I need to call my mother.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The leaker struck again Friday night. He or she sent an anonymous
email to Iris Kane, a reporter for the Washington Journal. It read:</p>
<p>Breaking news from Braxton, Virginia. Local attorney arrested in
poisoning death of wealthy client after revising her will. Simon Latch,
42, was indicted by the grand jury this afternoon and surrendered to
authorities at the city jail. Scheduled to appear in Circuit Court
Monday morning.</p>
<p>Iris made half a dozen calls and with little progress. Apparently,
most sources shut down on Friday night in Braxton. Fifteen minutes
later, another anonymous email arrived:</p>
<p>Eleanor Barnett, age 85, was pronounced dead on December 30, at the
Blue Ridge Memorial Hospital. Cause of death—pneumonia. But, an autopsy
later revealed she had been poisoned. You have the exclusive but act
fast. This story has enormous tabloid appeal.</p>
<p>Iris agreed and kept digging online for another hour, again with
nothing to show for it. She went to bed early with plans to head over to
Braxton in the morning for a long day of investigating.</p>
<hr />
<p>The cell was twelve-by-twelve with concrete blocks on three sides and
a wall of iron bars facing the hallway. Two bunk beds hung from the wall
by metal braces. Fortunately, the top bunk was unoccupied, and Simon had
the cell to himself. Directly across the hall, Loomis, a car thief, was
also solo, and lonely, and wanted to talk to someone. Actually, he
preferred to have someone listen while he went on and on. Two cells
away, Carl, an alleged drug dealer who claimed to be innocent, told
Loomis more than once to shut up. Others yelled back and forth, but as
the night wore on, the talking stopped.</p>
<p>Simon tried to read but could not concentrate. He tried every trick
he could remember to keep his thoughts away from his children, but it
was impossible. They were about to be subjected to unrelenting
embarrassment because of something he didn’t do, but the damage would be
done before he could be cleared. The damage was just beginning.</p>
<p>The cheap mattress was two inches thick. The blanket was well worn
but clean. The temperature was a little on the chilly side, but Loomis
said they were lucky because the heat pump had been on the blink. It was
snowing outside, though that was hearsay to Simon. He didn’t know where
the nearest window might be but it wasn’t close.</p>
<p>Loomis said men often cried during their first nights in jail, after
lights out. He said you could always hear them in the dark, even with
pillows over their faces. The pathetic sobs of grown men locked away
from everything they love.</p>
<p>When their wing was finally still, Simon knew the men were awake,
waiting to hear him cry.</p>
