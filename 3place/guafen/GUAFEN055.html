<h4 id="chapter-54">Chapter 54</h4>
<p>Teddy Hammer moved quickly. The following morning, he filed a
petition to open the estate of Eleanor Barnett, who, he alleged, died
without a valid will. Hammer sought to have Jerry Korsak appointed
administrator of the estate.</p>
<p>The petition was the first shot in a legal battle that would probably
drag on for years, like most probate matters. Hammer believed, as did
Clement Gelly, that the estate could be liquidated and yield at least
half a million in cash. Teddy wanted his share.</p>
<p>At the same time, he filed, on behalf of the Korsak boys, two
impressive wrongful death lawsuits. The first, for ten million dollars,
was against Simon Latch, who had just been adjudicated as the killer.
The second, for twenty million, was against the hospital for negligent
care, for allowing the patient to be poisoned. Teddy was kind enough to
email copies of the lawsuits to Simon, who was not surprised and enjoyed
reading them. At the moment, his net worth was about ,000 at best, most
of it tied up in used office furniture and a six-year-old leased Audi
that had exceeded its permitted mileage. He had almost no prospects of
future income. Sue all you want!</p>
<p>Cautiously, he opened his laptop and began reading dozens of emails,
from friends, acquaintances, old clients, and current ones who were
worried about their files. He fought the urge to check social media or
scan the news. Why ruin another miserable day?</p>
<p>He busied himself with work that had to be done. He prepared a form
letter to his clients and explained that he was no longer in business
and they would need to find another lawyer. Since he was not about to
unlock the front door, he promised to mail or ship their files to them.
He sent emails to opposing lawyers, clerks, magistrates, and judges, and
apologized for the inconvenience. He struggled through a short chat with
Paula. The kids were a mess and she did not want him to visit anytime
soon. He loved them more than anything, but he really didn’t want to
face them.</p>
<p>A hard knock on the front door startled him. He let it pass.</p>
<p>Long after dark, he ventured out on foot and stealthily made his way
to Raymond’s office. Casey was visiting his current girlfriend and
trying to make up for lost time. Raymond’s wife preferred that he work
at all hours and stay out of the house. He was finishing a sandwich when
Simon found him in the conference room, a layer of smoke from the first
cigar already hanging above the long table. They poured themselves a
bourbon.</p>
<p>After a long pull, Simon said, “If we’ve learned anything, it’s that
we cannot assume anything. I was assumed to be the killer, and convicted
because of it. We know it’s not true. Now, we’re assuming Matilda Clark
was involved, with Jerry Korsak, and it might be a mistake to make this
assumption.”</p>
<p>“I’ll play along. You got a better suspect?”</p>
<p>“Plenty. Let’s walk through this. I bought the cookies and Matilda
delivered them to the hospital. The killer had access to Eleanor’s room
and saw the cookies. I can’t believe that the killer had the nerve or
the time to remove the twenty-four cookies from the two cartons and
apply the thallium while in the room. It makes more sense for the killer
to notice the two cartons, go to Tan Lu’s and purchase identical ones,
for cash of course, then take them home or wherever and add the
thallium. Then, at the right time, probably after midnight when the
place is practically deserted, return to the room, and swap the
cartons.”</p>
<p>Raymond frowned as he listened and struck a match. “Seems as if I
remember a similar conversation a month ago.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but a month ago neither you nor I thought it was possible that
twelve jurors would vote to convict me. And we were wrong. Also, a month
ago we didn’t have the time or money to investigate other suspects. Now,
Raymond, things are radically different. We have to find the
killer.”</p>
<p>“I thought you were convinced it was Matilda and Jerry Korsak.”</p>
<p>“They are the prime suspects, but what if we’re wrong? We investigate
them, not sure how, but we’ll figure out something. At the same time, we
widen the net.”</p>
<p>“How wide?”</p>
<p>“You showed the jury the faces of thirty doctors, nurses, and
hospital employees who had access to Eleanor’s room. I thought it was a
brilliant move and proved its point.”</p>
<p>“I guess the jury wasn’t impressed.”</p>
<p>“Guess not. I’ve combed the records again, every page, every word,
and I’ve found three more names. Total of thirty-three. I think we can
safely eliminate the three hospital administrators and two secretaries.
Down to twenty-eight. A total of seven doctors either treated Eleanor or
stopped by to take a look, pinging Medicare as they came and went. Let’s
cut the seven. Down to twenty-one. She was a patient for two weeks and
at least eight nurses are on record as having had something to do with
her care. For the sake of time, let’s take the eight off the list. I’ve
found a dozen cases over the past fifty years where hospital nurses got
rid of their patients, for all sorts of crazy reasons, but let’s not go
there now. Down to thirteen. There were three janitors on duty at
various times, though they were not required to file reports. They’re
listed on the floor summaries. I don’t want to assume too much, but
let’s assume these guys were not sophisticated enough to procure some
black-market thallium. Now we’re down to ten. Technicians and orderlies.
These folks know a lot about medicine and drugs, and, same as in every
hospital, they had virtually complete access to Eleanor’s room. Are you
with me?”</p>
<p>Raymond blew a cloud of smoke with his eyes closed. “I think so. Keep
going.”</p>
<p>“So, let’s start with our top ten. Unfortunately, we know very little
about them because we can’t access all of their employment records and
history. We need to hack the hospital’s files.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Simon.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be involved. I’ll do it. Hell, what’s there to
lose? Convicted of murder on Friday and sued for wrongful death today. A
trifling hacking charge won’t faze me.”</p>
<p>“You’re on your own, pal. My firm will do whatever we can to help
investigate any possible suspect, but we’re not risking anything. Are
you asking for money?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m just thinking out loud, Raymond. The person who murdered
Eleanor was in her hospital room. And it was someone who was supposed to
be there, someone who was unnoticed, someone who didn’t care about
security cameras, of which there are very few, I might add.”</p>
<p>“What about motive? It was argued that you had motive. Perhaps
Matilda and Jerry had a motive. Why would a hospital employee want to
poison an old woman who’s banged up anyway?”</p>
<p>“There’s no answer to that question. Nurses who kill their patients.
Serial rapists who assault random women? Active gunmen killing
schoolchildren? There are no motives. Some people are just plain
sick.”</p>
<p>“Damned right about that, Simon. Look, we’ll do what we can. This
loss stings, you know? You bear the brunt, but it’s a kick in my balls
too. It’s a screwball verdict that should not have happened. I’m sorry,
Simon.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t say that again, Raymond. I owe you a lot, remember. You
did a marvelous job and we should’ve won.”</p>
<p>“Right. We should’ve won.”</p>
<hr />
<p>After being closed for renovation, Chub’s had reopened. If the
sprucing up included new paint, carpet, furnishings, and a good
power-wash to remove layers of nicotine stains, it was not immediately
evident. It all looked and smelled the same, which was not unpleasant.
The clientele was accustomed to a certain grunginess. Simon had always
suspected that Chub hurriedly closed his pub and left town to fake off
the FBI, or at least cool their aggressiveness. At the time, Chub had
given Simon too much credit for calling off the dogs.</p>
<p>Now, Simon was back and needed a favor. He stopped in late Tuesday
night and managed to avoid familiar faces. At the bar, Valerie gave him
a big smile and said, “Well, well, already escaped?”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha. I don’t report for a few months.”</p>
<p>“Rumor was they hauled your ass out in chains, took you straight to
death row.”</p>
<p>“And how reliable are rumors around here?”</p>
<p>“Extremely unreliable. Good to see you, Simon. I actually cried when
I heard the news.”</p>
<p>“So did I. Bourbon and ginger ale.”</p>
<p>“You got it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see Chub. Is he around?”</p>
<p>“Upstairs. I’ll get him.” She slid the drink across the bar and
disappeared. Simon kept his eyes glued to a Dodgers game and hoped no
one would bother him. He was glad it was baseball and not basketball;
otherwise, he would be tempted to place a bet.</p>
<p>He had never been invited into Chub’s office. One wall was nothing
but blackened one-way glass that allowed the boss to watch the floor
below. One wall was framed autographed jerseys of famous football
players. One wall was covered with enlarged photos of Chub preening next
to aging sports heroes, none of whom Simon recognized, and a few shady
types who were probably either politicians or gang bosses. One wall was
adorned with autographed baseballs, basketballs, footballs, pennants,
Super Bowl game programs, Kentucky Derby betting sheets, and so on.</p>
<p>They sat in comfortable chairs and sipped their drinks—bourbon and
ginger ale for Simon, bottled beer for the boss. Chub said, “So sorry,
man, I couldn’t believe it. Your lawyer said you’re gonna appeal and all
that.”</p>
<p>“That’s the plan, but it’s a mountain to climb. I need some help,
Chub.”</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s your office, stay as long as you want. I’m still
working on plans to renovate, probably lease it as office space, maybe
retail on street level. But I’m in no hurry.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, I really appreciate it. Right now I have no place else to
go.”</p>
<p>“A bummer.”</p>
<p>“But that’s not why I’m here.” As always with Chub, Simon was
wondering if someone else might be listening. He doubted it, though. And
what did he care at this point? “I need some help and it involves a good
hacker.”</p>
<p>Chub whistled as if stunned by the magnitude of the crime. As if
bookmaking and running an illegal gambling business for the past thirty
years were nothing compared to hacking. “Can’t help you, Simon. Don’t
know nothing about hacking. Computers, man, that’s a different
world.”</p>
<p>For at least the past ten years, Chub’s video poker machines had been
rewired by a homemade software program that allowed him to keep tallies
on his most active clients. This was not common knowledge, but the
gamblers knew it. Yet he always pretended to be overwhelmed by
technology.</p>
<p>Simon said, “I’m not asking you to get involved. I need Spade’s help.
Spade knows the right people.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and he came very close to getting busted two years ago. He’s
gun-shy. Can’t blame him.”</p>
<p>“Here’s what I’m asking, Chub. I want you to talk to Spade so I don’t
have to. Spade talks to a hacker. The hacker never knows my name, but he
gives me a blueprint on how to hack into the personnel records of the
hospital. Spade breaks no laws, neither do you, neither does the hacker.
If I get caught, what the hell? I’m a convicted murderer headed to
prison with nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>“You wanna hack a hospital?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I figure it’s an easy job.”</p>
<p>“Beats me, man. Not my world.”</p>
<p>“I know, but Spade lives there and he knows the right people.”</p>
<p>Chub took a swig from his bottle and stared at the wall of football
jerseys. “What if Spade wants a fee?”</p>
<p>“Then remind Spade that I got the FBI off his back last December.
Tell Spade that I was sleeping with the special agent, a woman, who was
in charge of the investigation. You might want to remember that
too.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I remember it well.” Another swig. “You were banging a
Fibbie?”</p>
<p>“An old friend from law school. And, please, this needs to be kept
quiet.”</p>
<p>“Who would I tell, other than Spade? All of my conversations are off
the record, Latch. You know that.”</p>
<p>Of course. Either off the record or recorded by law enforcement.</p>
<p>“I do. Lean on Spade, Chub. I need some help. I’m rather
desperate.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
