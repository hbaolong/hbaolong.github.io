<h4 id="chapter-55">Chapter 55</h4>
<p>He met Landy at an interstate hotel near Staunton, Virginia, two
hours south of Braxton. She was in the area working a case and had a few
hours she could waste without raising questions. While eager to help,
she had become increasingly worried about moonlighting on Simon’s case.
Her supervisor was pushing for arrests in some white-collar
investigations and she felt the pressure. In addition to her
professional problems, her divorce was now final and, while relieved
with the split, she was going through the usual letdown. Simon’s
conviction didn’t help. She had even mentioned changing careers, but
starting a new one as a forty-three-year-old rookie associate at a less
than prestigious law firm was not that appealing. With an endless supply
of young talent, few law firms were in the market for someone like
Landy.</p>
<p>Simon bought coffees in the lobby and took them to her room. It was
not yet 4 P.M., too early to think about drinks and dinner. Not that
they were in the mood. Both of their lives were upside down.</p>
<p>She said, “I hope you’re ignoring social media.”</p>
<p>“I am. I’m avoiding it, along with the television, newspapers, and
magazines. I assume the story has legs.”</p>
<p>“To put it mildly. It’s the rage. The tabloids are out of control.
The stories border on fiction. The posts are as idiotic as anything I’ve
ever seen. It’s outrageous.”</p>
<p>“Spare me, Landy. Things are bad enough. Paula informed me today that
the kids have been outed at school. The name Latch is not that
common.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. And I’m sorry I brought it up. Just thought you should
know.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I know you’re concerned.”</p>
<p>Without stepping out of bounds and violating agency rules, she had
gathered some information on Matilda Clark and her boyfriend. In
February, Jerry Korsak had signed a six-month lease for a one-bedroom
apartment in Fredericksburg. Matilda left Simon’s employment in March,
said she was going to Florida, but instead moved in with Jerry. She was
now working as a secretary in a car rental agency near Reagan National
Airport, about an hour from her apartment. The job appeared to be
full-time.</p>
<p>If Jerry had a job, it was not evident. He was not registered with
the Virginia Employment Commission, so there was no paycheck from which
to withhold taxes. He was fifty-one years old and his work history was
sketchy at best. Now that he was trying to get appointed as
administrator of Eleanor’s estate, he would be easier to monitor. Court
appearances would be required; petitions had to be filed. Judge Pointer
had not yet approved his request to be appointed, but at the moment he
was the only person asking for the position.</p>
<p>If Matilda and Jerry were legitimate suspects in Eleanor’s death,
there were several rather formidable problems with investigating them.
The most obvious was that Detective Roger Barr had all but closed his
file. He had arrested the right suspect, got him indicted, helped get
him convicted, and as far as Barr was concerned the case was over. The
convicted murderer could not ask the cops to keep digging into an effort
to get his conviction overturned. Another problem was the lack of
evidence. There was none. If Matilda and Jerry did the deed, where were
the witnesses? Not a single employee at the hospital had seen them there
after hours. Where was the poison? Any not consumed by the victim had
been flushed months ago. Where was the proof that they had procured it?
Finding a dealer in the black market would be impossible.</p>
<p>And where, exactly, was the black market? As Landy suspected, not
even the FBI was too concerned about the illegal trafficking of a poison
that had virtually no demand. The agency, along with dozens of others,
was far too busy trying to stop the flow of substances much more
popular.</p>
<p>She said, “It’s a dead end, Simon. The FBI has no jurisdiction and
the local boys have done their job. They got their man.”</p>
<p>Simon nodded in muted agreement. Possessing thallium was not a crime.
Producing it was. And it probably came from the third world.</p>
<p>He pulled some papers out of his briefcase and put them on the table.
“Next project. Here are the names of some hospital employees. Were you
in the courtroom when Raymond flashed a bunch of faces on the
screen?”</p>
<p>“Yes, last Thursday, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. There were at least thirty-three doctors, nurses, and
other employees with access to the room. I’ve eliminated all but these
ten. Can you dig for dirt and give me their backgrounds? Without setting
off alarms?”</p>
<p>She flipped through the pages. Each name had a color headshot next to
it and a short paragraph about the employee. Raymond had obtained the
information during discovery.</p>
<p>Landy looked at the list and said, “Two pharmacists, two technicians,
dietitian, two nurse’s assistants, three orderlies. You really think the
dietitian would poison a patient?”</p>
<p>“No. But neither would her lawyer.”</p>
<p>“And the pharmacists don’t make the rounds, do they?”</p>
<p>“I’m desperate here, Landy, okay? Indulge me.”</p>
<p>“All right, all right.”</p>
<p>“How much information do you have?”</p>
<p>“Tons. The agency’s database is enormous. Property ownership, utility
services, credit card activity, marital history, education, religion,
lawsuits, credit reports, rap sheets, employment history, and on and
on.”</p>
<p>“On every American?”</p>
<p>“Virtually every adult. But almost all of the data comes from other
sources, many of them public. The agency just sort of collects and
indexes everything.”</p>
<p>“And you have access to this data?”</p>
<p>She kicked it for a second, shrugged, and said, “Sure, within reason.
I’ll see what I can find.”</p>
<p>They finally got around to drinks and dinner. Simon did not want to
drive home and shuddered at the thought of another night in The Closet.
So, they slept together in her hotel bed, with thoughts of intimacy
somewhere far away.</p>
<hr />
<p>After one week as a convicted felon, Simon needed a change of
scenery. He was tired of living in the shadows and behind locked doors,
flinching every time some jerk banged on his office door. As far as he
could tell, no progress had been made in his efforts to exonerate
himself. For days he had been buried in piles of hospital records,
searching for more names of employees who worked on the hospital’s third
floor when Eleanor was there. When he wasn’t digging through that
monotonous material, he worked on the first draft of his appellate brief
to the Virginia Supreme Court. During his career, he had appealed two
cases, both dull zoning matters, to the court. In both cases he’d been
the lawyer, not the client. Now, sitting in the other seat was downright
bizarre. Instead of cranking out stilted legalese based on old cases, he
was writing to save his neck. He vowed to do a dozen drafts until every
word was perfect, persuasive, and gave the court no alternative but to
reverse the verdict. If beautiful prose and clever arguments could win
the day, he would somehow produce them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Landy was poking through the FBI’s database. Casey was
snooping around Braxton for any gossip on certain hospital employees.
And Spade was dragging his feet finding a suitable hacker.</p>
<p>On the first Saturday in June, Simon packed his camping gear and left
town. He stopped at a country store and bought canned meat, crackers,
beef jerky, and a pint of whiskey, things he didn’t mind carrying on his
back. He picked up the Blue Ridge Parkway and enjoyed a slow, lovely
drive south for ninety minutes. He entered the Shenandoah National Park
and stopped at a rest area with a dozen other vehicles. It took a few
minutes to adjust the backpack and get it as comfortable as possible,
then he was off on a five-mile hike that would take two hours. Hawksbill
Mountain rose four thousand feet above the valley and was the highest
peak in the park. He had hiked it for years and loved the views, and the
solitude.</p>
<p>On a clear day a hiker could see for fifty miles. Everyone stopped at
the peak for a rest, a photo, lunch, a nap, maybe even to sketch or
paint. Danger signs were conspicuous. According to a guidebook, at least
seven people had taken one step too many since the hike was opened in
1936. Three of the bodies were not found until months later, after the
snow had melted and the coyotes were finished. Two of the dead people
had left notes behind.</p>
<p>With less than ninety days to go, Simon was thinking of his future,
grim as it was. Assuming his efforts to clear his name went nowhere, the
direction they seemed to be headed, he would take command of his final
matters here at the peak of Hawksbill Mountain. He would leave notes in
his car, take a shot or two of bourbon, trot to the edge of the rock,
and launch himself into the air.</p>
<p>He sat on a bench, sipped water, breathed the clear air, absorbed the
panorama, and was at peace with his decision. The more he envisioned his
flight, the more he wanted it.</p>
