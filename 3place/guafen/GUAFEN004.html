<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>Simon and his wife, Paula, had not filed for divorce because they
could not afford one. Both desperately wanted out, but since they were
barely afloat financially with one household they could not imagine
trying to maintain two. Both wounded and scarred, they were tired of
fighting and had settled into a somewhat sustainable coexistence that
allowed them to pass the days in muted suffering as their three kids
grew up. Fortunately, the two older ones were teenagers who were
struggling through the usual strains of puberty and adolescence but not
yet causing serious problems. They seldom left their bedrooms and never
allowed themselves to be caught offline. A device was always in hand.
The youngest, Janie, was nine years old and still a sweet kid.</p>
<p>To avoid conflict and keep the tension away from the children, Simon
usually slept at the office. He had remodeled a small suite upstairs,
knocked out a couple of walls, and configured a small pad where he
survived with a tiny bathroom and narrow bed. When talking only to
himself he called it The Closet. It wasn’t nice but at least it was away
from Paula.</p>
<p>She was out this Tuesday night, the monthly book club gathering where
wine seemed to be more important than literature. It gave him the green
light to cook his favorite Italian sausage meatballs with pasta and hang
out with Janie in the kitchen. They talked about school and soccer and
life in general. She caught him off guard by asking, “Where do you go at
night?”</p>
<p>“Well, I often work late and just sleep at the office.”</p>
<p>“That’s weird. Why don’t you just come home? It’s not that far
away.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to wake up everybody. Mom’s a light sleeper and needs
her rest.”</p>
<p>“Buck thinks you and Mom are getting a divorce.”</p>
<p>Buck had always been a nosy brat and too mature for his years. Simon
managed a smile while realizing that it was the first time the word
“divorce” had been uttered by one of the children, or at least to his
knowledge.</p>
<p>He said, “No, we’re not getting a divorce, Janie. Mom and I are both
working too hard and don’t have a lot of time for each other, but that’s
not unusual these days. Everything will be okay. Tell Buck to stop
talking like that.”</p>
<p>Divorce had been on the table for at least three years but they had
been careful around the kids. Buck was sixteen and missed nothing. Danny
was fourteen and going through puberty with his head in the clouds.
Janie was a little girl who loved both parents. The thought of leaving
her was painful.</p>
<p>“It seems weird that you would sleep at the office when your bedroom
is here in the house with us.” She watched him as she said this, as if
she knew the truth.</p>
<p>“Everything is okay, Janie, I promise. The pasta is ready, so go get
your brothers.”</p>
<p>The only time Buck and Danny left their rooms was to eat. Both had
insatiable appetites, along with awful table manners. Paula had given up
on the rules. Danny ate with earbuds and an iPad with some dreadful acid
rock band screeching away, barely audible but loud enough to be
annoying. Buck had earbuds and a cell phone. Simon asked them to unplug
things and talk about their school days. They looked at him as if he
were a trespasser and flagrantly disobeyed. At that point, Simon could
slap the table, raise his voice, make a scene, start a fight he could
not win, and create even more bad blood. Paula would hear about it and
weigh in on behalf of her children. It was easier to ignore their
behavior, another act of cowardice that had become routine around the
Latch household.</p>
<p>So Simon chatted nonstop with Janie as the boys ate like pigs. The
sooner they finished, the sooner they could escape to the safety of
their rooms. They left their plates on the table, more rules violations,
but Simon just ignored them again. After dinner, when the kitchen was
spotless and the house was quiet, Simon kissed Janie on the forehead and
said he had to get back to work. She wanted to say something but didn’t.
He locked the doors, made sure the house was secure, and left a few
minutes before ten. Paula would be home soon, and the less he saw of her
the better.</p>
<hr />
<p>In earlier years he had parked his car, a leased Audi that needed to
be swapped for a later model, in front of his office on Main Street when
he worked early and late, a bit of free advertising intended to impress
others with his formidable work ethic. These days, though, he hid it in
an alley around back at night to quash rumors that he had moved out and
was living at the office. He suspected those rumors were already making
the rounds, because a couple of Paula’s friends had big mouths and
didn’t like Simon anyway. He was almost certain that the book club girls
spent more time sipping wine and bitching about their husbands than
discussing the hottest bestseller.</p>
<p>He parked in the alley and, instead of taking the rear stairs up to
his pad, he walked three blocks to the basement of an old bank building.
Chub’s Pub had been a part of his life for many years. He had been there
as Chub transformed it from a seedy low-end beer hall, known for its
illegal poker and bookmaking, to a mid-level sports bar with a dozen
widescreens and a less violent clientele. Gambling was still rampant
because Chub was the biggest bookie in the area, but it was kept quiet
and out of the way. The vice squad made a perfunctory visit once a week
but only because it was expected. Most of the cops hung out in Chub’s
when off duty. He even paid a few of them to work the door on
weekends.</p>
<p>It was a Tuesday night in early March and the place was not crowded.
Simon went to his spot at the end of the sweeping bar and settled in
before a screen that offered video poker. The bartender, Valerie, soon
appeared with a bourbon and ginger ale, along with a fake smile and the
same greeting, “What’s up, Lawyer Latch?”</p>
<p>“All’s well, Valerie, how are you?”</p>
<p>“Just living the dream.” Then she was gone. They didn’t have much to
discuss because Simon had handled two of her no-fault divorces, at cut
rates, and she wasn’t pleased with the outcome of the second one. With
time they had settled into a respectful standoff that required a forced
pleasantness but nothing else. Sort of like his marriage.</p>
<p>The drinks were free as long as he was playing video poker, which was
still illegal in the state, but Chub was smart enough not to get caught.
His machines were hot-wired to a file that kept a running balance of
each gambler’s wins and losses. No money changed hands in public. The
vice squad could see nothing illegal above the table. Simon and the
other players received monthly statements from the pub and settled up in
cash whenever Chub said so.</p>
<p>Cal Poly was playing UC Irvine and Simon had 00 on the game, his
standard bet. He watched it on a screen hanging above the racks of
bottles as he sipped his drink and occasionally looked at his poker
screen. He knew nothing about either school, so why would he place a
substantial wager on a game thousands of miles away? He once asked
himself such questions, but stopped doing so because the answer was
clear. It was all about the action. March Madness was right around the
corner, and, in preparation, Simon needed to watch as many games as
possible. The Big Show still got him excited, especially after last year
when he mopped up in the Sweet Sixteen and won ,000.</p>
<p>He did not have a gambling problem. He was certain of that because he
had two friends who did and betting had wrecked them financially. He had
watched them slide into a black hole playing risky games and wagering
more than they could afford to lose. Simon didn’t earn a lot of money;
therefore, he didn’t have much to lose. And after a decade of sports
betting he had convinced himself that his wins were slightly more than
his losses. He was too cautious to get into trouble. And too afraid of
Paula. She knew nothing of his secret little hobby because Simon, and
Chub, kept it all in cash.</p>
<p>Chub walked up behind the bar holding, as always, a bottle of beer.
“Who you got?” he asked as he reached over for a quick handshake.</p>
<p>“Irvine plus seven,” Simon said. Chub knew exactly who he “got.” They
had made the bet at ten that morning, on the phone. No texts or emails,
nothing to leave a trail. Chub had been busted once by the Feds for
bookmaking and came within a whisker of doing time, but a slick lawyer,
not Simon, worked a deal and kept him out of jail. He went straight for
twelve months, with ninety hours of community service, umpiring softball
games, then eased back into the business.</p>
<p>“I like Cal Poly,” he said and took a swig from his bottle.</p>
<p>He worked both sides of the Vegas line and didn’t care which side his
customers chose because he collected 10 percent on each bet. For Simon
to win 00 with his Irvine bet, he had paid 50. The extra, the “juice,”
went into Chub’s ever-deepening pockets.</p>
<p>Valerie called Chub from the other end of the bar. He offered his
standard “Good luck,” and waddled away. As always, he wore a fancy
tracksuit, this one bright red, with designer sneakers, as if he had
just come from a long run. He had not. Someone had stuck him with “Chub”
in the first grade and he had never been able to shake it, nor had he
been able to shed excess weight as he grew up. Sadly, he was, at
forty-five, still growing.</p>
<p>Simon usually stopped at two cocktails. He crunched the ice from the
second one as Irvine choked down the stretch and lost by five. But they
started the game with an extra seven, so Simon had a spring in his step
as he left the pub. He waved at Chub across the room, and Chub waved
back with a look that said, Nice win, I’ll get you next time.</p>
<p>The 00 Simon had just won was more than the legal fees he’d earned
that day.</p>
<p>But tomorrow held such promise.</p>
