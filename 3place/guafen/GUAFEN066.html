<h4 id="chapter-65">Chapter 65</h4>
<p>Judge Shyam made the wise decision to hear the defendant’s motion
several days before she was to sentence him on August 22. That day was
on the record, well known and publicized, and thus on the calendar for
the reporters, journalists, news crews, and other tabloid junkies.
Justice would be better served if those people were not watching. She
personally called the lawyers and arranged a closed hearing a week
earlier, on August 16, in Virginia Beach. She cautioned them to keep it
confidential and wanted no leaks. She even drove home the point by
threatening sanctions.</p>
<p>Before the hearing, she put three deputies at the main door to check
the guest list she had screened. Only a handful of people were allowed
inside. When they were seated, she entered the courtroom and greeted her
invitees. She began with “Mr. Lassiter, it’s your motion to vacate.
Please get things started. Feel free to keep your seat.”</p>
<p>There was no way Raymond could speak properly to a judge while
seated. He stood, fiddled with his silk tie, thanked her properly, and
said, “Your Honor, my client, Simon Latch, was found guilty in this
courtroom on May the twenty-seventh. I was shocked at the verdict, as
was Mr. Latch and many others. Since then, we have worked desperately to
solve the mystery of who poisoned Eleanor Barnett, and through the
rather heroic efforts of Mr. Latch himself, we now know. Our first
witness will testify under a pseudonym. His identity must be protected.
After he testifies, I will tender to the court an affidavit with his
real identification along with an explanation of need for secrecy. This
affidavit should not go into the record.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Mr. Lassiter. You have briefed me and the Commonwealth’s
attorney on this. You may call your first witness.”</p>
<p>“John Doe the Third.”</p>
<p>“How original,” Simon whispered to Casey.</p>
<p>Alan Teel took the witness stand with all the confidence of a
seasoned trial lawyer who’d had a brilliant career in courtrooms. After
being sworn, and after a slight prompt from Raymond, he was off and
running. He began his story eight years earlier when a secretary in his
unnamed firm got a tip from a nurse about an unusual death at a local
hospital, also unnamed. This happened in Pennsylvania. The tip led to
more information, then to an investigation by the law firm.</p>
<p>Cora Cook stood and said, “Your Honor, I hate to interrupt, but are
we ignoring all rules of procedure and evidence here? Are we allowing
the witness to use hearsay and irrelevant facts and anything else he
wants?”</p>
<p>Judge Shyam said, “Yes we are, Ms. Cook. I want the entire story and
I’m the sole decider at this point. There is no jury in the box. I’ll
filter the testimony and decide what’s relevant. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor shrugged in defeat and sat down.</p>
<p>Alan hardly missed a beat and continued with a narrative that he
obviously enjoyed sharing with the sparse crowd. He was a wonderful
raconteur, like most trial lawyers, and his audience was rapt.</p>
<p>Simon sipped coffee at the defense table and casually looked around
the courtroom. Landy and her boss, Shelia Wycoff, were in the front row.
On the far side of the courtroom, Detective Roger Barr sat alone,
listening and not taking notes. Then, the usual cast: court reporter,
two clerks, one bailiff, the judge.</p>
<p>After Teel had rambled for an hour, Raymond thought Judge Shyam might
be getting bored. So, he decided to liven things up with a video. Casey
tapped keys on his laptop and an image appeared on a screen in front of
the jury box.</p>
<p>Teel said, “This is a video of the search inside Oscar Kofie’s
apartment. The date is May third, 2009. There are the two metal
toolboxes, locked. Our technicians took them to a makeshift lab.” The
video continued with footage of the metal boxes being opened, the
bottles removed, the samples taken. An unseen voice narrated the action.
The video stopped after seventeen minutes.</p>
<p>Teel described some of the toxins and substances found in the boxes.
Then he returned to the lawsuits, the negotiations with the hospital,
and so on. He whitewashed his departure from his firm as simply a
misunderstanding and did not disparage his former partners in any way.
He never mentioned their names. When he finished, some two hours after
he started, his small audience was still hanging on his words.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam said, “Ms. Cook, any cross-examination?”</p>
<p>Cora appeared flustered, even shell-shocked, as if she was beginning
to understand that her conviction was in serious jeopardy and that
perhaps she had prosecuted the wrong man. She stood, fumbled with a
legal pad, and said, “So, Mr. Doe, your law firm did not prosecute Oscar
Kofie when it knew the truth, is that right?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. My ex–law firm. I quit by the time the settlement
was complete. But yes, they took the money and remained silent.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why you left the firm?”</p>
<p>“The main reason, yes. They allowed the killer to walk away without a
word to the police. They were hoping that maybe Kofie had learned his
lesson and would change his ways, but the problem was that Kofie never
knew he’d been caught. It was buried from everyone. His job got cut with
several others and he left town, none the wiser. It was a cowardly move
by the law firm. And they were praying that he would not kill again.
Well, they were wrong. The man is a sociopath, like most serial killers.
He works in health care, a place where homicidal poisonings are
prevalent. He enjoys watching his victims die, it gives him a perverted
sense of control. He eventually showed up in Braxton, Virginia, and here
we are.”</p>
<p>Cora’s questions were getting more answers than she cared to hear, so
she sat down. Raymond rose and said, “Your Honor, the defense calls FBI
special agent in charge Ms. Shelia Wycoff.”</p>
<p>Simon glanced at Landy in the front row and gave her a grin. She
crossed her legs and smiled in return. It was odd how much better a
pretty woman looked in an empty, stale, dusty old courtroom.</p>
<p>Wycoff testifed that the FBI received information regarding a
possible murder, or murders, ten days earlier, and opened an
investigation into one Oscar Kofie. He had worked in the hospital for
three years, and left under the cloud just described by John Doe the
Third. From there he went to a hospital in Baltimore for two years, then
to Braxton. At each hospital, there were mysterious deaths that could
have been caused by poisoning, and the FBI was investigating.</p>
<p>At the moment, the FBI was concentrating on the suspect, Oscar Kofie.
In fact, the day before, the FBI had obtained a warrant to raid his
apartment in Braxton. The raid was successful and yielded a number of
poisons, including thallium.</p>
<p>Simon enjoyed a long look over at Cora Cook, whose face was ashen in
disbelief. Her world would only get worse.</p>
<p>Luckily, the suspect had just received a package containing 25 grams
of thallium. It came by U.S. mail from a bogus address in Durban, South
Africa. There was a video of the search if the court wanted to view
it.</p>
<p>“Maybe later,” Shyam said, leaving little doubt she had seen enough
and had little curiosity left.</p>
<p>Then the bomb landed, and Simon could almost feel himself sprinting
from the courtroom, a free man.</p>
<p>Wycoff said, “Yesterday at approximately seven-twenty P.M., the
suspect was taken into custody as he left the hospital, and he is now
locked away in an undisclosed location. He will be charged with one
count of first-degree murder. His case will be presented to a federal
grand jury next Tuesday.”</p>
<p>It was the perfect stopping point. There was really nothing left to
say. Raymond read it nicely and said, “We tender the witness.” As if
Cora could possibly undo any of the damage with a brilliant
cross-examination. Instead, she shook her head in defeat.</p>
<p>“You may be excused, Ms. Wycoff. Your next witness,
Mr. Lassiter.”</p>
<p>“I believe the court has heard enough, Your Honor. The real killer
has been arrested by the FBI and will be indicted next week. The
Commonwealth made a grave mistake in prosecuting Simon Latch, an
innocent man. You should vacate that conviction and set him free.”</p>
<p>“Ms. Cook.”</p>
<p>She stood slowly, searching for words. “Perhaps not so fast, Judge. A
jury of twelve informed citizens heard the proof and returned a
unanimous verdict of guilty. We can’t just ignore that and sweep it
aside. The defendant got a fair trial in this courtroom and, at least in
my opinion, there was no reversible error. A clean, fair trial.”</p>
<p>Judge Shyam leaned forward and held some notes. “Ms. Cook, are you
familiar with the case of Commonwealth of Virginia versus Herman
Dungee?”</p>
<p>It came from left field and Cora was at a loss. “Maybe. Sounds
somewhat familiar.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Dungee spent thirty-one years in a prison for a rape and murder
committed by someone else. Three years ago he was cleared by DNA testing
and exonerated. His trial in 1985 was in this very courtroom. The jury
returned a unanimous verdict of guilty. The jury got it wrong. Are you
familiar with the case of Commonwealth versus Boyd Keenan?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“A case out of Norfolk, just down the road. Mr. Keenan spent eighteen
years in prison for a bank robbery that did not go as planned. Two bank
tellers were killed. When the crime occurred, Mr. Keenan was working in
South Carolina. Nevertheless, the jury convicted him. The jury got it
wrong.</p>
<p>“Are you familiar with the case of Commonwealth versus Harlan Miller,
another local screwup?”</p>
<p>“No.” Cora sat down.</p>
<p>“Mr. Miller served twenty-eight years on death row and came within
six hours of being executed. DNA cleared him. The jury, again in this
courtroom, found him guilty and recommended death.”</p>
<p>She laid down her notes and glared at the prosecutor. “I could go on.
In the past thirty years, at least forty-one people in this Commonwealth
have been convicted by well-meaning juries, only to be exonerated years
later. Across the country, over three thousand innocent people have been
cleared, and virtually all of them were convicted by unanimous
juries.”</p>
<p>If Cora had had a white flag, she would have waved it.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam said, “Would the defendant please rise?”</p>
<p>Simon was startled, but nonetheless managed to get to his feet.
Raymond stood beside him, suppressing a grin.</p>
<p>“Mr. Latch, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia I apologize for
this miscarriage of justice. I was surprised when the jury found you
guilty. Fortunately, our rules of criminal procedure allow me to correct
a wrong decision. I hereby grant your motion to vacate the verdict of
guilty and dismiss the charges against you, with prejudice. I will
instruct the Commonwealth’s attorney to close this file and disavow any
notion of a re-indictment. You are free to go.”</p>
<p>Simon’s knees went soft and he fell back into his chair. He covered
his eyes with his palms and began to cry.</p>
<hr />
<p>They drove south for an hour until they came to the Outer Banks.
Simon was lost in another world and said nothing. Landy drove with no
destination in mind, just happy to be out of Virginia. She glanced at
him occasionally to make sure he was okay. His eyes were closed but he
was not sleeping.</p>
<p>What a waste. Of time, money, emotions, lives. What needless
suffering. There was so much to say, but no energy to say it.</p>
<p>They stopped at a convenience store in Currituck because she needed
something to eat. Simon saw a picnic table under a tree and said, “I’m
going to walk over there and call my kids, and tell them that their
father has been declared innocent.”</p>
