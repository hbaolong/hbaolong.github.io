<h4 id="chapter-41">Chapter 41</h4>
<p>A month before the trial, Judge Pointer scheduled a closed hearing to
address a number of issues, the most important of which was venue.</p>
<p>Raymond had been adamant from day one that the trial must take place
far away from Braxton. He really didn’t care where, but preferably out
of the reach of the Washington and Richmond press. His client had been
pilloried and savaged from the day of his indictment and the damage was
irreversible. The only remaining question in the press was: Where was
the firing squad? Raymond had been a prominent criminal defense lawyer
for forty years and had never represented a defendant so thoroughly
condemned by his neighbors and townsfolk. His own secretary, a
compassionate soul, had quietly said to him several times, “Better get a
plea bargain.”</p>
<p>Simon had been reluctant at first. For a while he argued that by the
terms of the will he drafted for Eleanor, virtually everyone in Braxton
would benefit from her generosity. The trust he so cleverly created
spread her money to every church, civic club, food bank, scout troop,
garden club, and so on. And, more important, the will did not give Simon
Latch a dime of her money. He had to earn it! He would be paid 00 an
hour and his fees would be impressive, but an hour away in Washington
the going rate for the big firm guys was double that. Under oath and on
cross-examination he was confident he could justify his billings.</p>
<p>Raymond countered with the argument that the terms of the will might
never be heard by the jury. The will was not the issue. Murder was.
Oddly enough, motive was not always a factor and did not have to be
proven. Simon believed the will would be the Commonwealth’s first
exhibit, dramatically waved in front of the jury by Cora Cook as proof
that the defendant was dreaming of huge fees and profiting from the
death of Eleanor Barnett.</p>
<p>He and Raymond argued for several weeks, usually late at night over
cigars and bourbon. But Raymond would not budge and even threatened to
withdraw, a ploy he used occasionally. The defense filed a motion
seeking a change of venue.</p>
<p>During their discussions and arguments, they were joined by Casey
Noland, the newest member of Raymond’s firm. He was thirty years old and
had spent the past three years as a federal public defender. His
unabashed goal in life was to become a high-octane, radical, colorful
criminal defense lawyer, similar to Raymond Lassiter. While his law
school buddies dreamed of the big corporate firms and million-dollar
salaries, Casey wanted to be in the courtroom defending clients accused
of horrible crimes. He wanted to protect the rights of the worst
killers. He wanted to face skeptical juries. He wanted the
spotlight.</p>
<p>Casey was also single and worked strange hours. To impress Raymond
enough to get a job, he was developing a taste for bourbon and
cigars.</p>
<p>For the hearing, Judge Pointer put two bailiffs at the door of
Courtroom B and banned all spectators. She was tired of reporters
hanging around the courthouse and bothering her secretary. She had
called the police on several occasions to get rid of people digging for
dirt about the case.</p>
<p>Cora Cook opposed the motion because she was supposed to, but she,
too, knew a fair trial was impossible in Braxton. Around her office, the
sentiment always leaned toward guilt, but that was to be expected among
the staff of a prosecutor. No one was willing to give Simon Latch the
benefit of the doubt. Forget about the presumption of innocence. Out of
respect, her friends never commented on or gossiped about a case, but
she knew they thought Simon poisoned Eleanor. Her current boyfriend
thought a conviction was a slam dunk.</p>
<p>As always, the hearing was on the record, but Judge Pointer, as she
often did, treated it as informally as possible. The attorneys kept
their seats as they bantered back and forth, respectfully. Judge Pointer
interrupted when necessary. Simon sat between Raymond and Casey Noland,
and passed notes to both, once again thankful that he had not pursued a
career as a criminal lawyer. He was still trying to warm up to
Casey.</p>
<p>Virginia, like most states, allowed either side, defense or
prosecution, to request a change of venue. However, neither side could
suggest a preferred alternate. That was within the sole discretion of
the judge.</p>
<p>After an hour of discussion, and little argument, it was apparent
that Judge Pointer had made up her mind. She said, “I’ll grant the
motion to change venue and I’ll decide on the jurisdiction later. I’m
looking at various parts of the state and I tend to agree with the
defense that the trial should be moved far away.”</p>
<p>The attorneys scribbled notes. No one was surprised. Simon didn’t
relish the idea of spending a week or two in a cheap motel in a strange
town, but the longer he stayed in Braxton, the more he was convinced
that he needed to leave.</p>
<p>They then quibbled over discovery matters, with Her Honor lecturing
both sides on the rules that required full disclosure. Cora Cook had a
stellar reputation as an ethical prosecutor and withheld nothing.
Raymond’s reputation did not quite match hers but he had nothing to
hide.</p>
<p>At noon, Judge Pointer surprised them when she recessed until 2 P.M.
There was nothing left on the agenda, not in Commonwealth of Virginia v.
Simon F. Latch, and the lawyers left the courtroom scratching their
heads. What was the unfinished business?</p>
<p>Simon tried diligently to avoid being seen in public anywhere in
Braxton, especially downtown where the lawyers and courthouse gang had
their lunches. Casey drove them to an old country store where they had
sandwiches at a table in a corner. It was one of the few restaurants
Simon and Eleanor had not tried.</p>
<p>At 2 P.M. they reconvened and waited fifteen minutes for Judge
Pointer to assume the bench. She was religiously punctual and the slight
delay was unusual. When she took her place she dismissed the court
reporter and settled in for a casual chat with Raymond, Casey, Cora, and
Simon.</p>
<p>She began, “My husband is from the Tidewater area and I know it well.
From here, it’s four hours by car. It’s also another world, very
different from the Blue Ridge Mountains that we know and love. There are
two million people in the area, big towns like Hampton, Chesapeake,
Norfolk, Newport News, Portsmouth. Virginia Beach is the largest, with
twice the population of Richmond. The Tidewater Times has the largest
circulation and it hardly covered this story. I found only two reports,
while the state’s other newspapers were trying to out-scream each other.
As you probably know, the area has a strong military influence. The
largest naval base in the world is in Norfolk. The population is very
diverse and transient. I have no doubt that it will be easier to find
impartial jurors. So, I’ve notified the supreme court that I’m moving
the case to Virginia Beach. This will not affect the trial date of May
twenty-three.”</p>
<p>She took a sip of water and cleared her throat. “I have also informed
the supreme court that I am recusing myself from this case. My reasons
are as follows. There are two cases, one criminal, one probate. Under
our system, the circuit court has jurisdiction of both, and since I’m
the senior circuit judge in Braxton, they’re on my desk. The facts of
one case bleed into another. I could learn something from one case that
could affect my judgment in the other. It’s best if I turn loose of one.
The other reason is that I am facing some medical issues that will
require a lighter load for a few months.”</p>
<p>The lawyers frowned appropriately. Judge Pointer certainly looked as
healthy as ever. There were suddenly plenty of questions, but none were
asked.</p>
<p>“My prognosis is good but it may take some time.” Another sip of
water. “And there’s something else, something that may or may not be
relevant in the criminal case. I had a talk with Clement Gelly last week
and he informed me, sort of off the record, that he has learned
something important. He went to Atlanta and met with the investment
advisor for Eleanor Barnett. It looks as though she rather outrageously
inflated the value of her estate. Her late husband lost his fortune,
some fifteen million, in bad investments. Then they moved here and he
promptly died. Clement values her home at two hundred and fifty
thousand, about the same for her stocks and cash.”</p>
<p>Simon wanted to puke again, but he managed a poker face and nodded as
if he’d known this all along, no big deal. It had been a year since he
met her. A year since she had uttered, almost in a whisper, the words
that wrecked his life: Ten million in Coke stock, six million in
Wal-Mart stock, about four million in cash.</p>
<p>How could a pleasant old widow who appeared perfectly normal and
acted like the other eighty-five-year-olds be afflicted with some weird
strain of insanity? Nothing else in her life, or at least nothing Simon
had noticed, gave any indication of mental illness. The word “sucker”
rattled around his brain.</p>
<p>Judge Pointer kept talking, something about the will contest, but
Simon heard nothing.</p>
<hr />
<p>At least three nights a week, Simon found himself in Raymond’s law
library. He worked on briefs and motions, all designed to aid his own
defense. He read dozens of criminal cases involving poison. He studied
procedure and began to understand criminal law. He read every report and
researched every witness to be offered against him by the
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Raymond’s office was down the hall, his door always open, his cigar
smoke wafting through the entire building. At least once each night, he
would bark, “Simon,” as if his client was just another paralegal. Simon
always answered the call. It was the least he could do for an expensive
lawyer working for free.</p>
<p>On the night of the venue hearing, around 10 P.M., Simon sat down and
inhaled a load of smoke. Casey joined, in jogging shorts and running
shoes. Raymond walked to the liquor cabinet, poured three stiff
bourbons, and closed his door. They clinked glasses.</p>
<p>“Cora called this afternoon to offer a plea deal, sort of a
formality.”</p>
<p>“It was expected, right?”</p>
<p>“Right. Take a hit for fifteen years, parole after ten, probably, but
parole is tough in this state.”</p>
<p>“Fifteen years? I’ll jump off a bridge first.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a bad offer, given the circumstances.”</p>
<p>“What circumstances are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“The facts, Simon, the facts.”</p>
<p>“You still don’t believe me, do you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do. I’ve never doubted you. The problem, Simon, is that you
look guilty as hell, and I’m not sure how we change that.”</p>
<p>“I’ll testify. I’ll explain everything I did, and I’ll make the jury
believe me.”</p>
<p>“Famous last words. Whether you’ll testify or not is a decision we’ll
make at the last minute.”</p>
<p>“The answer is no. I’m not guilty and I’m not pleading guilty.”</p>
<p>They worked on their drinks, puffed their cigars. As usual, Casey
said little.</p>
<p>For some reason, Raymond began to chuckle. “What is it?” Simon
finally snapped.</p>
<p>“Did you really believe the old girl had twenty million dollars?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you think it’s funny.”</p>
<p>“Did you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“So, what was your first reaction when you were taking notes, the
initial consultation with a new client, right, and she says she’s
loaded, got twenty mil or so? What was your first thought?”</p>
<p>“Well, it was not a good one. Had something to do with greed.”</p>
<p>Raymond was laughing and Casey appeared to be amused. After a moment
or two, Simon wanted to join them. But he couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>He finished his bourbon and left with half a cigar. The only time he
walked the streets of Braxton was late at night, usually after leaving
Raymond’s. During the day he stayed in his office with the doors locked,
and ventured out only after dark.</p>
<p>The air was cool and the night was clear, and so he walked. His
thoughts were scrambled around the suggestion that he plead guilty,
which was ridiculous, and the destructive lies told by Eleanor, and the
prospect of being judged by people who lived far away and knew nothing
about the case.</p>
<p>At the moment, Simon felt abandoned by his friends. Not a single one
had been loyal. Many had sent quick emails after his arrest, but those
had all but stopped. Some of his friends were also friends of Paula’s
and, as in most divorces, they couldn’t take sides and found it easier
to just ignore the Latches.</p>
<p>The loss of support was crushing. The loss of his children was
painful. He called and texted them every day, but they were now four
hours away and struggling with their new lives.</p>
<p>And so he walked, for hours.</p>
