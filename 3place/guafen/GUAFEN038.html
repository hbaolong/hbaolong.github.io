<h4 id="chapter-37">Chapter 37</h4>
<p>As for his own mother, things were just as complicated. She had been
married many years to Arn, her second husband. Unhappy years, in Simon’s
opinion. Arn was a complicated person who had never tried to make her
life easier. Simon did not like him and the feelings were mutual. He was
a tough guy who’d once owned a successful roofing company and probably
had some cash in the bank. They had a nice home downstate in the Roanoke
area. The problem was that all of their assets were jointly owned. His
mother had no bank account of her own. When Simon explained that he
needed to borrow 0,000 to get out of jail, she became emotional and said
she would do whatever she could to help. Arn was not sympathetic. When
she put him on the phone, Simon asked for the money and promised to
repay as soon as he sold his office building. He might as well have
asked for twenty million. Arn handed the phone back to his wife and
could be heard mumbling in the background. She promised to discuss it
and call back the following day.</p>
<p>Knowing Arn, he was reading the newspaper accounts of Simon’s mess
and figured the boy was going to prison. Thus, the money would never be
repaid. The phone call home was a disaster and made a bad day even
worse, if that was possible.</p>
<p>During his fourth night in jail, Simon was able to read half a novel.
He tried to convince himself that he could survive incarceration now
that the shock had worn off. He felt safe. Loomis explained that there
was another wing where they kept the harder cases, but on their wing
things were civilized. The chief ran a tight ship and violence, or the
threat of it, was dealt with harshly. It was a clean jail without too
many rules, and the guards were real people who tried to help. Simon
also admitted to himself that, for the moment anyway, it was rather
pleasant being away from the glare and gossip. The flashbacks of all
those reporters and cameras were unsettling. He felt sorry for Paula and
the kids and hoped to see them soon. He actually slept a few hours
without interruption.</p>
<p>By nine the next morning, his mother had not called. He could not
imagine the war between her and Arn and he felt lousy for causing
trouble, but he had no choice. He was confident she would prevail and
convince Arn to lend a hand. Dammit, her only son was in jail and that
was an emergency.</p>
<p>Raymond dropped by midmorning and they discussed the plan to sell the
office building. They talked about various real estate agents in town,
few of whom inspired confidence. Such a sale, if indeed anyone wanted to
buy the building, would take days if not weeks. There would be an
appraisal, then a listing, then showings, and so on. Simon could easily
envision a drawn-out process.</p>
<p>For two hours each afternoon, the inmates were allowed into the Pit,
a break room with a television, pool table, checker boards, and plenty
of old magazines. Simon was making new friends right and left, most of
them duly impressed because they’d never had a lawyer in their midst. A
few wanted legal advice, but were disappointed when he claimed to know
nothing but bankruptcy law. He was playing checkers with Loomis late
Tuesday afternoon when a guard said he had a phone call. He was certain
it was his mother with good news and hurried to the front. It was not
his mother. A familiar voice said, “So, you’ve finally found your
rightful place, huh Latch?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Spade. It’s almost good to hear your voice.”</p>
<p>“Got yourself in a jam, huh?”</p>
<p>“You could say that.”</p>
<p>“I just did. Look, is anyone listening to this call?”</p>
<p>In Spade’s world someone was always listening or wearing a wire.
Simon thought the calls were secure but wasn’t sure. He said, “Of course
not. It’s unconstitutional to listen to inmates’ calls.”</p>
<p>“And you believe that? Listen, Chub called this morning. His joint is
closed for renovations, but he’s around and is somewhat concerned. He’s
seen the papers, called me, asked me to say hello.”</p>
<p>“I’m touched.”</p>
<p>“You should be. Look, Chub thinks it was you who got the Fibbies to
back off. Don’t know if that’s true, but you gave him the heads-up and
he left town. Now it looks like the investigation has lost steam, you
know? He’s wondering if there’s any way to help.”</p>
<p>“Damned right. He could loan me twenty thousand bucks for my
bail.”</p>
<p>“Twenty thousand. Wow.”</p>
<p>Twenty thousand was nothing to Chub. “Tell Chub I’ll pay it all back
when I sell my office building. Every penny.”</p>
<p>“He likes you, for some reason. Thinks you’re a stand-up guy.”</p>
<p>“Well, I am, in spite of my current situation. Better yet, tell Chub
I’ll sell him my building at a fair price, clear just enough to get me
out of here. He likes real estate.”</p>
<p>“That he does. I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
<p>“Thanks Spade.”</p>
<p>“I’ll call back tomorrow.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Tillie arrived later in the afternoon and they were allowed to meet
in the attorney conference room. She brought a printout of their current
bankruptcy cases and a schedule of his upcoming court appearances. Even
if he made bail and was free to move around, he could not imagine
walking into any courtroom for even a routine matter.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, she became emotional. “What’s going to happen to
you, Simon?” she asked. “I can’t believe this.”</p>
<p>He thought for a moment and said, “I honestly don’t know, Tillie.
Looks like I’ll be forced to sell everything to get out of here, and
that’s only the beginning. A trial will be months away. Who knows what
happens then. I can’t think of any reason to be optimistic in the short
term.”</p>
<p>“So, the practice gets shut down?”</p>
<p>“Probably. Even if I keep the building it will be impossible to do
business. My name is dirt around town. I don’t even want to ask what
you’re hearing.”</p>
<p>“Nothing good.”</p>
<p>“Everyone thinks I’m guilty, right?”</p>
<p>She nodded as she bit her lip. She wiped her eyes and said, “It’s
awful. I’m afraid to go anywhere near the office.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go there.”</p>
<p>“I want to leave town but where do I go?” She began sobbing and her
hands were shaking. “I’m sorry. I promised myself I wouldn’t do
this.”</p>
<p>In their twelve years together, he had seen her cry only twice, both
times in the past month. They had never allowed themselves to become
close, primarily because she had been hurt by other men.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard and said, “So, I guess I should start looking for
another job.”</p>
<p>“Not so fast. Let’s get through this week, see if I can spring
myself. We’ll work together and try to clean up the files. I need you
right now, Tillie.”</p>
<p>She managed a smile and said, “Okay.”</p>
<hr />
<p>No calls were allowed after 6 P.M., but Simon was desperate to get
out and the guards knew it. He needed to call his mother, and the jailer
eventually said yes. He waited until 8 P.M., hoping, of course, that she
would call him. When she did not, he dialed the number. Arn answered
with a gruff “Hello.”</p>
<p>Neither was in the mood for friendly chitchat. When his mother said
hello her voice was shaky. Then she barked at Arn, who was apparently
standing close by. “Can I have some privacy, please?” A few seconds
passed and a door slammed.</p>
<p>“He won’t do it,” she said. “I’ve tried everything, Simon, I really
have. We’ve fought and fought and right now I can’t stand him. I’m so
sorry, but the money is tied up in joint accounts. Pretty stupid, right,
but he’s always controlled the money. I would give you all of it if I
could. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>Simon listened with his eyes closed. His own mother and stepfather
wouldn’t bail him out of jail.</p>
<p>“I’m going to leave him, Simon, I swear. This time I’m going to leave
him. I’m fed up with him.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Mom. Settle down. I’ll be all right.” The idea of his
mother walking out and starting over at the age of seventy-three was
hard to grasp, but, at the moment, he really couldn’t blame her.</p>
<p>“No, I mean it, Simon. This is the last straw. I’ve put at least
eighty thousand dollars in CDs and it’s my money. He has no right to
control it.”</p>
<p>Eighty thousand sounded like a million. “Mom, take a deep breath. Go
for a long ride in your car. Let the moment pass.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, Simon. I’ll keep trying.”</p>
<p>“I love you, Mom. I’ll see you soon, and I’ll get this mess cleared
up, okay?”</p>
<p>“I love you too, and I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>Simon followed the guard back to his cell, stretched out on his bed,
and tried to read. Hours later he was still awake, wondering if he’d
caused another divorce.</p>
