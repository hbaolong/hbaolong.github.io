<h4 id="chapter-46">Chapter 46</h4>
<p>A friendly bailiff led Simon to a side exit and he was out of the
building before Raymond greeted the reporters on the front steps with
his usual banter and no-comments. They had learned by then that he was
not about to say anything remotely relevant to the case, but they
followed him anyway, in a pack down the sidewalk, taking photos and
videos that would look exactly the same as the ones they had taken on
Monday. He answered all their banal questions without saying anything.
Simon, meanwhile, wearing a green John Deere cap, jumped into the front
passenger seat of a black Chevy Impala, obviously government-issued, and
sped away with Landy behind the wheel. When the courthouse was out of
sight and no one chasing, he sat up and asked, “So how do you think it
went?”</p>
<p>“Pretty boring morning, actually. Raymond is smart to agree with the
doctors. His steady refrain of ‘Yep, she was poisoned but not by my guy’
resonates. The prosecutor is not that exciting.”</p>
<p>“Few of them are.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t turned on by her leopard-spotted slingbacks?”</p>
<p>“No. They look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Landy rolled her eyes. “The boys on the jury sure like them.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“There’s a seafood joint near the beach. Dark and quiet.”</p>
<p>“You do much work around here?”</p>
<p>“A couple of cases a year. Right now we’re talking to witnesses in a
bid-rigging case. Extremely monotonous. The life of an FBI agent is not
always gunfights and car chases.”</p>
<p>“Are you here tonight?”</p>
<p>“Is that an invitation?”</p>
<p>“Standing,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ll see if I can work you in. Delano doesn’t like your jury.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about Delano.”</p>
<p>“My partner on this job. He watched the first two hours this morning
and he knows his stuff. Spent four years in the federal defender’s
office and did a lot of trial work. Says your jury is not on your side.
The first impression was damaging—greedy lawyer sees the opportunity to
take advantage of a vulnerable client with no family.”</p>
<p>“Do you agree?”</p>
<p>“I saw only the first half this morning, and Delano and I can’t hang
around this afternoon. Work beckons. But we’re in and out tomorrow. Just
trying to help, Simon.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, but you didn’t answer my question. Do you think the jury is
against me?”</p>
<p>“They’re hard to read, as always. And all the proof’s not in. I’d say
it’s half and half.”</p>
<p>Simon took a deep breath and let it sink in. After a moment, he said,
“I didn’t take advantage of my client. I’ve earned nothing from all of
this. In fact, I’ve lost everything.”</p>
<p>“I know. I’m on your side. But your client is dead and you bought the
cookies.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The Commonwealth called Dr. Connor Wilkes as its next witness, and
she took the stand at 2 P.M. Tuesday. Cora Cook quickly established that
she had been the CEO of the hospital for three years, and she had met
with the defendant on several occasions before Ms. Barnett passed away.
Dr. Wilkes described the scene when Mr. Latch appeared in her office
with a new power of attorney and advance directive and asked her to
review them. He left and she read them. Then she sent copies to the
hospital’s attorney for his review. He thought the documents were fine
but stressed that she, Dr. Wilkes, along with the doctors, had to ensure
that the patient was not being pressured to sign anything. Dr. Wilkes
met with the doctors and nurses, several of whom were suspicious and did
not want to witness the signings. However, it was obvious that there
were no other family members present.</p>
<p>They walked as a group to Ms. Barnett’s room and met Mr. Latch there.
He passed out copies of the documents and answered all questions. Slowly
and thoughtfully, he explained each sentence to his client. Though
medicated, Ms. Barnett was alert and seemed to enjoy the attention. At
least twice, Mr. Latch offered to postpone the signings until some date
in the future. However, since she was eighty-five years old and in the
hospital, they felt like proceeding. The patient signed everything and
Mr. Latch left copies for the hospital.</p>
<p>Yes, it was certainly unusual to sign such documents at the hospital,
and Dr. Wilkes could think of only one similar occurrence. But, under
the circumstances, she felt as though nothing was wrong. The patient
needed the advance directive and power of attorney and knew what she was
doing.</p>
<p>As her condition deteriorated rapidly, the defendant visited the
hospital several times and met with the medical team. He was obviously
concerned about her care and spoke often to the doctors and nurses. He
refused to make the decision to remove Ms. Barnett from the ventilator.
He said, more than once, that it was a medical decision. She was
pronounced dead at 10:02 A.M., December 30.</p>
<p>About an hour later, Dr. Wilkes took a phone call from Detective
Barr.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Raymond drilled away at the heart of her
testimony: At no time did Simon Latch seem even remotely eager to get
involved in the final decisions regarding his client’s care. He didn’t
want to be there, but there was no one else.</p>
<p>With that point well made, Raymond caught her off guard by asking if
she ever reviewed the visitor sign-in logs at the front desk. No, she
did not. He handed her a thick printout and asked her to turn to
December 22 of last year.</p>
<p>She found the entries for that date and said, “Okay, sir, I’ve got
it.”</p>
<p>Gazing dramatically at the jurors, Raymond asked, “Now, do you see an
entry for a man named Jerry Korsak on that date?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He checked in at five thirty-five P.M. to visit Ms. Barnett and
stayed about twenty minutes.”</p>
<p>“Did you meet him?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t regularly meet visitors.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Do you know who he is?”</p>
<p>“I was informed later that he is the stepson of Ms. Barnett.”</p>
<p>“Indeed he is. Now please turn to December 26, around four P.M. Do
you seen an entry for a Mr. Wally Thackerman?”</p>
<p>She flipped and scanned and finally said, “Yes, looks like he checked
in at four-eleven.”</p>
<p>“To visit which patient?”</p>
<p>“Eleanor Barnett. Stayed about fifteen minutes and left.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Now, Dr. Wilkes, does the hospital keep a log of gifts,
flowers, candy, cards, that sort of stuff, that is delivered to each
patient’s room?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not aware of any hospital that can keep up with all that
stuff.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Raymond felt it was necessary to introduce the names of Jerry Korsak
and Wally Thackerman to the proceedings. It might be helpful later to
argue that Eleanor had other guests. Perhaps there could be other
suspects.</p>
<hr />
<p>The owner and director of Cupit andandandand Moke Funeral Home was
Douglas Gregg, a pleasant old gentleman who had been embalming Braxton’s
dead for decades. If he owned a suit that wasn’t black he’d never been
seen in it. He took the stand in his mortician’s finest and looked
petrified.</p>
<p>His testimony was that he had met the defendant for the first time on
December 29, the day before Ms. Barnett died, when Mr. Latch stopped by
to say hello and check on her burial policy. He showed Mr. Gregg her
advance directive, with instructions that she was to be cremated at once
and buried in the Eternal Springs Cemetery next to her late husband. The
following day he called to say she had passed.</p>
<p>Cora Cook handed the witness a copy of his office phone records. On
December 30, at 10:49 A.M., Mr. Gregg received a phone call from the
defendant and was told that Ms. Barnett had just died and he should send
the hearse to pick her up at the hospital as soon as she was released.
In his business, this was quite routine. After the body was brought to
Cupit andandandand Moke, the detective showed up and put a stop to the
plans for cremation.</p>
<p>About a month later, Ms. Barnett was finally put to rest, intact,
next to her late husband.</p>
<p>Only forty-seven minutes from the official time of death to the call
to the funeral home. The Commonwealth would repeat that timeline over
and over for the rest of the trial to prove that the defendant was in a
hurry to get the body cremated, thus destroying evidence of his
poisoning.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Raymond attempted to coax Mr. Gregg into saying
that forty-seven minutes was not unusual, but he wouldn’t budge. Several
hours usually passed before he was called in by either the hospital or
the family.</p>
<p>“He did seem to be in quite a hurry,” Mr. Gregg said.</p>
<hr />
<p>Juror number four on the front row was a hard-ass. Nigel Adcock,
forty-eight, district sales rep for a steel company, married, three
children, Catholic, probably the best dressed of the seven men. Simon
didn’t like him at first sight and wanted to cut him during jury
selection, but Raymond needed his cuts elsewhere. Adcock had tried to
get himself excused from jury duty by claiming he had too many deals in
the works, traveled a lot, and was a busy man whose boss would not
understand if he lost a week in court. Judge Shyam was not sympathetic
and refused to excuse him.</p>
<p>By Tuesday afternoon, Simon had stolen enough glances at his jury to
read them, or at least he thought so. And he knew Adcock had already
made up his mind and was not going to help. Simon had passed notes to
Raymond and Casey and they were watching too.</p>
<hr />
<p>The last witness of the day was a roll of the dice for the
prosecution. By calling Matilda Clark to the stand, Ms. Cook hoped to
prove that the defendant typed Eleanor’s will himself and tried his best
to hide it from his secretary. His behavior was highly suspicious. The
only reasonable explanation was that he wanted to bury the will until it
was time for probate.</p>
<p>Matilda looked great—tanned and toned with a smart new haircut and
designer frames Simon had never seen before. But, from the moment she
swore to tell the truth she appeared reluctant, as if testifying against
her old boss was the last thing she wanted.</p>
<p>Ms. Cook led her through the preliminaries—twelve years with Simon,
routine legal work with emphasis on bankruptcies, hundreds of wills, the
usual work in a small-town law office. Her voice cracked and her eyes
were moist, confirming that she hated being there helping the
prosecutors.</p>
<p>She remembered Eleanor Barnett very well and recalled their initial
phone conversations. A lovely lady with no family. Matilda pried some of
the basic client info from her, and later verified that she had a nice
pension and no debts. However, Ms. Barnett refused to discuss financial
matters with the secretary.</p>
<p>The deceit began immediately, as soon as the client left the office.
As a routine matter, Matilda would take the questionnaire, fill in the
blanks, crank out a three-page will, and wait a week or so for the
client to return and sign it with Mr. Latch. The fee had been 50 for
years. With Ms. Barnett, though, Simon kept his notes and said she might
be trouble. They would have to wait a few weeks. And so on.</p>
<p>On March 27, Matilda took the day off because it was her birthday.
Simon met with Ms. Barnett to sign the will and had it witnessed by two
people who worked in the office next door. Matilda found out about the
signing and asked Simon, point blank, if he had drafted a will for the
client.</p>
<p>He lied and said he had not. Matilda wiped her eyes again, obviously
upset by the betrayal of trust. No, in all her years with Simon she
could not remember a single will he had ever typed himself. The forms
were in her computer and she could spit one out in seconds, nice and
customized.</p>
<p>In the weeks that followed, she quizzed him about Ms. Barnett on
several occasions. Her file was still open and Matilda ran a tight ship
with the files. Simon was always evasive. More betrayal, more tears.</p>
<p>Simon was under a lot of pressure. His marriage was breaking up and
he was practically living at the office. He tried to keep this away from
Matilda, but secretaries have a way of knowing everything. As a lawyer,
he was barely staying afloat. He worked hard and put in the hours, but
it was a tough grind in a small town. Through the spring and summer, at
least seven other clients hired Simon to prepare their simple wills,
which were done in their routine manner. The fee was still 50.</p>
<p>When Eleanor was injured in the auto accident and hospitalized,
Matilda visited her at least three times, twice taking her homemade
brownies along with ginger cookies from Tan Lu’s. Simon explained that
he had taken her to lunch there and she loved the cookies. Matilda was
certain that neither the brownies nor the cookies were tampered with in
any way before she delivered them to the hospital room. Her visits were
friendly, but short. Eleanor had never shown much interest in
Matilda.</p>
<p>Cora handed the witness a document marked Exhibit #8 and asked if she
had seen it before. It was the will prepared by Simon, signed by Eleanor
Barnett, and witnessed by Tony and Mary Beth Larson on March 27 of the
previous year. Matilda said yes, she had been shown a copy a few weeks
earlier.</p>
<p>Cora asked, “In your twelve years as the defendant’s secretary, did
you ever prepare a will like this one?”</p>
<p>“Oh no. We never tried anything like this. It’s pretty complicated,
with all the trusts and such. Simon was not a tax and estate lawyer,
never pretended to be. We just did simple wills.”</p>
<p>“What was Mr. Latch’s hourly rate for legal work?”</p>
<p>She sort of shrugged and chuckled and said, “I’m not sure we had one.
He didn’t really work by the hour. He charged flat fees for
bankruptcies, real estate closings, small criminal matters in city
court, our typical cases. Occasionally he tried to charge three hundred
an hour, but the client usually balked at that and they negotiated
down.”</p>
<p>“This will provides for five hundred dollars an hour. Is that the
going rate in a town like Braxton?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know what the other firms charge. But Simon never got
paid that much.”</p>
<p>“Does it seem excessive to you?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say.”</p>
<p>“You handled the billing, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and the bookkeeping.”</p>
<p>“How often did the defendant charge five hundred dollars an hour and
get paid for it?”</p>
<p>She thought for a second, but the answer was obvious. “I don’t recall
a case like that.”</p>
