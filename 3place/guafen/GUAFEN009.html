<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>The execution of the will was carefully planned, or so Simon thought.
Since he was not a criminal, he didn’t think like one. What was the
famous line in the movie Body Heat? “When you commit a murder you make
ten mistakes. If you can think of seven, you’re a genius.” Or something
like that. Simon wasn’t planning a murder, or any other crime for that
matter, but he felt guilty anyway. He made lists and charts and
diagrams, and when everything seemed to click, he gave it the green
light.</p>
<p>It happened on March 27, a day that would find Matilda’s birthday
lunch far away from the office. As he often did, Simon asked his
neighbors for the favor. Tony and Mary Beth Larson ran a mom-and-pop
insurance shop next door to Simon’s office on Main Street and often
stepped over to witness will signings. The law required two people not
related to the “testatrix,” in this case Eleanor Barnett, to spend a few
minutes in easy conversation with her to satisfy any concerns about her
mental capacity. As attesting witnesses, they were not expected to read
the will—and in this case Simon was certainly determined that they would
not—but only to make sure that Ms. Barnett knew what she was doing and
was not being unduly influenced.</p>
<p>Simon had written every word of the will on his laptop and printed it
in his cramped bathroom, where he kept the new printer he’d paid 50 for
at a Wal-Mart. He didn’t normally shop at Wal-Mart but suddenly had a
keen interest in the company. Coke too. After several drafts, he was
convinced it looked almost identical to one that Matilda could have
typed. It was five pages long and packed with a lot of dense language
that he managed to explain to Eleanor in simple terms that were not
altogether forthcoming.</p>
<p>“Legal gobbledygook,” she said more than once, exasperated. The gist
and thrust was that upon her death her fortune would be placed in a
foundation, one not too dissimilar to the trust Wally across the street
had devised, and the money would be spread over a multitude of local
charities that would do all manner of good things. By keeping the money
local, Simon believed the will would be more palatable to a jury in the
likely event a big lawsuit erupted later. Food banks, homeless shelters,
boys’ clubs, girls’ clubs, Cub Scouts and Brownies, soccer leagues,
senior center, United Way, policemen’s fraternal order, a dozen of the
town’s largest churches of all denominations. The Eleanor Barnett
Foundation would make thousands of people smile for years to come, and
Simon Latch would be Santa Claus. As executor of the will, and sole
director of the trust, as well as the attorney for the estate, he would
be in complete control. His fees would be substantial.</p>
<p>Unlike Wally, the greedy little bastard, Simon would not be getting a
direct payment of cash upon Eleanor’s death. In the depths of the
densest and most convoluted paragraph of that will, Wally included an
outright gift of 85,000 to himself. A magnifying glass was needed to
find the language. The payment was for “accrued services,” a vague and
unique category of testamentary gifts that, not surprisingly, went
undefined. It was absurd to think that Eleanor owed that much money to
Wally.</p>
<p>But never mind. It wouldn’t matter. Wally wasn’t getting squat from
the will he drafted or the one dear Netty was signing now in the
presence of her two attesting witnesses.</p>
<p>As always, Simon choreographed the execution and asked Tony and Mary
Beth Larson if they understood that they were vouching for the mental
acuity of Ms. Eleanor Barnett. With enthusiasm, both said yes and
eagerly signed their names. There were smiles and even giggles all
around. Simon notarized both signatures, and in doing so sealed the fate
of the most valuable last will and testament he would ever prepare.</p>
<p>As his way of saying thanks to the Larsons, he usually took them to
lunch, and today he insisted that Eleanor join them. The invitation
seemed harmless, and though it was made in good faith there was an
ulterior motive. Simon, now with one distant eye on future litigation,
wanted the Larsons to spend even more time with his client. They had no
way of knowing that they were quite likely to be called as witnesses if
the whole mess blew up. The more time they spent with Eleanor, and
especially on the same morning she signed her will, the more credibility
their testimony would have.</p>
<p>Of course Simon did not mention their possible involvement in a will
contest. The Larsons had been witnessing wills for years and there had
never been a problem. Why bother them now? He did have a twinge of guilt
because he couldn’t warn them that one day they might get subpoenas, but
he forced those thoughts out of his mind for the moment.</p>
<p>Simon pondered these things over chicken salad in a deli two blocks
off Main, a hole-in-the-wall seldom frequented by lawyers and the
courthouse gang. He did not want Wally to see him out and about with
Eleanor Barnett, who was having a delightful time chatting with Tony and
Mary Beth. The Larsons were friendly people, they sold insurance, and
Eleanor warmed up to them considerably. She seemed to thrive on the
interaction and hardly touched her salad.</p>
<p>After an hour of listening, Simon broke up the party with a fib about
being needed in court.</p>
<p>The will was done. Properly signed and witnessed and notarized. He
had deliberately ignored the matter of the 50 fee, simply because he did
not want a check that Matilda might see. Eleanor could keep her money.
He had big plans to get it back later, in spades.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back at the office, Eleanor was saying goodbye when she thought of
something. “Can we talk for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Simon said. Whatever she wanted.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not sure how these things work, but what happens to Wally
at this point?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Do we tell him that I have a new will and the one he prepared is no
longer valid?”</p>
<p>That was the last thing Simon wanted. Wally might react badly and
become unpredictable. He might press Eleanor to change her mind yet
again. He would certainly come after Simon with all manner of threats,
though he probably wouldn’t follow through. Sticking his name in her
will to the tune of 85,000 cash outright would probably get his license
suspended for a year or two, if not revoked. Simon simply did not want
to deal with Wally at this point. Their disagreements would erupt later,
after her funeral.</p>
<p>He said, “The law does not require one lawyer to inform another
lawyer that a client has signed a new will that invalidates a prior one.
It’s simply not done.”</p>
<p>“It seems like we should tell him.”</p>
<p>“Not now. Maybe later. The reason it’s not done is because a client,
you, has the right to change your mind anytime you want. You may decide
next month to change something in your new will. You many even decide to
have another lawyer prepare a new one.” Simon couldn’t believe he was
uttering such foolishness.</p>
<p>Eleanor grinned and touched his arm. “I would never do that, Simon.
I’m in such good hands now. I didn’t feel this way with Wally
Thackerman. I still can’t believe he tried to take my money.”</p>
<p>“Let’s forget about that. It’s history now. I’ll keep the original
will here in my safe and you take a copy home and hide it somewhere. No
one should ever see your will, Netty, do you understand? Friends,
stepsons, housekeepers—no one sees your will.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“There’s one last thing we have not discussed, and that’s your final
arrangements. It’s a very delicate matter and I think we should do it
over lunch in the near future.”</p>
<p>“You mean, funeral, things like that?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so. You live alone, and there’s no family nearby, or
anywhere else. Who makes decisions about your health care? Who gets the
phone call when you’re sick? And, yes, the funeral and burial. Do you
have a burial policy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Harry and I bought one years ago. I’ll be put to rest next to
him in the Eternal Springs Cemetery. It’s a lovely spot.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure. I’m happy to help with these decisions, Netty, and some of
them could be legal in nature.”</p>
<p>“Gobbledygook.”</p>
<p>“I know. Let’s put this conversation off a couple of weeks and meet
for lunch.”</p>
<p>“I really enjoy getting out for lunch, Simon. And the Larsons are
such nice people.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s do lunch,” he said with a smile. The Larsons would not be
invited.</p>
