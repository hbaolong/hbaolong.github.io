<h4 id="chapter-26">Chapter 26</h4>
<p>Two days before Christmas, Matilda announced that she was leaving an
hour early to do some shopping. Since the legal profession was known for
loafing through half of December anyway, the office was quiet, and Simon
didn’t care when she left. He was re-drafting some leases for a real
estate client, work that was so dull he’d been putting it off for a
month. He was determined to finish it now and not punt it into 2016, a
year that promised to be just as tedious and unproductive as the
present, unless, of course, some lucrative estate work popped up.
Eleanor Barnett’s estate. He shook his head as he once again thought of
the hours he had wasted dreaming of her death.</p>
<p>When he looked up and saw his secretary he said, “I thought you were
gone.”</p>
<p>“I was leaving when a man walked in.”</p>
<p>“I’m not showing any appointments.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have one.”</p>
<p>“Then get rid of him.” Simon had learned years earlier that the
drop-ins were both bothersome and broke. They never brought their
checkbooks.</p>
<p>“You should make time for this guy.” She looked uneasy.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Name’s Jerry Korsak. Brother of Clyde. Stepson of you know who. I
don’t think he’s leaving.”</p>
<p>“Does he appear to be violent?” Simon asked as he quietly pulled open
a drawer and glanced at his .38.</p>
<p>“No, actually he’s rather polite. Wears a tie.”</p>
<p>Simon was not wearing one. He took a deep breath as reality set in.
“Okay. Can you break it up in thirty minutes?”</p>
<p>“I’m going shopping, remember?”</p>
<p>“Right. Call me in thirty minutes with some urgent matter.”</p>
<p>“Will do.”</p>
<p>Simon paused for a second and checked the drawer again. He shook his
head and said, “I’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>“I can’t shoot like Fran but I can make some noise.”</p>
<p>Both of them chuckled at the legend of Fran. Her threat to blast off
Clyde’s testicles was still good for a laugh around town. Simon said,
“Thanks, but I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Okay. And I’ll run by the hospital and see Eleanor. I made her some
brownies and have a few other things. Poor lady doesn’t see many
visitors.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for doing that, Tillie. She’s a dear old woman in a lot of
trouble.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The necktie was smartly knotted and went nicely with a plaid shirt
and wool blazer. Jerry was in his early fifties, lean, cleanshaven, and
well groomed. Simon had seen Clyde in the courtroom the day after he
slugged poor Wally, and the difference between the brothers was
startling.</p>
<p>Jerry said he was living in the “D.C. area” and working for a
government contractor, which narrowed things down to around five million
people. Simon didn’t probe because he didn’t want to seem interested,
and also, he quickly learned that every answer was vague. As they
chatted awkwardly and sipped coffee, Simon tried desperately to figure
out if Jerry knew Eleanor was in the hospital, and if so, then who told
him. He referred to her as “Mom.” Clyde had used “Momma.” They couldn’t
keep their lies straight. After a few minutes of light conversation,
Simon was convinced he could not believe a word Jerry said. He was
shifty-eyed, blinked a lot, and had trouble looking at Simon and holding
a gaze.</p>
<p>Finally, Simon asked, “What brings you to Braxton?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, uh, Mom called last night, told me about her accident,
asked me to come check on her.”</p>
<p>Simon absorbed this with a hard stare, as if it wasn’t true and he
wanted Jerry to know it was a lie. “Who told you I was Eleanor’s
lawyer?”</p>
<p>“A nurse at the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Really? Which one?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Didn’t take notes.”</p>
<p>“So, you’ve been to the hospital?”</p>
<p>“Just left. Mom seems to be doing fine, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“I suppose. She got banged up pretty bad.”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of spending Christmas with her.”</p>
<p>“In the hospital?”</p>
<p>“No, she says she’s going home tomorrow. I figure she’ll need me
around the house to help out, you know?”</p>
<p>“She’s not going anywhere. She can’t even walk yet.”</p>
<p>Jerry tried to laugh, his first effort at that, and said, “Well,
someone needs to tell her.”</p>
<p>“I talked to her doctor this morning,” Simon said, controlling
himself. “They’ll move her to a rehab unit in a day or so and start
working with her legs. She won’t be home anytime soon.” The idea of
Jerry in the house was unsettling, though Simon had removed as much
sensitive material as possible. It was all locked up in a drawer ten
feet from his desk.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Jerry said, eyes darting even quicker, then he blurted, “Does
she have a current will?”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to ask her. I can’t discuss client matters.”</p>
<p>“She’s my stepmother, the widow of my father. You can at least tell
me if she has a current will.”</p>
<p>“Why do you want to know?”</p>
<p>“Because my father promised me and Clyde a nice gift in the
estate.”</p>
<p>“He died ten years ago.”</p>
<p>“Right, and he forgot about the gift. We’ve always figured Mom would
make things right in her will.”</p>
<p>“How often do you see Eleanor?”</p>
<p>“Uh, well, not much. I’ve been living down in Florida and it’s a long
ways off, you know? But we talk all the time on the phone.”</p>
<p>Simon had inspected her phone records and checked every long-distance
call she’d made in the past year. Another lie. “That’s odd, because I’ve
known Eleanor since March and she’s never said anything about having a
conversation with you.”</p>
<p>“Are you calling me a liar?”</p>
<p>“No sir, I am not.”</p>
<p>Evidently, Jerry was not as hotheaded as his brother. He shrugged and
put down his coffee cup. “Fair enough. I just wanted to say hello and
let you know that I’m only an hour away, should you need me.”</p>
<p>Simon had a dozen responses but managed to keep it pleasant with a
simple “Thanks.” He could not imagine any turn of events that would
cause him to “need” the man. His sudden appearance was trouble.</p>
<p>After he left, Simon sat for a long time and tried to analyze the
visit. Nothing made sense. An hour later, driving to the hospital, Simon
decided not to mention the episode. If Eleanor brought it up he might
quiz her. If she said nothing about it, he would assume Jerry was
lying.</p>
<p>Loretta Goodwin met him in the hallway and said it was a bad time to
visit. Eleanor was asleep and had not been feeling well. Her breathing
was labored, her blood pressure was erratic, and she needed some
rest.</p>
<p>“Has she had any visitors today?” Simon asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen any.”</p>
<p>“Any lawyers snooping around?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact.” Loretta pulled a business card out of a pocket
and handed it over. “You know this guy?”</p>
<p>Simon looked at the card. It could’ve been worse. “Yeah, afraid
so.”</p>
<p>“He left about an hour ago.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’ll hang around in the cafeteria for a while. If she wakes
up, come fetch me.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I live for.”</p>
