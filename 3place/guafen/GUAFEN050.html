<h4 id="chapter-49">Chapter 49</h4>
<p>For a moment, he thought he was being followed by a blue Impala, but
it soon disappeared into traffic south of Norfolk. He zigzagged at
random to be safe, and finally relaxed on a county road near Suffolk.
For three hours he drove at a leisurely pace through the peanut farms
and tobacco fields of southern Virginia. It was a perfect spring day and
life would have been something quite pleasant, but for the horror of
tomorrow when his future would be handed to twelve ordinary people, a
jury of his peers.</p>
<p>He replayed every witness and every word of testimony he could
remember. At times the past three days were a blur. A moment later, he
could recall the attire of every witness and hear their voices. The
Commonwealth’s case was heavy on suspicion and motive, but severely
lacking on direct proof. Sure, he bought the damned cookies, and gave
them to Tillie who took them to Eleanor, who ate them and died. But the
crucial part about the poisoning had been botched by the prosecutor and
her team. They simply had no proof, primarily because there was no
proof. Simon had nothing to do with her death, and the fact that he was
even suspected of it still made him burn. The possibility of being
convicted of it was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Paula had moved the kids into a three-bedroom apartment in a new
complex on the eastern edge of Danville. A crowd of young singles
lounged around the pool, sipping beer and listening to music. On a
playground nearby, toddlers swung and seesawed as their mothers
chatted.</p>
<p>Not a bad place and very far from Braxton.</p>
<p>Buck answered the door and gave his dad a hug, one he meant, and he
was soon joined by Danny and Janie. Simon was determined not to get
emotional and tried to keep things light. Paula was at the stove cooking
pasta. For a few hours, they felt like a family again, eating slowly and
talking about life—school, the new town, new friends, and old ones from
Braxton. Janie asked if they were ever going back there, even referred
to it as “home.”</p>
<p>With one week left in the school term, homework was not a priority.
After the dinner table was cleared, they sat for a long time and talked
about the trial. Simon went through each witness and gave honest
assessments. He explained that his defense would begin first thing in
the morning and would not take long. He didn’t have to prove anything.
He was presumed to be innocent, and was in fact innocent. The burden was
on the prosecution, and his lawyers thought the Commonwealth had not
done an effective job.</p>
<p>The kids believed every word he said. Paula had repeatedly assured
them that their father would never commit such a crime.</p>
<p>Simon asked about the media coverage and said he had ignored most of
it. Buck said there was still plenty of it in the Washington and
Richmond press, but nothing much in Danville. After all, it was a small
town. Danny said the online stuff was terrible so stay away. Simon had
no plans to take a look.</p>
<p>The conversation drifted to the end of school and summer plans. The
year before, the family had gone camping and canoeing in the Smoky
Mountains, and, in spite of the friction between the mother and the
father, they had enjoyed themselves. Simon hoped they could do it again,
though sharing a tent with Paula was not going to happen.</p>
<p>His heart ached for his children. They had done nothing to deserve
the unfairness of being forced to flee their home and listen to the crap
about their father. And if he was convicted, they would be scarred for
life.</p>
<p>They talked and talked and couldn’t get enough of their time
together. They were starved for his attention. At 10:45, Paula finally
said, “Fifteen more minutes, then lights out.”</p>
<p>When they were finally in bed, he said, “We need to talk.”</p>
<p>“Okay. There’s no booze.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need it.”</p>
<p>“Do I?”</p>
<p>“You’re okay. How about coffee?”</p>
<p>“Decaf?”</p>
<p>“Even better.”</p>
<p>When they were sure the kids were asleep, Simon said, “I think Tillie
may have been involved in Eleanor’s death.”</p>
<p>Her mouth dropped open but she didn’t speak.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<hr />
<p>He slept on the sofa, the same one he and Paula had purchased on sale
in Braxton years earlier when the kids were small and life was much less
complicated. But sleep was only a goal. At 3 A.M., he finally got up and
quietly left the apartment. Driving away, he wondered when he would see
his kids again. It could be as soon as the weekend, assuming his trial
ended well. Or, it could be weeks, months, or years.</p>
<p>In the early days of his practice, he had a court-appointed criminal
client who pled guilty and went to prison. Simon liked the guy and they
kept in touch with mail and an occasional phone call. The client left
behind a wife and kids, and he would not allow them to visit him in
prison. He missed them greatly, but didn’t want them to see him in
prison clothes. Six years passed before he was paroled and went
home.</p>
<p>Six years? Simon was facing a lifetime behind bars.</p>
<p>Pushing the speed limit, he made it to his hotel by dawn, showered
and changed, and met his lawyers at 7 A.M. for breakfast. As soon as the
waitress walked away, Raymond said, “We are of the opinion that you
should not testify.”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“I’ve tried a thousand cases, Simon, and I can remember only a
handful in which the defendant helped himself by taking the stand. When
they do so, they become fair game for a brutal cross-examination, one
the prosecutor has been planning from day one. There will be traps,
trick questions, insinuations, arguments, retorts, irrelevant comments.
Of course, I’ll be there to object and raise hell, but in the end we’ll
probably wish you had stayed in your seat.”</p>
<p>Simon looked at Casey and asked, “And you?”</p>
<p>“You’re a lawyer, Simon, and half the jury will suspect you’re not
being truthful just because you’re a lawyer. You’re fighting for your
life and you’ll say anything to stay out of prison. But you’ve never
been cross-examined like this before. Some of your actions look
suspicious on the surface. By the time they’re hashed and rehashed on
cross-examination, they’ll look even more damning. I agree with Raymond
on this one. Let’s play it safe and keep attacking the Commonwealth’s
case.”</p>
<p>Simon looked at Raymond and asked, “If the jury voted right now,
what’s the score?”</p>
<p>Raymond took a sip of coffee and closed his eyes. “Eight to four to
acquit.”</p>
<p>Casey asked, “Who are the four to convict?”</p>
<p>With no hesitation, Raymond replied, “Two, four, seven, and
eleven.”</p>
<p>Casey said, “I’ll take those four and add eight and nine.”</p>
<p>For a second Simon felt like he was at a poker table with two
professionals. He flashed back to those halcyon times at Chub’s when he
played video poker for hours while drinking bourbon and ginger ale and
watching three games on the big screens.</p>
<p>But it was his life they were betting on.</p>
<p>Casey said, “I’ve never liked this jury. I’d say a six-six
split.”</p>
<p>“So no acquittal?” Simon asked.</p>
<p>“No acquittal, no conviction. A hung jury with a retrial later this
year and a better jury.”</p>
