<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>The rest of the day was shot. He couldn’t stomach the thought of
sitting for an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Pendergrast as they squabbled over
who was to blame for their financial problems. Simon’s speciality was
bankruptcies and they were often more trouble than divorces, which he
loathed. He called the Pendergrasts and canceled with one of the many
standard lawyer fibs used to duck and weave: he said he was suddenly
needed in federal court. But he really wasn’t needed anywhere. The most
pressing file on his desk involved the purchase and sale of an ice-cream
shop down the street, a 0,000 deal for which he might earn a fee of a
thousand bucks or so.</p>
<p>Suddenly, every file seemed so trivial. An elderly client with 6
million in stocks and more in cash had just left his office with a
current will that left her fortune to a rat-faced little lawyer across
the street. Simon could think of nothing else. As soon as Matilda said
goodbye promptly at five, he left ten minutes later and drove to a
watering hole in a motel bar out near the interstate. It was favored by
lawyers and judges who didn’t want to be seen drinking too much in town,
though there were some who drank openly and excessively. Luckily, none
of them were there, and Simon nursed a beer in a dark corner and tried
to sort out his thoughts.</p>
<p>First things first. He had to see the will to verify that his dear
Netty was telling the truth. It was still hard to believe that a lawyer,
any lawyer, would be brazen enough to insert himself in a will and have
unfettered access to an entire fortune. But the fact that he, the
Honorable Simon Latch, was thinking of doing something very similar to
that made him realize it was indeed possible. Upon Netty’s death, there
would certainly be a massive legal brawl with lawsuits flying, but the
only named trustee, at the moment one Wally Thackerman, would be in the
driver’s seat.</p>
<p>Of course the fortune wouldn’t be 0 million. Last time he checked,
the state and federal estate taxes were 40 percent, almost all of which
could be avoided with the marital trust. However, since Netty had no
husband, her estate would be on the chopping block and fair game for the
tax collectors. Eight million in taxes up in smoke. He actually grimaced
at the thought of paying so much to the government.</p>
<p>But 2 million was still more than he would earn working for thirty
years at the corner of Main and Maple. Then he remembered something he’d
read in a newspaper. Congress had been tinkering with the tax rates
before its December recess. He couldn’t recall the details and usually
did a half-ass job of staying informed, because his clients never
worried about gift and estate taxes.</p>
<p>He called a buddy from law school who practiced in a prestigious tax
firm in D.C., an hour away. After the usual chatter, he got around to
business. Dirk, his friend, laughed and said, “Come on, Simon. You
haven’t heard the big news?”</p>
<p>“I guess not.”</p>
<p>“Congress adjourned without repealing the amendment.”</p>
<p>Simon wasn’t sure what that meant so he kept quiet. Dirk liked to
talk anyway. “Those clowns dropped the ball big-time. The estate tax
deal fell through, no compromise, no tax. Zero, zilch, nada. For the
next twelve months there will be no federal estate taxes, and, since
most states follow the Feds, now is the perfect time to die. So tell
your geezer clients to get their shit in order and get ready to pull the
plug. Have a big Christmas this year, then it’s adios. Their kids and
grandkids will love them for it.”</p>
<p>“Right! I saw that. What a screw-up.”</p>
<p>“Par for the course these days.”</p>
<p>As the conversation drifted dangerously close to politics, Simon
switched gears and asked about another law school classmate who was
battling cancer. Since both were busy lawyers, they managed to wrap up
the conversation with promises to get together soon.</p>
<p>Back to 0 million! Simon got another beer and thought about the
conversation for a long time. Later, he would go online and do some
research, try to find out why Congress allowed the estate tax provisions
to slip away. As if one might be able to understand anything Congress
did.</p>
