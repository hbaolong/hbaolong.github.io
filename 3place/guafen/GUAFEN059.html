<h4 id="chapter-58">Chapter 58</h4>
<p>The airtight conviction of Simon Latch began to crack late one summer
night in Raymond’s office. Cigar smoke boiled from the open windows. His
staff was long gone. Soft bluegrass echoed through the speakers. It was
almost 10 P.M. and Raymond was reading the latest decisions from the
state supreme court, a boring habit he had not broken in almost fifty
years. He still loved the law and kept abreast of its changes.</p>
<p>He heard a knock at the front door. Normally, he would have ignored
it and waited for the person to go away, but for some reason he was
curious. Something told him to check it out. With a cigar in his mouth
and a drink in his hand, he waddled to the front and opened the door.
Standing there was a young lady he recognized from somewhere but
couldn’t immediately place.</p>
<p>“Good evening, ma’am,” he said, always the gentleman, especially
around women.</p>
<p>“I’m Loretta Goodwin, a nurse at the hospital. We met at the trial
last month.”</p>
<p>His plans to shoo away the visitor changed quickly. “Of course, of
course. Please come in.”</p>
<p>Hit with the aromas of smoke and bourbon, Loretta stood her ground.
“No, I’ll just be a minute. I’m trying to get in touch with Simon Latch,
but he won’t answer his phone and I have no idea where he is.”</p>
<p>Raymond knew immediately that something was up. “Well, I’m sure I can
find him. Is this about his trial?”</p>
<p>She glanced around, hesitated, and answered the question with her
eyes. “I need to talk to him.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’m happy to make contact, but he’ll want to know what’s up.
For a lot of reasons, he stays buried in his office these days. Talks to
very few people.”</p>
<p>She was nervous and uncertain. Raymond said, “Look, if it’s about his
case, we don’t have time to play games. If it’s not about his case, he
has no interest.”</p>
<p>“It’s about Ms. Barnett.”</p>
<p>“Come in and have a seat. I’ll call Simon.”</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Simon appeared. His shirt was damp with sweat
and he said he’d been out for a long walk. Always after dark.</p>
<p>Loretta was uncomfortable, but also resolved. She began by saying to
Simon, “When we met in the hospital last December, I already knew who
you were. Several years ago my uncle had a boundary dispute with a
neighbor. We live out in Beeno, a whole slew of Goodwins out there. Kind
of a clannish bunch. Anyway, my uncle hired you to represent him and you
got things settled in a proper way without charging a lot of money. He
had good things to say about you. It’s not easy hiring a lawyer when you
don’t know much about the law and don’t know how much it’ll cost. So,
anyway, I knew who you were when you came to take care of Ms. Barnett.
We, the staff, were suspicious when you got her to sign those papers
while she was in bad shape, but we were surprised when they accused you
of the poisoning. We figured the police knew what they were doing.”</p>
<p>“Who is ‘we’?” Simon asked.</p>
<p>“The staff, everyone around the patient. As you know, a lot of people
come and go at all hours.”</p>
<p>“I tried to sleep there one night. Impossible.”</p>
<p>“By the time the trial was over, we assumed the police and prosecutor
got things right. We talked about how sad it all was, nice lady, our
patient, being killed like that, and you, a nice lawyer, guilty of it.
But I always had a nagging doubt. Something told me it was somebody
else.”</p>
<p>A long pause. Finally, Raymond asked, “Was it somebody else?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But there’s a guy.”</p>
<hr />
<p>She talked about him for a long time without giving a name. He was an
X-ray technician who’d been at the hospital for a couple years. There
were three technicians in his group and they worked all wings of the
hospital, so he was not limited to the third floor where Eleanor was a
patient. He was thoroughly nondescript, the kind of person you would
never notice in any situation. Said little, not the least outgoing,
wouldn’t speak unless spoken to, sort of edgy though. Since the nurses
and their assistants routinely gossiped about everyone else who roamed
the halls, they had mentioned him a few times. He was single and got
pretty low marks on personality, even lower on good looks. But, she now
remembered three events that might be relevant.</p>
<p>One day in the lounge the staff was lunching on free pizza from a
local restaurant. About a dozen were there in a relaxed atmosphere. This
guy was on the fringe, eating, listening, saying nothing. It was the
week before the trial and the gossip centered around nothing else. The
mood was clearly against Simon Latch. Everyone was buying the same
greedy-lawyer narrative that had been plastered in the newspapers the
previous weeks. They had a mock verdict, with each person allowed to
chime in. Most voted for guilt. A couple were undecided. This guy
wouldn’t say, but it was clear, at least to Loretta, that he didn’t
think Simon was guilty. Throughout the discussion she noticed him
several times, always shaking his head and rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>She flashed back to Christmas, when Ms. Barnett was a patient and not
doing well. Loretta saw the guy leave her room late one afternoon, all
alone and carrying nothing. She checked the charts and saw that the
patient had not had an X-ray in three days. There was no reason
whatsoever for this guy to be in her room. It was unusual, though not
that suspicious.</p>
<p>Then, a week or so after the trial, some of the boys from the
hospital were in a bar late on a Friday night, drinking beer. Saturday
was an off day, and they decided to break bad. The guy was with them,
though he rarely hung out with anyone at the hospital. The bar closed,
they were still thirsty, and they ended up at the apartment of one of
the male ER nurses. The beer was losing its effect so they switched to
vodka shots. Somehow thallium became the topic and they talked about the
poisoning of Ms. Barnett. The guy knew a lot about various poisons,
their prevalence, legalities, histories, and effects on human bodies. He
claimed that thallium was not that difficult to find. At some hazy point
in the early hours of Saturday, a bag of pills hit the table and was
passed around. Bennies, Mollies, mud, cubes, who knew what else? There
was also cocaine, and someone said something like “Gee, hope it’s not
thallium we’re snorting.” As the hell-raisers began passing out, someone
heard the guy say, “I promise you that lawyer didn’t poison the old
gal,” or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Around noon Saturday, as they staggered forth in their stupors, they
realized the guy had already left. They could not imagine him leaving in
his condition, and they spent an hour or so chugging coffee and talking
about some of the things he had said.</p>
<p>Loretta was quick to acknowledge that most of her information was
secondhand at best, but she believed it anyway. Why, other than being
drunk, would the guy know so much? Her source was the ER nurse, a
trustworthy pal she had known for about five years. He was bothered by
some of the things the guy said, at least as much as he could
remember.</p>
<p>At work the following Monday, the guy kept away from his drinking
buddies and fell into his usual routine of saying little and acting
detached. The ER nurse described him as being “downright weird.”</p>
<p>His name was Oscar Kofie. Simon remembered meeting him in Eleanor’s
room not long after she was admitted. He and another technician were in
the process of returning her after more X-rays. She had referred to
them—Bill and Oscar—as her new friends. Oscar Kofie, an unusual name,
and one that Simon had run across digging through the hospital’s
records.</p>
<p>As lawyers, Simon and Raymond immediately recognized the potential
danger facing Loretta and her story. If it led to the investigation and,
hopefully, conviction of Kofie, the hospital would be liable for the
death of Eleanor Barnett.</p>
<p>At that moment, they didn’t care. Finding the killer was far more
important. And Loretta was a confident professional who gave every
indication of being able to fend for herself.</p>
<p>Simon managed to suppress his excitement and thanked Loretta for
coming forward. Raymond puffed away, poker-faced, and said they would
check out the new suspect. He said, “We’ll keep your name out of
it.”</p>
<p>Loretta said, “Thanks, this is all secondhand stuff. I don’t have any
real proof.”</p>
