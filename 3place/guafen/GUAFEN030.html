<h4 id="chapter-29">Chapter 29</h4>
<p>The year would not end on a quiet note. On Thursday, December 31,
Circuit Court Judge Mary Blankenship Pointer was having her morning
coffee with her husband at their little breakfast nook, both still in
pajamas. They were discussing a small New Year’s Eve dinner party they
had been invited to but would rather avoid, when their landline
rang.</p>
<p>The voice on the other end identified himself as Teddy Hammer,
attorney, of the firm of such and such in Washington, D.C. He had an
emergency matter that needed to be heard that morning, if at all
possible. Judge Pointer explained that she normally kept her office open
until noon on New Year’s Eve, though there was never much activity.
Mr. Hammer explained the nature of his emergency and said he was
emailing a copy of his petition for a temporary injunction at that very
moment. It was brief, only two pages, and he could be in her courtroom
by 10 A.M.</p>
<p>As she waited for the petition to arrive via internet, she checked
out Mr. Hammer, a lawyer she had never heard of, but then there were at
least a million of them in D.C. The big city was far away from Braxton
in so many ways. His firm had ten lawyers with an office on Connecticut
Avenue and another one in Arlington. It was a typical lawyer’s website,
with lots of bluster and self-congratulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammer represented Jerry and Clyde Korsak, two stepsons of
Ms. Eleanor Barnett, who had passed away the day before. His clients
were concerned about the “mysterious circumstances” surrounding her
death and wanted to get to the bottom of things. They requested that all
funeral and burial arrangements be stopped, or “held in abeyance” in
lawyer talk, until an autopsy could be performed. At the bottom of the
second page, Mr. Hammer stated that a copy of the petition was being
emailed simultaneously to the Honorable Simon F. Latch, attorney for
Eleanor Barnett.</p>
<p>Attorney Latch was at his desk studying Vegas lines for bowl games,
with his coffee, when the email came across. In one dreadful split
second he forgot about football and yelled an expletive. His office door
was open but the place was empty. Tillie, of course, had the entire day
off. There were no appointments. Simon was still in his boxers.</p>
<p>In the middle of his desk was a small bowl filled with low-fat Greek
yogurt, blueberries, and granola, and he had been preparing to dive in.
Now, he stared at the food with no desire whatsoever. His stomach
churned. He fought off a wave of nausea.</p>
<p>Was this the beginning of the end? Was his grand scheme and scam
finally unraveling? What could possibly be mysterious about Netty’s
death? He had watched her deteriorate as pneumonia set in. The coughing,
fevers, labored breathing—all the symptoms were there and he had
discussed her condition with the nurses and the doctors. An
eighty-five-year-old woman got banged up in a car wreck, couldn’t walk,
didn’t eat much, took plenty of meds, and slowly withered away. Where
was the mystery?</p>
<p>Now the vultures were swarming.</p>
<p>Once he had collected his thoughts, somewhat, and the room had
stopped spinning, he thought about calling Mr. Teddy Hammer and cursing
him. But the more diplomatic and beneficial approach might be to call
with a professional hello and dig for information. Either call was a bad
idea.</p>
<p>He searched Hammer’s firm, absorbed the first image of the man, and
loathed everything about him. Age about fifty, expensive dark suit,
chubby cheeks, puffy eyes, the cocky smirk of a street lawyer who knew
how to hurt you. His firm wasn’t much; the usual collection of hustlers
trying to portray an image of a blue-ribbon D.C. firm with plenty of
connections.</p>
<p>There were so many baffling scenarios, but the one that was most
disturbing was the fact that Jerry and Clyde had joined forces. When
Simon had quizzed Eleanor about them, she had always given the
impression that the stepsons lived in separate worlds and didn’t like
each other. Now the two outlaws had teamed up with an aggressive lawyer
to wreak havoc with Eleanor’s death.</p>
<hr />
<p>When Simon walked into the courtroom at exactly ten-thirty, Judge
Pointer was already on the bench and chatting with a clerk. A court
reporter filed her nails as she waited, obviously irritated at being
called in on a holiday. Simon introduced himself to Teddy Hammer, who
was alone. The only spectator in the room was Detective Roger Barr, who
sat in the front row and flipped through a magazine.</p>
<p>They were in Courtroom B, a much smaller room and one used for
non-jury trials. Judge Pointer preferred it over the larger, grander
courtroom because it was more intimate, plus the HVAC system was more
reliable. She had been given her judgeship fourteen years earlier by the
General Assembly, no messy campaigns to worry about, and she was well
regarded by the bar. After a round of all the obligatory pleasantries,
she called things to order and the court reporter began recording the
proceedings.</p>
<p>Judge Pointer said, “This is an expedited matter that would normally
require notice to all parties and some preparation, but, as I understand
things, Ms. Barnett died yesterday and there is some concern over what
happens next with her remains. Mr. Latch, you are her attorney? Please
keep your seat.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I am, Your Honor. I prepared her last will and testament
and I have a power of attorney over her affairs, but I have not been
appointed by the court to handle her estate. I’m sort of in limbo
here.”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s proceed.”</p>
<p>Simon jumped in with “And Your Honor, just to be on the safe side, I
suggest that this hearing be closed and the record secured, for now
anyway.”</p>
<p>Hammer said, “We have no problem with that.”</p>
<p>Judge Pointer said, “Well, the only spectator I can see right now is
Detective Barr with the Braxton Police. Mr. Barr, do you mind stepping
outside? We’ll call you if we need you.”</p>
<p>Barr was irritated and glared at Simon as he left the courtroom.</p>
<p>Judge Pointer said, “Mr. Hammer, it’s your petition. You have the
floor.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Honor. It’s really quite simple. I represent the two
stepsons of Ms. Eleanor Barnett. She passed yesterday. It appears as
though Mr. Latch is eager to have her remains cremated. Indeed, at this
moment she’s being held in the cooling unit in the basement of Cupit
andandandand Moke Funeral Home, just down the street. We are in no
position to make accusations or arouse suspicion, but my clients would
like to know the exact cause of death before she is buried. Thus, they
request a time-out and an autopsy.”</p>
<p>Simon had made the decision years earlier to avoid courtrooms if at
all possible. He loathed trial work and had never felt comfortable on
his feet. The courtrooms he frequented did not have jury boxes or
counsel tables. Most matters were not contested. It was obvious to him
that Teddy Hammer was a smooth brawler who had addressed many judges and
juries.</p>
<p>Simon replied, “Ms. Barnett was in the hospital for two weeks before
she died. She was treated by the best doctors in town. I was there every
day. I watched her slowly succumb to pneumonia. Her doctors tried
everything, including a ventilator for the final two days. They have no
doubt she died of pneumonia. There is no need for an autopsy.”</p>
<p>Judge Pointer asked, “And you prepared her last will and
testament?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct.”</p>
<p>“And in that will did she give instructions as to her final
arrangements?”</p>
<p>“No, ma’am. Those instructions were given in a subsequent document,
her advance directive.”</p>
<p>“And when did she sign that?”</p>
<p>“Twelve days ago.”</p>
<p>“In the hospital?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And it was prepared by you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The judge seemed suspicious. Indeed, an air of suspicion seemed to
settle in the courtroom. Hammer read it perfectly and said, “Your Honor,
my clients believe that their father and stepmother owned a burial
policy issued by Cupit andandandand Moke, and it provides for funeral
services and a burial next to their father at the Eternal Springs
Cemetery. It covers embalming, preparation, a nice casket, a memorial
service, and burial. The works. There’s nothing in that policy about
cremation.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Latch?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple, Your Honor,” Simon said. “Ms. Barnett changed her mind.
We discussed it many times. Cremation is gaining popularity across the
country and she liked the idea.”</p>
<p>“Do you have copies of her advance directive?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Simon quickly handed a copy to the judge and one to
Hammer. They took their time and read every word. When they finished,
Hammer said, “Your Honor, Ms. Barnett can be cremated next week, after
an autopsy, as per her wishes. There’s no problem. And there’s no rush.
It’s a holiday weekend. Everybody is off work on Monday. Let the family
get the autopsy and have that peace of mind, and if it proves the cause
of death was pneumonia, then she can be cremated. No problem.”</p>
<p>Judge Pointer pushed her file away and said, “Okay, here’s what we’ll
do. I’ll grant the injunction and order the funeral home to transport
the remains for an autopsy. In the meantime, I will order that all
estate proceedings be held in abeyance until after the autopsy and after
the burial. At that time, we will meet again and decide how to proceed
with probate. This record of this hearing is sealed, as is the file. All
participants are ordered to keep this matter confidential.
Understood?”</p>
<p>Both lawyers nodded and agreed. Judge Pointer adjourned the hearing
and disappeared. Simon and Teddy stood and shook hands. Simon asked, “So
who does the autopsy?”</p>
<p>“The chief medical examiner at the crime lab in Richmond.”</p>
<p>Crime? Simon took a deep breath and tried to speak.</p>
<p>Teddy flashed a conspiratorial look that spoke volumes, and said,
“Off the record, Mr. Latch, but there’s a good chance your client did
not die of natural causes.”</p>
