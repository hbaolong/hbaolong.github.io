<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>Eleanor refused to meet again at Starbucks, said she felt too old
there, as if, at the age of eighty-five, there was a place where she
might feel young. Simon didn’t argue and suggested they meet in his
office at 6 P.M. one afternoon, after an alleged long day in court and
clearly after 5 P.M. sharp when Matilda clocked out. Any mention of her
was now done so in a manner to convey suspicion. Netty admitted that she
really didn’t trust her. Atta girl.</p>
<p>So far, the last will and testament Simon was contemplating was a
complete mystery to his secretary, and it was imperative that it remain
so.</p>
<p>Netty sipped sparkling water and said, “I would really like to get
this wrapped up, Simon. It’s weighing on my mind.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Just a couple of things. I’ve made a list here of
about three dozen charities and nonprofits that I want you to consider
naming in your will. Your trustee will be given the authority to
distribute the money at his or her discretion.”</p>
<p>“Who’s my trustee?”</p>
<p>“Well, right now it’s Wally Thackerman.”</p>
<p>“That little crook. The more I think of him the more I despise
him.”</p>
<p>“I understand. You mentioned a niece and a nephew.”</p>
<p>Her chin dropped. Her eyes watered. She suddenly looked very sad. She
swallowed hard and said, “I mentioned them only because you asked about
relatives. You see, Simon, I have no family. My parents died young. My
sister Rose and I were never close. I really never liked her, to be
honest. She’s dead now and her two kids are my only relatives. It’s
kinda sad, you know, going through life with no family, no kin
folks.”</p>
<p>“I know some people who would say it’s a blessing,” he replied, but
the wisecrack went nowhere.</p>
<p>“Vince Barnett and I tried but we couldn’t have kids. We were so
young.”</p>
<p>“Where is your nephew?”</p>
<p>“Oh, gosh, who knows? Last I heard he left his wife and kids and ran
off with a college girl.”</p>
<p>Simon was suddenly tentative with his questions. “And you have no
relationship with him?”</p>
<p>“None. I saw him briefly at my sister’s funeral fifteen years ago. He
barely spoke to me. We just don’t know each other.”</p>
<p>“And your niece?”</p>
<p>A long pause as she managed a slight smile. “Maggie. She’s certainly
a better person than her brother, but I haven’t seen her in decades. You
see, Simon, their childhood was not good, and Maggie fled as soon as she
could. She had to get away from her parents and her brother. She became
a veterinarian and moved to Africa where she studies giraffes, last I
heard. We’ve had no contact since she was in college, couldn’t even get
home for her mother’s funeral. Pretty sad family, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a lot worse. What if you made a gift to the foundation she
works for?”</p>
<p>“To study giraffes?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure they do good work. Do you know its name?”</p>
<p>“The giraffe?”</p>
<p>Simon took a breath as he scribbled something and asked himself if
this was one of those moments when the marbles were loose. “No, the
nonprofit Maggie works for?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, of course not. I don’t even know what country she’s in. And
besides, she hasn’t bothered to contact me in at least thirty years. So
why should I send her a check? I’ll be dead, right? You know, when she
gets the check?”</p>
<p>“Right, that’s the purpose of this will.”</p>
<p>“So Maggie gets a check she’s not expecting from her dear Aunt
Eleanor, who she has obviously forgotten and never really cared about in
the first place, and what’s she supposed to do, write me a thank-you
note? I’ll be dead, Simon. Who’s going to read the thank-you note?”</p>
<p>Damned sure won’t be me, Simon thought to himself, but it was an
excellent question. “All right, all right, forget the family. Can you
think of any person, a friend, neighbor, anyone, who you might want to
leave some money to?”</p>
<p>“No. You’ve already asked me this. So did Wally. I said no.”</p>
<p>“Well, you left a chunk to Wally.”</p>
<p>“I did not.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Netty, in paragraph fourteen, section A, there is an outright
gift to Wally Thackerman for 85,000.”</p>
<p>Her jaw dropped and she shook her head. “That little creep.”</p>
<p>“He did not explain this to you?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I don’t think so. If he did I don’t remember it. Why
would he do that?”</p>
<p>Simon had been looking for an opening to bring up the gift to Wally.
As he suspected, she was unaware of it because she had not carefully
read the will. She had trusted Wally, just as she would trust Simon,
hopefully enough to allow him to simply explain the provisions of the
will, hitting the high points and skirting by the fine print.</p>
<p>“I can’t begin to understand what Wally was thinking,” Simon
said.</p>
<p>“You’re not doing that, are you, Simon?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. It’s highly unethical and probably grounds for
disbarment.”</p>
<p>“Gobbledygook. Please don’t take advantage of me.”</p>
<p>“There is no gift to me in your will. Period. As the attorney for
your estate and for the trust I will be entitled to fees for my
services, but all fees must be filed in public records and approved by
the court.”</p>
<p>She exhaled, obviously relieved. She reached over and touched his
hand. “Thank you, Simon.”</p>
<p>“Just doing my job, Netty. And part of my job is to protect your
estate and prevent trouble. For this reason I want you to leave some
money to your two stepsons.”</p>
<p>She jerked back her hand and frowned. “Why would I do that?”</p>
<p>“Because they might cause trouble during probate. If they find out
how much money you really have, then it’s almost guaranteed they’ll hire
a lawyer and contest the will.”</p>
<p>“On what grounds?”</p>
<p>“Oh, lawyers can be very creative when they smell money. They’ll come
up with all sorts of claims. But, here’s the clincher. I’ll include in
your will a provision that disallows any gift to a person who contests
the will. So, say you give each stepson a hundred thousand dollars
outright. Now, if one of them contests the will, he runs the risk of
losing the gift.”</p>
<p>“You are so clever, Simon.”</p>
<p>He smiled and almost demurred by saying that such a provision was
taught to every second-year law student, but passed on the notion of
modesty and in silence took full credit for being so clever. “And,
besides, wouldn’t Harry want his boys to get some of the money he
invested over the years?”</p>
<p>“I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Okay. A hundred thousand to Clyde, same to Jerry. Agreed?”</p>
<p>“Yes, if you say so.”</p>
<p>Simon was scribbling away as he doled out some of her money. Precious
little of it, though. “Now, I know I’ve asked you this already, but do
you want to make gifts to any friends or acquaintances?”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought about that, yes. Inez Mulberry is an old friend in
Atlanta. She’s in a care facility there and not doing well. She’s
ninety-one. Do you know anybody that old who’s doing well?” She chuckled
at her humor and Simon joined in with a hearty laugh. He wrote down the
name and asked, “How much to Inez Mulberry?”</p>
<p>“Uh, let’s say, uh, twenty-five thousand.”</p>
<p>“Okay. That’s not much. Does she need financial assistance?”</p>
<p>“Oh, gosh no. She’s loaded. Her husband worked for Coke with Harry
and bought tons of stock.”</p>
<p>Then why are you leaving her a gift? Simon let it pass. It would be
easier just to put Inez in the will and keep going. “Okay, I’ll include
her at twenty-five thousand. Anyone else?”</p>
<p>“No, can’t think of anyone.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so moving right along. I asked you before about the firm in
Atlanta that handles your portfolio, and you said it was Appletree
something or other, right?”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes in frustration and mumbled, “Here we go
again.”</p>
<p>Simon pretended to ignore her and continued, “As I said, it is
important for me to have a chat with the advisor there who is in charge
of your stocks and such.”</p>
<p>“Now you sound like Wally, and that’s not a good thing.”</p>
<p>Simon was being cautious and not about to push. She was proving that
she had no loyalty to her estate lawyers and he didn’t want to lose her.
His dear Netty could be his ticket to an easier, more rewarding life. He
could almost smell the huge fees coming his way. “I understand, but to
fully take advantage of the tax laws it may be necessary to protect some
of your assets. To protect them, I need to know everything about
them.”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and frowned hard as if hit by a migraine. After a
long, heavy pause she said, “You don’t trust me, do you Simon? You don’t
believe me when I say I have all this money.” Her voice was breaking and
she was about to cry.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following morning, Simon was sitting in a small courtroom
deleting voicemails as he waited to argue a motion in a lawsuit he was
destined to lose, when his phone hummed quietly. Unknown caller,
Atlanta. He quickly stepped into the hallway and said, “Latch.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mr. Latch. My name is Buddy Brown and I run a wealth
advisory firm in Atlanta. How are you, sir?” Pleasant voice, proper
manners, age between sixty-five and seventy-five.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Mr. Brown. I appreciate your call.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure. Eleanor Barnett has been a client of mine for many
years. I knew her husband Harry back in the day. He died too young and
left her some common stock in both Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart. I’m not at
liberty to say how much, but I can say that Ms. Eleanor is well taken
care of.”</p>
<p>“Okay, that much I gather. I’m preparing a last will and testament
that is not very thick. No heirs, no relatives, everything to
charity.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like Ms. Eleanor, though I haven’t seen her in many years.
She knows what she wants. Best of luck, Mr. Latch.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>Evidently Buddy was a man of few words and had better things to do.
Spade had found the right man, though the question of Eleanor’s real net
worth was still unanswered. On the one hand, the call was comforting in
that Buddy legitimized her claims of wealth. It was safe to assume that
any client with a long history at such an advisory firm would have
substantial assets. On the other hand, there was much that Buddy didn’t
mention and he seemed determined to get off the phone as quickly as
Simon got on it.</p>
<p>Simon returned to the courtroom just as his case was being called. He
walked to the front of the courtroom, nodded at the judge, and took a
seat at counsel table. His adversary, an old pal, began presenting his
motion and the judge quickly lost interest. Simon almost chuckled to
himself. There he was, quibbling over a useless motion in a worthless
lawsuit, while at the same time he had just hooked a client worth 0
million in liquid assets.</p>
<p>Though he had almost no liquid assets and plenty of debts, and his
marriage was dangerously on the rocks, and his law office had proven to
be a break-even venture over the past eighteen years, he was suddenly
smiling at the future. He would continue to build an alternate world and
one day soon get lost in it. He would wrangle his way out of his life
with Paula while remaining relevant to his children. He would phase out
Matilda, though that game plan had not yet materialized. He would wait
patiently for Eleanor Barnett to succumb to the years, and as soon as
she kicked the bucket he would swoop into probate court and take control
of her money.</p>
