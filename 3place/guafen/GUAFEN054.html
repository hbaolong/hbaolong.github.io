<h4 id="chapter-53">Chapter 53</h4>
<p>At the rap of the gavel, a bailiff opened the doors and the crowd
rushed out, led by Jerry Korsak. When he was out of the building he
speed-dialed Teddy Hammer, who was in his Washington office.</p>
<p>“They nailed him,” Jerry said gleefully. “Guilty, first degree.”</p>
<p>“You’re lying,” Hammer stuttered in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Swear. Took ’em all day.”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>“All the way. You got it. Now what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Let me sit down.” Hammer had watched most of the trial
and left the day before convinced the Commonwealth had not presented
enough proof to convict. In his opinion, the best they could hope for
was a hung jury, with a retrial to follow. He said, “Let’s talk
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Jerry stuck his phone in his pocket and looked around. The sidewalk
was busy with reporters either talking low or texting furiously. Cameras
were waiting in an area cordoned off by bailiffs, though the defendant
had not been seen all week.</p>
<p>The defendant sat for a long time at his table, oblivious to the
noise and bustle of the crowd in a hurry to leave. The judge and jury
were gone. The lawyers and clerks milled about, gathering papers and
packing briefcases. Slowly, the crowd thinned on both sides of the
bar.</p>
<p>Simon could not acknowledge the pats on the shoulder and the banal
offerings of “so sorry” and “we’ll get ’em on appeal.” He was too
stunned to respond and kept repeating to himself, “I didn’t kill anyone,
I swear. I know I didn’t.” Casey stayed by his side for quiet support as
Raymond went through the forced ritual of chatting with the opposing
lawyers. He also brushed off some pushy reporters.</p>
<p>My poor children, Simon thought, and tried mightily to keep them out
of his mind.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed. He sat slumped in his chair, motionless, staring
at something on the floor. Two Virginia Beach police officers loitered
near the bench, as if waiting to pounce.</p>
<p>Raymond finally sat down beside him, leaned in, and said, “Look,
Simon, time to go. They’re taking you to the city jail where you’ll
spend the night. I’ll be there. In the morning, some boys from Braxton
will fetch you here for the drive home.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t kill anyone.”</p>
<p>“I know you didn’t. I’ve believed you from the beginning and am even
more convinced now. But, juries sometimes do strange things and I guess
this is one of them. I can’t explain it.”</p>
<p>“What’s next? Prison?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“For the rest of my life?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I can’t do that, Raymond. I swear I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Not so fast. The next step is post-trial motions, then sentencing.
Nobody gets in a hurry. I’ll talk to the judge first thing Monday
morning and ask her to allow you to remain out on bond until sentencing.
That’s rarely permitted, but it does happen. We’ll get to the bottom of
it, Simon, I swear we will.”</p>
<p>“I can’t go to prison.”</p>
<p>Raymond looked at Casey as the two police officers walked over. One
removed a pair of handcuffs from his belt. Raymond said, “These two guys
will take you to the city jail.”</p>
<p>Simon looked at them in horror and said, “Handcuffs? And I gotta ride
in the back seat?”</p>
<p>“Afraid so,” Raymond said.</p>
<hr />
<p>Paula was tidying up her desk as if preparing for the weekend. The
day, like the ones before it, had not been productive. It was difficult
to concentrate on work with one eye on the news. While the jury was
deliberating she couldn’t leave her desk. A cold sandwich for lunch had
gone untouched. Thankfully, her colleagues had not made the connection,
but it was inevitable. They were gone for the day.</p>
<p>She almost shrieked at the headline on her laptop: “Virginia Lawyer
Guilty in Poison Case.” A live shot from Action News caught Simon as he
was led from a side door of the courthouse to one of two fully marked
Virginia Beach police cars. His wrists were cuffed at his waist and two
cops held his elbows. Though his legs weren’t chained, his captors still
walked as slowly as possible, making the most of their brief glow in the
cherished ritual of the “perp walk.” Simon seemed dazed and deaf as he
deflected the idiotic questions flung from the crowd of reporters.
Another cop opened a rear door as Simon ducked low and was shoved
inside. For some reason, the drivers of both cars needed to turn on all
emergency lights and sirens as they inched away from the courthouse, as
if the public should be warned that a convicted murderer was passing
through on his way to jail.</p>
<p>Within seconds, Paula’s phone buzzed. It was Danny, already in
tears.</p>
<hr />
<p>Raymond was at the jail, threatening to sue anyone who moved. He
explained, in rather coarse language that any cop could understand, that
his client was not a suspect and was not under the jurisdiction of the
Virginia Beach police. His stay was simply custodial, less than
twenty-four hours, and there was no need to process, fingerprint, or
photograph Mr. Latch. He was not going to wear faded orange coveralls
that had been worn by a hundred others. He was not going to be placed in
a cell with the general population. And, he should be allowed to keep
his cell phone.</p>
<p>The jailer felt obliged to agree to all terms except the phone.</p>
<p>Simon was put in a single cell reserved for those in protective
custody. Raymond said goodbye and left for Braxton. He was cranky,
almost belligerent, and pissed-off at the world because of a shellacking
in a high-profile case.</p>
<p>The bunk was actually more comfortable than the makeshift bed Simon
had been wrestling with for the past fifteen months. He stretched out on
it, closed his eyes, and tried to convince himself he was still
dreaming. His moods swung sharply from despair and hopelessness to anger
and retribution. He managed to block thoughts about his children.</p>
<p>At six, a friendly trustee appeared and slid through a tray of baked
ham and boiled vegetables. “Can I get you anything?” he asked.</p>
<p>Simon looked around the empty cell. “There’s nothing to read in
here.”</p>
<p>“Books or magazines?”</p>
<p>“Books.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can find.”</p>
<p>Because he was starving and had been hungry for most of the week, he
played with his vegetables and managed a few bites. When the trustee
returned to fetch the tray, he passed through a battered and dog-eared
paperback. Simon looked at it and could not suppress a smile.</p>
<p>The Lonely Silver Rain, by John D. MacDonald. During his second year
of law school, a good friend named Rick had loaned him a mystery titled
A Deadly Shade of Gold. It featured a private investigator named Travis
McGee, MacDonald’s most famous hero. A literary project evolved as the
two law students began reading, swapping, and collecting the Travis
McGee series. Their goal was to collect all twenty-one books, paperbacks
only, and to pay as little as possible for them. Both were on tight
budgets and any excess cash usually went for beer and pizza, but they
diligently searched bargain sites online, and used bookstores, garage
sales, anywhere they might find a Travis McGee adventure. And the
cheaper the better. During their last semester they bought the last one,
for .25 at a flea market, and read it. When they graduated, they sold
their little library to a second-year law student for 00, split the
money, and had a steak dinner to celebrate old Travis.</p>
<p>The book was like a drug. Simon kicked off his shoes, stretched out
again, and was soon lost in another world.</p>
<hr />
<p>As humbling as it was, jail was not the worst place for Simon to
spend the weekend. Being behind bars, both in Virginia Beach and later
Saturday back home in Braxton, kept him away from the news…and he was
the news. With no access to television or internet, he was shielded from
the barrage of sensational press. The main story—small-town lawyer
stumbles upon wealthy widow client then poisons her to take control of
her estate—was spun in a dozen different directions. The cremation
scheme was a favorite—rushing her to the funeral home just minutes after
pulling the plug to destroy the evidence of thallium poisoning. The tax
deadline was another favorite, killing her just before January 1 to save
40 percent in estate taxes. And Eleanor’s hoax was almost funny,
tricking two dim-witted local lawyers into believing she was worth
millions.</p>
<p>Experts of every stripe appeared on cable, speculating freely.
Doctors and toxicologists discussed the exceptional qualities of
thallium, as if it was the perfect poison for a good murder. Estate
lawyers with little knowledge of the case thought Latch was scheming to
earn millions in fees. All manner of legal experts dissected the trial,
and the general consensus was that Raymond screwed up by not putting his
client on the stand. They were shouted down by more legal experts who
believed you never allow the defendant to testify. Someone found an old
friend of Harry Korsak’s who delighted himself by telling the story of
the erupting volcano in the Caribbean and the investors getting soaked
with nothing but souvenir lava.</p>
<p>Jail was a refuge. Simon had access to his phone at certain times,
but had been warned, by Raymond, Casey, Paula, Landy, and the Braxton
city police officer who drove him home Saturday morning, not to watch
the news. Landy stopped by for Sunday visitation and brought him three
more Travis McGee novels, slick new paperbacks she bought at a Barnes
andandandand Noble. He was starting a new collection and planned to find
all twenty-one, again. Reading them not only helped him escape, it also
brought back fond memories of those law school days that now seemed so
carefree.</p>
<p>At nine-thirty Monday morning, the jailer unlocked his cell door and
said, “Follow me.” No handcuffs were in sight. Apparently, Raymond had
threatened to sue the city, the jail, and each employee personally if
Mr. Latch was not treated with enough respect. Raymond was waiting in
the small attorney visitation room and seemed as cranky and aggressive
as he had been on Friday and Saturday. Casey was with him and had
brought a thermos of good coffee from home. He poured Simon a cup.</p>
<p>Raymond said, “I spoke to Judge Shyam about an hour ago. Not
surprisingly, she doesn’t like this verdict.”</p>
<p>“Welcome to the club,” Simon said.</p>
<p>“She was remarkably candid and said she was stunned by it.”</p>
<p>“So, what can she do?”</p>
<p>“Well, she can do a lot but she’s not willing to grant our motion to
set the verdict aside for lack of sufficient proof. That takes a lot of
balls and is almost never done. It would be very heavy-handed for her or
any other judge. In fact, I’m not sure if I can recall a case in
Virginia where the trial judge negated a guilty verdict and set the
defendant free.”</p>
<p>He looked at Casey, as if his associate was supposed to know
everything. Casey said, “About ten years ago, in Rockingham County, a
judge pulled a guilty verdict in a bank robbery. He was not
reappointed.”</p>
<p>“So, we can forget that. But she will allow you to go free until
you’re sentenced.”</p>
<p>“When will that happen?”</p>
<p>“We’ll find out in a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“So, I’m walking out today?”</p>
<p>“This morning.”</p>
<p>At ten, they huddled over Casey’s cell phone for the conference call.
Judge Shyam’s clerk was recording it. Cora Cook was on the call from her
office down the street.</p>
<p>Judge Shyam was all business. “Post-trial motions are due in thirty
days, with thirty more days to respond to each other. I will rule on
them at the end of sixty days. I have been informed by the defense that
it will appeal the verdict to the supreme court. Of course, I don’t
control that schedule.”</p>
<p>Cora Cook said, “Your Honor, the Commonwealth has no post-trial
motions.”</p>
<p>“As expected. Mr. Lassiter?”</p>
<p>“Several, Judge. We’ll file them on time.”</p>
<p>“I am scheduling the sentencing for Monday, August
twenty-second.”</p>
<p>Raymond said, “Your Honor, we request that the defendant be allowed
to remain free on the same bond pending his sentencing.”</p>
<p>“Ms. Cook?”</p>
<p>“The Commonwealth opposes this request, Your Honor.”</p>
<p>“On what grounds?”</p>
<p>“Well, on the grounds that the defendant has been convicted of
first-degree murder and is facing the probability of being sentenced to
prison for life; on the grounds that the defendant has much more
incentive to flee now than before; on the grounds that defendants are
almost never allowed to remain free after being convicted. I could go
on.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Latch has been free on bond since January and has never failed
to appear in court when expected. We have his passport, don’t we?”</p>
<p>Her law clerk said, “Yes, it’s in the vault.”</p>
<p>“Thought so. I see no reason to order him to prison at this time.
I’ll do so in ninety days when he’s sentenced. The Commonwealth’s
objection is overruled.”</p>
<p>Casey whispered to Simon, “Pack your bags.”</p>
<p>“What bags?”</p>
<hr />
<p>It was a beautiful spring day, everything in bloom, the town and
countryside picturesque. Simon wanted a long walk to absorb the beauty
and drink in the sweet smell of freedom. Walking around, though, was not
a good idea. He could only imagine the excitement he would create if
spotted by someone he knew, or a reporter, or, heaven forbid, one of the
town’s legendary gossips. Braxton was now toxic for Simon, a lost home,
a place where his story would rage for years, a place where few, if any,
friends would defend him, a grid of streets he could no longer walk. He
wasn’t sure where he would spend the next years, locked up or otherwise,
but it would not be in Braxton. His family had fled to another town to
start life over. His law office was deserted and his building sold. The
state bar association would soon pull his license, as required by
statute.</p>
<p>Ducking through alleys and side streets, he made it home without
being seen. He entered his office through a rear door and walked around,
inspecting things, as if he’d been gone for years instead of eleven
days. His handshake deal with Chub allowed him to squat until July 1.
After that, well, who knew? With the curtains closed he sat in the
reception area and stared at Tillie’s forlorn and dusty desk. The phone
had been disconnected. The outdated word processor even looked like a
fossil.</p>
<p>He still could not bring himself to believe that Matilda Clark had
the guts to venture into the black market, buy a quantity of a poison
she had no experience with, and lace the ginger cookies, all with the
intention of killing another human being. Staring at the spot where she
had dutifully worked on his behalf for twelve years, he told himself it
couldn’t be true.</p>
<p>How Jerry Korsak figured into the plot was another unknown. It
certainly added an avalanche of intrigue.</p>
<p>One certainty remained constant: Simon Latch didn’t do it; therefore,
someone else did.</p>
<p>He had eighty-four days.</p>
