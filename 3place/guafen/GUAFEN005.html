<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>The Starbucks anchored one corner of a strip mall at the edge of a
suburb fifteen minutes from his office. It was busy when he arrived half
an hour early to scope out the place and look for privacy. He sipped
dark roast at four bucks a cup and moved quickly when a corner table
opened up. He toyed with his laptop, same as all the other customers,
and watched the endless line of cars creep through the drive-thru. Then
he saw the old Lincoln turn a corner. Netty couldn’t find a spot and
parked far away, straddling a yellow line. She drove like a
ninety-year-old who’d been a lousy driver seventy years earlier. As she
entered, he stood and waved and helped her to her seat. She seemed ill
at ease and glanced around.</p>
<p>“Figures,” she said. “I’m the only senior here.”</p>
<p>“Would you like coffee or tea?”</p>
<p>“Just some water, please.”</p>
<p>Simon left and brought back a bottle of water. She ignored it and
asked, “Can we really talk here? I mean, it’s not very private.”</p>
<p>The nearest person was ten feet away, hunched over a laptop with
wires running to ears that were invisible under a red hoodie. “Oh, it’s
very private. No one can hear a word we say because their ears are
plugged.”</p>
<p>“These young people.”</p>
<p>“I know. Addicted to their phones and laptops. What’s the world
coming to?”</p>
<p>“I guess.” She unscrewed the cap and drank some water.</p>
<p>Finally, Simon said, “We were going to talk about your will, the one
prepared by Wally Thackerman.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m just not comfortable with it.”</p>
<p>“Did you bring it?”</p>
<p>She reached into a large handbag and retrieved an envelope. As she
handed it to him she glanced around again.</p>
<p>“Please relax, Netty. These kids are totally self-absorbed and have
no interest in anything we’re talking about.”</p>
<p>Simon wanted to rip open the envelope and scour the will for the
scandalous language, but he managed to take his time and keep smiling at
her. It was only four pages long, with the first paragraphs filled with
the usual lawyerly crap that he himself charged people for. Then, the
juicy part. It established the “Eleanor Korsak Barnett Memorial Trust”
and placed all of the liquid assets in it. Her home was to be sold,
along with everything else, and the cash added to the trust. All the
fancy legal footwork would be done by, of course, the Honorable Wally
Thackerman, who was not only the executor of her estate and the sole
trustee of her trust, but also the lawyer self-appointed to handle
everything. His fees were set at 50 an hour and Simon could almost
visualize the thick, padded bills Wally would present to the court for
interim payments.</p>
<p>Simon frowned, a grimace prompted by genuine disbelief, but also
offered for dramatic effect because Netty was staring at him, waiting.
“Is it that bad?” she whispered loudly, then covered her mouth and
glanced around again. No one looked at her. No one knew she existed.</p>
<p>“Let me finish,” Simon said calmly with a fake smile, as if what he
was reading was definitely outrageous but he alone could fix
everything.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the hefty fees to come, the worst part was the power
granted unto the trustee. In half a page of thick legalese, Wally gave
himself the right to do virtually everything and anything with the
trust. He could donate to “appropriate” charities and nonprofits, make
loans to virtually anyone, hire consultants, appraisers, accountants,
and tax experts to help “protect” the trust. After ten years of such
shenanigans, he could, in the event any of the money was left, disburse
it at his discretion and close the trust.</p>
<p>Simon worked on his poker face. He had to be careful. He could not
outright condemn the will, because he was suddenly emboldened to prepare
one very much like it. But, he had to criticize it enough to win her
support and convince her that he could steer her assets in a safer
direction.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mention your two stepsons,” he observed, still frowning,
reading glasses balanced on the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>“Nothing for them. I thought I told you that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did, but that could cause problems. If they receive nothing
they might get upset and hire some more lawyers to attack the will.”</p>
<p>“But they’re not entitled to anything, right? That Wally character
told me that a person, any person, can exclude a child from her or his
will, at least in this state. It that right? And since they’re not
really my children, they have no claim to my estate?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. You can exclude everyone but a spouse.”</p>
<p>“Well, my spouse is dead and he left me everything. Not a dime for
those two outlaw sons of his. Nothing. Cut, cut, cut.”</p>
<p>She did the cutting with a glow in her eyes, the first sign of
possible meanness. Simon was pleased that she was already referring to
her soon-to-be ex-lawyer as “that Wally character.” He read on, frowning
intelligently. When he finished, he took a sip of coffee and said, “I
don’t like this will.”</p>
<p>“I told you so.”</p>
<p>“It gives too much power to the attorney for your trust.”</p>
<p>“How can we fix it?”</p>
<p>“It’ll take a few hours but I’ll hop right on it. The obvious
challenge here, Netty, is to find a place for the money. I want you to
make a list of possible charities you’d like to help.”</p>
<p>“Such as?”</p>
<p>“Do you have a church?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sort of. Harry was a Lutheran and we tried to go once a
year.”</p>
<p>“That’s an idea. Think big. There are about a million worthy
nonprofits you could help.”</p>
<p>“Such as?”</p>
<p>“Such as the Girl Scouts, heart association, orphanages, animal
shelters, local library, small colleges, refugees, childhood hunger,
environmental groups. You mentioned your work with the spider
monkeys.”</p>
<p>“That was a rip-off.”</p>
<p>“Do you like animals?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Whatever. Sit down tonight and make a list of all the possible
groups, causes, and charities that you might want to help.”</p>
<p>“What’s your favorite charity?”</p>
<p>Simon’s lack of generosity was caused by a lack of extra cash rather
than an absence of a kind spirit. How could he possibly write checks to
help others when he and Paula were underwater and staring at three kids
soon going to college? They had not donated more than a hundred bucks in
the past five years.</p>
<p>He lied quickly with “The Sierra Club.”</p>
<p>“Never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not really for you. Have you thought about leaving some money
for your friends?”</p>
<p>“My friends, the ones still living, know nothing about the money. If
I told them about it they’d drive me crazy and my life would get very
complicated. That’s what money does, Simon, it really causes
problems.”</p>
<p>So does the lack of it, he thought to himself but managed to maintain
an intelligent frown. He scribbled something on his legal pad and said,
“Okay, moving right along. Who prepares your tax returns each year?”</p>
<p>“Why do you want to know?” she snapped, quite defensively.</p>
<p>“Well, because when you die, and I hate to say it that way but that’s
the real reason we’re here, right, so when you die and your new will
comes into play, the attorney for your estate will have to work with
your tax advisor to prepare your returns.”</p>
<p>“Who will be the attorney for my estate?”</p>
<p>“That’s entirely up to you, but it’s pretty common for the attorney
who prepares the will to also act as the probate attorney.”</p>
<p>“Kinda like that Wally character.”</p>
<p>“Yes, kinda like that.”</p>
<p>“What was the question?”</p>
<p>“Your tax advisor?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, he’s this little CPA guy in Atlanta, been doing my taxes
forever. One of Harry’s old sidekicks. I talk to him once a year, so you
don’t need to bother him.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but it might be important for me to make contact.”</p>
<p>“That’s what Wally said. Why do you lawyers always want to pry into
everything?” Another flash of anger, maybe even bordering on meanness.
She was suddenly defensive and Simon quickly changed strategies and
backed off. He had done a good job so far of gaining her trust and he
didn’t want to irritate her.</p>
<p>Pry? Oh yes. What Simon really wanted was some proof that his dear
Netty actually owned all that Coke and Wal-Mart stock, in addition to
several million dollars just sitting in the bank. He believed her, he
wanted so desperately to believe her, but he was also cautious enough to
proceed slowly. Clients lied to him all the time. Lawyers, often after a
few drinks, loved to tell stories of the outrageous lies their clients
had fed them.</p>
<p>He assumed the stocks were held in a brokerage account and a nice,
neat, concise summary was sent to Netty each month, same as the bank
statements. He gritted his teeth and asked, “Do you have a financial
advisor?”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes as if frustrated and glanced around again,
looking for eavesdroppers. She frowned and a ridge of thick wrinkles
folded across her forehead. “You mean, like, a stockbroker?”</p>
<p>“Yes, who handles the stocks?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s complicated. You see, Harry did business for years with a
firm in Atlanta, then it merged or something with a bigger firm, and so
on. After Harry died, one firm got sold to another. I really can’t keep
up with it all. Now it’s all handled by this guy in Atlanta.”</p>
<p>“I see. Is there a person I can talk to about your assets?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Why do you want to talk to someone about my
assets?”</p>
<p>“Because the IRS may require proof of assets.” Simon had no idea what
he was talking about but using the IRS might frighten her somewhat.</p>
<p>She mumbled, “Same thing Wally said.” This startled Simon, but he
decided to let it go and push later. He pretended to ignore her last
comment, cast an important glance at his wristwatch, and said, “Okay,
I’ll get started on this. Let’s meet again in a couple of days and go
over a rough draft.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s the first version of your new will. In the meantime, please
give some thought to some charities and foundations you might want to
include.”</p>
<p>“I thought we talked about that. Thought I told you I don’t have any
favorite charities.”</p>
<p>No charities, no friends, no family, no distant relatives. No one to
receive the fortune when his dear Netty kicked the bucket. Perhaps
that’s why Wally Thackerman did not name a single nonprofit. His scheme
basically left everything in a new foundation that would become his own
little piggy bank after her funeral, with at least a dozen ways to
siphon money into his own pocket. Simon hated to admit it, but Wally’s
will was impressive, in spite of its blatant effort at being nothing but
a naked grab for money.</p>
<p>Simon vowed to do much better. He capped his pen, pulled his notes
together, and said, “There is one thing, Netty. I can’t prepare a simple
will if I can’t verify your assets. For most of my clients, this is not
really necessary because they are not wealthy. But you’re in a different
category.”</p>
<p>She was gazing through the window with a blank stare, as if it were
time for another nap. She shook her head and said softly, “All this
legal stuff.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know. But it’s important to get this right. Your current
will is a mess and will only enable Wally Thackerman to end up with most
of the money. That’s not right.”</p>
<p>She looked as if she might cry. “I feel so stupid.”</p>
<p>“Please. I can fix this. But I need to know the name of your
stockbroker in Atlanta.”</p>
<p>“Buddy Brown.”</p>
<p>He repeated the name to himself. For some reason “Buddy” didn’t quite
fit that profession. He uncapped his pen and scribbled on a paper
napkin. “And the name of his firm?”</p>
<p>“Appletree something or other.” She was drifting away, her eyelids
fluttering, her speech fading as if fatigued. And for the first time
Simon wondered about her mental capacity. She was an elderly woman who
suddenly looked even older. Hang on, old girl.</p>
<p>Among the many issues roaring through his brain was the challenge of
getting her new will witnessed by two people who could attest to her
“sound and disposing mind and memory.” Normally, it was a routine matter
with Matilda and a secretary next door going through the motions. Oh
well. It was something else he would deal with later.</p>
<p>He walked her to her car and watched her drive away, on the wrong
side of the road and with one foot on the brake.</p>
