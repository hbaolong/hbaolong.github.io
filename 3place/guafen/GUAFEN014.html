<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>On a perfect spring day in late May, Simon left the office at four
with Matilda fighting the phone. He was grateful it was still ringing,
though the racket meant there would be a stack of calls to return in the
morning. For some unknown reason, his practice had hit a busy cycle
after the latest lull and there were some nice fees. But the divorce was
looming and would consume money he didn’t have. And the situation at
Chub’s had not improved. Betting on NBA games was proving, once again,
to be more challenging than the NCAA.</p>
<p>He really wanted to play nine holes of golf for the first time in
weeks, but soccer was calling. Janie’s under-10 team, Slash, had yet
another game at the sports complex, a place he was learning to loathe.
But he didn’t dare skip it because Janie would know before the start
that he wasn’t there. Paula, of course, would arrive early, in part to
prove she was the more diligent parent. Who cared? They weren’t fighting
over custody.</p>
<p>He found the field, one of a dozen, all with games raging, and saw
Paula standing alone at one end.</p>
<p>“What’s the score?” he asked as he stood beside her without looking
at her.</p>
<p>“One–zip. Janie scored a goal in the first thirty seconds. You missed
it.”</p>
<p>“Chalk up another one for you.”</p>
<p>“She’s really quite good. Her coach wants her to play on a summer
travel team.”</p>
<p>Simon’s shoulders sagged a bit as he exhaled with frustration. “A
travel team? There goes the summer. How many games?”</p>
<p>“Dozens. Six weekend tournaments. Washington, Baltimore, Charlotte,
Atlanta, can’t remember the rest.”</p>
<p>“Great. And I suppose you’ve already said yes.”</p>
<p>“No. She mentioned it for the first time this morning at
breakfast.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“Forty-two hundred.”</p>
<p>“You must be kidding.”</p>
<p>“Nope. Fancy uniforms, travel, tournament fees, the works. Plus, a
paid coach.”</p>
<p>“A paid coach? She’s nine years old, Paula.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I know.”</p>
<p>They had yet to look at one another. A month or so earlier they had
sat together in the bleachers and a little chat grew somewhat testy. It
was best if they stayed away from the other fans.</p>
<p>He said, “And I’m sure Janie wants to spend her summer playing
soccer.”</p>
<p>“I think so. Her therapist says she wants to stay away from the house
as much as possible.”</p>
<p>“Her therapist?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s had two sessions.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I know this?”</p>
<p>“You haven’t been home. I’m raising the kids now. Solo, it
seems.”</p>
<p>He wanted to start yelling and cursing loudly but figured that might
disrupt the game and embarrass his daughter. Plus, it would only give
Paula more ammunition. He had to stay cool at all times. He ground his
teeth and made himself smile.</p>
<p>“How much for the therapist?”</p>
<p>“Two-fifty an hour.” Same rate as the Honorable Simon F. Latch,
Attorney and Counselor at Law. He swallowed hard and asked, with as much
sarcasm as possible, “Anybody else in the family seeing a shrink, other
than you and Janie?”</p>
<p>“Not at this time. I’m going to protect the children, Simon. Whatever
it takes.”</p>
<p>“As if I’m trying to harm them?”</p>
<p>“The divorce will do enough damage.”</p>
<p>“And the divorce is a mutual undertaking, right? We both want out and
have agreed to get a divorce.”</p>
<p>“The sooner the better.”</p>
<p>The soccer ball bounced nearby, out of play, and Janie scooped it up
for the inbounds. “Nice work, Janie! Atta girl!” Simon yelled intensely.
Of course, his encouragement was not acknowledged. He glanced at Paula
and she rolled her eyes in disgust. What a bitch. He couldn’t even cheer
properly.</p>
<p>Simon knew that the odds of Janie earning a single dollar playing
soccer were about as slim as him winning billion-dollar verdicts against
Big Pharma. But his dreams were over. Janie’s were only beginning.</p>
<p>“Any comments about the property settlement agreement?” he asked,
changing the subject to something other than soccer. Why did he pick the
PSA?</p>
<p>She sighed and glanced around to check on their privacy. “Is this
really the place?”</p>
<p>“No one’s listening. You want me to stop by the house and discuss it
in front of the kids?”</p>
<p>“Who prepared it?”</p>
<p>“I did. I told you I would.”</p>
<p>“Figures. I’ll feel better if I have my own lawyer to review the
agreement. And I don’t trust any lawyer around here because you know
them all.”</p>
<p>“Of course I know them all. Sorta goes with being in the profession.
And just because I know a lawyer doesn’t mean I trust him. In fact, I
distrust at least half of the lawyers in town and don’t like most of
them.”</p>
<p>“I’ll find one.”</p>
<p>“Great. And pay him or her five grand to nitpick a PSA that is
straightforward, fair, and includes everything we’ve already agreed
to?”</p>
<p>“You’re raising your voice, Simon, please.”</p>
<p>The game dragged on as Simon boiled and Paula seethed and both wanted
to walk away but neither would be the first to leave. Janie would know
instantly if one of them left. Late in the game she scored a third goal.
Simon faked a cheer while wondering how much it might cost him. When the
ball went out of bounds at the other end, he turned and walked away
without another word.</p>
