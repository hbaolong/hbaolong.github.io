<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>Their fourth lunch was at a slightly upscale Korean restaurant that
Simon had heard was superb. There were tablecloths and linen napkins and
an atmosphere that was more subdued than some of their previous dives.
So far they had tasted Greece, Thailand, and Afghanistan, and, though
Netty was thoroughly enjoying their lunches, she was not impressed with
the wide variety of cuisine. Also, she seemed perfectly willing to allow
Simon to pay for all the lunches, which he did while bitching only to
himself. Lunch was part of his grand seduction scheme.</p>
<p>She dutifully looked over the menu, thoroughly overwhelmed by it.
Simon took charge again and ordered traditional dishes of mandu, a
pan-fried dumping filled with chopped pork; japchae noodles, thin
see-through noodles with sliced mushrooms, carrots, and spinach; and,
everyone’s favorite, Korean fried chicken, made even crunchier after
first being rolled in rice flour. Simon made sure the waiter understood
that they wanted the tamest version of the chicken. The spiciest was
talked about around town.</p>
<p>During the second lunch, Eleanor had made it clear that she did not
drink alcohol, so no wine. She encouraged Simon to have a glass if he
wanted, but he rarely drank at lunch. Booze made the afternoons
sluggish.</p>
<p>When the waiter was gone, Simon decided to get to the point. “We have
not discussed your arrangements, have we?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, when Mr. Korsak died suddenly, who stepped up and made the
important decisions about his funeral and burial?”</p>
<p>“Oh my.” Her eyes were moist and she looked away. “Is it really time
for that?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so. As the executor of your will, and in the absence of
any family members, I’ll have to make those decisions. Unless, of
course, you want someone else to do so.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Simon. I’m trusting you to do it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I appreciate your trust, Netty.”</p>
<p>“Which funeral home?”</p>
<p>“Cupit andandandand Moke, downtown. I guess they’re still
around.”</p>
<p>“Oh, they’re both dead, but their families run the funeral home. Mind
if I take a look at the policy?”</p>
<p>“Why? I’m not even sure if I can find it. Wasn’t planning on needing
it anytime soon.” She cackled at her humor and Simon obliged with a fake
laugh. He said, “And your plot is next to Harry’s?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Out in Eternal Springs, the cemetery. Nicest one
around. I go visit once a month and take some flowers. Well, not every
month, but most of the time.”</p>
<p>“And the plot is paid for?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, as far as I know. Haven’t seen a bill in forever.”</p>
<p>“I’m assuming the policy covers the standard mortuary services,
casket, and so on.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it does. Harry’s casket was so handsome, made of oak, had
to pay extra.”</p>
<p>“Again, I’d like to see the policy,” Simon said. “There’s a trend
nowadays away from traditional burials. Many of my clients are choosing
cremation. Have you heard of this?”</p>
<p>“I may have read something. Dottie Watson from the poker club passed
two years ago and they cremated her, stuck her in a wall in a mausoleum.
We thought her family was just trying to save some money.”</p>
<p>“My wife and I have chosen cremation,” Simon said. “It’s easier,
quicker, and much cheaper. Plus, it protects the environment. Think of
the millions of people who’ve died and been embalmed and now those
chemicals are leaking into the drinking water. It’s a looming
environmental disaster.”</p>
<p>Eleanor was about to take a sip of water and she froze, then set down
her glass. Shocked, she said, “I never thought about that.”</p>
<p>“It’s true. When a person dies, the morticians fill the body with all
manner of chemicals, like formaldehyde, phenol, methanol, and glycerin,
to preserve things only until the funeral. It’s ridiculous, really.
About a million gallons of chemicals go into the ground each year. Over
time, as the body decomposes, the chemicals start leaking out,
regardless of what type of casket is used.”</p>
<p>“Well, I never…” Her voice trailed off.</p>
<p>“Cremation is the way to go and it’s definitely the trend, at least
in this country. I’ll send you some magazine articles.”</p>
<p>“No casket, nothing like that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing like that. Your ashes are put in a cremation urn and it’s
buried in a mausoleum or a columbarium.”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“Columbarium. It’s a structure that holds cremation urns.”</p>
<p>With thoughts of decaying remains hanging in the air, the mandu
arrived on a platter. They were small, round rice dumplings that smelled
delicious. Netty said, “Let’s change the subject.”</p>
<p>“Good idea.”</p>
<p>Simon could do a passable job with chopsticks but Eleanor was too
inexperienced. He suggested they stick to forks and she readily agreed.
The eight small dumplings disappeared in minutes, just as the noodles
and fried chicken were served. Eleanor had been lukewarm to the kabobs
from Afghanistan and the spicy egg rolls from Thailand, but she devoured
the crunchy fried chicken. And, in Simon’s opinion, she needed to eat.
She was looking thin and frail, not sickly, but she could add a few
pounds.</p>
<p>The waiter was a young Korean American kid with a Jersey accent. As
he cleared the table Simon asked, “What’s a delicious, authentic
dessert?”</p>
<p>“Coming right up,” he said, with confidence. “Coffee?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Eleanor asked for spiced tea.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he was back with small plate of sesame honey bars.
Eleanor took a bite of one, turned up her nose, and sipped tea.</p>
<p>Simon asked, “Were we finished with the conversation about your
arrangements?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Were we? I’m not sure about this cremation thing.
Could I still be buried next to Harry? He and I never talked much about
resting peacefully in the same plot, side by side.” Her eyes watered
again.</p>
<p>Simon listened with a smile. He knew for certain that he and Paula
would not spend eternity anywhere near each other. He said, “I’m sure
you can be placed next to Harry.”</p>
<p>She said, “But there won’t be a casket or anything. Just a little
vase or box or—”</p>
<p>“An urn. A cremation urn. There are thousands to choose from. It’s a
much simpler way to go and also cheaper.”</p>
<p>“Well, let me think about it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no rush, Netty.”</p>
<p>“I certainly hope not,” she said with a laugh that was too loud.</p>
