<h4 id="chapter-40">Chapter 40</h4>
<p>With Simon focused on his criminal problems, and with Judge Pointer
steadfastly refusing to even discuss Eleanor Barnett’s complicated
estate, Teddy Hammer quietly pursued his grand scheme. His plan was to
attack the will prepared by Simon on the grounds of undue influence. If
Simon was convicted of murder, he would go away for a long time and his
will would be worthless. If he was acquitted, something no one really
expected, then they would have a huge court fight over his actions in
preparing the will. Teddy would also attack the will prepared by Wally
Thackerman, also on the grounds of undue influence. He was confident he
could use the threat of an ethics complaint to bully Wally into backing
off.</p>
<p>Once Simon and Wally and their wills were out of the picture, Teddy
could reveal his secret. Neither lawyer had discovered that there was a
third will, one signed by Harry Korsak in 1988. According to Jerry
Korsak, who had a copy of the old will, his father had agreed to leave
everything to Eleanor, in trust. Upon her death, the assets would go to
Jerry and Clyde in equal shares. Because Eleanor had such strong
feelings against the boys, Harry had not told her about the will and she
did not sign a similar one at that time.</p>
<p>Teddy at first doubted the story because he had learned to doubt
almost everything Jerry told him. However, the old will was
straightforward and attempted to protect Jerry and Clyde upon Eleanor’s
death. The will had been prepared by a lawyer who died years earlier,
and it was a near perfect example of legal malpractice. It virtually
guaranteed years of litigation. For example, Harry kept his assets
jointly owned with Eleanor while at the same time attempting to shield
the assets in a poorly drafted trust. Why the old will was not probated
at Harry’s death was not clear. Teddy surmised that Eleanor knew nothing
about it and managed to avoid probate because the assets were jointly
owned. He was also certain that neither Simon nor Wally knew about the
old will. How could they? There were many unanswered questions, but the
bottom line was that Clyde and Jerry were the only blood relatives still
around. Eleanor’s niece and nephew didn’t even know she was dead.</p>
<p>The most pressing matter was the issue of the assets. What was in
Eleanor’s estate? Jerry was convinced there was plenty. He knew his
father owned stock in Coke and Wal-Mart, but some of his claims seemed
rather grandiose. Before Teddy invested hundreds of hours of work, he
needed to make sure there were significant assets. Otherwise, the case
was not worth pursuing. To investigate, Teddy befriended the
conservator, Clement Gelly, the conscientious young lawyer who had not
asked to be involved. Judge Pointer trusted him and leaned on him for
the favor.</p>
<p>Teddy convinced Clement to take a trip together. After getting Judge
Pointer’s quiet approval, they flew together, at Teddy’s expense, to
Atlanta and checked into a splendid hotel in the ritzy Buckhead
neighborhood. Teddy had learned the identity of Buddy Brown, a principal
in Rumke-Brown, Harry’s old brokerage house. However, his two attempts
to get him on the phone had gone nowhere.</p>
<p>Buddy was fully aware of Eleanor’s death and the surrounding drama
with her lawyer in Braxton, Virginia. In fact, he had a file with the
press clippings and had followed the chatter online. He knew he would be
involved at some point, so when the conservator, one Clement Gelly,
called and asked for a meeting, Buddy really had no choice but to
agree.</p>
<p>Teddy stayed at the hotel and kept busy while Clement took a cab a
few blocks away to an office building filled with professionals and
firms that seemed to want little attention. Rumke-Brown’s first-floor
suite spoke of understated wealth. The walls and floors were decorated
in a minimalist theme, with contemporary paintings and strange bronzes
on the end tables. The mood was subdued and quiet with soft background
music. There was no receptionist because the firm did not allow walk-ins
or encourage visitors. An assistant met Clement and led him through the
halls to a large corner office where Buddy Brown was waiting with a
smile.</p>
<p>The firm’s website followed the minimalist theme of revealing almost
nothing. There were a few partners and about a dozen associates, all
much younger than Brown. Though his age was not given, he graduated from
Emory in 1962, so he was in his mid-seventies. Fit, tanned, vigorous,
ready for the next tennis match. No pickleball for him. The same
assistant served them coffee and designer water on the conference table.
Brown rolled up his sleeves, glanced at his watch, and was ready to
donate one hour to the cause, whatever it was.</p>
<p>He said, “Looks like you got yourself a real mess up there.”</p>
<p>“Lots of drama,” Clement agreed. “I was minding my own business when
the judge hooked me in as the conservator.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what you said on the phone.” In other words, I’ve
already heard this. “Where is the case procedurally?”</p>
<p>“Which one? The murder trial is set for May twenty-third. The estate
mess is on hold until the criminal matters are resolved. Same judge with
both cases and she’s very much in control.”</p>
<p>“So, what’s my involvement at this point?”</p>
<p>“Nothing officially. I’m just trying to verify Ms. Barnett’s
assets.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I spent an hour with our attorney yesterday and this is my
position. I have, or had, a fiduciary relationship with Harry Korsak and
Eleanor Barnett, both now deceased. It was a confidential, privileged
relationship, as with all our clients. However, upon their deaths, the
confidentiality became somewhat less strict, shall we say. I will agree
to give a deposition, with my attorney present, for the record. I will
not agree to testify in any proceeding, unless, of course, I am
subpoenaed, at which time I will comply. Fair enough?”</p>
<p>“I suppose.”</p>
<p>“But there are some things I can tell you now, off the record, and in
confidence, that might help you inventory her assets. Are we off the
record?”</p>
<p>Clement wasn’t sure what the record was, and he knew he would
immediately debrief with Teddy Hammer over lunch. He wasn’t a journalist
working on a story, and he had not traveled all the way to Atlanta to
get stiff-armed. “Sure,” he said.</p>
<p>Buddy started at the beginning.</p>
<hr />
<p>He was a stockbroker with Merrill Lynch in Atlanta when he met Harry
and Eleanor. Her first husband died a few years earlier and she had
0,000 in life insurance. Harry was working for Coca-Cola and had just
qualified for its employee stock-option plan. They put all their money
in Coke and kept buying shares for many years. They were frugal, saved
as much as possible, and for thirty years bought all the Coke stock they
could afford. Later, they began buying Wal-Mart shares with the same
strategy. Both companies grew over the years and split their common
stock numerous times. The little Korsak nest egg became a fortune.
Around 1990, they splurged on a vacation and went to a small Caribbean
island few people had heard of. It was called Montrouge, in the French
West Indies, near Guadeloupe. Some executives at Coke had discovered the
place and were trying to keep it quiet. It was paradise, just a speck of
an island with beautiful mountains and white beaches. Harry and Eleanor
fell for the place and bought a nice bungalow for half a million. An
Atlanta developer showed up and saw the potential. The plan was to buy
the entire island, sell off individual lots, put in a resort or two, and
watch the value increase. Sort of like Mustique. Harry, whose health was
not great, was tired of working and began dreaming of a glorious
retirement on the island. He put million into the development and built
a bigger house on the beach. The land was selling at outrageous prices.
A few celebrities moved in and the prices went even higher. A deal to
sell Montrouge for 00 million fell through. Harry’s piece would have
been worth 15 percent of the total. More financing was needed to finish
a third resort, and Harry put up another million. Buddy voiced his
concern at that point, but Harry was determined. The limited partners
began squabbling and lawsuits were filed. The resorts were doing well
and the property values were through the roof, but there was discord
among the ownership. One group tried to buy another in a hostile
takeover. Harry sided with the losing group. A hefty loan was in
default. Harry put in another million. Almost all of his Coke and
Wal-Mart stock was gone but his real estate protected his net worth.
Then, an unbelievable disaster. On the first day of June 1999, the
volcano on Montrouge erupted for the first time in 240 years. The island
was practically blown out of the ocean and off the map. Over a hundred
people, tourists and residents, were killed, most of them never found.
Harry and Eleanor had been there the week before. Their luxury home was
totally destroyed. The typical insurance coverage on the island
protected the homes and resorts against fire, wind, flooding, and so on.
Not a single one mentioned volcanoes. Big lawsuits were filed by the
owners, and the litigation raged until the owners got tired of losing.
The insurance companies won every case.</p>
<p>Harry’s bad health deteriorated even faster. He and Eleanor had
nervous breakdowns together and went into therapy. To run away, they
sold their home in Atlanta and moved to the hills of northern Virginia.
Harry died not long after the move.</p>
<p>It was a very sad story.</p>
<p>The obvious question was: How much, if any, of the money was
left?</p>
<p>Buddy dodged the question for a while, then said, “Upon the advice of
counsel, I can’t give you the exact value of the stocks in the
portfolio. I will if a court orders me to, but I can’t now.”</p>
<p>Clement was frustrated by Buddy’s reluctance and said, “Okay, I get
that, but I’m trying to anticipate litigation, and it would be helpful
if I had an idea, in the ballpark, of the value of Eleanor’s
stocks.”</p>
<p>“I understand. At its peak, the Coke stock was worth a little over
ten million. What’s left is less than half a million. Wal-Mart was about
six mil, and it’s all gone.”</p>
<p>Clement managed to stifle his reaction. “That’s quite a bit less than
we thought.”</p>
<p>“Substantially less than half a million.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Clement left after an hour and a half, returned to the hotel, and
found Teddy Hammer at a small desk in the business center. He sat in a
chair across from him, smiling as he shook his head, and said, “It’s all
a hoax.”</p>
