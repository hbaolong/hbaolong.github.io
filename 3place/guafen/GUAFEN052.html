<h4 id="chapter-51">Chapter 51</h4>
<p>It took two hours, and all of lunch, to hammer out jury instructions
and settle the lingering objections that Judge Shyam had taken under
advisement. When the loose ends were wrapped up, the jurors were brought
in once more and the courtroom grew quiet. Cora Cook approached the jury
box. It was almost 3 P.M.</p>
<p>She once again thanked the jurors for their service, a needless
gesture that meant nothing. By then they were weary of their service and
tired of each other and no amount of false praise could impress
them.</p>
<p>She switched gears immediately and got their attention. “According to
FBI statistics, there are twenty thousand murders each year in this
country. Almost forty percent are never solved. Those are troubling
numbers, but let’s set them aside. Of the murders that are solved,
almost half, fifty percent, involve circumstantial evidence. No one saw
the fateful deed. No one saw the murderer pull the trigger, or cut with
the knife, or beat with the club. There were no eyewitnesses. And, since
the murderer did not confess to the crime, the detectives studied the
crime scene and found clues. Every murderer leaves behind evidence.
Bullets and shells for ballistics tests. Blood, semen, saliva, sweat,
skin, for DNA testing. Fingerprints, hair follicles, boot prints, for
forensic analysis. And poison for toxicologists to examine and
study.”</p>
<p>Cora stayed behind the small podium and only occasionally glanced at
her notes. She spoke directly to the jurors, looking them in the eye, an
orator who was well prepared and knew her stuff.</p>
<p>“Eleanor Barnett was murdered in a very devious manner. She ingested
a poison that has for decades been known as the poisoner’s choice.
Thallium has no taste, odor, or appearance. It’s invisible. It can be
ingested in small quantities over several days or weeks without yielding
clues, often, as in this case, confounding the doctors, who so rarely
confront it. Neither the doctors nor the nurses had any reason to
suspect that this lovely and respectable lady, laid up in the hospital
after an awful car wreck, would secretly be fed, in small doses, a
poison added to one of her favorite treats, ginger cookies purchased by
the defendant and delivered by his longtime and loyal secretary.</p>
<p>“Now, the defense evidently wants you to believe that someone other
than the defendant acquired a poison that can be found only on the black
market and only by someone with evil intent, and this other person
sneaked into Ms. Barnett’s hospital room and laced her cookies with
thallium. How convenient. How original. Someone else did it. I’m sure
you’ve never heard that one before.</p>
<p>“But why would someone else murder Eleanor Barnett? Ladies and
gentlemen, it’s a question of motive. And the motive was greed. Who
could profit from her death? Oh, I suppose the funeral home could make a
buck. But it’s hard to imagine Mr. Douglas Gregg, the mortician you met
here on the stand, sneaking into her hospital room and killing her so he
could then cremate her. Are we supposed to believe that? Ludicrous.
About as ludicrous as the other good and innocent people the defense has
dragged into this courtroom to smear their names. The doctors, nurses,
orderlies, assistants, even janitors, all those good folks just doing
their jobs, trying to save her life, and now the defendant wants you to
suspect them all. Pretty outrageous.”</p>
<p>One glance at the jurors and Simon knew better than to glance again.
If Raymond thought they had eight friends in the box, Simon would love
to know where the first one was sitting.</p>
<p>“Who has the motive? Who wanted Eleanor dead?” Cora’s voice was loud,
incredulous, and echoed around the courtroom. She stepped away from her
notes and hit her stride with a tirade of facts that could not be
contested. The secrecy of the preparation and execution of the will. The
obvious belief that there was big money on the table; otherwise, why
would the defendant go to such great lengths to set up a trust designed
to make donations to 120 charities? Why would the will leave 00,000 each
to Clyde and Jerry Korsak if doing so would leave so little for the
trust? Why would the defendant call his pal Dirk Wheeler, a bona fide
tax and estate lawyer, and seek advice for a client with a substantial
net worth? Why would the defendant insert himself as the attorney for
the estate and also the attorney for the trust, with no other trustees
to provide oversight? Why would the defendant award himself fees of 00
an hour, an obscene amount for a small-town lawyer with no experience in
complicated estate matters? According to his own secretary, he had never
been paid such exorbitant fees.</p>
<p>Cora stopped, looked at the jurors in complete amazement, and asked,
“Who in the world is worth five hundred dollars an hour?”</p>
<p>Then she lowered the large white screen opposite the jurors and
methodically went through the timeline, carefully listing the important
dates and times: Eleanor’s car wreck and hospitalization, the purchase
of the first box of ginger cookies from Tan Lu’s, the aggressive actions
by the defendant to get his client to execute a power of attorney and
living will, from her hospital bed; the purchase of the second box of
cookies; the deterioration of her condition; the ventilator; her death;
then, of course, the forty-seven-minute gap between her official passing
and the defendant’s phone call to the funeral home with the request to
“come and get her.”</p>
<p>Cora finished an hour after she began. Her final words to the jury
were: “A clear-cut case of first-degree murder.”</p>
<p>Simon tried to sit tall, take meaningless notes, and present a
confident look for everyone.</p>
<hr />
<p>Raymond wasted no time in attacking the prosecution. He said, “Well,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, once again the great Commonwealth of
Virginia, with its endless resources of lawyers, investigators, experts,
doctors, and money, has stumbled its way into a courtroom without
bringing enough proof to overcome the presumption of innocence. The
prosecution has no proof!” His voice boomed throughout the hushed
courtroom.</p>
<p>“What the Commonwealth does have is plenty of speculation. Tons of
it. Lots of suspicion too. Plenty of circumstantial suspicion. And, it
has the dead body of a lovely lady who deserved better. A lady who
trusted the defendant because she had no one else to trust. A lady who
had once been wealthy and lost it all and was obviously mentally
unbalanced in many ways. She still lived in a fantasy world in which she
and her late husband were quite wealthy. She was delusional and still
dreamed of the lost money. She was lost in the past.</p>
<p>“And how, exactly, was Simon Latch supposed to know it was all a
hoax? Maybe he should have dug deeper. I don’t know and it doesn’t
really matter right now. All that matters today is that someone poisoned
Eleanor Barnett and it wasn’t Simon Latch.”</p>
<p>Raymond stopped pacing and wiped his brow with a handkerchief.
“Greed? You want to talk about greed? Simon Latch never received a
single penny in fees from this woman. Nothing. She didn’t believe in
paying her legal bills. She had plenty of cash, and he knew that, but he
never pressed her for payment.”</p>
<p>Simon kept his eyes on Raymond as he moved back and forth in front of
the jury box, and in doing so he caught glimpses of the jurors’ faces.
Some watched Raymond and seemed to agree. Most, however, seemed
dismissive.</p>
<p>He finished in half an hour and his timing was good. The jury had
heard enough. Judge Shyam told them to go home and forget about the case
until nine the following morning, Friday.</p>
<hr />
<p>Landy had been in the courtroom for most of the afternoon and was
waiting behind the courthouse near the dumpsters. They made another
getaway and drove for an hour west of town. She was of the opinion that
the jury was split and would hang itself. Simon was too consumed with
fear to say much. He certainly wasn’t hungry.</p>
<p>They stopped at a restaurant in Williamsburg and had drinks on an
outdoor terrace as the sun faded. She asked if sex might help and he
said no. At the moment, nothing would help but an acquittal.</p>
