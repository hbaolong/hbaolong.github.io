<h4 id="self-assessment">SELF-ASSESSMENT</h4>
<p>Are You At Risk for Brain Decline?</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have spent a great deal of time distilling
the best evidence-based brain research into guidance for you. It is
based on formal and informal conversations with colleagues and other
experts in the world of neuroscience and human performance. In order to
make it most useful, I have created a list of questions that are highly
relevant to your brain health and potential. <strong>No matter what in
your life you are trying to improve, honest self-awareness is
important</strong>, and answering these questions will help you do just
that.</p>
<p>The list of twenty-four questions that follows will help you assess
your risk factors for brain decline. These are mostly all modifiable
risk factors, so don’t panic if you answer yes to any of these
questions. This is not meant to frighten you. (Remember: I don’t believe
that scare tactics work.) Some of these questions correlate with highly
reversible symptoms of cognitive decline. Chronic sleep deprivation, for
example, can lead to a staggering amount of memory loss that can even
appear like the onset of dementia. <strong>Sleeping well is one of the
easiest and most effective ways to improve all of your brain functions,
as well as your ability to learn and remember new knowledge (it improves
every system in the body).</strong> I underestimated the value of sleep
for too long, taking great pride in my ability to function on a lack of
it. Take it from me: That was a mistake. <strong>Luckily, this can be
remedied with proper diagnosis and simply going to bed earlier and
putting away your electronic devices and your to-do list.</strong> Some
queries may seem unrelated, such as your level of education. For reasons
I’ll explain in this book, multiple studies now show that higher
education might have protective effects in cognitive decline but not
necessarily at slowing the decline once memory loss has started. In
other words, people with more years of formal education (e.g., more
college attendance and advanced degrees) or greater literacy have a
lower risk for dementia than those with fewer years of formal education,
but that doesn’t matter as much if you start to develop dementia in the
first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>dementia,英 [dɪˈmenʃə] 美 [dɪˈmenʃə] n. 痴呆，精神错乱</li>
</ul>
<p>More than anything else, though, I want you to begin to see what kind
of behavior plays a role in your brain health now and in the future.
This is important. As a neurosurgeon, I know the satisfaction that comes
with quick fixes, but you will see that some of these behavioral changes
are not only effective but surgical in terms of rapid improvements.
<strong>Knowing and understanding your daily habits will arm you with
some personal data that can ultimately provide guidance for where you
should be putting more effort—to rebuild and maintain a better
brain.</strong> The questions are data driven insofar as they reflect
scientific findings to date.</p>
<p>If you say yes to any of the questions below, that doesn’t mean
you’ll receive a doomsday diagnosis now or in the future.
<strong>Multiple factors, some of them not even included here because I
wanted to keep this simple, are at play in the realm of
cognition.</strong> Just as there are lifetime smokers who never get
lung cancer, there will be people who live with many heightened risk
factors for brain decline yet never experience it. Some of these risk
factors are also debatable, and I will be transparent about that as
well, alongside those debatable recommendations. Nonetheless, it’s
helpful to see all the potential risk factors for which there is good
evidence and also the risk factors that researchers have been exploring
and believe will be proven important in the future. I want to provide
you with both the knowledge and the thinking that helped create that
knowledge.</p>

<p>If you answered yes to five or more questions, then your brain could
be in decline or may be soon, and you can benefit tremendously from the
information in this book. Even if you answered yes to only one or two
questions, you can help optimize the health and performance of your
brain for the better. Curious as to how these questions (and their
answers) relate to your body’s most mysterious organ? Read on to learn
everything you want—and need—to know for a smarter, sharper,
better-thinking you. Final reminder: This book isn’t just about avoiding
disease. It is about making your brain as sharp as it can be at any
age.</p>
<p>Read on to learn everything you want—and need—to know for a smarter,
sharper, better-thinking you. My hope is you can wind up like the couple
who inspired me several years ago and who showed me what to aspire to
when it comes to “old age.” We all age and will one day live with an old
brain, but that doesn’t mean it has to lose its sharpness. Looks can be
deceiving.</p>
<p>The husband was ninety-three years old and had been brought to the
emergency room where I was on call. When my chief resident first told me
about the patient, who was in serious neurological decline, his advanced
age concerned me. I honestly thought he was too old to undergo an
operation, should he need one. A little while later the CT scan showed a
significant brain bleed that explained his symptoms.</p>
<p>I went to the family in the waiting room fully expecting them to tell
me not to pursue an aggressive, risky operation. A spry woman who looked
to be in her sixties was nervously pacing the room with several other
family members sitting earnestly in chairs. I was shocked to learn she
was his wife and they had just celebrated their seventieth wedding
anniversary. “I am actually older than he is,” she said. “I robbed the
cradle.” She was ninety-four years young in perfect health, took no
medicines, and had driven her great-grandkids to school earlier that
day. She shared that my patient was still an avid runner and worked
part-time as an accountant. His sixty-three-year-old son said they kept
him around because “he’s such a whiz with numbers.” His brain bleed
occurred after he fell from his roof while he was blowing leaves up
there. These nonagenarians were healthier than most of my patients, of
any age.</p>
<p>Since I started medical school, there has always been a truism: We
consider “physiological” age more than chronological age. At the
family’s request, I took the gentleman to the operating room for a
craniotomy, which would fix the bleed. Before closing the dura, the
outer layer of the brain, I took a few moments to closely inspect his
brain, and what I saw surprised me. Given how active, cognitively
intact, and sharp he was, I expected to see a large brain pulsating
robustly and appearing healthy. But this looked like a
ninety-three-year-old brain. It was more shriveled, sunken with deep
wrinkles indicative of his age. Now, if this sounds disheartening to
you, it should not. In fact, just the opposite.</p>
<p>Another truism in medicine is the following: Always treat the
patient, not their test results. Yes, of course his brain had aged; he
was ninety-three. But, the brain—perhaps more so than any other organ in
the body—can reliably grow stronger throughout life and become more
robust than in years past. I will never forget that experience. There
seemed to be a total disconnect between the brain I was staring at and
the man whose skull it inhabited.</p>
<p>He recovered quickly. When I visited him later on, recovering in the
ICU, I asked him how the whole event affected him. He smiled and said,
“The biggest lesson in all of this is no more trying to blow the leaves
off the roof.”</p>
<p>Final reminder: This book isn’t just about avoiding disease. It is
about making your brain as sharp as it can be at any age.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-the-brain">PART 1 THE BRAIN</h2>
<p>MEET YOUR INNER BLACK BOX</p>
<p>In the seconds it takes for you to read this sentence, your brain
will have fired off a miraculous number of electrical signals to keep
you alive—breathing, moving, feeling, blinking, and thinking. Some of
the information zipping through your billions of neurons are traveling
faster than the speed of a race car. The human brain is a remarkable
organ, an evolutionary marvel. It arguably houses more connections than
there are stars in the known galaxy.1 Scientists have said that the
brain is the most complex thing we have ever discovered; one of the
discoverers of DNA went so far as to call it “the last and grandest
biological frontier. The brain,” he said, “boggles the mind.”2</p>
<p>Our brains sculpt who we are and the world we experience. It creates
our everyday experiences, from those that bring us joy, wonder, and
connection to fellow humans, to the complicated moments when we have to
rely on our brains to make good decisions, plan, and prepare for the
future. It even tells stories when we’re sleeping in the form of dreams.
And it knows how to adapt to environments, tell time, and form memories.
It is quite likely the reservoir of our consciousness, though we are not
entirely sure about that. (More on that later.) Neuroscientists have
their work cut out for them because the brain continues to mystify as if
it were a distant planet light-years away. It’s arguably the most
enigmatic 3.3 pounds of life. Researchers even found a new kind of
neuron recently—the rosehip—and still don’t know yet what it does. It
seems to exist only in human brains but not in rodents, which may
explain why so many mice brain studies never translate to humans. Our
brains can be extraordinarily selfish and demanding as well. Of the
total blood and oxygen that is produced in our bodies, the brain steals
20 percent of it, despite being only roughly 2.5 percent of your body
weight. There can be no life without a brain.</p>
<p>Time to meet your inner black box.</p>
