3 12 Destructive Myths and the 5 Pillars That Will Build You</h4>
<p>Overall, the human brain is the most complex object known in the
universe—known, that is, to itself.</p>
<p>EDWARD O. WILSON</p>
<p>As a neurosurgeon, I get to live a life that has a clear sense of
purpose. Patients come into the hospital under dire circumstances, and
they put all their faith in me. It is an awesome responsibility. After
practicing for nearly twenty years, I am still thrilled to speak to a
family after a successful operation—whether it’s removing a tumor,
clearing pooled blood after trauma, or repairing a fractured spine. But
I also make my living by taking my expertise on the road and putting on
my journalist’s hat to report from the front lines of a newsworthy
event. And when my worlds of medicine and media collide, the result can
be spectacular.</p>
<p>In spring 2003, I was in Iraq for several weeks with a group of
doctors known as the Devil Docs—navy doctors who helped support the
marines. We had spent countless days together traveling through the
desert, caring for patients terribly wounded, and getting to know each
other well under incredibly unique and challenging circumstances. One
day, some of the Devil Docs ran over to me and asked if I would
literally take off my journalist’s cap and put on a surgeon’s cap. A
young lieutenant had been shot in the back of the head and was thought
to have been mortally wounded, but as they brought his body to the Devil
Docs’ camp, his pulse returned. He was alive but in need of quick
surgery. Time was of the essence, and I was the only neurosurgeon in the
area, so they wanted me to help. I rushed him to the makeshift operating
room and realized that he needed a craniectomy—removal of a portion of
his skull to relieve pressure on his brain and drain the blood
collection. Without proper tools in the dusty, desert tent, I took the
bit from a Black andandandand Decker drill and sterilized it. I placed a
sterile glove on the drill itself, and then used it to open his skull
and provide room for his swollen brain. After that, I dissected through
the outer layers of the brain, found the blood clot and shrapnel, and
carefully removed it. I still needed to cover his brain in some sterile
fashion, otherwise he would have been at risk of meningitis, possibly
encephalitis, and most likely he would not have survived. So I fileted
open an IV bag and used the inside of it to re-create the outer layer of
his brain, because it was the only thing truly sterile inside that dusty
tent.</p>
<p>After that, I wrapped his head, and he was evacuated by a Black Hawk
helicopter to Kuwait. I wasn’t sure I would ever see him again or even
if he would survive. A couple of months later, a doctor called me from
San Diego to give me an update on the young man, Jesus Vidana. He was
alive and doing well, he told me. I visited with him a short time later,
and I invited him to be my guest when I gave the commencement address at
the University of Southern California Medical School. He received a long
standing ovation, and it still gives me chills to think of his beaming
face, handsome and healthy. His survival under those conditions with the
gravity of his wounds was one of the most electrifying experiences of my
life. I like to joke that operating on Jesus in the middle of the desert
is something I will never forget!</p>
<p>The reason I share this story is that it highlights what’s possible
when a brain—against all odds—survives a trauma. It’s more resilient and
recoverable than you think. And you can take action to reverse the
course of a brain’s inevitable demise under even bad circumstances. The
example is extreme, but remember it as you move forward and learn the
ways in which you can shift your own circumstances to decrease your
chances of ever facing a brain-related condition or, worse, dying from a
brain-related ailment.</p>
<p>THE DIRTY DOZEN</p>
<p>You’ve already gained a lot of wisdom about the brain in previous
chapters. But I bet you’d still get a few facts wrong when it comes to
answering questions about what it can do and how it changes throughout
your lifetime. Remember that I want you to know the why and the how when
it comes to brain health. Let’s add to your working knowledge by
debunking the twelve most pervasive myths about the aging brain. This
will ultimately prepare you to embrace what you can do to de-age your
brain and add more years to its health. I call these myths the Dirty
Dozen.</p>
<p>Myth #1: The Brain Remains a Complete Mystery</p>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with this myth. I hate it because
it’s not true, but I love it because it allows me to correct people’s
misconceptions and give them hope. While there is still a lot to learn,
researchers have recently made great strides in understanding the brain.
We know more about the connections between different parts of the brain
and their relevance to how we think, move, and feel. We are better able
to anatomically identify the areas of the brain responsible for
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and addiction. And we can
better rehabilitate the brain after injury or stroke. The field of
neuroscience is almost constantly brimming with new and exciting
breakthroughs, many of which I highlight in part 2.</p>
<p>Myth #2: Older People Are Doomed to Forget Things</p>
<p>There is a kernel of truth to this myth; some cognitive skills do
decline as you age, especially if you don’t employ strategies to pay
closer attention and help you remember. But whereas you may have been
quicker at picking up a new language or memorizing a list of random
words when you were a youngster, you’re more likely to be superior with
vocabulary and a good judge of character when you’re an older adult.
You’d score higher on tests of social communication and diplomacy, such
as how to settle an argument or deal with a conflict. The other good
news about aging is that we tend to improve over time at controlling our
own emotions, weathering stress, and finding meaning in our lives.</p>
<p>Myth #3: Dementia Is an Inevitable Consequence to Old Age</p>
<p>You should be able to dispel this myth on your own by now. Dementia
is not a normal part of aging. Typical age-related changes in the brain
are not the same as changes that are caused by disease. The former can
be slowed down and the latter can be avoided.</p>
<p>Myth #4: Older People Can’t Learn New Things</p>
<p>Learning can happen at any age, especially when you get involved with
cognitively stimulating activities like meeting new people or trying new
hobbies. The combination of memory being dynamic and the possibility of
growing new neurons (neurogenesis) means we can continue to change our
brain’s information, capacity, and learning strengths. While mastering
some new skills, such as a second or third language, may take an older
person longer, that doesn’t mean one cannot achieve the feat. Never say
“never.” Even people diagnosed with cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s
disease included, can continue to learn new things.</p>
<p>Myth #5: You Must Master One Language before Learning Another</p>
<p>Young children who learn English and a different language at the same
time do not confuse the two, and even though they may take longer to
master both at the same time, that does not mean it’s a bad idea.
Different areas of the brain do not go to battle so there’s no
interference. Much to the contrary, kids who are bilingual have a better
generalized knowledge of language structure as a whole. One of the
reasons children seem to learn a new language more easily than adults is
that they are less self-conscious.</p>
<p>Myth #6: A Person Who Has Memory Training Never Forgets</p>
<p>In part 2, I present a gallery of memory training ideas to build
those skills. One of them is “use it or lose it.” It applies to memory
training in the same way it applies to maintaining the strength of a
muscle or your overall physical health. This will be an ongoing practice
that you’ll need to maintain, as with other long-term strategies.</p>
<p>Myth #7: We Use Only 10 Percent of Our Brains</p>
<p>Who hasn’t heard of this myth? It’s been around for a long time,
suggesting that we have huge reserves of untapped mental powers. But do
we really waste 90 percent of our brains? Absolutely not. That would be
ridiculous just from an evolutionary standpoint. Brains are demanding
organs; it takes a lot of energy to build them during development and
maintain them as adults. Evolutionarily, it would make no sense to carry
around surplus brain tissue (and let’s apply some logic: if the 10
percent idea were true, it would certainly make brain damage a lot less
worrisome). Experiments using positron-emission tomography (PET) or
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans show that much of the
brain is engaged during even simple tasks, and injury to the small
sections of brain called “eloquent areas” can have profound consequences
for language, movement, emotion, or sensory perception.</p>
<p>Remember that autopsy studies show that many people had physical
signs of Alzheimer’s disease (such as amyloid plaques among neurons) in
their brains even though they had no symptoms. Perhaps we can indeed
lose some brain tissue and still fully function. There is something to
be said, however, about choosing to exercise our minds at 100 percent
capacity. People score higher on IQ tests if they’re highly motivated,
and that’s not surprising. I think of the brain like a town. The
important structures such as the homes and shops are in nearly constant
use, and they probably represent 10 to 20 percent of our brains. The
rest, however, are the roads that connect all these shops and homes.
Without the roads, information could not get where it needs to go. So
while the roads are not in constant use, they are necessary.</p>
<p>Myth #8: Male and Female Brains Differ in Ways That Dictate Learning
Abilities and Intelligence</p>
<p>Urban legend has it that men are biologically better suited for math
and science, whereas women are better suited for empathy and intuition.
Some of the worst-designed, least reproducible, and most biased research
in the history of science claims to provide biological explanations for
differences between the sexes. Granted, differences do exist in the
brains of males and females that result in variations in brain function,
but not to the extent that one is better “equipped” than the other.
Scientists continue to study the brain to understand and learn more
about any important differences between the brains of men and
women—research is still emerging in the field of neuroscience. Another
way to think about it more broadly: Each of us may be wired in our own
unique way, though with a healthy brain we each have the capacity to
learn, remember, and make sense of the complex world around us.</p>
<p>One item to note, however, is that Alzheimer’s strikes a
disproportionate number of women compared to men.1 Two-thirds of
Americans with Alzheimer’s disease are women, and we don’t have an
understanding yet why this is the case or what causes women to be at
higher risk. It’s not just because they are more likely to live longer.
Something about their physiology could be part of the reason. How many
times a woman is pregnant over her lifetime is among the provocative
theories being studied.2 Pregnancy entails many biological events from
hormonal changes to immune function shifts that could ultimately lead to
protection against developing dementia later in life. We don’t have the
answers yet, although hormone therapy continues to be discussed as a
tool. It has been shown to be harmful for cognition under certain
circumstances but potentially beneficial under other circumstances,
depending on when you start taking it (in one’s early fifties or between
sixty-five and seventy-nine, respectively). What’s becoming clear is
that a personalized approach needs to be considered. Different women
respond differently to hormonal therapy depending on their individual
risk factors, such as being diabetic or carrying a gene related with
Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>Women do have an advantage over men in their verbal abilities, and
that could be a factor in identifying any cognitive problems. Studies
show women score better on standard tests used to diagnose the early
stages of dementia, even when brain scans suggest they are at the same
stage of the disease as men.3 Put simply, women can hide symptoms of
Alzheimer’s with their superior verbal skills, which results in their
not getting diagnosed early enough. At later stages of cognitive
impairment, this advantage disappears. Such a gender-based difference
may be the reason that women seem to decline more rapidly after being
diagnosed—they are further along the disease’s trajectory than the
earlier test would have indicated. Calls for gender-based cutoff points
for these tests are now part of the conversation in research and
clinical settings. (I discuss this in more detail with Maria Shriver in
chapter 11.)</p>
<p>Myth #9: A Crossword Puzzle a Day Can Keep the Brain Doctor Away</p>
<p>Another urban legend is that doing crossword puzzles will keep your
brain young. Unfortunately, crossword puzzles flex only a portion of
your brain, mostly its word finding ability (also called fluency). So
while they might help you excel at that, they won’t necessarily keep
your brain sharp in any general, overall sense. That said, there is
value in doing word and number puzzles, including games like Sudoku. In
2019, a follow-up study by the University of Exeter Medical School and
King’s College London confirmed earlier results that showed the more
often participants engaged with puzzles, the better they performed on
tasks assessing attention, reasoning, and memory.4 Their results came
from analyzing data from more than nineteen thousand healthy people aged
fifty and over who are enrolled in the large PROTECT Study, which spans
twenty-five years and follows participants annually to explore how the
brain ages and what might influence the risk of dementia later in life.
The researchers were quick to point out that the results don’t directly
and definitively mean that doing crosswords improves brain function or
gives you a sharper brain. What’s known is that keeping an active mind
can help to reduce decline in thinking skills, and for some people,
doing crossword puzzles is a way to do that. For others, it may not
be.</p>
<p>Myth #10: You Are Dominated by Either Your “Right” or “Left”
Brain</p>
<p>Contrary to what you might have been taught in the past, your brain’s
“two sides”—right and left—are intricately codependent. You may have
heard that you can be “right-brained” or “left-brained”—and that those
who favor the right are more creative or artistic and those who favor
the left are more technical and logical. The left brain/right brain
notion originated from the realization that many people express and
receive language more in the left hemisphere and spatial abilities and
emotional expression more in the right. Psychologists have used the idea
to distinguish between different personality types. But brain scanning
technology has revealed that the brain’s two hemispheres most often work
together intricately. For example, language processing, once thought to
be the domain of the left hemisphere only, is now understood to take
place in both hemispheres. The left side handles grammar and
pronunciation, while the right processes intonation, and the brain
recruits both left and right sides for both reading and math.</p>
<p>Myth #11: You Have Only Five Senses</p>
<p>You can likely name all five senses: sight (ophthalmoception), smell
(olfacoception), taste (gustaoception), touch (tactioception), and
hearing (audioception). But there are others with the “cept” ending,
which is Latin for take or receive. The other six senses are also
processed in the brain and give us more data about the outside
world:</p>
<p>Proprioception: A sense of where your body parts are and what they’re
doing.</p>
<p>Equilibrioception: A sense of balance, otherwise known as your
internal GPS. This tells you if you’re sitting, standing, or lying down.
It’s located in the inner ear (which is why problems in your inner ear
can cause vertigo).</p>
<p>Nociception: A sense of pain.</p>
<p>Thermo(re)ception: A sense of temperature.</p>
<p>Chronoception: A sense of the passage of time.</p>
<p>Interoception: A sense of your internal needs, like hunger, thirst,
needing to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>Myth #12: You’re Born with All the Brain Cells You’ll Ever Have, Your
Brain Is Hardwired, and Brain Damage Is Always Permanent</p>
<p>If you have thought the head of a newborn looks proportionally bigger
compared to its body size than the head of a grown adult, you’re right.
Due to the imbalance between brain and body development during
pregnancy, babies’ brains are proportionately much larger than those of
adults relative to their body size. A newborn’s brain triples in size in
the first year of life; after that, the rate of physical growth slows as
we learn and pack more into our roughly 3.3-pound brains. What continues
to develop, allowing this tremendous ability to process more and more
information, is the complexity of the networks of neurons as they go
through a process of pruning, whereby certain synapses that are not
being used are trimmed to make room for new ones. This helps explain why
brain size is not necessarily directly correlated with intelligence. As
the brain reaches half of its adult size by nine months and nearly
three-quarters by two years of age, a baby’s head must be large and grow
rapidly to accommodate the rest of the body’s growth. On average, the
brain reaches its maximum size in girls at about eleven and a half years
of age and fourteen and a half on average for boys—but again it will not
be fully mature in terms of its internal development and executive
functioning until about twenty-five years of age.</p>
<p>You know that as an adult, adding more information to your brain
doesn’t increase the size of it (and imagine what people would look like
if brain size increased with learning new information). But what does
grow larger is the number of neurons—nerve cells—and the complexity of
their network through ongoing and active pruning and “growth.” While
genes likely play a role in the decline of synapses, among the most
astonishing recent research is that which has highlighted the power of
experience—how one’s environment can profoundly influence the pruning
process. It’s the old nature-versus-nurture phenomenon in action.
Synapses that are “exercised” by experience become stronger, while
others get weaker and are eventually trimmed away.</p>
<p>As I’ve already noted, we used to believe that we were born with a
finite number of neurons for life. When we damaged any of them, we
couldn’t replace them. Similarly, many scientists thought that the brain
was unalterable: Once broken, it could not be fixed. Now we know
differently. The brain remains plastic throughout life and can rewire
itself in response to your experiences. It can also generate new brain
cells under the right circumstances. Take, for example, what blind
people experience, as parts of their brain that normally process sight
may instead be devoted to exceptional hearing. Someone practicing a new
skill, like learning to play the violin, “rewires” parts of the brain
that are responsible for fine motor control. People who’ve suffered
brain injuries can recruit other parts of their brain to compensate for
the lost or damaged tissue. Intelligence is not fixed either.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis has long been proven in various other animals, but it
wasn’t until the 1990s that researchers began focusing exclusively on
trying to demonstrate the birth of new brain cells in humans. Finally,
in 1998, Swedish neurologist Peter Eriksson was among the first to
publish a now widely cited report documenting that within our brains—in
the hippocampus—there’s a reservoir of neural stem cells that are
continually replenished and can differentiate into brain neurons.5 We
all experience development, at least in certain areas of our brains,
throughout our lives. We are also equipped with the technology to rewire
and physically reshape our brains. This has led to the burgeoning new
field of neuroplasticity—the ability of the brain to form and reorganize
synaptic connections. The brain’s plasticity was first documented more
than 100 years ago in William James’s 1890 book The Principles of
Psychology, in which the Harvard University psychologist writes:
“Organic matter, especially nervous tissue, seems endowed with a very
extraordinary degree of plasticity,” but only in my lifetime have we
begun to measure and visualize this phenomenon with technology. And with
tools like fMRI, we can see the brain changes in response to certain
stimulation. We can also see parts of the brain that are not in use
being pruned away. The brain constantly and dynamically shapes and
reshapes itself in response to experiences, learning, or even an injury.
What’s more, what you choose to focus your attention on rewires the
brain from a structural and functional perspective.</p>
<p>The fact neurogenesis occurs in us throughout our lifetimes, coupled
with the bonus fact we can change its circuitry through neuroplasticity,
has stirred a revolution in neuroscience and our thinking about the
brain. This new knowledge also has instilled hope in those searching for
clues to slowing down, reversing, or even stopping and curing
progressive brain disease. If we can regenerate brain cells and reshape
connections, imagine what that can do for the study of neurodegenerative
disorders. My educated guess is that novel treatments are on the way.
Some have already transformed the lives of people who have suffered from
serious brain injuries or disease. Look no further than Sharon Begley’s
Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain to read about real-life stories that
prove just how pliable our brains are.6 Dr. Norman Doidge tells similar
stories in his books that chronicle how the brain changes itself. If
people who have suffered a devastating stroke can learn to speak again
and those born with partial brains or who lose significant brain tissue
to disease or surgical removal can propel their brains’ rewiring to work
as a whole, think of the possibilities for those of us who just hope to
preserve our mental faculties as we age. Even people who’ve had an
entire hemisphere removed in childhood to treat rare neurological
conditions such as intractable epilepsy or brain cancer can go on to
function in adulthood. Their brains reorganize and various networks pick
up the slack.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering just how the brain “grows” new neurons, it’s
largely through the help of the protein brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), which is encoded in a gene located on chromosome 11.
Dr. John Ratey, a neuropsychiatrist at Harvard who has written
extensively on the connection between physical fitness and brain health,
calls BDNF “Miracle-Gro for the brain.”7 In addition to nurturing
neurogenesis, BDNF also helps protect existing neurons and encourage
synapse formation—the connection of one neuron to another.
Interestingly, studies have demonstrated decreased levels of BDNF in
Alzheimer’s patients. It’s no surprise, then, that scientists are
looking for ways to increase BDNF in the brain through basic lifestyle
habits. Among the things included on their list of upcoming strategies
are exercise, restorative sleep, stress reduction, and healthy exposure
to sunlight.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that brain plasticity is a two-way street. In
other words, it’s almost as easy to drive changes that impair memory and
physical and mental abilities as it is to improve these things. I love
how Dr. Michael Merzenich, a leading pioneer in brain plasticity
research and professor emeritus at the University of California at San
Francisco, puts it: “Older people are absolute masters at encouraging
plastic brain change in the wrong direction.”8 You can change your brain
for the better or worse through behaviors and even ways of thinking. Bad
habits have neural maps that reinforce those bad habits. Negative
plasticity, for example, causes changes in neural connections that can
be harmful. Negative thoughts and constant worrying can promote changes
in the brain that are associated with depression and anxiety. Repeated
mental states, where you focus your attention, what you experience, and
how you respond to situations indeed become neural traits. One of
Dr. Merzenich’s often-cited quotes is the following: “The patterns of
activity of neurons in sensory areas can be altered by patterns of
attention. Experience coupled with attention leads to physical changes
in the structure and future functioning of the nervous system. This
leaves us with a clear physiological fact… moment by moment we choose
and sculpt how our ever-changing minds will work. We choose who we will
be in the next moment in a very real sense, and these choices are left
embossed in physical form in our material selves.”9</p>
<p>Secrets of SuperAgers</p>
<p>While it would be great to have the brain of a SuperAger, someone who
has an uncanny ability to maintain a youthful brain well into old age,
most of us didn’t win the genetic lottery. A small, elite group of
people age eighty and older have memories that are as sharp as those of
people twenty to thirty years younger; they show no age-related
shrinkage in the size of the brain networks correlated with memory
ability.10 And their outer cortexes, where memory, attention, and other
thinking abilities take place, are remarkably thick—similar to people in
their fifties. Scientists are trying to uncover their secrets to make us
all SuperAgers, and they are learning it may not be totally genetically
driven. What the science is increasingly showing is that we can have a
huge impact in our brain’s fate with simple lifestyle choices.
SuperAgers often don’t act like old folks. They too keep sharp with good
habits.</p>
<p>HOW TO KEEP A SHARP MIND</p>
<p>Part 2 of this book covers the five pillars of brain health. It’s how
you’ll continue to move your mind in the right direction. You’ll gain a
great understanding about the science behind these pillars and how to
apply them easily in your own life. And for those willing to take the
challenge, I will show you how to take each recommendation up a notch or
two to truly optimize your brain. Not all of the strategies I suggest
will be for everyone, but I trust that I’ve got something for everyone.
I will even give you a program for those who need specific directions.
(I can already hear some of you pleading: Please tell me exactly what to
do and not do.) Finally, I’ll give extra tips for those seeking to
increase productivity, make the most of their time (like how to find a
full extra hour in your day), and break bad habits while becoming the
architect of good ones. At the core of the lesson is the goal: shape a
better life through a sharper brain.</p>
<p>As a primer, here are the five pillars of brain health: Move,
Discover, Relax, Nourish, Connect. These five pillars were first
described by AARP based on the existing scientific evidence that
demonstrated these actions are fundamental to promoting good cognitive
function across the lifespan. I recommend them to you to keep your mind
sharp no matter your age. Here’s what they mean in no particular
order:</p>
<p>Move. This should not come as a surprise. Exercise, both aerobic and
nonaerobic (strength training), is not only good for the body; it’s even
better for the brain. Every day before sitting down to write this book,
I made sure to do something physical. A bike ride, push-ups, a swim, or
a run. If my writing ever starts to drag or not connect the way I want,
I exercise my body as a way of stimulating my mind. Physical exertion,
in fact, has thus far been the only thing we’ve scientifically
documented to improve brain health and function. While we can record
associations between, say, eating a healthy diet and having a healthier
brain, the connection between physical fitness and brain fitness is
clear, direct, and powerful. Movement can increase your brainpower by
helping to increase, repair, and maintain brain cells, and it makes you
more productive and more alert throughout the day. There is a nearly
immediate measurable cause and effect going on that you’ll soon learn
about, and it’s stunning. I have always followed the advice of my
friend, actor and fitness buff Matthew McConaughey: “Just try to break a
sweat every day.”</p>
<p>Discover. A 2014 study from the University of Texas at Dallas tells
us that picking up a new hobby, like painting or digital photography, or
even learning a new piece of software or language can strengthen the
brain.11 Doing something new can even be seeing a 3D movie, joining a
new club, or even using your nondominant hand to brush your teeth. As
part of this conversation, I’ll cover the benefits and pitfalls of brain
training exercises, as well as how to discover your brain’s full
capacity through strategies that heighten attention, focus, and
concentration. I will be asking, “Do you have a strong sense of purpose
in life?” That, too, will be part of the equation.</p>
<p>Relax. Relaxing is not solely a physical thing for the body; your
brain needs to chill out too. Scores of well-designed studies, some of
which we’ll explore in chapter 6, routinely show that poor sleep can
lead to impaired memory and that chronic stress can impair your ability
to learn and adapt to new situations. According to a group of
researchers at MIT, something as commonplace (and stressful) as
multitasking can slow your thinking.12 Stress is particularly
subversive. I’m going to help you find ways to unwind, and it won’t
entail mandatory meditation (though you’re welcome to try it; see
chapter 6). This involves both engaging in stress-reducing activities
and ensuring you achieve restorative sleep on a nightly basis.</p>
<p>Nourish. The link between diet and brain health has long been
anecdotal. But now we finally have evidence to show that consuming
certain foods (e.g., cold-water fish, whole grains, extra virgin olive
oil, nuts and seeds, fibrous whole fruits and vegetables) while limiting
certain other foods (those high in sugar, saturated fat, and trans-fatty
acids) can help avoid memory and brain decline, protect the brain
against disease, and maximize its performance. Eating well is more
important than ever now that we know our diet can affect our brain
health (and overall health too). This conversation extends to the health
of our microbial partners as well. The human gut microbiome—the
trillions of bacteria that make their home inside our intestines—have a
profound role in the health and functioning of our brains, and it turns
out that what we eat contributes to the microbiome’s physiology all the
way up to our brains.</p>
<p>Connect. Okay, so if crossword puzzles get a B- for their ability to
boost brain function, what gets an A? Connecting with others. In person
and face-to-face. A 2015 study, among many others, tells us that having
a diverse social network can improve our brain’s plasticity and help
preserve our cognitive abilities.13 Interacting with others not only
helps reduce stress and boosts our immune system; it can also decrease
our risk of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Get ready to reinvent the way you live. I will make this doable and
practical. Your brain—no, your whole body—will love it.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-the-brain-trust">PART 2 THE BRAIN TRUST</h2>
<p>HOW NOT TO LOSE YOUR MIND</p>
<p>Prevention is the most powerful antidote to illness, and this is
especially true of degenerative maladies like those in the brain and
nervous system. Shockingly, half of adults don’t know the risk factors
for dementia, which makes the disease even more misunderstood and scary.
You can’t prevent something you don’t understand and cannot “see.”</p>
<p>Age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease, and chronological age isn’t something anyone can teach you to
slow down—yet. What we know is that the incidence of Alzheimer’s or
vascular dementia increases exponentially after sixty-five years of age,
nearly doubling every five years.1 By the age of eighty-five and older,
about a third of people have dementia.2 But this doesn’t mean that the
disease takes root during these decades. Among people who are
eighty-five years old, an age at which more than 30 percent have
developed dementia, signs of brain decline began silently when they were
between fifty-five and sixty-five years old. Similarly, the brain health
of the 10 percent or so of people who are sixty-five years old and have
developed dementia started to quietly degenerate when they were between
thirty-five and forty-five years old. In the words of one prominent
neurologist, “Alzheimer’s disease may be more aptly termed a younger and
middle-aged person’s disease.”</p>
<p>We don’t usually think about dementia when we’re entering our prime,
but we should, because it provides a remarkable opportunity. Data from
longitudinal observational studies accumulated over the past few decades
have shown that aside from age, most other risk factors for brain
disease can be controlled. That means you indeed have a powerful voice
in controlling your risk for decline. As you might guess, some of the
most influential and modifiable factors related to that decline are
linked to lifestyle: physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking,
social isolation, poor sleep, lack of mentally stimulating activities,
and misuse of alcohol. Half of Alzheimer’s cases in the United States
alone could be caused or worsened by a combination of these bad habits.
High blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol, especially
at midlife, substantially increase the chances of developing dementia
later—sometimes decades down the road. Prevention should start early,
but to make it count, you need a strategy. It has to be something you
can easily incorporate into your life. In Part 2, I’ll give you a
library of tools to adapt now that will tremendously increase the
chances you can be sharp for as long as you live. These tools reflect
the five pillars of preserving your brain health and function and
culminate in a tailored twelve-week program.</p>
<p>I will also explain why these various factors have an impact on your
brain so you can best understand and visualize the benefit you are
getting by applying my ideas to stay sharp. Think of them as your own
personal brain trust. The best part is that they are all well within
your reach.</p>
