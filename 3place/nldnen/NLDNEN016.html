<h4 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>The Bright Future</p>
<p>The future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long
before it happens.</p>
<p>RAINER MARIA RILKE</p>
<p>I promised that I’d end this book on an optimistic high note. In the
time that has passed since I wrote these words and you’re reading this
sentence, thousands of headlines will have been published with the word
Alzheimer’s. There is no shortage of enthusiasm and drive to find better
treatments, perhaps a cure. In 2019, the possibility of a vaccine once
again burst onto the scene after scientists at the University of New
Mexico reported on their experiments of inoculating mice with a
virus-like particle designed to target tau protein. The mice developed
antibodies that removed the abnormal tau protein from the part of the
brain associated with learning and memory. Will it work in humans and
have antidementia effects? It remains to be proven.</p>
<p>Another team of scientists is hard at work with so-called endobody
vaccines—vaccines that prime the immune system to deal with
malfunctioning internal parts of the body that it would otherwise
ignore. These work differently from the typical vaccine that prepares
the body’s immune system to fight off diseases that come from the
external world, such as flu or measles, which are caused by bacteria or
viruses entering the blood. The endobody vaccines essentially provoke an
antibody response in the body that clears the tangled beta-amyloid
plaques without triggering damaging inflammation. Clinical trials are
underway to see if this vaccine will have an impact on cognition and
memory, but it will probably take years before results are in. And yet
another group, this one out of Yale University, has suggested that a
“drinkable cocktail of designer molecules” can restore memories in mice
engineered to have a condition similar to Alzheimer’s disease. Science
fiction or a potential therapy? Future research will answer this
question. Future research will also help us put an end to a range of
illnesses linked to the brain, from mental disorders such as depression,
anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia to neurodegenerative
maladies such as Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou
Gehrig’s disease. Although each of these illnesses is unique, my hunch
is that breakthroughs in treating or curing one ailment will inform
other areas of brain science. What we learn from studying depression,
for example, may help us better understand Alzheimer’s disease. There
are lots of surprising intersections in medicine. We just need to find
them.</p>
<p>I’m excited for what the future will bring us in our understanding
and treatment of diseases as complex as Alzheimer’s and other forms of
dementia. Even that word, dementia, may one day be forgotten. With new
therapies on the horizon, I don’t think it will be fair to label anyone
with “dementia” if they can go on to live a life with an ailment that is
kept at bay. Our entire vocabulary and the narrative around degenerative
brain diseases will change with promising new preventive solutions and
treatments for symptoms. Preventing and treating brain ailments will not
be reduced to a single action, but will entail a multipronged approach.
The solutions will probably encompass an array of things, from
modifiable lifestyle strategies and daily habits to medications and gene
therapies.</p>
<p>I hope that I’ve given you a lot to think about and do in pursuit of
a vibrant brain. My teenaged kids will probably be among the first of
many generations to come who will push the limits of human
longevity—living long and sharply into their nineties and beyond. With
the dawn of personalized medicine upon us and the explosion of new drugs
and therapies that can revolutionize and democratize medicine, we’re on
the precipice of a new era in our evolution as a species. The pace of
change will only grow faster. Imagine a retinal scan through your
smartphone or iPad that tells you which mix of molecules or biologics
will clear your brain of suspicious proteins, restore synapses, and
heighten cognition. Or picture a drone delivering the right therapy to
the right person at the right time that will enhance the brain’s
processing speed without side effects. We will soon be able to peer into
our brains and see where a problem is developing while we are armed with
small molecules or natural plants to help address that problem. I am
convinced that we have created many of the problems that plague us, and
this presents an opportunity. There will always be a place for good
old-fashioned habits like eating more vegetables and working out
regularly. But those time-tested habits coupled with what’s in store for
us tomorrow will ultimately make for the best life—one that we will want
to remember and will be able to remember. Keep sharp.</p>
