11 Navigating the Path Forward Financially and Emotionally, with a
Special Note to Caregivers</h4>
<p>From caring comes courage.</p>
<p>LAO TZU</p>
<p>While working on this book, I was struck by how challenging it is for
families to navigate the best way to care for their newly diagnosed
loved one. Sadly, I realized that some families often stopped talking
about their family members with cognitive impairment and became
conflicted by the idea of putting the person into an extended-care
facility. Concerns about affording such care are mixed with worries
about the quality of care they’d receive. The average cost for a
semiprivate room in a nursing home in the United States is over ,000 per
month and about ,000 for a private room.1 For people with severe memory
issues who need extra care and attention, the costs are even higher.
One-bedroom units in assisted living facilities can be a little less
expensive, but with fewer staff and skimpier training they may be less
than ideal, especially for people with Alzheimer’s disease or related
dementias. There are superb facilities and excellent staff providing
high-quality care to people living with dementia in long-term care
facilities every day all across the country. But even if you can afford
the prices, there are significant problems in many long-term facilities.
In recent years, I have reported on bad apples in the assisted living
industry, which is sorely underregulated, leaving some residents in
unsafe environments with inadequate care. Worse, some residents are
mistreated and abused. This includes facilities that are marketed as
specializing in memory or dementia care. Construction of memory care
units in assisted living facilities is the fastest-growing segment of
senior care. For all of these reasons, the place I will tell you about
in the next section is perhaps the most extraordinary of all my
journeys.</p>
<p>As someone who has traveled to more than a hundred countries around
the world, there is a question I often get: Which of all those places
has been the most remarkable and why? My mind quickly scans through war
zones, natural disasters, outbreaks, and other scenes where I have
witnessed terrible human suffering soon followed by heroic stories of
people rising to the situation and doing their new life’s work in
incredible ways. For them, it is true that necessity is the mother of
invention, and the stories of families dealing with dementia are no
different.</p>
<p>IT TAKES A VILLAGE</p>
<p>Within the city of Weesp, just minutes outside Netherlands’ capital
city of Amsterdam, is a gated model village known as De Hogeweyk (a
“weyk” refers to a group of houses similar to a village). It was first
described to me as a place where a grand experiment has been taking
place for over a decade that could fundamentally change the way patients
with advanced dementia live out the rest of their lives. The media are
rarely allowed inside. I was fortunate to be invited by the founders a
few years ago to see it for myself.</p>
<p>The idea for the facility started when two Dutch women, who had both
worked in traditional extended care facilities themselves, had a candid
conversation about the prospect of their own parents developing dementia
and being placed in a conventional nursing home care setting. They
thought how jarring it would be to not only lose your memory but to also
lose your sense of home and place at the same time. After all, a
traditional nursing home is a completely foreign setting with nothing to
help ground patients and allow them to have roots. This line of thinking
brought them an idea. Their audacious goal was to normalize extended
care facilities so that the people living there could experience their
lives in a way that felt easy and familiar. The result was Hogeweyk,
which was primarily funded by the Dutch government for slightly more
than 5 million. This four-acre gated community, which opened in 2009,
has been dubbed “Dementia Village,” but that sounds a lot worse than
what I’m about to describe. Try and visualize it in the following few
paragraphs. Let it capture your imagination, as it did mine.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that there is only one way in and one
way out. A single pair of sliding glass doors separates Hogeweyk from
the outside world, and this is the only place you will find security
guards. As you walk into this beautiful Netherlands village, you see the
famous Dutch tulips wrapping around bubbling fountains. It feels a bit
like a beautiful midwestern college campus with its own amalgamation of
streets, squares, dormitories, cafés, street musicians, and theaters.
But while college campuses cater to young students, Hogeweyk is
strategically designed to meet the needs of those with profound memory
loss in their final years of life. And to do that, this facility is very
much created to look like the outside world, including restaurants and
salons.</p>
<p>Each of the twenty-three two-story dormitory-style homes is stylized
to resemble different lifestyle categories to match people’s interests
and backgrounds. For those who come from the upper classes (Goois), for
example, there is a housing option with an aristocratic Dutch feel to it
in its decor and amenities; the residents often like to attend classical
concerts and enjoy high tea. Other choices include housing for people
who share Indonesian ancestry or whose religious practices are a
priority and who attend services regularly. Residents who had once
worked in professional disciplines such as engineering, medicine, or law
are grouped together in a unit. The same is true for people who were
once artists or carpenters or plumbers. The aim is to place residents in
environments where they can live close to people who are likely to have
similar past experiences. Each household of six to seven residents
manages itself, including cooking and washing, with a staff. The
caregivers and house attendants, who collectively outnumber the
residents two to one, even use an in-house currency to help their
residents “buy” groceries at the fully functional supermarket (though no
real currency is exchanged in the village; everything is included).</p>
<p>Outside, there are plenty of gardens and communal places where people
are encouraged to move, congregate, and embrace the outdoors rather than
stay in their rooms. The focus here is on what residents can do rather
than not do, and this place has become a pioneering model for
specialized elder care. Experts in elder care have been coming here from
around the world to get a glimpse of what growing old with an ailing
brain can look like in a vibrant community rather than a depressing,
isolating, and lifeless institution. Life is alive here with a variety
of social clubs and events, bingo nights, theater events, and even a
pub.</p>
<p>As normal as it looks, subtle reminders are everywhere about the
tremendous level of planning required to care for an entire village of
residents with serious cognitive decline. For example, because wandering
is a significant concern, the village is highly secure, with cameras
monitoring residents every hour of every day. The elevators are
controlled by motion sensors and when someone gets in, it automatically
takes that person to the next level. Everyone who works in the village,
including the barbers, waiters in restaurants, and clerks at the grocery
store or post office, is a trained medical professional—geriatric nurses
and specialists—whose primary mission is to provide care far beyond
what’s typically found in a traditional medical facility. That’s what
sets this place apart from the average nursing home, with its
nondescript buildings, anonymous wards, lots of white coats, nonstop
television, and plenty of sedating medications. Here, there are no
wards, long hallways, or corridors. The intention is to give people a
sense of intimacy even if they no longer have an understanding of what’s
happening around them or in the world itself. Friends and family are
encouraged to visit, and people who live in Hogeweyk’s surrounding
neighborhoods are all welcome to come in and enjoy some of the
facilities, such as the café-restaurant, bar, and theater. This is an
important goal because all too often, friends and family members fade
away when someone is diagnosed with dementia. It can be an isolating
disease and the isolation itself can worsen the prognosis. Keeping
patients engaged and socially active is important.</p>
<p>The residents may not necessarily know where they are, but they feel
that they are at home—and that is precisely the idea. At Hogeweyk, if
someone reaches that single doorway to the outside, a staff member will
often say that it’s broken. I watched as residents simply turned around
and walked back in the other direction. No one is trying to “escape,”
staff tell me; “they are merely confused.” Over time, the residents of
Hogeweyk consume fewer sedating medications, have a better appetite,
appear more joyful, and live longer than those in standard elder care
facilities.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking: This is straight out of the movie The
Truman Show where a man played by Jim Carrey discovers his entire life
is a TV program. Everything he thinks is real is a mirage, created by
television producers. So I had to ask the cofounder of Hogeweyk, Yvonne
van Amerongen, if this setup is somehow fooling or duping its residents.
She was quick to respond: “Why should they feel they are fooled? We have
a society here.… We want to help people enjoy life and feel that they
are welcome here on this earth.” It was one of the most humane things I
had heard, allowing people to retain their dignity even as the end is
near. Yvonne recalled that when her father had died suddenly of a heart
attack several years prior, one of the first things that went through
her mind was, Thank God he never had to be in a nursing home. That
became part of her inspiration for Hogeweyk.</p>
<p>When people move to Hogeweyk, their families know this will be their
last stop. Residents will be watched over and comforted until they die,
which is typically about three to three and a half years after they
enter. Only then does a spot open up for a new resident to enter the
village. The Dutch health care system makes Hogeweyk possible; it
receives the same funding as any other nursing home in the country. (The
cost of care is nearly ,000 per month, but the Dutch government
subsidizes residents to varying degrees. Everyone gets a private room,
and the amount each family pays is based on income, but it never exceeds
,600. It has been operating at full capacity since it opened.)</p>
<p>The staff at Hogeweyk count on the different ways dementia touches
the brain to keep that brain engaged. For instance, the part of the
brain that equips us with musical talents, including recalling words and
placing them to a tune, functions the longest. One couple I met and
spent a lot of time with was Ben and Ada. Throughout their marriage of
sixty-odd years, they enjoyed making music together as a pastime. Ada
would play the piano and Ben would sing. But since Ben developed
Alzheimer’s disease, their communication inevitably began to falter.
Eventually Ben could no longer carry on a conversation. Now a resident
of Hogeweyk, Ben relies on music to connect with his wife. I watched as
Ada played the piano, and Ben, who came across as an incredibly quiet
man when I first met him, suddenly started singing along to some
traditional Dutch music. It was a beautiful, magical thing to see, and
it helped cushion the blow Ada felt when she left Ben at the end of each
day. In her words, “We can’t talk anymore about everything, but with
singing… you can make a good concert together. For me, that’s very
important.”</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons I learned at Hogeweyk is to resist
the urge to correct someone with dementia. The toughest conversation I
had while visiting was with a resident named Jo. At nearly ninety years
old, she was charming and animated, with a smile that warmed the entire
room. But she still thought she held a daily job and yet couldn’t recall
what that job was. “Tomorrow,” she said to me, “I’ll know it, and I’ll
have to go to it.” She also thought that her parents were still alive
and that she’d seen them the day before. When I turned to the resident
social worker for help in responding to Jo, the social worker told me
that how one responds to such confusion depends on the phase of
dementia. In the earlier phases, you can challenge them with a question
like “Well, how old are you?” And if they say “I’m eighty-four,” you
respond, “How old would your parents be?” The person might figure it out
and say, “Oh, that doesn’t make sense.” But what you never want to do is
correct people with dementia. If they are asking for dinner, for
instance, and they’ve just had dinner but don’t recall the experience,
you don’t deny them. Instead you might ask if they are hungry without
forcing them to recall an experience that is no longer retrievable in
their brain.</p>
<p>I noticed a lot of hand-holding between couples, one of whom is
fading while the other is holding on. One pair I met, Corrie and Theo,
seemed to communicate through their hand-holding. Theo, the healthier of
the two, told me that Corrie squeezes his hand whenever she sees
something or feels something familiar. They spend the whole day in a
clasp, and according to Theo, his marriage is the best it’s been in
nearly sixty years.</p>
<p>I left Hogeweyk wondering: Could this work in other parts of the
world? What would this look like in the United States?</p>
<p>BRACE YOURSELF</p>
<p>The majority of people with dementia in the United States live in
their home, and for approximately 75 percent of these individuals,
family and friends provide their care.2 The largest proportion of those
caregivers are spouses, followed by children and children-in-law, mostly
women. The typical profile of a dementia caregiver is a middle-aged or
older female child or spouse of the person with dementia. At least 60
percent of unpaid caregivers are wives, daughters, daughters-in-law,
granddaughters, and other female relatives. All told, roughly 60 million
Americans are caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease. That’s more
than twice the number of people living in Texas.</p>
<p>Maria Shriver told it to me straight when I spoke with her about
dealing with a loved one’s future once the diagnosis is in: “Brace
yourself. Take care of yourself. I see a lot of women who have kids and
are taking care of a parent, too. They are stressed out, desperate,
crying. You have to talk to other family members and get help.
Alzheimer’s is such an emotional, and financial, and physical journey.
No one can do this alone.” Maria has walked this path before; her
father, Sargent Shriver, was diagnosed with the disease in 2003 when she
knew little about it. She helped him get through the disease’s process
until he died eight years later. The experience galvanized her into
becoming one of the world’s most vocal advocates for research into not
just Alzheimer’s disease but brain health, with a focus on women. She
has since established the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement and has
championed many brain-health projects—from award-winning documentaries
to collaborations with top scientists—to spread knowledge about the
disease’s challenges and to lend support to families. She called me back
right away when I left word for her that I was writing this book.
“Anyone with a brain needs to be thinking about the possibility of
Alzheimer’s disease,” she started off saying, going on to stress the
importance of prevention and delay. And as she so often does, Maria
pointed out something I hadn’t considered before: a glaring
contradiction when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease in the United States.
While women are most likely to be the caregivers, they are also much
more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease themselves: Almost two-thirds
of Americans with Alzheimer’s are women, and a woman’s estimated
lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s at age sixty-five is 1 in 6
(compared to 1 in 11 for breast cancer).3 On top of that, there is a
medical research gender gap, meaning that women are less likely to be
enrolled in clinical trials despite being significantly more affected by
the disease.</p>
<p>For a long time, it was incorrectly thought that women developed
Alzheimer’s more often than their male counterparts simply because they
lived longer. But new research shows a complex set of circumstances to
explain this discrepancy between men and women that includes differences
in biology as well as how diagnoses are made. For example, given the
correlation of early dementia symptoms with perimenopause, researchers
have wondered about the protective or destructive effects of estrogen
and progesterone. More recently, studies have shown that the telltale
tau protein is already more diffusely spread throughout a woman’s brain
in the early stages of Alzheimer’s as compared to a man. That suggests
that Alzheimer’s disease may affect more areas of the brain in women.
From a diagnostic perspective, women tend to perform better on tests of
verbal memory during the early and midstages of Alzheimer’s, making them
more likely to be diagnosed only in the later stages of the disease.
There are probably clues to the diagnosis and future treatment of
Alzheimer’s that lay in these gender differences between men and women,
and we haven’t explored that nearly enough, as Maria told me. I also
spoke to Maria a great deal about the difficulty of caring for a parent
as well as children, a reality for so many new caregivers. One thing
became clear in my conversations with both experts and people currently
immersed in the care of someone with Alzheimer’s: Every day feels like a
desperate scramble to stay in control.</p>
<p>There is a lack of consistency with treatment plans, coverage, and
support. Unfortunately, there are not many Hogeweyk-like communities for
dementia patients here, although there may be sometime soon. (The
closest thing I found is the Glenner Town Square in Southern California
that is an Alzheimer’s-friendly facility reminiscent of the 1950s, but
it serves only as a day care center. I expect more facilities based on
the village-like model and specializing in memory care to crop up in the
future.) Most families in the United States struggle to find the right
care—and the money to pay for it. The best estimate is that more than 15
million people have someone with Alzheimer’s in their family, a number
that will continue to grow. The caregivers for someone with Alzheimer’s
provide an estimated 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care annually.
Out-of-pocket costs for Americans with Alzheimer’s or other types of
dementia are much higher, on average, than for those without. Dementia
caregivers spend an average of 0,697 annually out of their own pockets,
more than twice the amount spent by caregivers of people without
dementia.4 It is safe to say that advanced dementia is arguably one of
the most destabilizing afflictions to a family’s emotional and financial
health.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what’s worse: the financial or the emotional
toll that caring for an individual with dementia costs. If the diagnosis
came in for me, I’d immediately worry about my family and their
well-being as they try to help me through the illness. I have learned
this over the past couple of years of working on this book. The
diagnosis is life changing and leads to many immediate questions. What
will this mean for me and my family? How do I plan for the future? Where
can I get the help I need? How will I pay for it all? Who will be in
charge? What happens when I can’t make any decisions anymore? Will there
be any assets left for my children?</p>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Association maintains a wealth of useful information
for both people living with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers. And it’s
all free, including a 24/7 hotline: 800-272-3900, and a website:
www.alz.org. AARP (www.aarp.org/disruptdementia), and the Global Council
on Brain Health (www.aarp.org/gcbh) also maintain lots of free
information to answer critical questions about dementia and brain
health. AARP maintains a caregiver’s hotline from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00
p.m. ET at 1-877-333-5885. The support line is also available in
Spanish, at 1-888-971-2013. AARP’s online caregiving community is a
place where caregivers can join, for free, to talk with other caregivers
and get answers from experts in the community. Check out AARP’s
Caregiving Resource Center (www.aarp.org/caregiving).</p>
<p>Here are a few things I would nail down as soon as possible after a
diagnosis. Some are obvious, and others are less intuitive, but based on
conversations with caregivers who told me the things they wish they had
known:</p>
<p>Where to find support and education programs in your local area. It’s
vital to have a good support network for advice, encouragement, and
knowledge. You need to know what to expect and how to prepare to meet
the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>Where to find early-stage social engagement programs. These are
programs that help people in the early stages of the disease stay
connected and active. A diagnosis does not mean a person disengages from
life and is destined to be confined to a lounge chair in the living room
or in a facility. Adult day health care centers that specialize in
serving people with dementia are cropping up in many cities. Programs
that include cognitive rehabilitation therapy should also be considered.
These offer a wide range of therapies provided by trained professionals
that help people relearn skills they have lost through traumatic brain
injuries or the cognitive decline seen in dementia. New research shows
that cognitive rehab may be able to teach people to compensate for
memory and thinking shortfalls that happen in the early stages. Remember
that what you do during those early stages may have a significant impact
on how fast the disease progresses. And the diagnosis does not mean you
stop learning new things. Some people thrive for a long time and can
even continue to live independently with the right support in place.</p>
<p>Where to find clinical trials matching your needs. These studies will
help you become part of important research, but they may also slow the
progression of the disease. There is no guarantee with any clinical
study that you’ll find a helpful treatment, let alone a cure, but rarely
will there be downsides to participating.</p>
<p>How to keep a home safe. People in the early stages often lead an
independent life, but there will be preparations and hard choices to
make, such as no more driving and walking outside alone. At some point,
a person with progressing dementia will need help with daily tasks such
as managing money and paying bills, shopping and cooking, general
housework, and personal tasks like grooming, dressing, bathing,
toileting, and taking medication. Eventually, the home, no matter how
many safety features have been set up, may not be the ideal place to
stay. Where will you go? AARP’s book Wise Moves can help you choose
among the options.</p>
<p>How to make a legal plan. This includes taking inventory of the
family’s legal documents—wills and trusts. If none are in place, a
family or estate attorney can help draft and execute these important
documents, which include things like durable power of attorney
(designating who can make financial and other decisions when someone is
no longer able) and durable power of attorney for health care
(designating who can make health care decisions when someone is no
longer able). They are valid even after the person is no longer able to
make decisions. These documents tend to be lengthy and detailed, and
they specify some of the most practical but difficult decisions that
will eventually be faced, such as care facilities, types of treatment,
end-of-life care decisions (e.g., do you want feeding tubes?), and DNR
(do not resuscitate) orders. These are important decisions to make
because without instructions in place, expensive medical interventions
are often routinely performed even if they are futile in extending life.
One young woman told me about her own mother, “Life itself quickly
became a transactional physical and financial death spiral devoid of
emotion.” Think of it this way: You’ve worked hard your entire life to
build a little wealth and have something to leave to others. But if you
don’t plan, all of those assets can vanish because of the costs incurred
during the last part of your life.</p>
<p>How to make a financial plan. This part of the process can be
daunting and will have some crossover with legal planning. You’ll want
to organize assets, debts, insurance policies, and existing benefits
like Medicare, retirement, and Social Security. The Financial and Legal
Document Worksheet on the Alzheimer’s Association’s website can help you
in your inventory. As part of this exercise, you’ll also want to
identify the cost of care going forward—from basics like ongoing medical
treatment and prescription drugs to adult day services, in-home care
services, full-time residential care services, and the prospect of
moving to a facility that specializes in end-stage Alzheimer’s. There
will be many options to explore. If this part of the planning feels
overwhelming and uncomfortable or you’re dealing with a complex family
estate, it helps to bring in a financial advisor who is qualified (and
licensed and certified) to be your guide. Be sure to choose this person
carefully—preferably someone who has gone down this path with many
families and is knowledgeable about eldercare and long-term care
planning. The Alzheimer’s Association provides leads and links to
directories on its website for finding this important person if you
don’t already have someone on board or in mind. Another good resource is
AARP’s Checklist for My Family: A Guide to My History, Financial Plans,
and Final Wishes.</p>
<p>How to build a care team. No one can walk this road alone. In
addition to family, your friends, neighbors, and health care
professionals are all part of your team. Volunteers in your community
can also be part of this team. The sooner you identify and develop your
care team upon diagnosis, the better. These conversations can be
challenging, especially when you are not quite ready to share your
diagnosis widely. Over and over again, though, experts tell me that
having these people in your inner circle early on will allow you to live
as full of a life as possible and for as long as possible. Again, choose
these people wisely!</p>
<p>Q: I was told to get an advance directive. What is that?</p>
<p>A: Advance directives are legal documents that allow people to
document their wishes regarding treatment and care, including
end-of-life preferences. They include a living will that dictates how
you’d want your end-of-life care to go and who will be in charge, or
your durable power of attorney for health care. Fewer than 30 percent of
American adults have signed advance directives stating their health care
wishes. Here is why this is so important. Forgoing these documents can
be financially ruinous to families—triggering unexpected medical bills
and bankruptcies to loved ones left to deal with the financial
aftermath. When a person does not have an advance directive, the costs
can skyrocket. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality, one-quarter of all Medicare spending annually—39 billion—each
year goes toward care for just 5 percent of beneficiaries at the end of
life.5 Put another way, 25 percent of Medicare’s annual spending is used
by 5 percent of patients during the last twelve months of their lives.
Advance directives also can help to avoid unwanted, ineffective medical
interventions that can cause so much anguish for loved ones. The data is
alarming: Spouses are twice as likely to prematurely die after their
partner’s death if end-of-life care is not planned.6 How so? I strongly
believe it’s the stress. When we think about the costs of dealing with
dementia, we forget about the costs that don’t come with dollar signs:
Nearly 60 percent of those caring for family members with Alzheimer’s or
other dementias report “high” or “very high” emotional stress.</p>
<p>Q: I don’t have a large estate so I don’t need a trust, do I? Aren’t
those for rich people?</p>
<p>A: Anyone who owns property and assets—from a house to bank
accounts—should have a will or trust in place; these are not documents
only for the super wealthy. If you have substantial assets, ideally you
set up what’s called a living trust while you are still alive that pools
all of your assets into one entity, the trust, so your family can avoid
the long and often costly probate process the courts use to distribute
your assets after your death. In setting up a trust, you make
instructions about how you’d like your assets to be handled once you are
no longer able to manage your affairs, and you name a trustee to follow
those instructions, with a backup successor trustee as well. Living
trusts and wills often get drafted together as a package. The costs of
not having these documents in place before you die depend on the state
in which you live. But in some states, dying without a will (intestate)
and trust can be devastating to your beneficiaries—and your legacy. A
large estate can be wiped out by the probate process, lawyers, and
bickering family members who don’t agree on how to divide your
assets.</p>
<p>KEEP TALKING</p>
<p>To be clear, everyone should complete these documents, not just those
worried about dementia. When Nancy’s father passed without a will or
trust in place, she and her siblings fought to figure out how to take
care of their mother, who was in the middle stages of Alzheimer’s and
could not live independently or make decisions for herself (what’s
technically called lacking “legal capacity”). No plans had been set and
no one could agree on the best steps forward for their mother’s sake.
One sibling thought their mom should be placed in an assisted living
facility that catered to people with dementia. Another strongly believed
she should stay in the home at whatever cost and hire around-the-clock
care when necessary. The third daughter had mixed feelings about all the
options and could not take sides. The debate grew bitter and prolonged
while their mother suffered. Eventually one of the siblings filed a
petition with the court asking for a conservator to come in and act as a
leader. This is not common, but when families cannot agree about how to
handle an individual’s legal, financial, or health care decisions, the
courts can get involved. In some states, a conservator is called a
guardian.</p>
<p>Conservatorships are not typically ideal solutions. They involve
court proceedings, additional costs, and lawyers, and you or your family
members may lose control, not even getting to choose who becomes the
conservator and how things get decided in the future. Every state has
different laws that govern this area of family law, but it tends to be
riddled with problems and a general lack of oversight that may allow for
unscrupulous behavior among conservators. According to fiduciary
watchdogs and family lawyers who attend conservatorship proceedings,
people who are cognitively incapacitated and have warring family members
are extremely vulnerable. In many cases throughout the country, large
estates have been drained by this system and elders with dementia are
preyed on and financially abused. Indeed, a conservator is supposed to
“conserve” an estate and protect the individual; the same goes for
guardians, as they are named in some states. But conservators and
guardians can hold so much power that they not only make all the
decisions when it comes to an individual’s health care and well-being,
but they can decide the fate of assets, property, and even where the
person lives—without the family’s input or wishes. Conservators and
guardians often are granted trustee status, too, further extending their
power. Once a conservator or guardian is attached to an estate, it can
be incredibly difficult to end or object to the conservatorship or
guardianship without arduous and expensive court hearings. These
proceedings in general are emotionally exhausting and can be grueling
for family members who are already under the stress of having to deal
with each other’s quarrels and a loved one’s dementia.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid a court-appointed conservator or guardian is to
have open communication with family members early and often. Make this a
priority; do it as soon as you finish reading this book. Have your will
or trust prepared. I realize that communication can be tough in some
families, and a diagnosis of dementia complicates matters, but it’s
essential. Plan a family meeting and bring in a trusted family friend if
that helps for extra support. This might require multiple family
meetings and that’s okay. If everyone cannot attend the meeting in
person, use tools like voice-over IP or Skype to make sure everyone can
be included.</p>
<p>THE INVISIBLE SECOND PATIENT</p>
<p>Here is a statistic that I initially found hard to believe:
Caregivers of spouses with dementia are up to six times more likely to
develop dementia than people in the general population.7 In fact, anyone
who helps care for a loved one with dementia has a higher risk of
developing the ailment. These people are called the “invisible second
patients.” It seems ironic and cruel, but it makes sense if you consider
the dynamic. The spouse caregiver has been, on average, married for
thirty years, and there is now a significant upheaval in the couple’s
shared life. On top of that are increased stress, loneliness,
depression, and inactivity. Their devotion to such care often means a
trade for a lower quality of life. And as I heard many times, the
emotional effects of witnessing the disease progress despite your care
and support creates a sense of profound helplessness.</p>
<p>We hear about toxic stress in the media daily and its biological
effects in the body—from the destructive slow boil of chronic
inflammation to increased stress hormones like cortisol that inflict
biological harm over time. I have reported on the ills of toxic stress
in America, mostly among communities where economic divides run deep due
to income inequalities and a lack of general optimism about the future.
This high-anxiety state can result in drug dependence, suicide, and a
heightened risk of dying from illnesses like cardiovascular disease or
stroke. But we don’t think about the same toxic stress experienced by
caregivers who often suffer similar emotional and physical consequences.
The biological reasons for their elevated risk of developing dementia
are partly the same: Chronic inflammation ravages the body and reaches
the brain. In fact, caregivers are at increased risk not only for
dementia but also for any ailment tied to chronic inflammation, which is
every degenerative disease we know of today, from heart disease to
cancer.</p>
<p>When we think of dementia, we typically envision some variation of
“forgetfulness disorder” in our heads. We don’t often consider the other
symptoms that often come with dementia and can be excruciatingly hard to
manage, particularly for the caregivers. These include anger, agitation,
mood changes, hallucinations, apathy, sleep disturbances, incontinence,
and wandering. These challenging dementia-related symptoms, in fact, are
some of the leading reasons people are placed in assisted living
facilities or nursing homes. It becomes too hard and stressful to care
for them. Those of us who are parents can vividly remember the sleepless
days of having an infant in the house who has yet to maintain a regular
sleep schedule. But we know those days are numbered, and soon enough our
babies will be toddlers with stable sleeping patterns. Now imagine what
it’s like to be responsible for an adult who no longer maintains a
constant, reliable sleeping schedule. She sleeps randomly throughout the
day and night, sometimes waking every couple of hours when everyone else
in the house is asleep. Add to that troubles with eating, using the
bathroom, and walking (incontinence is another leading reason people are
placed in nursing homes). And her personality can morph with the
disease. Someone who was mean can become, after developing dementia,
gentle and sweet. Someone who was once loving, easygoing, and fun to be
around can become increasingly cantankerous, combative, lacking in
social graces, and likely to have unpredictable outbursts. Caregivers
can feel like they are walking on eggshells and don’t know what they
will encounter when they walk into the room to see their loved one.
These behaviors can get worse with time, and with patients who wander at
night or act out hallucinations, the situation can quickly become
intolerable and untenable. Unfortunately, there’s no way to predict who
will experience these challenging behaviors and symptoms, which can
change depending on the stage of the disease process, the situation, and
what area of the person’s brain is most affected by the illness.</p>
<p>In the early stages, when a person’s cognition is only mildly
impaired but the person has awareness of what is happening, anxiety,
anger, aggression, and mild depression can occur. As many as 20 percent
of individuals with Alzheimer’s will experience increased confusion,
anxiety, restlessness, and agitation beginning late in the day. This is
called sundowning or sundowner’s syndrome. Later in the disease, once
the dementia renders someone less aware of his mood shifts, paranoia,
delusions, and hallucinations can set in. There are no effective
treatments for these kinds of symptoms, and antipsychotic drugs are
sometimes associated with an increased risk of death in people with
dementia. While there is always great interest in developing effective
treatments for the disease itself, there is also hope that research will
generate better strategies to help combat these most devastating
symptoms with safer drugs or even drug-free approaches. For example,
promising research is underway to look at using the effect that light
has on the body’s sleep-wake cycles. The thinking is that improving the
sleep patterns of dementia patients could significantly improve their
mood and behavior.</p>
<p>Q: My mother is delusional and hallucinating. She accuses me of all
sorts of things, from stealing to killing people. Is this normal? What
do I do?</p>
<p>A: In the middle to late stages of Alzheimer’s, delusions and
hallucinations can occur. These are not the same thing. Delusions are
firmly held beliefs that are not real, such as a suspicious delusion
that someone is stealing possessions. This is sometimes called a
paranoia. Hallucinations are false perceptions of events or objects that
are sensory in nature. This is when an Alzheimer’s patient sees, smells,
tastes, hears, or feels something that is not there. A caregiver who
encounters either delusional thinking or hallucinations in a person with
Alzheimer’s should document the specific behavior as much as possible to
share with the doctor. Witnessing these experiences can be deeply
troubling, and sometimes the patient can act out in ways that hint at
self-harm or caregiver harm. There may be some treatment options to
consider at this juncture, depending on the specific symptoms and the
stage of dementia.</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET YOURSELF: A NOTE FOR CAREGIVERS</p>
<p>Taking care of a loved one with dementia needs to be a team effort
with family members and friends. But for the person who takes on the
role of primary caregiver (and there always is one), it’s crucially
important that he or she prioritize self-care in addition to the care of
the patient. This means staying on top of your own diet and exercise
routines, engaging in activities that boost your well-being, spending
time with friends and family, and taking breaks from your caregiving
duties—breaks throughout the day (even just five minutes) and longer
breaks throughout the weeks and months with certain days and weekends
off. The program I outlined in part 2 is designed for all of us—whether
we are already caring for someone, awaiting a diagnosis in a loved one,
or headed toward serious cognitive decline ourselves. Put yourself on
your to-do list.</p>
<p>If you’re a caregiver who also maintains a full- or part-time job, be
extra cautious about your time, energy, emotions, and personal needs.
You are at a high risk for burnout, but not for reasons you may think.
Caregiver burnout is caused less by the rigorous responsibilities of the
jobs themselves and more by the fact you tend to neglect your own
emotional, physical, and spiritual health. To repeat, put yourself on
your to-do list. Listen to any symptoms you develop and pay attention to
them. While things may seem okay at the start of your dual duties, you
can’t know for sure how long you will have to wear both hats. This can
be a long and punishing road, leading to further neglect of self-care.
By the time most caregivers are burned out, they are sick
themselves.</p>
<p>Don’t be ashamed to recruit help for yourself and your loved one.
Again, talk to your siblings and anyone else in your circle who can
assist you. I’ve witnessed too many people wait far too long to ask for
help, and they wind up with serious health problems of their own that
can be just as devastating—or more so—as their partner’s dementia. In
one tragic instance, the wife died of a fatal heart attack while caring
for her husband as he deteriorated with a difficult form of dementia.
She was trying to do everything on her own, not wanting to “burden” or
“bother” anyone else. I wonder if she’d still be alive today had she
gotten more help and been able to take better care of herself.</p>
<p>Family caregivers are motivated to provide care for any number of
reasons—from a sense of love or reciprocity to a sense of guilt or duty.
It may be helpful to identify your specific motivation so it can serve
as a reminder when things are particularly challenging. There are social
pressures and cultural norms to meet. In rare instances, greed can be a
motivator, but that is not common. Many people tell me that caring for a
loved one at this time in life can be incredibly fulfilling on a
spiritual level. It comes as no surprise, however, that caregivers who
are motivated by the negative forces—duty, guilt, or social pressure—are
more likely to resent their role and suffer greater psychological
distress than those who are motivated by positive incentives. And those
who identify more with beneficial components of their role experience
less burden, better health and relationships, a more gratifying
experience, and greater social support.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things a caregiver faces, at least in the
beginning, is denial. And that’s totally normal. It’s not easy learning
that a parent, partner, or other family member has a disease as scary
and fateful as Alzheimer’s. We don’t get this kind of preparation in
formal schooling. Even in medical school, I wasn’t taught the
fundamentals of dealing with the psychological aspect to hearing about a
family member’s grim diagnosis. I’ve learned a lot through my years as a
practicing physician and talking to families who are grappling with a
difficult prognosis, and I have dealt with it personally with my parents
and a grandparent. It is always hard. The diagnosis can seem
unbelievable, impossible to accept. Your life is probably already
overscheduled with responsibilities, and then you add something that
requires almost another full-time commitment. It’s no surprise that
denial in the short term can actually be a healthy coping mechanism, as
it provides time to get used to the new reality and let circumstances
sink in. But you can’t stay in denial forever, especially when there are
decisions and plans to make. If you cannot come to terms with the
diagnosis, talk to someone and seek professional help from a therapist.
Diagnoses like these can be incredibly disruptive to self-confidence as
well, and a therapist can help you reframe your thoughts a certain way
to regain the confidence that you’ll need to move forward.</p>
<p>Guilt is another emotion that many experience at the beginning, and
it rides right along with the denial. You wonder why you didn’t see the
signs earlier and question why you avoided seeing them. Could your loved
one have been better off if you got her diagnosed sooner and into
treatment? These emotions—denial and guilt—are common. But again, it’s
important to stay attuned to your own emotions and mental and physical
exhaustion, and equip yourself with knowledge and resources. Connect
with other caregivers who are in a similar situation.</p>
<p>I can’t emphasize this enough: Build your own support network, ask
for and accept help, and continually plan for the future, adjusting
plans as needed and being okay with uncertainty. Alzheimer’s disease is
erratic, unpredictable, and an instigator of many mixed
emotions—anxiety, fear, sadness, depression, anger, frustration, and
grief. Try to be mindful of what you’re feeling and respond to your own
needs. Keep in mind that the disease can vary tremendously from person
to person and progress differently across the stages. So don’t beat
yourself up when you compare symptoms with others and find that you
“have it worse” than another caregiver. Embrace and accept the fact
you’ve taken on one of the most challenging roles anyone can have in
life. Both AARP and the Alzheimer’s Association provide a wealth of
resources online about care options, caregiving across the stages,
support, and financial and legal planning for caregivers. The sites also
include a bounty of strategies for handling complicated situations for
which none of us has likely been formally trained. Indeed, there are
ideal ways to respond when faced with someone behaving out of character
or extremely unpredictably. It can be hard to know how to regularly
monitor that person’s comfort and anticipate needs when things change so
quickly. It also can be excruciatingly tough to know how to handle
unusual situations. For example, what should you do when the person
seems stuck on repeating a word, activity, or sentence over and over
again? Repetition is common in the disease’s later stages. The person is
searching for familiarity and comfort as the brain continues its
malicious march forward in decline. One of the ways to respond, in
addition to being calm and patient, is to engage the person in an
activity to break the pattern of repetition. The Alzheimer’s
Association’s website has online support community and message boards
(ALZConnected) where people can share their strategies. It helps to
share your experience with others. This is a team effort in terms of
family and a group effort in global terms.</p>
<p>The goal of the caregiver is ultimately to help the person with
dementia live well. It is a job high in demand and low in gratitude or
compensation. I don’t know if there is such a thing as true balance, but
I will say that the role is very much a balancing act.</p>
<p>You may find that at some point, you can no longer be the primary
caregiver. Be open to the idea of changing the setting for the patient
and give yourself permission to surrender the sole responsibility.
Again, there are lots of options out there for places that offer
high-quality care led by professionals specially trained to treat people
with dementia and who do so with respect and dignity. Don’t get to a
place where you feel trapped and resentful. All that’s asked of you is
to do what you can when you can. It may help to keep a journal for your
personal thoughts and notes. Keep track of your experience. Document the
journey.</p>
