Diagnosing and Treating an Ailing Brain</h4>
<p>This increase in the life span and in the number of our senior
citizens presents this nation with increased opportunities: the
opportunity to draw upon their skill and sagacity—and the opportunity to
provide the respect and recognition they have earned. It is not enough
for a great nation merely to have added new years to life—our objective
must also be to add new life to those years.</p>
<p>JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>
<p>When I started in the world of journalism, I thought I’d be reporting
on health policy and the direction of our health care systems. It was
the sort of work that I had done at the White House and formed the basis
of much of my writing earlier in my career. As much as I have planned my
life, though, my pivotal moments have happened suddenly and completely
unexpectedly. I started at CNN in August 2001, and three weeks later,
the tragic attacks of 9/11 happened. Immediately, I was the only doctor
working at an international news network during the unfolding crisis.
Shortly after that, I was covering the conflict in Afghanistan, the
anthrax attacks, and the war in Iraq. It was a case of professional and
personal whiplash.</p>
<p>Having come from a tiny town in rural Michigan, and having had no
exposure to war zones or the military, it was a challenging experience
to be completely immersed in a foreign world where the stakes were so
high and personal safety was a real concern. I was instantly struck by
the first responders, nurses, and doctors who so often rushed in to save
other people’s lives while putting themselves in the line of fire. To
this day, I will never forget the first time I saw that complete and
genuine selflessness. The people they were saving were typically total
strangers and sometimes captured enemies, and yet, they would say to
themselves, Today I am willing to risk my life to save someone I don’t
even know. It remains the most human story I covered. I made a
commitment then to always report on the stories of the first responders,
and over the past two decades, it is the reason I have covered just
about every war, natural disaster, and outbreak in the world. Even in
the midst of total devastation and darkness, I’ve wanted to tell the
stories of the bright lights that remind us of our humanity.</p>
<p>Writing this book about brain health has been no different from
writing about my experiences out on the battlefield or in an area
devastated by a disaster. When it comes to dementia, we are at war. Some
people bristle at metaphors that conjure up battle. But I’ve witnessed
the disease cause as much devastation and darkness in families as any
other type of calamity. There are numerous casualties when it comes to
any neurodegenerative disease. Not only does the individual patient
suffer; so does everyone else around him or her—from family members and
friends to additional caregivers brought in to help (many of whom
volunteer). It’s emotionally and physically draining. And then there are
the costs in time and money. Adding to the toll is the sheer frustration
from a general lack of progress in research circles to arrive at a cure.
Victims languish in the limbo of a long-drawn-out disease that can go on
for years or even decades with no hope for a cure. Conversations always
teeter awkwardly between hope and honesty. But as I describe later in
the book, the approach to treatment for dementia is beginning to change.
The conversation no longer needs to be solely one of desperation.
Instead, we can focus on improvements in care and reshape the
experience—particularly with early diagnosis and interventions—showing
those with dementia and their caregivers that it is possible to live
well with the disease until the elusive cure is found.</p>
<p>I recently had a chance to sit down with Bill Gates and talk to him
about research for Alzheimer’s disease. He wanted to tell me about his
personal financial commitment to finding a treatment or cure. It turns
out that losing his memory is one of his biggest fears, which again is
the case for most people. One of the areas we discussed the most was the
trajectory of brain research and how we could better shape it. With
Alzheimer’s in particular, a great deal of energy has been spent on
trying to find the cure. This is understandable, but it also means
resources have been siphoned from simpler goals, such as early detection
and coping strategies, which are also important. Remember that the
accumulation of amyloid begins in the brain decades before symptoms
appear. Unfortunately, that also means the disease is fairly developed
and much harder to treat when the patient finally develops clinical
symptoms. It does, however, pose opportunities to prevent the disease
from becoming symptomatic even if it is not cured. In essence, it would
be “asymptomatic Alzheimer’s.” I am very excited about this possibility.
In the world of neurosurgery, we always remind ourselves that our
objective is not to make a patient’s brain scan look better; we are
trying to make the patients themselves better. The point is that even if
someone has amyloid plaques in their brain but doesn’t have memory loss
or other symptoms, that would be a very desirable outcome. In fact, we
know there are many people who have amyloid and tau in their brains who
never go on to develop the symptoms of dementia. Science is just
beginning to explore why that is, but the evidence behind healthy
lifestyle choices delaying onset or reducing the severity of symptoms
supports a strategy to reduce your risk for dementia right now. So as a
starting point, I would make sure the trajectory of brain research is
centered on patients first, even if it doesn’t mean a home-run new
therapy. Yes, patients want an effective treatment or even a cure, but
incremental achievements in brain research should be pursued and
celebrated as well.</p>
<p>Writing this book made me realize just how much the field of
scientific research can suffer from groupthink. Once an established
scientist has put forth a theory and received funding to prove that
theory, many other labs start to follow behind. The problem is that most
of those trials then focus on the same mechanism, which in the case of
Alzheimer’s research historically has been addressing amyloid in the
brain. (We have also seen this with HIV trials. At one point, nearly a
dozen of the largest and most expensive clinical trials in the world
were all basically trying to prove the same thing. They turned out to be
wrong.) With AARP and Bill Gates investing in the Dementia Discovery
Fund, which is the world’s largest venture fund focused entirely on
discovering and developing revolutionary therapies for dementia, there
will be more renegade approaches to Alzheimer’s that will get a fair
chance, such as the idea that the glial cells may be activating the
immune system, or that the energy life span of the brain cells may be
contributing to the disease, or something else entirely. AARP
contributed 0 million and inspired United Health and Quest Diagnostics
to pitch in. Perhaps most importantly, there needs to be a research
platform that allows sharing of data—otherwise everyone may be pursuing
the same or wrong theories—and a safety net that allows researchers to
take more chances. People are working right now on this particular
issue, including Gates, the National Institute on Aging, AARP, and
others.</p>
<p>As a neuroscientist and journalist, I often get to spend time with
the people behind all the numbers. It’s important to do that and truly
understand what life is like for someone with Alzheimer’s disease.
Sometimes the experience is surprising, but it always informs opinions
and thoughts about how best to approach this disease. Sandy Halperin in
particular did that for me.</p>
<p>BRINGING HOPE</p>
<p>“All we really are is our thoughts and our brain,” Sandy told me. It
was the spring of 2013, and he was living an independent life as a
resident of a retirement community in Florida with his wife, Gail. That
was surprising because he had been diagnosed with early-onset
Alzheimer’s disease in 2010 when he was sixty. What he couldn’t possibly
have known was that he was likely just thirty-five years old when his
brain began its slow descent into the illness. This is important because
when Sandy was diagnosed after he started losing words and forgetting
his intentions, the disease was already advanced. Sandy admits that his
symptoms had started quietly a couple of years before his formal
diagnosis, but he was hesitant to acknowledge them and his family didn’t
notice the signs.</p>
<p>Ignoring symptoms and waiting to seek medical help is not uncommon.
Data from the Centers for Disease Control suggest that nearly 13 percent
of Americans reported experiencing worsening confusion or memory loss
after age sixty, but most—fully 81 percent—had not consulted with a
health care provider about their cognitive issues.1 For most people, the
memory lapses are just that, but it is still worth raising the issue
with your doctor. If it is the beginning of Alzheimer’s, the clock has
already been ticking for years. You don’t want to lose more precious
time that can be used to intervene with strategies, sometimes in
combination with drugs, to slow the ailment’s progression and ease some
symptoms.</p>
<p>I followed Sandy for several years as his malady unfolded. He was
brave to open his home and heart to me and my team so we could witness
firsthand what it’s like to be diagnosed with such a crushing illness
and not know what the future holds.</p>
<p>“There is no pain,” Sandy told me in 2016. I had asked about this
because of recent papers showing that inflammation in the brain is a
primary enemy at the time Alzheimer’s disease starts to show itself.
Sandy had to search hard for the right words. He said it felt like
cotton stuffed deep into the front of his head. He began to eloquently
describe this feeling with the precision of a Harvard assistant dental
professor, which he once was. But then he stopped because he completely
forgot what we were discussing. He looked at me blankly. “Front of your
head,” I gently prompted him. “Right,” he remembered. And for just a few
minutes, Sandy would be lucid again.</p>
<p>Sandy also opened up his life and his brain to science. He wants to
be a part of the transformative advances taking place in the
understanding and treatment of Alzheimer’s, even if he is not around to
benefit from them. Unwilling to be relegated to the sidelines with his
diagnosis or fulfill the image of a person wasting away in a nursing
home, Sandy became an advocate for increased funding and decreased
shame. He also rallied for patients to remain as active and social as
possible, just like him. He maintained a LinkedIn network of Alzheimer’s
patients, advocates, and physicians for as long as he could until his
health finally compelled him to pass the baton. Sandy’s story may not
have a good ending, but he will have a great legacy.</p>
<p>It was while Sandy was working at the Florida Department of Health
that he noticed a memory problem worse than losing his keys and
forgetting names. His job was to review dental cases for attorneys and
consider the merits of patient complaints before the department. Then he
would give a written or verbal report. The job required attention to
details. Then one day his memory of a case that should have been fresh
in his mind simply vanished. As this forgetting started to occur more
and more frequently, Sandy struggled to cope. When an attorney entered
his office to discuss a case, Sandy would make an excuse to meet a few
minutes later so he could try to refresh his memory. That desperate
scramble wasn’t going to last. No longer could he hide his
symptoms.2</p>
<p>At this writing, Sandy is in the more severe stages of the disease,
managing as best he can with symptoms and chronic pain from other health
challenges. He’s supported by a family that includes his wife of more
than forty years, his two grown daughters, and his granddaughters (60
percent of family caregivers are women). Among the powerful lessons he
wants to leave behind is this: “We’re all terminal.… I may pass faster,
but I have to live my life for now. So I want people to know there’s
still a good life for anyone with a diagnosis with dementia. That’s what
they have to know: There’s a quality of life they can still have.”</p>
<p>That stuck with me. Too many people give up on life when they receive
a diagnosis. But you’d be surprised by how much hope and optimism can
play into health and any prognosis. In all my years of doctoring and
reporting, I’ve noted that the people who live better—and longer—are the
ones who hold on to hope. They keep their chins up and often throw
themselves into the service of others. That is what Sandy Halperin
did.</p>
<p>A POUND OF PREVENTION</p>
<p>The key to treating dementia is prevention, and it just so happens
that the same things you can do to reduce your risk for the disease are
what you can do to improve your quality of life as you live with the
disease. It’s one of Dr. Richard Isaacson’s most salient points:
Alzheimer’s disease typically begins in the brain up to twenty to thirty
years before symptoms develop. I’ve already called out this fact a
couple of times because it’s so important (and it forces us to think of
our children). This presents an opportunity to intervene and delay or
even prevent Alzheimer’s disease altogether. Remember this because the
gap of time between brain changes occurring and symptoms surfacing was
mentioned by every expert I spoke to while doing my research. It’s
called the preclinical time, and it is where Dr. Isaacson and many
others have started to train much of their attention.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, at the annual Alzheimer’s Association
International Conference in 2019, Dr. Isaacson presented a paper that is
one of the first to show how his revolutionary lifestyle intervention
studies lead to improvements in as little as eighteen months. His
programs are designed for each individual based on that person’s medical
screenings and evaluations, but they all involve similar strategies that
target different areas in life that are modifiable. These include
attention to diet, exercise, sleep, supplements and drugs when
necessary, intellectual stimulation, and stress reduction—all the
strategies I outlined in part 2. The brains of people who showed no
signs of brain disease at the start of his program can act up to three
years younger by some measures after his program. Most important, he has
shown measurable improvements among those who have memory loss and have
already been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. He believes he’s
helping them turn back the clock. And those who have signs of disease in
the brain but no symptoms yet could be delaying their illness by years.
If you can’t entirely prevent the illness from developing, then at least
you can delay it for as long as possible. As mentioned in chapter 7, the
average number of personalized recommendations given to the 176 people
in his study, who ranged in age from twenty-five to eighty-six, was
twenty-one. Some of the recommendations were decidedly simple: eat
certain types of fish, add more berries to your diet, and get into an
exercise routine. These are nature’s “drugs” to beat disease. And the
fact people who were already showing signs of mild cognitive impairment
could improve by following just 60 percent of the protocol speaks
volumes.</p>
<p>All of these participants have a history of Alzheimer’s disease in
the family though no or minimal (mild) cognitive complaints at the start
of the study. He calls his approach the ABCs of Alzheimer’s prevention
management: A is for the anthropometrics like body fat percentage and
muscle mass; B is for blood biomarkers such as cholesterol and
inflammation levels, blood sugar, as well as genetic tests; and C is for
cognitive performance to test for memory, processing speed, attention,
and language. From there, he designs individual protocols and reassesses
people’s ABCs every six months and makes adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>For Dr. Isaacson, as it is for me in my work, patient outcomes are
the most important evidence of science. He says: “As a clinician with a
family history, what I’m doing that is so disruptive is taking the time
to get to the heart of the matter here and crafting a plan. People who
correct their underlying biology first will be much more likely to
respond to typical therapies. You don’t have to be a neurologist to do
this. Any doctor should be able to do this.” And he’s right. None of us
should have to visit a high-profile clinic to receive basic training in
preventing brain decline or even applying fundamental lifestyle habits
to delay the onset of a disease or, at the very least, improve symptoms
that are already evident. Many of the same interventional strategies
that Isaacson endorses and “prescribes” in his clinic are the same ones
you can benefit from by reading this book.</p>
<p>Dean Ornish is also trailblazing this path. You’ll recall I mentioned
his randomized controlled trials currently in motion with colleagues at
UC San Francisco to see how lifestyle interventions can change the
course of Alzheimer’s disease. He goes so far as to use the word reverse
when talking about the possibilities of nipping the illness in the bud
during its early stages. His program is not too different from the
twelve-week Keep Sharp plan and includes: a whole foods, low-fat,
low-sugar, plant-based diet; moderate exercise; stress management
techniques such as meditation; and psychosocial support. He has also
recruited the help of other scientists to create a full picture during
the study. Renowned geneticist David Sinclair at Harvard is measuring
changes in gene expression; Dr. Rob Knight’s lab at UC San Diego is
tracking changes in the microbiome; Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn’s lab at UC
San Francisco is documenting changes in telomere length, which are
chromosomal sections related to aging; and Dr. Steve Horvath at UCLA is
measuring changes in the DNA clock. All of these data will help us
further understand a disease as complex as Alzheimer’s and point us in
new directions for therapies and preventive tactics.</p>
<p>Should I Get Tested for the “Alzheimer’s Genes”?</p>
<p>Various genes are known to raise risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
Although a quarter of Alzheimer’s patients have a strong family history
of the disease, only 1 percent or less directly inherit a gene mutation
that causes early-onset Alzheimer’s, also known as familial Alzheimer’s
disease. These people can show signs of the disease in their thirties;
many of them choose to enter clinical trials to help scientists better
understand the disease in general. Another set of genes can raise risk
for the more common late-onset type of Alzheimer’s, but they are not
deterministic—that is, just because you carry them does not translate to
a diagnosis in your life. One of the most common ones is the APOE gene,
which has three types or alleles: APOE2, E3, and E4. Everyone has two
copies of the gene, and the combination you’re born with determines your
APOE genotype—E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/E4, E3/E3, E3/E4, or E4/E4. The E2 allele
is the rarest form of APOE and carrying even one copy appears to reduce
the risk of developing Alzheimer’s by up to 40 percent.3 APOE3 is the
most common allele and doesn’t seem to influence risk. The APOE4 allele,
present in approximately 10 to 15 percent of people, however, increases
the risk for Alzheimer’s and lowers the age of onset. Having one copy of
E4 (E3/E4) can increase your risk by two to three times, while two
copies (E4/E4) can increase the risk by twelve times. While there is a
blood test for APOE4, the strongest risk gene for Alzheimer’s, this test
is mainly used in clinical trials to identify people at higher risk of
developing the disease.</p>
<p>Carrying this gene mutation indicates only a greater risk, however;
it does not indicate whether a person will ever develop Alzheimer’s or
already has Alzheimer’s. When I ask experts whether it’s a good idea to
know one’s APOE genotype, I receive mixed responses. Some say it’s best
to know what risks you bear so you can do what you can to prevent the
disease. But others suggest that such knowledge can be difficult to
shoulder if it’s bad news and you don’t have proper genetic counseling
to support you. Genetic counseling means working with someone
knowledgeable in interpreting genomic test results and the probabilities
you face with various health risks. (These are health care
professionals; your doctor can recommend someone.) Personally, I’d want
to know my genetic status, but would recommend that anyone who gets
tested do so under the guidance of a physician and counselor. And I’ll
say it again: Your lifestyle habits will influence the fate of your
brain more so than your genetics.</p>
<p>THE THREE STAGES OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE</p>
<p>Sandy Halperin’s experience highlights an important message: If
you’re destined to develop a disease like Alzheimer’s, time is of the
essence. As with a cancer diagnosis, you don’t want to wait until the
ailment has reached its later stages and interventions to delay the
progression are practically useless. The disease typically evolves
slowly in three general stages: mild (early stage), moderate (middle
stage), and severe (late stage). Sometimes the stages are broken down
into seven phases, from 1 (no impairment) to 7 (very severe decline),
but here I’m going to cover how the Alzheimer’s Association categorizes
the progression of the disease.4 Everyone with Alzheimer’s experiences
these stages differently. How fast and how severe one person shows
symptoms and moves through the stages may not reflect someone else’s
experience, so there’s no way to tell how a given disease will advance.
That unknown alone can be scary. On average, a person with Alzheimer’s
lives four to eight years after diagnosis but can live as long as twenty
years, depending on other factors. Unfortunately, many people don’t get
diagnosed until later stages, if at all. This can be especially true for
those who are single or otherwise lack partners to notice cognitive and
behavioral changes and lapses in memory. And remember: Alzheimer’s
disease is not the only form of dementia. As I’ve outlined, the symptoms
of other forms of dementia can be different and people can have mixed
dementias. These other diseases have similar stages.</p>
<p>Let’s review the stages as defined by the Alzheimer’s
Association.</p>
<p>Early Stage: Mild Alzheimer’s Disease</p>
<p>In the early stage, a person may function independently. He or she
may still drive, work, and socialize normally. But the person may begin
to notice unusual memory lapses, such as forgetting familiar words or
the location of everyday objects. Friends, coworkers, family, or others
begin to notice difficulties too. This state is also referred to as mild
cognitive impairment, particularly when the cause of the dementia is not
known. Doctors may be able to detect problems in memory or concentration
by asking certain questions. Common difficulties include:</p>
<p>Struggles with finding the right word</p>
<p>Problems with remembering names when introduced to new people</p>
<p>Difficulties performing tasks in social or work settings</p>

</ol>
<p>Middle Stage: Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease</p>
<p>The middle stage is typically the longest one and can last for many
years. As the disease progresses and symptoms become more pronounced,
those with Alzheimer’s will require a greater level of care. Although
they may still remember significant details about their life, they may
have greater difficulty performing tasks, such as paying bills and
tending to household chores.</p>
<p>A witness to someone in this stage may notice the person confusing
words, getting frustrated or angry without provocation, or acting in
unexpected ways, such as refusing to bathe or dress appropriately.
Damage to nerve cells in the brain can make it challenging to express
thoughts and perform routine daily tasks. At this point, symptoms will
be noticeable to others and may include:</p>
<p>Forgetting events or part of one’s own personal history</p>
<p>Feeling moody or withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally
challenging situations</p>
<p>Being unable to recall one’s own address or telephone number or the
high school or college from which one graduated</p>
<p>Being confused about where one is or what day it is</p>
<p>Needing help choosing appropriate clothing for the day or an
event</p>
<p>Having trouble controlling bladder and bowels</p>
<p>Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and
becoming restless at night</p>
<p>Wandering and becoming lost</p>
<p>Personality and behavioral changes, including suspiciousness and
delusions or compulsive, repetitive behavior like hand-wringing,
repeating comments, or repeating the same gesture</p>
<p>Late Stage: Severe Alzheimer’s Disease</p>
<p>Dementia symptoms are serious in the final stage. People lose the
ability to respond to their environment, carry on a conversation, and,
eventually, control their movements. They may still say words or
phrases, but communicating in general, including sensations of pain,
becomes difficult. As their memory and cognitive skills continue to
decline, very noticeable personality changes occur and individuals need
extensive help with daily activities. At this stage, a person may:</p>
<p>Need around-the-clock assistance with daily activities and personal
care</p>
<p>Lose awareness of recent happenings, as well as of their
surroundings</p>
<p>Lose basic physical abilities, such as the ability to walk, sit, and,
eventually, swallow</p>
<p>Experience increasing difficulty communicating</p>
<p>Become vulnerable to infections, especially pneumonia</p>
<p>Surprisingly, no single diagnostic test can determine if a person has
Alzheimer’s disease. Even if a brain scan to look for beta-amyloid is
performed, we don’t have definite parameters established for what’s
normal and not and whether any buildup of amyloid in the brain is truly
causing the symptoms. There’s disagreement among pathologists as to what
exactly constitutes “enough” plaque, and in what locations, to make the
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force does not recommend screening, while some neurologists do. Health
care providers typically do not make a diagnosis of dementia unless the
symptoms are already so severe that they interfere with a person’s
activities of daily living. Adding to the challenge is the fact some
doctors, especially primary care physicians, hesitate to diagnose
dementia and are often ill-equipped to deliver the news. They sometimes
cling to outdated thinking that says there’s nothing to be done for
those identified as being at greater risk for dementia or who have
already been diagnosed. Primary care providers grappling with these
issues can benefit from the Gerontological Society of America’s
four-step KAER process, a tool kit developed to help them detect
cognitive impairment and provide earlier diagnosis, which can greatly
improve quality of life for their patients.</p>
<p>Arriving at a diagnosis usually entails the help of several
specialists such as neurologists, psychologists, geriatricians, and
geriatric psychiatrists, plus a variety of approaches and tools. A
standard medical workup for Alzheimer’s disease often includes
structural imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed
tomography (CT). Structural imaging can reveal other causes of the
patient’s symptoms such as tumors, small or large strokes, damage from
severe head trauma, or a buildup of fluid in the brain. A third type of
scan, PET, can show patterns of brain activity and whether the amyloid
protein is accumulating. But again, these scans have limitations. They
are best used within the context of other clinical findings. Most of
these tests are not going to detect Alzheimer’s; rather, they rule out
other conditions that may cause symptoms similar to Alzheimer’s but
require different treatment.</p>
<p>DEMENTIA MIMICS</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some dementia “mimics” because many of
these conditions can be treated successfully.</p>
<p>Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)</p>
<p>It was a remarkable experience for me as a neurosurgeon to see
someone successfully treated for normal pressure hydrocephalus. As with
most other patients, the man I was treating had been given a diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s and had been treated for two years. Having reached out
for second and then third opinions, he was finally found to have NPH, a
gradual buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, which results
in swelling and pressure that can damage brain tissue over time. My
patient had classic symptoms of NPH, including walking and balance
problems, urinary incontinence, and memory difficulties. When I saw him
and reviewed his CT scan, I was pretty confident he was going to benefit
from draining the excess fluid. First, I did a lumbar puncture and
inserted a lumbar drain to investigate if draining large amounts of CSF
would help with his symptoms. The plan was to have the physical and
cognitive therapists evaluate him after a couple days to see if he had
any improvements.</p>
<p>Amazingly, after the first day, he sat up on his own when I walked
into the room. He was so thrilled about his improvement that he almost
pulled his lumbar drain out as he started showing off how well he could
walk. He told me he felt “uncongested” after having the fluid drained.
It was dramatic and emotional for him and his family. They had basically
resigned themselves to a life with Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>After that, I placed a shunt (a catheter that drains cerebrospinal
fluid from the ventricles in his brain, and diverts it to his abdomen)
and he continued to improve. It was one of the most satisfying
operations I have performed because it’s not common to achieve such a
quick response to what could otherwise be a serious and untreatable
brain problem. Best estimates are that close to a million people have
NPH, and fewer than 20 percent are properly diagnosed. Not everyone will
have improvement with drainage of CSF, and few will have as dramatic a
turnaround as this patient. Still, it is one of the dementia mimics that
needs to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Medications</p>
<p>More than half of Americans take at least one prescription drug, and
more than half take an average of four.5 The older we get, the more
likely we are to take drugs for various conditions, especially in the
United States. Twenty percent of Americans are on five or more
prescription medications. These include drugs like antidepressants,
antibiotics, statins, opioids, benzodiazepines (used for anxiety and
sleep), and blood pressure medications. We often don’t ask or think
about a drug’s side effects or interactions with other drugs when a
doctor prescribes them, and rarely do we consider effects that can mimic
a disease like Alzheimer’s. We just go ahead and take these drugs
prescribed for us. But many commonly used drugs can trigger cognitive
symptoms. As we age, the body metabolizes and eliminates medication less
efficiently, allowing drug levels to build up and cause memory glitches.
Which ones? The most likely culprits are some I just named: narcotic
painkillers (opiates), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants used after
injury, and steroids.</p>
<p>This is why it’s critical to tell your doctor about every drug you
take, including supplements and over-the-counter medications. You might
assume your doctor already knows everything that’s in your medicine
cabinet (and perhaps all your prescriptions came from your own doctor),
but it helps to make sure you remind and make your doctor aware of
additional things you take, including vitamins and dietary supplements
that don’t require a prescription.</p>
<p>One particular class of drugs has gained notoriety in dementia
circles: anticholinergics. As the name implies, an anticholinergic agent
is a substance that blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the
central and the peripheral nervous system. Acetylcholine is responsible
for transferring signals between certain cells that affect specific
bodily functions. In the brain, acetylcholine has a role in learning and
memory; elsewhere in the body, it stimulates muscle contractions.
Anticholinergic drugs’ effects make them a candidate to treat an array
of illnesses such as depression and Parkinson’s disease, as well as
gastrointestinal disorders, urinary incontinence, epilepsy, and
allergies. Benadryl—the popular antihistamine many of us have in our
medicine cabinets and also find in over-the-counter cold remedies and
sleep aids—owes its main ingredient to an anticholinergic:
diphenhydramine. But here’s what’s increasingly a concern: This class of
drugs may also increase a patient’s risk of dementia by more than 50
percent. And it’s estimated that 20 to 50 percent of Americans age
sixty-five and older take at least one anticholinergic medication. A
2019 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine revealed that in men and
women age sixty-five and older, taking an anticholinergic for three or
more years was associated with a 54 percent higher risk for dementia
than taking the same dose for three months or less.6 These are not drugs
you want to be taking long term to maintain a clear head.</p>
<p>If you take an anticholinergic, talk to your doctor about the risks
versus benefits and see if there are other alternative options. We don’t
know yet what the long-term effects can be from using these drugs. By
some measures, researchers have found greater incidences of dementia
among patients prescribed anticholinergics for depression, urological
problems, and Parkinson’s disease than among older adults who were not
prescribed these drugs. It is still not clear whether it was the
medications that increased the risk or the underlying malady that
required the medication, but the new incidences of dementia were found
up to twenty years after exposure to the drugs.</p>
<p>Drugs that May Increase Risk of Dementia</p>
<p>anticholinergic antidepressants (e.g., paroxetine, Paxil)</p>
<p>antiparkinson drugs and antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine,
Benadryl)</p>
<p>antipsychotic drugs (e.g., clozapine, Clozaril)</p>
<p>drugs for overactive bladder (e.g., oxybutynin, Oxytrol)</p>
<p>antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, Tegretol)</p>
<p>Depression</p>
<p>This area is tricky. Severe depression can frequently cause symptoms
of dementia, sometimes called pseudodementia. When the depression is
successfully treated, the cognitive impairment improves. But it is
important to know that the individual will still have a higher risk of
developing dementia later in life. Complicating matters is the fact that
people with various forms of dementia live with a higher risk for
depression, largely due to the damage of the emotional circuitry in the
brain. You can see the vicious cycle here. This is why it’s imperative
to have anyone suspected of suffering from dementia also evaluated for
depression. A psychiatrist, neurologist, or geriatrician affiliated with
a memory disorder clinic or major medical center will already have this
evaluation in the protocol.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have shown severe depression in older people with
normal memory is linked to developing dementia within a few years.
Because we now understand Alzheimer’s and related diseases can begin to
develop decades before the memory loss symptoms of the disease are
obvious, it is unlikely that depression leads to rapid-onset Alzheimer’s
disease. Therefore, it’s possible that late-life depression is one of
the early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Sometimes, it can be difficult
to distinguish between certain aspects of depression and mild memory
loss in normal aging and what may be a disease. Technology—including
cerebrospinal fluid protein levels and amyloid PET imaging—is now
available to determine whether changes in feelings and emotions or in
memory that come with older age are consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.
Most clinicians agree depression symptoms should be treated through
medications or non-pharmacological approaches regardless of whether
Alzheimer’s disease is present.</p>
<p>Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)</p>
<p>UTIs are caused by a buildup of bad bacteria in the bladder, ureters,
urethra, or kidney that cause infections. They often present differently
in older people because they rarely have the typical symptoms of a high
fever or pain, especially when urinating. Instead, the person may
experience sudden memory problems, confusion, delirium, dizziness,
agitation, or even hallucinations. UTI-induced confusion is most likely
to occur in people who are older or already have dementia. Eradicating
the infection with proper treatment can help ease symptoms.</p>
<p>Vascular Dementia</p>
<p>Vascular dementia can be caused by any number of adverse
cardiovascular conditions or events including a massive stroke, which
results in losing function in parts of the body or having trouble
speaking, or a series of ministrokes. The latter, called subcortical
vascular dementia, can result in the person showing signs of cognitive
impairment without any idea of having suffered the strokes because they
occurred silently. The treatment protocol for this is usually reducing
the risk of further strokes through improving diet and exercise,
controlling blood pressure, and engaging in cognitive rehabilitation.
Sometimes drugs approved to treat Alzheimer’s can help. Vascular
dementia can also be caused by damaged blood vessels in the brain as a
result of diabetes, high blood pressure, or atherosclerosis (hardening
of the arteries).</p>
<p>Nutritional Deficiencies</p>
<p>AARP’s survey found that over 25 percent of adults in the United
States fifty and older are taking a supplement for brain health
purposes, which is a big waste of money for most of them. The Global
Council on Brain Health’s report on supplements does not recommend
supplementation for brain health unless a health care provider has
specifically identified a nutritional deficiency. When nutritional
deficiencies do exist, however, they can lead to symptoms of dementia
because of their influence on the metabolism and downstream effects. The
most common deficiencies include vitamin B12, niacin (the deficiency
causes a disease called pellagra), and a general imbalance of nutrients
called protein calorie malnutrition due to lack of overall intake of
healthy foods. Luckily, deficiencies are rare in the Western world and
can often be remedied through diet and supplementation.</p>
<p>Underlying Infection</p>
<p>As noted earlier, infections can trigger symptoms of dementia.
Syphilis, for example, has long been associated with increased risk for
dementia due to its effects on the nervous system and brain. Research is
currently underway to understand other infections that can have
brain-wasting consequences—from Lyme disease to other vector-borne
ailments such as bartonellosis, which is caused by the Bartonella
bacteria.</p>
<p>Brain Tumor</p>
<p>Having a benign brain tumor called a meningioma can sound dire, but
it can be better than getting diagnosed with dementia. Several of these
tumors can be surgically removed, unlike the plaques causing Alzheimer’s
dementia. These tumors can press on certain parts of the brain and cause
cognitive dysfunction. The key here is early assessment so these tumors
can be removed in their early stages, which can increase the chances
that cognitive changes can be reversed. Otherwise, the longer they
remain and grow, the harder they are to remove, and there’s much greater
risk of permanent damage.</p>
<p>Subdural Hematoma from a Head Injury</p>
<p>A subdural hematoma occurs when abnormal bleeding (usually caused by
an injury) leads to blood collecting between the dura (the outermost of
the meninges, which are layers of tissue that surround the brain) and
the brain. A buildup of pressure caused by the hematoma can lead to
dementia-like symptoms. These can be relatively easy to drain
surgically, especially if the hematoma has become liquefied. Small ones
may even go away on their own over time. Because these blood collections
may take some time to accumulate, patients may forget the minor head
injury that often causes them. Something as seemingly innocuous as
bumping your head while getting into your car can show up as a subdural
hematoma days or weeks later, especially in someone who is elderly.</p>
<p>Traumatic brain injuries in general can cause memory loss that mimics
symptoms of dementia, especially when the injury happens in regions of
the brain associated with learning and emotions. In 2019, researchers at
UCLA and the University of Washington revealed that MRI scans in
development today will help doctors in the future distinguish between
Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury.7 It’s important to be
able to make this distinction because it can inform the proper
treatment. Note that the risk of falling in general tends to increase
the older we get, so preventing falls to begin with will go a long way
to avoid breaking bones and suffering from a traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Alcohol Misuse</p>
<p>Alcohol dementia (or alcohol-related dementia) is caused by
long-term, excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages and is
increasingly a concern for doctors because the amount of drinking has
been on the rise in our society, especially among older folks. In
addition to destroying brain cells in areas critical for memory,
thinking, decision making, and balance, heavy drinking can also lead to
injury and increase the risk of other health problems that can impair
cognitive function (such as liver damage). Certain medications combined
with alcohol can also cause memory issues and other side effects. The
effects of alcohol abuse can sometimes be reversed, but the first step
is to abstain from alcohol, which can be difficult for long-term
drinkers.</p>
<p>THE MEDICAL WORKUP</p>
<p>Anyone concerned about the possibility of having a form of dementia
should be seen as soon as possible for a complete medical workup. This
should include a review of the following:</p>
<p>One’s medical history and a complete physical with lab work (blood
and urine)</p>
<p>Psychiatric history and history of cognitive and behavioral
changes</p>
<p>Current and past illnesses</p>
<p>Medications and supplements</p>
<p>Medical conditions affecting other family members</p>
<p>Lifestyle habits like diet, exercise, and use of alcohol</p>
<p>The combination of the physical exam and laboratory tests can help
spot health issues that can cause symptoms of dementia, such as
depression, untreated sleep apnea, side effects of medications, thyroid
problems, certain vitamin deficiencies, and excessive alcohol
consumption. Even hearing loss can be a warning sign; although we don’t
fully understand the connection, new research points to moderate and
severe hearing loss being a significant risk factor for dementia. The
good news is that for some people, treating the hearing loss may prevent
or delay progression of the disease.8</p>
<p>The neurological part of the exam can include a brain imaging study
and assessments that can gauge a person’s range of everyday mental
skills. For example, is the individual aware of symptoms? Does she know
the date, time, and where she is? Can he remember a short list of words,
follow instructions, and do simple calculations? Among the commonly used
tests to identify potential problems are these:</p>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale
(ADAS-Cog) is one of the more comprehensive and widely used tests.
Researchers often use it in cognition research and clinical drug trials
for antidementia medications. It was developed in the 1980s and
primarily measures memory, language, and orientation (e.g., how someone
solves a problem). A noncognitive part measures things like mood,
attention, and motor activity, but this is not used nearly as much as
the ADAS-Cog section, which can be done on paper or electronically.
Unlike some of the other tests that take minutes to complete, the
ADAS-Cog takes about thirty to thirty-five minutes and consists of
eleven sections led by a test administrator who adds up points for
errors in each task. The greater the total score (out of 70), the
greater the dysfunction. Research shows that a normal score for someone
who does not have Alzheimer’s or another type of dementia is 5. Studies
also show that 31.2 is an average score for people who have been
diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive
impairment, though critics charge that the ADAS-Cog is not that
effective in rating the severity of that impairment and mild cases of
dementia. It is, however, considered better than many other tests.</p>
<p>The Mini-Mental State Exam, also called the Folstein test, is a
simple questionnaire that takes about ten minutes to complete. Dating
back to 1975, it’s also one of the most commonly used basic screenings
for dementia in clinical settings and has a maximum score of 30 points.
It evaluates attention and calculation, recall, language, ability to
follow simple commands, and orientation (time and place). It can be done
on paper and requires no fancy equipment or even a computer. A score of
20 to 24 suggests mild dementia, 13 to 20 suggests moderate dementia,
and less than 12 indicates severe dementia. On average, the MMSE score
of a person with Alzheimer’s declines about two to four points each
year.</p>
<p>The Mini-Cog test is even simpler and briefer than the MMSE. It takes
just three minutes to complete and has two components: a three-item
recall test for memory and a clock-drawing test whereby the person is
asked to draw the face of a clock showing all twelve numbers in the
right places and a time specified by the examiner.</p>
<p>The Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE), another
simple test done on paper, was developed at the Ohio State University’s
Center for Cognitive and Memory Disorders. Like the other tests, this
one asks fundamental questions to show how well the brain is working,
including language, memory, and problem solving. It takes about fifteen
minutes, and although it’s marketed to be done at home or in a doctor’s
office, I recommend that anyone looking to use these tests do so in a
formal setting under the guidance of a qualified doctor if possible.</p>
<p>Many other cognitive exams are available. In research circles,
multiple different assessments are often used because no single test is
a total diagnostic. In other words, these tests alone do not diagnose
dementia. They are assessments—they evaluate general cognition and
measure the amount or degree of impairment. The results become part of
the entire medical workup to determine whether someone is diagnosed with
a form of dementia.</p>
<p>Computerized cognitive tests are becoming increasingly popular among
physicians, and they can have advantages over the older, written exams.
They can be more precise in their evaluations of thinking, learning, and
memory, as well as administered exactly the same way in the future to
document changes. Using both clinical tests and computer-based tests can
give physicians a clearer understanding of cognitive difficulties that
patients are experiencing. The FDA has cleared several computerized
cognitive testing devices for marketing, including Automated
Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM), CANTAB Mobile, COGNIGRAM,
Cognision, and Cognivue.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that all of these tests—written questionnaires
or computerized—should be administered by a professional familiar with
their interpretation. As simple as some of these tests are, don’t
attempt to self-evaluate using a test you can download or take online. I
also recommend that you don’t “cheat” by studying these kinds of tests
over the Internet before being tested in a professional setting. These
tests aren’t perfect, and they can be gamed. Remember that the goal is
to get a clean and unbiased screening assessment. It’s also important to
note that current testing is not 100 percent accurate 100 percent of the
time, so it’s helpful to get second and even third opinions when
possible.</p>
<p>Do you have to take the assessment at a top facility? It’s a question
I get regularly. The answer is “not necessarily,” but be sure that
you’re with a doctor and a team that regularly sees and diagnoses all
forms of dementia. As a starter, if you are older, finding a good
geriatrician is an excellent idea for every patient. There is a chronic
shortage of geriatricians across the country, particularly now as we
have growing numbers of older people. If you can’t find one, make sure
your primary care provider has some experience. You don’t want to be
diagnosed by someone who rarely deals with dementia and who will not
have recommendations for you going forward. Also remember that the
people who notice the earliest signs are often family members,
coworkers, and friends, not the individual beginning to show signs of
cognitive decline or even a doctor. The details noted by family members
are very important and can be crucial to figuring out the time line of
the disease, the speed of progression, and whether there could be some
other cause. After that, a medical team—typically a neurologist,
psychiatrist, and psychologist—would be ideal to help assess this
disease.</p>
<p>NATIONWIDE PROGRAMS: WHERE TO FIND HELP</p>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Association is a leading voluntary health
organization in Alzheimer’s care, support, and research. It delivers
education, support, and services for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s,
their families, caregivers, health care professionals, and the general
public. The organization maintains a 24/7 Helpline that’s free and
confidential: 800-272-3900. Call anytime to receive reliable
information, advice, and support. Trained and knowledgeable staff are
ready to listen and can help you with referrals to local community
programs and services, dementia-related education, crisis assistance,
and emotional support. Care consultations are provided by specialists
and clinicians.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Association may be the oldest organization focusing
on this disease, but it’s certainly not the only one. In fact, there are
many local organizations that are not part of the Alzheimer’s
Association that do great work and provide a wealth of resources. A list
of some of the finest institutions for diagnosing, treating, and
researching dementia and, in some instances, other brain-related
ailments like Parkinson’s and stroke follows. This is not an exhaustive
list, so don’t hesitate to check out places near you that a friend or
your doctor can vouch for. In addition, the National Institute on Aging
keeps an online directory of all the research centers it collaborates
with across the nation.</p>
<p>AARP maintains a comprehensive library of resources for people living
with dementia (aarp.org/disruptdementia) as well as for their caregivers
(aarp.org/caregiving) where, by answering three quick questions,
caregivers can get personalized information and resources based on their
specific concerns. Partnering with the Alzheimer’s Association, AARP
also has a community resource finder for social and medical services,
housing, and programs that can be your link to local support services.

<p>The Dementia Action Alliance is a national advocacy and education
organization of people living with dementia. This is an extraordinary
organization that aims to take the stigma and misperceptions out of the
disease and give people the tools to live courageously and purposefully
with the disability. When I spoke with some of the members of its board
of directors, I was moved by their perspective on how to speak about
dementia and communicate with patients using positive, hopeful terms.
They use the word carepartners in place of caregivers, and highlight
that it’s not about surviving the disease—rather, it’s about thriving.
Some community members feel that life is actually better after their
diagnosis because it opens doors and creates new opportunities. See me,
not my dementia is one of their mottos. Check out the alliance’s site
and the resources available online at daanow.org. It publishes two small
handbooks: one for the person diagnosed, and the other for family and
friends.</p>
<p>The Family Caregiver Alliance has been around for more than forty
years, but it’s poised to expand its reaches and visibility as it
promotes new programs that help connect institutions and health care
providers with its evidence-based Best Practice Caregiving solutions for
high-quality dementia care. It supports a searchable database of
effective programs for family caregivers of persons with dementia. The
goal is to increase knowledge and adoption of non-drug, evidence-based
programs for family and friend caregivers by health care and community
service organizations. It ultimately helps individuals and families
gather the information they need and find programs in their area that
can help with managing a diagnosis. www.caregiver.org.</p>

<p>In Their Words</p>
<p>Brian Van Buren is a hero in the dementia community and someone who
is not about to give up. Diagnosed in 2015 with early-onset Alzheimer’s
at the age of sixty-four, he’s living with the disease and has become an
outspoken advocate for the African-American and LGBTQ communities—places
where dementia is sadly stigmatized and hushed. I was charmed by his
candor and humor when I spoke with him. “I came out in the 1970s not
knowing I’d have to come out again when I was diagnosed with dementia,”
he candidly told me. Brian wears a button every day that says “Living
with Dementia,” and it’s quite the conversation starter. He’s on the
board at the Dementia Action Alliance and is a frequent speaker at
large-scale events and on radio shows. Life does not end after the
diagnosis, he told me. It doesn’t have to be a death sentence and the
idea that you should “go home and get your affairs in order” is not the
view to focus on—at least not initially. You will go through a grieving
process at first and then carry on with knowledge about what to do.
Brian stays centered with the help of a life coach who specializes in
dementia and he participates in what’s called couch surfing, a homestay
program. People from around the world visit him and have a place to stay
for a few nights for free. He’s enjoyed the company of more than one
hundred guests and will continue to host for as long as he can.</p>
<p>THE FUTURE</p>
<p>There’s a lot that can be done to delay the progression of the
illness. I can’t repeat this enough: Early detection is critical. You
may be wondering why this is so important given the lack of effective
drugs or a cure. I have found that it can be reassuring to family
members when a loved one is diagnosed, even if it is Alzheimer’s
disease, because it is finally an answer at the end of an often long and
confusing journey. It enables people living with dementia to participate
in their care plan and express their views on what they want and need
before it becomes too difficult for them to communicate with their
health care providers and loved ones. It also allows planning for the
future, including logistics and the cost of care. Early diagnosis may
also make someone more eligible for certain clinical trials, which is
critical for future effective treatments. The goal should be to enable
the person with dementia—not disable them. People with dementia still
have a lot to offer and can continue to learn new things. It is
sometimes possible for people to live twenty years or so after the first
symptoms appear. Rates of progression differ widely, and in the future,
people will realize that we can manage the symptoms so people can live
as well as possible for as long as possible. People living with dementia
can do a lot to improve their quality of life. Again, engaging them in
the care planning process is critical to enable health care providers to
deliver person-centered care that can dramatically improve health
outcomes and the quality of care.</p>
<p>Just a few decades ago, nobody wanted to talk about cancer; today
cancer patients take pride in talking about their illness and forging
ahead with hope and resolve. We’ve destigmatized cancer and developed
strategies for treating each cancer patient individually based on their
particular cancer, values, resources, and family dynamics. We are on the
cusp of revolutionizing how we view and treat dementia, improving
people’s experience with it—from the patients to the caregivers. There
is also a lot that people living with dementia can do to improve their
quality of life and delay the progression of the illness. Engaging them
in the care-planning process is critical to enable health care providers
to deliver person-centered care that can dramatically improve health
outcomes and the quality of care.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that delaying the onset of dementia by only five years
can cut the incidence rate in half, vastly improving life and well-being
for people and reducing health care costs for families and society. Over
the next few years, I believe there will be significant progress in
early detection techniques for Alzheimer’s with the help of technologies
like artificial intelligence and big data mining to find biomarkers.
Such biomarkers can range from the usual suspects like certain lab tests
to novel findings like losing one’s sense of smell. New research
suggests that having a weak sense of smell could be an early warning
sign of cognitive decline. The neurodegeneration that occurs with these
ailments affects brain circuits linked to our olfactory system. Testing
someone’s sense of smell using common scents—clove, leather, lilac,
smoke, soap, grape, lemon—is inexpensive and noninvasive and may lead to
new therapies.</p>
<p>Blood tests for dementia may come sooner than previously thought—even
within the next few years. Scientists are inching closer to such tests
that can help screen people for possible signs hidden in the blood that
may not come with outward signs of a problem. A blood test is a lot more
economical and easier to perform than other tools that involve brain
scans and spinal fluid tests. If you can know a potential diagnosis
years ahead of developing symptoms of a brain disorder, that could
change your brain’s future with interventions you can execute right
away.</p>
<p>Q: Should I take a dementia screening test at home today that I can
buy online or download? And what about getting a brain scan?</p>
<p>A: A number of these tests have come on the market targeting
consumers and they don’t require a doctor to prescribe or even oversee.
None of these tests have been scientifically proven to be accurate and
should be met with caution. The last thing you want to get is a
false-positive, meaning the results say you have dementia when you do
not. False-positives are highly unlikely when you visit a physician to
seek a potential diagnosis. Avoid these kinds of tests, even if they are
tempting. Anyone should be evaluated within the context of an ongoing
relationship with a health care professional.</p>
<p>As far as PET (positron-emission tomography) brain scans go, again
you may want to hold off on paying for such tests. Not only are these
expensive (neither Medicare nor private insurers cover their costs,
which can be between ,000 and ,000), but they can have unintended
consequences. Positive scans that detect amyloid plaques do not mean you
will go on to develop dementia, yet they can lead to costly and
ineffective treatments. Negative scans do not mean you won’t develop the
disease. Interestingly, biostatisticians at UCLA have calculated that a
seventy-five-year-old man with amyloid has a little more than a 17
percent lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia; for a woman
that age, her changes are about 24 percent with a longer life
expectancy.9 Until these tests become more reliable and useful, leave
them for the researchers using them in clinical laboratory settings.</p>
<p>TREATMENTS: DRUG-BASED AND PEOPLE-BASED</p>
<p>The complexity of dementia makes it uniquely difficult to treat, more
so than just about anything else in the world of neuroscience. We have
little in our arsenal to combat the disease once it has taken hold and
begun its march forward. The two FDA-approved classes of drugs to lessen
symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease aim to keep brain cells communicating
with one another so the brain can function normally, but these
medications are far from a promising therapy and come with their own
side effects. They can temporarily improve symptoms of memory loss and
problems with thinking and reasoning, but they lose their effectiveness
as the disease progresses. In other words, these treatments don’t stop
the underlying decline and death of brain cells; they just throw some
obstacles in the way to buy time.</p>
<p>The first class of drugs encompasses cholinesterase inhibitors, which
work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine and keeping it at
healthy levels. Acetylcholine, you may recall, is an important
neurotransmitter in the brain, responsible for sending signals in the
nervous system and plays a key role in memory. (By contrast,
anticholinergics block the action of acetylcholine. So, to be clear,
cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergics having opposing effects
in the body.) In clinical trials, cholinesterase inhibitors show modest
effects against the functional and cognitive decline of people with
Alzheimer’s disease. You might know these medications by their more
common brand names: Aricept, Exelon, and Razadyne. Acetylcholine breaks
down naturally in everyone, but the process is much worse in people with
Alzheimer’s, who have low levels of acetylcholine in their brain.</p>
<p>The second type of treatment is an NMDA receptor antagonist that also
works primarily by keeping lines of communication open between brain
cells. The drug, memantine (Namenda), regulates the activity of
glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions such
as learning and memory. Glutamate is critical because when brain cells
are damaged by Alzheimer’s disease, they pump out too much of it, which
damages even more brain cells.</p>
<p>These two types of drugs often are prescribed together, especially in
later stages of the disease. Other drugs can also be prescribed to treat
symptoms from other conditions based on an individual’s diagnosis.
Someone with mood disorders and sleep disturbance on top of a form of
dementia may benefit from additional medications, for example. The
tricky part, of course, is knowing which drugs to use in combination
without a worsening of side effects or a canceling-out effect. People
with Parkinson’s disease, for instance, may benefit from an
anticholinergic for controlling tremors, but not at the risk of speeding
up Alzheimer’s disease. There is growing concern that if someone is
taking both types of drugs—cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergic
medications—they will antagonize each other, and neither will work.</p>
<p>In 2018, the FDA announced revised guidelines for neurological
disorders that will make clinical drug trials for preclinical
Alzheimer’s easier to conduct. This represents a major policy shift that
the FDA hopes will lead to better treatment at the earliest stages of
the disease, where medical intervention is most promising. Such trials
should also lead to better treatments that stop or delay the disease
process before it progresses.</p>
<p>Another hopeful note is the Coalition Against Major Diseases, an
alliance of pharmaceutical companies, nonprofit foundations, and
government advisers that has forged a partnership to share data from
Alzheimer’s clinical trials. It has also collaborated with the Clinical
Data Interchange Standards Consortium to create data standards. Data
sharing can speed research and drug development. As you read this,
researchers are hard at work trying to come up with effective therapies.
Until we have reliable solutions, one thing top scientists agree on is
that when a diagnosis comes in and someone is suffering from a
neurodegenerative condition, you don’t give up. Like Sandy Halperin, you
can become a voice, an advocate, and a model patient.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that “treatment” may not come in the
form of a super drug. Treatment can be the quality of care and the
lifestyle plan that’s set upon diagnosis. How a person is cared for by a
loved one—the person who is the guide or shepherd through the process—is
critical to how a patient progresses. Effective interventions to improve
quality of life are growing, though they need to be radically
accelerated. “High-quality dementia care” may sound like an oxymoron,
but it doesn’t have to be—especially with the aid of the Internet that
can connect people around the world and build communities like those
supported by Dementia Friendly America, the Dementia Action Alliance,
and other organizations. There’s a movement away from the “nothing can
be done” mentality that has unfortunately stained this area of medicine
for far too long and, frankly, set it back. Katie Maslow is excited
about the prospects of these new programs. As a former
scholar-in-residence at the Institute of Medicine, veteran
policy-related researcher for the Alzheimer’s Association, and now
visiting scholar at the Gerontological Society of America, she knows a
thing or two about best practices for managing dementia. She echoes what
other experts have told me: Each patient must be treated individually
because everyone is different. What works for one person might not help
another. The drumbeat message of “search for the cure” eclipses other
areas where we should be paying attention—places where we can
proactively keep people in stable, early stages of the disease and
improve their experience and quality of life.</p>
<p>Dr. David Reuben is a gerontologist at UCLA who holds many
credentials. In addition to his role as Chief of the Division of
Geriatrics Medicine and Professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA, he maintains a clinical primary care practice and also directs
the UCLA Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center and the
UCLA Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care program, which I mentioned in the
list of programs where you can find help. Like all the other experts I
spoke with, Dr. Reuben emphasizes the importance of an individualized
approach to taking care of patients with dementia and focusing on “the
dyad”—the patient and the caregiver. Cookie-cutter approaches are not
going to work; tailoring the intervention to a patient’s disease,
personal resources, and goals are what leads to better outcomes and
higher quality of life. And even though many caregivers find the job
gratifying, that doesn’t mean it’s stress-free. As we’ll see in this
next chapter, managing the primary caregiver’s health is just as
important as managing the person with dementia. There will be a lot of
twists and turns and no one can prepare for it all. According to
Dr. Reuben, when it comes to a person’s experience with dementia, the
most important person is not the doctor—it’s the caregiver.</p>
