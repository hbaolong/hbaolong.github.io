<h4 id="in-this-book">IN THIS BOOK</h4>
<p>For most of us, our brains are probably working at 50 percent
capacity at any given time. That is my own made-up number. I don’t know
exactly how much it is (and neither does anyone else), but it is clear
that with various behavior interventions such as meditation training or
regular sound sleep, our brains can be put into hyperdrive status (and
no, we of course don’t use just 10 percent of our brains—see chapter 3).
<strong>We know our brain can crank out a lot more torque than it is
normally doing.</strong> So are our brains more like the mother whose
child is pinned under a car and she displays superhuman strength to save
him? Or are our brains high-performance Ferraris sputtering along on
potholed neighborhood roads and hardly ever opening up to full throttle?
I think it is the latter. We don’t hit the open road enough with our
exquisitely designed brains, and after a while, we forget what our
brains are really capable of achieving.</p>
<p>You will read some car references in this book because they reflect
the way I was raised. Both of my parents were in the auto industry; my
mom was the first woman ever hired as an engineer by Ford Motor Company.
So on my childhood weekends, often the whole family was tinkering with
the family car. Our garage was filled with toolboxes and a running
commentary about how the human body wasn’t really that much different
from the Ford LTD we were rebuilding. Both had engines, pumps, and
life-sustaining fuel. I think those conversations contributed to my
interest in the brain, because here was one area of the body that really
couldn’t be compared mechanically to a car. After all, there is no seat
of consciousness in a car, no matter how plush the leather. Still, it is
nearly impossible for me to look at the brain and not think about tuning
up and maintenance. Is an oil change necessary? Is it getting the right
fuel? Is it revving too high or being driven without a break? Are there
cracks in the windshield or the chassis, and do all the tires have
enough air pressure? Can it heat and cool properly? Does the engine
respond appropriately to a sudden demand for speed, and how quickly can
it be brought to a halt?</p>
<p>Part 1 starts with some basic facts. What exactly is a brain? What is
it like to operate on one? What does it really look and feel like? Why
is it so mysterious and hard to understand? How does memory work? What
is the difference between normal brain aging and the occasional brain
lapse, abnormal brain aging, and signs of serious decline? Then we’ll
take a deep dive into the myths about aging and cognitive decline, as
well as how we know the brain can remodel, rewire, and grow.</p>
<p>Part 2 offers a tour of the five main categories that encompass all
the practical strategies you need to protect and heighten your brain
function: 1) exercise and movement; 2) sense of purpose, learning, and
discovery; 3) sleep and relaxation; 4) nutrition; and 5) social
connection. This part includes a look at some of the research going on
now to explore the brain and find ways to better maintain and treat it.
You’ll meet top scientists who have dedicated their lives to decoding
the mysteries of the brain. Each chapter offers science-backed ideas you
can adapt to your own preferences and lifestyle. Part 2 ends with a
brand-new and easy-to-follow twelve-week program to carry out the steps
I suggest.</p>
<p>Part 3 takes a look at the challenges of diagnosing and treating
brain diseases. What should you do if you notice the early signs? Are
they symptoms of another health condition that mimics dementia? Why have
our research and clinical trials failed so miserably in coming up with
cures and drugs to treat neurodegenerative ailments? What treatments are
available at all levels of severity? How can a spouse remain healthy
while caring for a partner with dementia (caregivers have a much higher
risk of developing the disease)? Dementia is a moving target; caring for
someone with the disease can be one of the most challenging jobs ever
undertaken. No one learns in formal schooling how to deal with a loved
one whose brain is in irreversible decline. For some, the brain changes
are slow and subtle, taking years or even more than a decade for
symptoms to become pronounced; for others, it’s sudden and rapid. Both
circumstances can be difficult and unpredictable. In addition to
covering evidence-based care that improves quality of life and makes the
caregiving manageable, I’ll also review highly treatable conditions
caregivers should be on the lookout for that are often mistaken for
Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll look to the future, for this book ends on a high note.
There is tremendous hope for the neurological conditions we still
struggle with today (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, depression,
anxiety, panic disorders). I have no doubt that in the next ten to
twenty years, we will be much further along when it comes to treating
brain disorders. We may even have a successful therapy or preventive
vaccine for Alzheimer’s disease. Many of the advances may come from gene
and stem cell therapy, along with deep brain stimulation, which is
already being used for depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. We
will also advance further technically, allowing a more minimally
invasive approach to the brain. I’ll explain what this all means for you
and offer ideas to help prepare for this future. Many of the messages in
this book are also directed at helping younger generations care for
their own brain health since brain-related illnesses often start decades
before symptoms show up. If I knew in my younger years what I know now,
there are many things I would’ve done to take care of my own brain
differently. You won’t make the same mistakes I made.</p>
<p>I like an adage I once heard in Okinawa: “I want to live my life like
an incandescent lightbulb. Burn brightly my entire life, and then one
day suddenly go out.” We want the same for our brains. We don’t want the
flickering of fluorescent lightbulbs that signal their impending demise.
When we think of old age, we think of hospital beds and forgotten
memories. Neither needs to happen, and your brain is the one organ that
can get stronger as you age. There’s nothing brainy about it—anyone can
build a better brain at any age.</p>
<p>In a way, writing this book has been a selfish experience. I’ve had
the privilege of going to specialists all over the world and getting
their insights and action plans to keep my brain sharp and do all I can
to prevent my brain from declining. Along the way, I’ve picked up on
strategies to also be more productive, feel less overwhelmed, and
generally navigate through life with ease and joy. I’ve been sharing
this knowledge with everyone I hold near and dear to me. Now I want the
same for you. Welcome to the Keep Sharp community.</p>
<p>Let’s get started with a self-assessment.</p>
