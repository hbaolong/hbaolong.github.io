<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Nothing Brainy about It</p>
<p>The brain is wider than the sky… [and]… deeper than the sea.</p>
<p>EMILY DICKINSON</p>
<p>Unlike most of my colleagues, I didn’t grow up with a deep-seated
desire to be a doctor, let alone a brain surgeon. My earliest aspiration
was to be a writer, likely triggered by a boyhood crush I had on a grade
school English teacher. When I chose medicine, I was thirteen years old
and my grandfather had just suffered a stroke. We were very close, and
witnessing his brain function change so quickly was jarring. He was
suddenly unable to speak or write but seemed to understand what people
said and could read without difficulty. Simply put, he could receive
verbal and written communication easily, but he could not respond in
those same ways. It was the first time I became fascinated by the
intricate and mysterious functioning of the brain. I spent a lot of time
at the hospital and was that annoying kid who asked the doctors a lot of
questions. I felt very grown up as they patiently explained what had
happened. I watched as those doctors were able to return my grandfather
to good health after opening up his carotid artery to restore the blood
flow to his brain and prevent future strokes. Having never spent much
time with surgeons before then, I was hooked. I started reading
everything I could about medicine and the human body. Before long, I was
fixated on the brain, and specifically memory. It still astonishes me
that our memories—the very fabric of who we are—can be reduced to
invisible neurochemical signals between tiny areas of the brain. For me,
those early explorations into the world of brain biology were at once
demystifying and magical.</p>
<p>Years later, when I was in medical school in the early 1990s,
conventional wisdom was that brain cells, such as neurons, were
incapable of regenerating. We were born with a fixed set and that was
it; throughout life, we’d slowly drain the cache (and accelerate that
killing off with bad habits like drinking too much alcohol and smoking
marijuana—the truth about that later). Perhaps it was the eternal
optimist in me, but I never believed that our brain cells simply stopped
growing and regenerating. After all, we continue to have novel thoughts,
deep experiences, vivid memories, and new learning throughout our lives.
It seemed to me that the brain wouldn’t just wither away unless it was
no longer being used. By the time I finished my neurosurgery training in
2000, there was plenty of evidence that we could nurture the birth of
new brain cells (called neurogenesis) and even increase the size of our
brains. It was a staggeringly optimistic change in how we view the
master control system of our bodies. Indeed, every day of your life, you
can make your brain better, faster, fitter, and, yes, sharper. I am
convinced of that. (I’ll get to the bad habits later; they don’t
necessarily kill brain cells, but when they are abused, they can alter
the brain, especially its memory powers.)</p>
<p>Let me say at the outset: I am certainly a fan of excellent
education, but this is not what Keep Sharp is all about. This book is
less about improving intelligence or IQ and more about both propagating
new brain cells and making the ones you have work more efficiently. This
isn’t so much about remembering a list of items, performing well on
exams, or executing tasks adeptly (though all of those goals will be
more achievable with a better brain). In Keep Sharp, you will learn to
build a brain that connects patterns others might miss and helps you
better navigate life. You will develop a brain able to toggle back and
forth between short-term and long-term views of the world and, perhaps
most important, a brain highly resilient in the face of life experiences
that might be disabling to someone else. In this book, I will precisely
define resilience and teach you how to nurture it. Resilience has been a
critical ingredient for my own personal growth.</p>
<p>Context matters when talking about something as important as the
function or dysfunction of our brains, and our view of cognitive decline
has changed dramatically over time. The history of documenting dementia
dates back to at least 1550 BCE, when Egyptian doctors first described
the disorder in what’s known as the Ebers Papyrus, a 110-page scroll or
manuscript that contains a record of ancient Egyptian medicine. But it
was not until 1797 that the phenomenon was given a name, dementia, which
literally means “out of one’s mind” in Latin. The term was coined by a
French psychiatrist, Philippe Pinel, who is revered as the father of
modern psychiatry for his efforts to push for a more humane approach to
the care of psychiatric patients. When the word was first used, however,
dementia referred to people with an intellectual deficit (“abolition of
thinking”) at any age. It was not until the end of the nineteenth
century that the word was confined to people with a specific loss of
cognitive ability. During that century, the British physician Dr. James
Cowles Prichard also introduced the term senile dementia in his book, A
Treatise on Insanity. The word senile, which means old, referred to any
type of insanity that occurs in old people. Because memory loss is one
of the most prominent symptoms of dementia, the word became mostly
associated with old age.</p>
<p>For a long time, the elderly with dementia were believed to be
cursed, or to have an infection like syphilis (because the symptoms of
syphilis can be similar). So the word dementia was considered
pejorative, used as an insult. In fact, when I first told my kids I was
writing this book, they asked if it was about dementors, the dark,
soul-sucking creatures from Harry Potter. The idea that dementia, which
is not a specific disease but a group of symptoms associated with memory
loss and poor judgment, is sometimes thought of in such negative ways is
worth addressing briefly here.</p>
<p>It is true that scientists and doctors use the word clinically, and
it is also true that patients and their loved ones don’t always know
what to make of it, especially when they first receive the diagnosis. It
is too imprecise, for one thing. Dementia can be a spectrum, ranging
from mild to severe, and some of the causes of dementia are entirely
reversible. Alzheimer’s disease, which accounts for more than half the
cases of dementia, gets nearly all the attention, and as a result, the
terms dementia and Alzheimer’s are often used interchangeably. They
shouldn’t be. The word dementia, however, is steeped in our common
vernacular, and so is the association with Alzheimer’s disease. In this
book, I use both terms with the hope that the conversation, and the
words we use to describe the broad condition of cognitive decline, will
shift in the future.</p>
<p>I believe there has been an overemphasis on Alzheimer’s disease as a
way to talk about this broad condition, and it has further fueled a
widespread sense of fear that memory loss is inevitable as we get older.
Perfectly healthy people in their thirties and forties are alarmed about
the implications of common memory lapses, like misplacing their keys or
forgetting someone’s name. That is a misguided fear, and as you will
learn, memory loss is not a preordained part of aging.</p>
<p>As I started traveling the world talking to people about this book, I
realized something else extraordinary. According to an AARP survey of
Americans aged thirty-four to seventy-five, nearly everyone (93 percent)
understands the vital importance of brain health, but those same people
typically have no idea how to make their brains healthier or that
achieving such a goal is even possible. Most believe this mysterious
organ encased in bone is a black box of sorts, untouchable and incapable
of being improved. Not true. The brain can be continuously and
consistently enriched throughout your life no matter your age or access
to resources. I have opened the black box and touched the human brain,
and I will tell you all about those extraordinary experiences in this
book. As a result of this training and decades of additional learning, I
am more convinced than ever that the brain can be constructively
changed—enhanced and fine-tuned. Just consider that. You probably think
of your muscles that way—even your heart, which is a muscle. If you are
reading this book, you are someone who is probably already proactive
about your physical health. It is time to realize the same is possible
with your brain. You can affect your brain’s thinking and memory far
more than you realize or appreciate, and the vast majority of people
haven’t even begun to try. Keep Sharp is going to help you design your
own “sharp brain” program, which you can easily incorporate into your
daily life. I have already done it myself, and I am excited to teach you
to do it as well.</p>
<p>As an academic neurosurgeon and a reporter, a big part of my job is
to educate and explain. I have learned that in order for my messages to
stick, explaining the why of something is just as important as the what
or the how. So throughout this book, I explain why your brain works the
way it does and why it sometimes fails to deliver what you’d hoped. Once
you understand these inner workings, the specific habits I encourage you
to adopt will make sense and more likely become an effortless part of
your routine.</p>
<p>Truth is, even when it comes to our general physical health, there is
very little explanation in public discourse of how our bodies actually
work and what makes them work better. Even worse, there is a lack of
agreement among medical professionals about the best foods to eat, the
types of activities we should pursue, or the amount of sleep we really
need. It is part of the reason there are so many conflicting messages
out there. Coffee is practically a superfood one day, and the next it’s
a potential carcinogen. Gluten is hotly debated continuously. Curcumin,
found in turmeric, is touted as a miracle brain food, but what does that
really mean? Statins seem to have a split personality, at least in the
research circles: Some studies propose that statins lower risk for
dementia and improve cognitive function, and other studies suggest the
exact opposite. Vitamin D supplementation is constantly under fire too;
some people swear by it, but study after study shows no benefit.</p>
<p>How does the average person make sense of the competing messages?
Almost everyone agrees that toxins and pathogens from mercury to mold
are bad for you, but what about certain artificial ingredients or even
your own tap water? A new Canadian study showed that the fluoride in tap
water consumed by pregnant mothers can lead to a small drop in their
children’s IQ later in life.1 But fluorinated water also clearly has
benefits for oral health and is still recommended by most top medical
associations. It can be confusing. On top of all that, just about every
doctor’s visit ends with the blanket, generic recommendation that you
should “get plenty of rest, eat right, and exercise.” Sound familiar?
Sure, it’s good advice, but the problem is that there is hardly any
consensus on what that means from a highly practical, day-by-day
standpoint. What is the ideal diet, and how does it change from person
to person? How about activity? High intensity, or slow and steady? Does
everyone really need seven to eight hours of sleep a night, or can some
people do just fine with far less? Why? Which drugs and supplements
should one consider, given individual risk factors? And with brain
health in particular, there is an even greater lack of basic
understanding by both patients and the medical community. Has a doctor
ever told you to take good care of your brain besides reminding you of
the importance of wearing a helmet when riding a bike? Probably not.</p>
<p>Well, this doctor is going to tell you what you need to know and show
you how to do it. If you think this already sounds complicated, don’t
worry. I am going to take you through step-by-step. You will understand
more about your brain than you ever have in the past, and the ways to
keep it healthy will make complete sense by the time you finish this
book. Think of this as a master class on how to build a better brain,
which opens the door to whatever you want to get out of life—including
being a better father, mother, daughter, or son. You can be more
productive and joyful, as well as more present for everyone with whom
you interact. You will also develop more of that critical ingredient,
resilience, so the optimization of your brain isn’t derailed by the
trials of daily life. These goals are all far more connected than you
may realize.</p>
<p>Believing you can always be better tomorrow is an audacious way to
view the world, but one that has helped shape my own life. Since I was a
teenager, I’ve always worked hard on my physical health—to make my body
stronger, faster, and more resilient to illness and injury. I think
everyone has different motivations for taking care of their own health.
For many, it is to feel better and more productive, and to be there for
the children. For others, it is about achieving a certain physical
appearance. As we get older, the inspiration often comes from a brush
with mortality and seeing the fragility of life up close. That was the
case for me. When my father was just forty-seven years old, he developed
crushing chest pain while out on a walk. I remember the panicked call I
received from my mom, and the voice of the 911 operator I spoke to
seconds later. A few hours later, he had an emergency four-vessel bypass
operation on his heart. It was a frightening ordeal for our family, and
we were worried he might not survive the operation. I was a young
medical student at the time and fairly convinced I had somehow failed
him. After all, I should’ve seen the warning signs, counseled him on his
health, and helped him avoid heart disease. Luckily he survived, and the
near-miss completely changed his life. He lost thirty pounds, paid close
attention to the foods he was eating, and made regular activity a
priority.</p>
<p>Now that I am past that age with my own children, I make it a
priority to learn not just how to prevent disease, but to continually
assess myself to make sure I’m performing to the best of my ability.
Over the past few decades, I have also been exploring the deep
connection between the heart and the brain. It is true that what is good
for one is also good for the other, but I now believe the secret is that
it all begins with your brain. As you are about to learn, once your
brain is running cleanly and smoothly, everything else follows. You will
make better decisions, have improved resilience and a more optimistic
attitude, and the physical part of your body will improve too. There are
studies showing that your pain tolerance will increase, your need for
medications will decrease, and your ability to heal will be accelerated.
Nearly every doctor I have spoken to about this book has said some
variation of the following: In order to best take care of your body, you
have to first take care of your mind. It is true, and the best part is
that it is not that hard to do. Think of it as periodic little tweaks
and adjustments instead of wholesale changes in your life.</p>
<p>Before I explain what those tweaks are and why they work, I offer my
philosophy when it comes to the tone of this book. Over the years, I
have worked in many different areas of our society: academic
neurosurgery jobs within universities; public service at the White
House; as a journalist in media organizations; as a husband and father
of three strong, smart, and beautiful girls. All along I have stuck to a
principle I learned at a young age: Don’t try to inspire people with
fear. It doesn’t work well, and it doesn’t last long. When you scare
someone, you activate that person’s amygdala, the emotional center of
the brain. The reaction is swift and hot, as one would have when
confronted with a threat. The problem is that an action that starts in
the emotional centers of the brain bypasses the judgment and executive
function areas of the brain as well. As a result, the reaction may be
intense and immediate, but it is also often uncoordinated and transient.
It is why telling people they will likely have a heart attack if they
don’t lose weight may lead to a single intense week of dieting and
exercise followed by an abrupt return to the old bad habits. Fear-based
messaging will never lead to a long-term effective strategy because it
is not the way we are wired. Nowhere is this more important than when
telling someone he or she might develop Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Many polls consistently show that people fear losing their minds more
than anything else, even death. For many, it is considered the bogeyman
of old age. And at one point in my life, I also worried a great deal
about cognitive decline and dementia as I watched another grandparent
progress through the stages of Alzheimer’s disease. At first, he seemed
to be contributing to conversations in nonsensical ways. Because he was
a fun-loving, quick-to-laugh sort of guy, we thought perhaps he was
making jokes we weren’t quite in on yet. What finally gave him away was
the vacant stare that would turn to puzzlement, and then to panic, as he
realized he could not recall how to perform the most basic tasks and
execute plans. I will never forget that look—at least I hope to never
forget it.</p>
<p>But again, the fear of dementia should not be the motivation for you
to read this book. Instead, it should be the knowledge that you can
build a better brain at any age. I will teach you how to do it and
explain why these strategies work. As you read this book, I don’t want
you to be running away from something. I want you to be running toward
something—running toward a brain in peak shape that can withstand the
test of your time on this planet.</p>
<p>When I started my work as a neurosurgeon more than twenty-five years
ago, the idea of “improving” my own brain seemed like a bit of a
misguided quest. After all, I was trained to remove tumors, clip
aneurysms, relieve pressure from collections of blood and fluid, and so
on. Even today, it is not possible for any neurosurgeon to go inside a
human brain and adjust the 100 billion or so neurons to make the organ
more intelligent and less vulnerable to decline. While heart surgeons
can rotor away plaques in the heart, I can’t rotor away the brain
tangles often associated with Alzheimer’s disease. There is no operation
or medication to cure dementia or render someone more brilliant,
creative, equipped with an extraordinary memory, or poised to invent the
next big thing the world needs.</p>
<p>The brain is unlike any other organ. You can’t transplant a brain
like you can a heart (or liver, or kidney, or face for that matter), and
our knowledge of the brain is still in the early stages, continuing to
develop and expand. I had an astonishing realization recently while
moderating a panel for the American Academy of Neurological Surgery,
with the world’s experts on concussion. They came from medicine, the
Department of Defense, and the tech world. While they all talked about
the great strides we have made in awareness, astonishingly there was no
clear agreement on how to best treat a concussion, a condition diagnosed
millions of times every year in the United States. There was hardly any
published data presented to the Academy on effective treatments, either.
Many current recommendations are based only on anecdotal evidence.2 Even
topics like rest—how much and for how long you rest a brain touched by
concussion—were debated. For example, do you minimize activities that
require concentration and attention during recovery from a concussion or
increase those activities? When does light exercise, such as speed
walking on a treadmill, help rather than hinder the recovery process? I
heard all kinds of opinions, but very little of it was evidence based.
And remember: That panel was made up of the world experts on brain
injury.</p>
<p>Sure, we’ve come a long way from the ancient days of Aristotle, who
thought the heart was the seat of intelligence and the brain was a kind
of refrigerator that cooled off the fiery heart and hot blood, but there
are still more questions about the brain than answers. We now know how
actions are created and how thoughts are formed, and we can even
identify the hippocampus, the two tiny seahorse-shaped structures in the
brain essential for memory function. But we still haven’t made much
progress in stemming the tide of people with cognitive decline and
dementia. While we enjoy lower rates of cardiovascular disease and
certain cancers than a generation ago, the numbers are going in the
other direction when it comes to brain-related impairment. According to
a 2017 study out of the University of California, Los Angeles, 47
million Americans have some evidence of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,
which means their brains show signs of adverse changes but symptoms have
not yet developed. Oftentimes, it could still take years before their
memory, thinking, and behavior are obviously affected.3 The problem is
we don’t necessarily know who those 47 million people are and which ones
will go on to develop full-blown Alzheimer’s disease. We do know,
however, that by 2060, the number of Americans with Alzheimer’s dementia
or cognitive impairment is expected to climb from 6 million to 15
million.4 One new case of dementia will be diagnosed every four seconds,
and it will be the most common neurodegenerative disorder of our time.
Globally, the numbers of people living with Alzheimer’s disease will
swell to 152 million by 2050, which reflects a 200 percent increase
since 2018. While science is steadily trying to push back, there still
hasn’t been a single new treatment since 2002 despite more than four
hundred clinical trials for the disease.5 That’s why the gap between
brain science and good therapeutics in drug discovery for brain
disorders has been called the “valley of death.”6 That’s the bad
news.</p>
<p>The good news is that even without some major medical breakthrough,
we can significantly optimize our brains in a variety of ways to improve
its functionality, boost its neuronal networks, stimulate the growth of
new neurons, and help stave off age-related brain illnesses. As you read
this book, always remember this: Cognitive decline is not inevitable. As
an analogy, think of a historical building that still stands. Perhaps
it’s more than a century old. Had it not been cared for throughout the
decades, the wear and tear of weather and constant use would have
certainly caused its deterioration and dilapidation. But with routine
maintenance and occasional renovations, it not only withstood the test
of time but is likely celebrated for its beauty, significance, and
prominence. The same holds true with your brain, which is just another
structure of different components and input needs for general
maintenance and upkeep. Some of the strategies I will teach you will
help assemble brain scaffolding—creating a support structure for your
brain that is stronger and more stable than what you currently have and
will help you to perform some initial “renovations,” including
reinforcement of your brain’s “foundation.” Other strategies will act to
provide the raw materials necessary to do ongoing maintenance, as well
as build what’s called “cognitive reserve,” or what scientists call
“brain resiliency.” With more cognitive reserve, you can lower your risk
of developing dementia. Finally, there will be strategies that serve as
finishing daily touches akin to dusting and tidying up to keep the
better brain—better. As I mentioned, the old-school thinking dictated
that the brain was pretty much fixed and hardwired after childhood
development. Today, as we visualize the brain with new imaging
technologies and study its ever changing function, we know the
truth.</p>
<p>When you think of your heart, you probably have a good idea of things
that might damage it: certain types of food, lack of activity, elevated
cholesterol. But what about your brain? While many of those same things
apply, your brain is also a highly sensitive antenna taking in millions
of stimuli every day, and how we process these inputs can make a world
of difference when it comes to a sharper brain. For example, I know many
people who are absolutely crushed by events in the news, while others
are emboldened and undaunted. Your brain can be strengthened by what you
experience, like a good workout, or it can be battered and defeated.
What separates those two camps of people? The answer is resilience. A
resilient brain can withstand ongoing trauma, think differently, stave
off brain-related illnesses including depression, and retain cognitive
memory for peak performance.</p>
<p>Moreover, possessing a resilient brain is what separates strategic,
visionary thinkers from more average ones. It is not necessarily IQ or
even educational level. It is the ability to improve the brain from
challenging experiences instead of shrinking it. Now those capabilities
alone should be enough to motivate you to build a better brain. If
you’re looking to achieve your greatest potential, this book is for you.
If you’re hoping to gain insights into preventing the cognitive decline
or dementia that affected someone in your family, this book is for you.
(We know now that diseases like Alzheimer’s start twenty to thirty years
before any symptoms develop, so young people need to heed these
lessons.) And if you’re just seeking strategies to maximize brain health
so that you can enjoy life to the fullest and be “unreasonably
productive” no matter how young you are, this book also is for you.
Whether you are dealing with a chronic disease or are an elite athlete,
tomorrow can be better. Truth is, most of us—myself included—have not
done nearly enough to improve ourselves. While writing this book, I
tried everything I am recommending to you, and my brain has never been
sharper. I want the same for you, and I will convince you that even
small, incremental tweaks can have huge payoffs.</p>
<p>In 2017, I began collaborating with AARP (which changed its name from
the “American Association of Retired Persons” because it speaks to a
broader audience now and a lot of people never “retire”). Like me, AARP
detects a sense of urgency around this book. They know that people are
afraid of aging brains and of losing not only their cognition but also
their freedom to live independently. AARP has established the Global
Council on Brain Health to bring together scientists, health
professionals, scholars, and policy experts from around the world. The
goal is to gather the best possible advice about what we can be doing to
maintain and improve brain health. The Council is chaired by Dr. Marilyn
Albert, professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine and director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the Global Council has brought together ninety-four
experts from twenty-three different countries and eighty different
universities and organizations to reach a consensus on the state of the
science. Together with fifty liaisons from government and not-for-profit
organizations, the Global Council has produced a library of reports
distilling evidence on how lifestyle and modifiable risk factors can
impact brain health. So as part of our collaboration, I decided to put
all of that wisdom—and a lot more—in these pages. I also spoke to people
who have been directly affected by dementia and others who have spent
their lives trying to understand and treat it. Through it all, I used my
own lifelong fascination with and understanding of the brain to distill
the enormous amount of information out there into one book with the
insights and strategies you need to keep your mind sharp. Some of it
will surprise you. I will be debunking a lot of myths that you’ve
probably bought into and show you exactly what you could be doing this
very minute to think and be sharper tomorrow. (Sneak peek: Stop
multitasking. Don’t spend mornings reading emails. Socialize more. Pick
up the one specific activity that has long been scientifically proven to
directly improve brain health—see chapter 4.) If I suggest something
that’s controversial (there can be lots of rival ideas in the brain
health sphere), I will tell you. Trouble is, when science lacks
universally accepted proof from long-term data, what can take hold—for
good or bad—are theories, opinions, and perspectives.</p>
<p>You are going to hear this word a lot in this book: lifestyle. If
there’s one fact that’s increasingly becoming apparent in scientific
circles, it’s that we are not doomed by the genetic cards we were dealt
at birth. If a certain disease runs in your family, you can still stack
the deck in your favor and avoid that fate. Our everyday experiences,
including what we eat, how much we exercise, with whom we socialize,
what challenges we face, how well we sleep, and what we do to reduce
stress and learn, factor much more into our brain health and overall
wellness than we can imagine. Here is an illustrative and fascinating
example. A new study in 2018, published in the journal Genetics,
revealed that the person we marry factors greater into our longevity
than our genetic inheritance does.6 And by a long shot! Why? Because it
turns out that our lifestyle habits weigh heavily into our decisions
around marriage—much more so than most other decisions in our lives. The
researchers, who also analyzed birth and death dates of nearly 55
million family trees that encompassed 406 million people who were born
from the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, found that
genes accounted for well under 7 percent of people’s life span versus
the 20 to 30 percent of most previous estimates. That means that over 90
percent of our health and longevity is in our own hands.</p>
<p>When I gathered all the highlights from my research colleagues at the
Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in 2019, one fact stood
out: Clean living can slash your risk of developing a serious
mind-destroying disorder, including Alzheimer’s disease, even if you
carry genetic risk factors. No matter what your DNA says, a good diet,
regular exercise, not smoking, limiting alcohol, and some other
surprising lifestyle decisions, can change that destiny. A few years
ago, I experienced firsthand that healthy living could help someone
overcome genetic risk for heart disease. Now we know the same is true
for dementia. So worry less about your genes and stop using them as an
excuse. Instead, focus on the things you get to choose, big and small,
day in and day out.</p>
<p>I believe the way we have long approached the care of our bodies and
brains is too passive. For much of medical history, doctors did nothing
more than wait for disease or dysfunction to occur, and then they
swooped in with antidotes to symptoms but not to the underlying
pathology. As we evolved and cultivated more knowledge, we discovered
that we could detect and diagnose disease before it reached late stages.
Still, hardly anything was done to anticipate the disease long before it
surfaced. Over the past few decades, we have begun to focus more
attention on early intervention of disease and, more recently, on
prevention. But in the brain health realm, attention to these final two
areas has still been weak and too often missing. Let’s change that. I
wholeheartedly believe—and I am not alone in this thinking—that
addressing brain decline is going to come from those two camps:
prevention and early intervention. And I will throw another into the
mix: optimization, or continuously building a better and more resilient
brain.</p>
<p>Numerous books have been written about enhancing brain function and
long-term brain health, but many of them are biased toward a particular
philosophy, lack real data behind them, and are limited in their advice.
The ones that I find particularly concerning are brain books that are
platforms for selling products. The only thing I am selling (besides
this book) is a way to understand your own brain and make it better. My
aim is to present a comprehensive review of the science with practical
lessons anyone can carry out starting now. I am not tied to any single
“do this, not that” approach, though I do offer a few hard-and-fast
rules. Like you, I seek the best that science has to offer, but the
guidance has to also be truly practical.</p>
<p>I want you to keep one caveat in mind as you read this book: What
will help stave off your cognitive decline may not be the same for
someone else. If there’s one fact I’ve learned in my years of studying
the brain, operating on brains, and working with top scientists, it’s
that each of us carries our own unique profile. That is why any program
to optimize brain health needs to be wide ranging, inclusive, and based
on indisputable evidence. That is what I deliver in this book. And while
there is no single nostrum, no one-size-fits-all solution (don’t believe
anyone who tells you otherwise), there are simple interventions all of
us can make right away that can have a significant impact on our
cognitive function and long-term brain health.</p>
<p>I am excited to share all the latest research and give you a
personalized road map for arriving at a sharper brain for life. It is a
spectacular destination.</p>
