<h4 id="chapter-8-connection-for-protection">CHAPTER 8 Connection for
Protection</h4>
<p>Let us be grateful to people who make us happy; they are the charming
gardeners who make our souls blossom.</p>
<p>MARCEL PROUST</p>
<p>After Helen’s husband died suddenly from heart failure after more
than forty years of marriage, her health and cognition declined
precipitously in just a few months. Her husband had been her main social
companion, and without his presence, she lacked opportunities to
interact with others and had very few friends. It had been a long time
since Helen had socialized outside the home. She became increasingly
isolated and depressed, living alone in a large, cluttered house with
nothing much to do other than sit on the couch and watch TV. If her
children had not insisted that she move to a retirement community to
experience a social network of people and share joint activities, Helen
might have continued to deteriorate mentally and met an early death.</p>
<p>The health of one spouse is important to that of the other spouse.
The impact of close relationships, particularly marriage, on an
individual’s health has been investigated from both a physical health
and psychological perspective. In the first six months after the loss of
a spouse, widows and widowers are at a 41 percent increased risk of
mortality. No doubt some of this increased risk is due in part to a loss
of companionship. A meaningful relationship with another person brings
love, happiness, and comfort to an individual’s life. In addition to
psychological well-being, however, relationships have been found to be
associated with a broad range of other health functions related to the
cardiovascular, endocrine, and the immune systems.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of science to back up the fact we need social
connection to thrive, especially when it comes to brain health. A look
at the data shows that enjoying close ties to friends and family, as
well as participating in meaningful social activities, may help keep
your mind sharp and your memories strong.1 And it’s not just the number
of social connections you have. The type, quality, and purpose of your
relationships can affect your brain functions as well. Even your marital
status affects your risk. Researchers at Michigan State University found
that married people are less likely to experience dementia as they age,
and divorcees are about twice as likely as married people to develop
dementia (widowed and never-married people have risk profiles in between
the married and divorced groups).2</p>
<p>It may be that staying social and interacting with others in
meaningful ways can provide a buffer against the harmful effects of
stress on the brain. I see the anecdotal evidence for this cause and
effect every day in my work as a neurosurgeon and out in the field as a
journalist. The people I meet who are the liveliest and most joyful and
seem to be having a great time despite their advanced age are the ones
who maintain high-quality friendships, loving families, and an
expansive, dynamic social network. My heart sinks when I meet a patient
who has no immediate family and no close friends. There’s nothing more
heartbreaking than watching someone suffer through a serious medical
issue—maybe even facing death itself—alone.</p>
<p>Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are on the rise in our
society. It’s the paradox of our era: We are hyperconnected through
digital media yet increasingly drifting apart from each other and
suffering from loneliness because we lack authentic connection. This
absence of real connection is epidemic, and medicine is increasingly
recognizing it as having dire physical, mental, and emotional
consequences, especially among older adults, with about one-third of
Americans older than sixty-five years old and half of those over
eighty-five now living alone.3 A new Global Council on Brain Health
survey on socialization and the brain health of adults age forty and
over found that although most people are at least somewhat socially
engaged (with an average of nineteen people in their social networks), a
surprising 37 percent said they sometimes lacked companionship, 35
percent found it hard to engage socially, and nearly 30 percent said
they felt isolated.4 Overall, the survey revealed that 20 percent of
adults over forty years old were disconnected socially. That’s important
because adults who said they were happy with their friends and social
activities were more likely to report an increase in their memory and
thinking skills in the previous five years, while those who were
unsatisfied with their social lives reported the opposite—that their
cognitive abilities had declined. Dr. Michelle C. Carlson, a professor
at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, and
an issue expert for the Global Council on Brain Health, who participated
in the review, calls this “a public health issue,” and she’s right.</p>
<p>People with fewer social connections have disrupted sleep patterns,
altered immune systems, more inflammation, and higher levels of stress
hormones. In a 2016 study, isolation was found to increase the risk of
heart disease by 29 percent and stroke by 32 percent.5 Another analysis
that pooled data from seventy studies and 3.4 million people found that
individuals who were mostly on their own had a 30 percent higher risk of
dying in the next seven years and that this effect was largest in middle
age (younger than 65).6 And loneliness in particular has been shown to
accelerate cognitive decline in older adults.7 Those data speak to me.
They tell me to pay attention to nurturing my relationships as much as I
nurture my health through diet and exercise. Apparently, high-quality
socialization is akin to a vital sign.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies have been particularly revealing in this new
area of brain science. A couple of investigations have been carried out
by AARP Foundation Experience Corps, a program that links older adults
with kids who are not reading at grade level yet. The program aims to be
mutually beneficial; it helps older adults engage in the community as
tutors while children learn the skills they need to do well in school.
Remarkably, fMRI imaging showed that the adults who participated in the
program improved their cognition over a span of two years and even
reversed declines in brain volume in regions vulnerable to dementia
(e.g., the hippocampus).8 Another study, the Synapse Project, also used
fMRI in a randomized trial to compare the difference between putting one
group of older adults through challenging activities together, such as
quilting or digital photography and another group that just socialized.9
The results? fMRI analysis revealed that those who were engaged in the
challenging activities gained improved cognition and brain function that
were not seen in the socializing-only group. Finally, the Rush
University Memory and Aging Project has shown that those with larger
social networks were better protected against the cognitive declines
related to Alzheimer’s disease than the people with a smaller group of
friends.10 Engaging socially in a larger group, particularly when
centered around some sort of challenging activity, seems to be the most
protective.</p>
<p>The damaging effects of social isolation start early. Socially
isolated children have significantly poorer health twenty years later,
even after controlling for other factors. The stories I’ve uncovered
during my own investigative work on loneliness have stopped me cold, in
part because I never expected to hear them from the people in front of
me—people with no outward hint of a problem, but mostly because the
descriptions of their sense of isolation were so upsetting: “It’s
unceasing, toxic, brutal.” “I feel invisible.” “It’s like living with a
hole smack in the center of your chest—a hollow feeling.” “My loneliness
magnifies every pain in my body.” Oprah asked me to talk and write about
this for her magazine.11 At any given time, at least one in five people,
or roughly 60 million Americans, suffers from loneliness—and nearly half
of Americans always feel alone or left out.12 They experience both acute
bouts of melancholy and a chronic lack of intimacy that leaves them
aching for someone special in their life that “gets” them.</p>
<p>The pain of loneliness has really captured my attention. A remarkable
study led by Naomi Eisenberger, an associate professor of social
psychology at UCLA, found that being excluded triggered activity in some
of the same regions of the brain that register physical pain.13 Feelings
of exclusion lead to feelings of loneliness. This makes evolutionary
sense because throughout our history, survival has been about social
groups and companionship. Staying close to the tribe brought access to
shelter, food, water, and protection. Separation from the group meant
danger. Loneliness doesn’t discriminate; it can affect people who are
single and living alone as much as individuals surrounded by people and
living in a family unit. And it affects city dwellers as much as people
living in rural areas.</p>
<p>“Get Your Moai On!”</p>
<p>In Okinawa, Japan, where an unusual number of elders live past 100
years old (called a Blue Zone—the name of a region with some of the
world’s oldest people), moai (“mo-eye”) is one of their longevity
traditions. These are social support groups that start in childhood and
extend throughout life. The term originated hundreds of years ago as a
means of a village’s financial support system. Moais were established to
gather a village’s resources for projects and public works. Someone who
needed capital to buy land or take care of an emergency, for example,
could turn to the moai for help. Today the concept of a moai encompasses
social support networks, a cultural tradition for built-in
companionship. People meet to share advice, ask for help, and gossip.
Yes, gossip can be a good thing in social exchanges; it’s a gateway to a
safety net of friends and has been used by humans since our tribal
days.</p>
<p>THE SECRET SAUCE TO A LONG, SHARP LIFE</p>
<p>For over eighty years, researchers in the now-famous Harvard Study of
Adult Development have been tracking how health is influenced by
connections between people. They started recording data in 1938 during
the Great Depression, following the health of 268 Harvard sophomores,
and what they’ve found contains lessons for all of us. (Of the original
group recruited, only nineteen are still alive; among the original
participants were President John F. Kennedy and long-time Washington
Post editor Ben Bradlee. Women weren’t in the original study because
Harvard was still all men, but since then, the researchers have expanded
the diversity of their recruits and have included the original men’s
offspring.) The study is currently led by Dr. Robert Waldinger, a
psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of
psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. His TED talk on the subject, “What
Makes a Good Life?” has been viewed more than 29 million times.14</p>
<p>Dr. Waldinger’s findings are attractive because they debunk commonly
held myths about health and happiness. The findings are based on a
comprehensive review of the participants’ lives and biology. They not
only answer questionnaires, but their medical records are combed, their
blood is drawn, their brains are scanned, and their family members are
interviewed. The lesson learned is that health and happiness are not
about wealth, fame, or working harder. They are about good
relationships. Period. According to Dr. Waldinger, “We’ve learned three
big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections
are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that
people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to
community, are happier, they’re physically healthier, and they live
longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of
loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they
want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health
declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner,
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.”15</p>
<p>The Harvard Study of Adult Development has also discovered that it’s
not the number of friends you have, and it’s not necessarily whether
you’re in a committed relationship; rather, it’s the quality of your
close relationships that matters. In terms of the brain specifically, it
turns out that “being in a securely attached relationship to another
person in your eighties is protective.” As Dr. Waldinger expressed in
his TED talk, “One of the key ingredients was that people in
relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person
in times of need had their memories stay sharper longer. And the people
in relationships where they feel they really can’t count on the other
one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And by
the way, those good relationships don’t have to be smooth all the time.
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and
day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the
other when the going got tough, those arguments didn’t take a toll on
their memories.”16</p>
<p>Dr. Waldinger encourages people to lean into relationships with
family, friends, and community. It could be as simple as spending more
time with loved ones or reaching out to someone you haven’t spoken to in
years but has a place in your heart. And you can make new friends
however old you are. What happens naturally as we age is that we lose
connections due to deaths, challenges with mobility, and geographical
separation. Our social networks can shrink from the effects of
retirement or an illness. Seeking out new connections can counter those
developments.</p>
<p>MYTH: Money and fame will keep you happy throughout life.</p>
<p>TRUTH: Close relationships protect people from life’s discontents,
help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of
long and happy lives than social class, IQ, financial status, or even
genes.</p>
<p>While social media can be isolating, they also present new
opportunities for older adults to engage socially when used
appropriately. More than 80 percent of Americans, including older
adults, use the Internet daily. No doubt this sort of digital engagement
should complement rather than replace in-person communication, but
email, instant messaging software, social networking sites, online
communities, and blogs can help us maintain our relationships with
family and friends and expand our social world. Studies of online
communities for older persons showed that community members report
numerous benefits, including intellectual stimulation, playful
experiences, and emotional support.</p>
<p>Such social engagement may be particularly valuable for older
individuals living in remote places or unable to get around. To an
extent, virtual connections may compensate for lost relationships and
offer relief and distraction from stressful circumstances. In addition,
thanks to the anonymity, invisibility, and opportunity for reading and
responding to communication as schedules permit, digital engagement
enables people to more easily communicate with others and get across
their feelings, opinions, and skills. We think that this has the effect
of instilling more confidence and a sense of control of one’s life—all
good things for health.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of disparity in my travels. After the basics, one of
the big drivers of disparity is whether or not someone has access to the
Internet. Granted, some communities are better off being disconnected
from modern technology. I won’t be encouraging the closely knit tribes I
visited along the Amazon River to start installing Wi-Fi. But there’s
something to be said for the vast majority of people living in the
developed world to stay connected and keep up with acquiring new
computer skills. When I meet older folks who learn how to use a computer
and tools like email, social media, and search functions, they seem to
have a much greater sense of independence and generally appear happier
than the people who stay offline. I know that stands in contrast to how
a lot of people view technology, but there are plenty of studies to back
this up. The Internet affords us many opportunities to learn and connect
with others. There’s even some evidence demonstrating that digital
engagement can have positive effects on cognitive abilities in later
life that is on par with in-person communication. An Australian study
involving more than five thousand older men found that those who use
computers have a lower risk of receiving a diagnosis of dementia by up
to eight and a half years,17 and an experimental study conducted in the
United States revealed that older adults performed about 25 percent
better on memory tasks after learning to use Facebook.18</p>
<p>Here are some tips to staying socially engaged:</p>
<p>Focus on the relationships and activities that you enjoy the most,
such as a team sport, interest groups, or political activities.</p>
<p>Ask others for help in removing barriers to social interaction—for
example, difficulty getting around due to physical limitations or the
fact you don’t drive anymore.</p>
<p>Make a point of connecting regularly with relatives, friends, and
neighbors. Digital contact is important too.</p>
<p>Maintain social connections with people of different ages. That means
people older and younger than you are.</p>
<p>Volunteer at a school or community center.</p>
<p>Look for programs in your community that allow you to pass along
skills you have, such as cooking or coaching a team. You can start by
seeing what kind of activities are available at your local community rec
center or community college.</p>
<p>Try to have at least one trustworthy and reliable confidante to
communicate with routinely (e.g., weekly)—someone you can trust and
count on.</p>
<p>Add a new relationship or activity. Place yourself in everyday
situations where you can meet and interact with others (e.g., stores or
parks).</p>
<p>Challenge yourself to try out organized clubs such as travel and book
clubs.</p>
<p>Consider adopting a pet. Caring for a cat, dog, or bird can be a
catalyst to social interaction. Taking care of pets can give a sense of
purpose and structure to a pet owner’s day. Specific benefits to adults
interacting with animals range from reduction in depression, anxiety,
and social isolation to decreased blood pressure, reduced risk of heart
attacks, and increased physical activity. Dogs can be social icebreakers
by serving as a conversation trigger between strangers or casual
acquaintances. As a result, dog walkers are more likely to experience
social contact and conversation with other people than walkers without
pets.</p>
<p>If you are feeling isolated, reach out to professionals who can help
you, including religious leaders, telephone hotlines, and
therapists.</p>
<p>When I interviewed UCLA’s Dr. Gary Small (he’s the one who endorses
flossing), he suggested the “triple threat”: Take a walk with a friend
or neighbor and have a conversation about what worries you. The
combination of the exercise, in-person interaction, and talking through
your anxieties is a wonder drug to the brain. Dan Johnston at BrainSpan
added a good point about the foundation of relationships in general:
“You have to have a good brain to have good relationships.” There’s a
beautiful circle of success here: Good relationships boost the brain,
and a healthy brain boosts relationships.</p>
<p>But as people living with early stage dementia know, your brain
doesn’t have to be razor sharp to still have good relationships. Too
many people worry about the stigma of fading memories or cognitive
decline and either begin to withdraw themselves or lose lifetime
relationships because their old friends don’t know what to say to them.
This is the opposite of the virtuous circle described above. It is
especially important for those living with dementia and their caregivers
to have people reach out to them to keep those relationships going or
develop new ones. Remember: You can’t catch dementia from others, and
sharing a smile and a laugh may be the best medicine there is.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t underestimate the power of appropriate touch. Hand
holding has been found to decrease levels of the stress hormone
cortisol. A friendly touch can also be calming. In other words, the
simple act of touching another human is a way of connecting with others
to protect ourselves—and them.</p>
