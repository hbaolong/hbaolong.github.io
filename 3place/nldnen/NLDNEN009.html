The Power of Purpose, Learning, and Discovery</h4>
<p>It’s not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for
something.</p>
<p>DR. LEO BUSCAGLIA</p>
<p>The two most important days of your life: the day you are born. And,
the day you figure out why.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN, OR SOMEONE ELSE</p>
<p>I will probably never retire. I wouldn’t know what to do with myself.
I also know the consequences for people who retire early: an increased
risk of developing dementia. They also are more likely to suffer from
other conditions that further increase that risk, including depression.
One study showed that for each additional year of work, the risk of
getting dementia is reduced by 3.2 percent.1 The study, which included
nearly half a million people in France, showed that someone who retired
at age sixty-five had about a 15 percent lower risk of developing
dementia compared to someone retiring at sixty, even after other factors
were taken into account. (France has produced some of the best
Alzheimer’s research in the world, partly because its former president,
Nicolas Sarkozy, made it a priority. Part of their strides in this realm
has been because the country keeps detailed health records on
self-employed people who pay into a Medicare-like health system, so
there’s more data to mine.)</p>
<p>The conclusion makes sense. Staying engaged in a job, especially one
that’s satisfying, tends to keep people physically active, socially
connected, and mentally challenged—all things known to protect
cognition. Years ago, while I was on a search to find the secrets to
longevity for a project, I spent a lot of time in Okinawa, Japan. There
isn’t even a word for retirement in Okinawa. People do different things
as they get older, not necessarily fewer things. They are also honored
and included even more as they age, as a sign of respect but also an
acknowledgment of their experience. My visits to Okinawa over the years
left a profound impression on me, and I am pretty sure their approach is
how I want to grow old.</p>
<p>The lesson: delay retirement as long as possible. And when you do
retire, don’t quit on life. Find activities that are joyful and
stimulating. Stay engaged. There’s power to maintaining a sense of
purpose by continuing to learn, discover, and complete complex tasks. A
sense of purpose means that you see your life as having meaning, a sense
of direction, and goals to live for. It’s active aging.</p>
<p>KEEPING THE BRAIN PLASTIC</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, active aging involves more than moving
your body. You also need to move your brain, exercising it in ways that
keep it healthy. Recruiting your muscles in exercise improves overall
health; using your brain in challenging ways similarly improves overall
brain health. But there is a right way and a wrong way to employ the
brain. Pick the right way, and it will help you tap the “plastic” power
of the brain—its capacity to rewire itself and strengthen its
networks.</p>
<p>One of the most startling pieces of research has been comparing
different people’s brains when they are autopsied. I know it’s not for
everyone, but participating in an autopsy of someone’s brain is one of
the most enlightening experiences I have had. You get to see deep into
this mysterious organ in ways you couldn’t when the organ was alive. And
one of the big revelations is that while some brains may share nearly
identical pathology, their owners sometimes exhibited very different
behaviors when they were alive. Two brains that look severely diseased
at autopsy, perhaps riddled with the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s
disease or signs of cerebrovascular disease, will not necessarily
reflect how their owners came across in life. One person may never have
shown any symptoms of cognitive impairment or decline, whereas the other
faded away for years and could not recognize any family members’ faces
toward the end of life. The question I always asked was how the person
with a seemingly sick brain averted the cognitive decline. The answer I
often heard was “cognitive reserve” or what scientists call brain
resiliency. Building that reserve or resiliency has everything to do
with staying as engaged in life as possible through socialization and
participating in stimulating activities. I’ll cover the importance of
connecting with others in chapter 8. For now, let’s focus chiefly on the
concept of cognitive reserve. Think of it as a big backup system in the
brain that results from enriched life experiences such as education and
occupation. You will learn that cognitive reserve may even help
counteract the effects of other risk factors such as a poor diet.</p>
<p>THE BRAIN AND COGNITIVE RESERVE</p>
<p>The whole idea of a cognitive reserve, or brain resiliency, remains a
bit controversial because we’re not sure exactly how it works and it can
be difficult to define. From a practical standpoint, cognitive reserve
is your brain’s ability to improvise and navigate around impediments it
may encounter that could prevent it from getting a job done. To draw on
another car analogy, your car has a braking and acceleration system for
navigating the road and dealing with things it may encounter, like
obstacles and unforeseen turns. You can quickly swerve to avoid an
accident and stay on course. Similarly, your brain can change how it
operates to find alternative routes, thereby helping it to cope with
challenges that could otherwise be harmful to its health and function.
If you think of your brain’s networks like a series of roads, then you
can see how the more networks you have, the more options are available
to shift direction and arrive at the same destination if one road
becomes impassable. It’s a simple way of looking at this, but those
networks or roads are the cognitive reserve, and they develop over time
through education, learning, and curiosity. The more you discover in
your lifetime, the more networks you create to help your brain better
manage any potential failures or declines it faces.</p>
<p>The concept of cognitive reserve is relatively new. It originated in
the late 1980s when a group of scientists in the Department of
Neurosciences at the University of California San Diego described older
people in a skilled nursing facility with no apparent symptoms of
dementia who were nonetheless found at autopsy to have brains whose
physical appearances were consistent with advanced Alzheimer’s disease.
Their paper, published in the Annals of Neurology, was the first to use
the term reserve, suggesting that these individuals had enough brain
cache to offset the damage and continue to function as usual.2 The
researchers also noted that the people who had escaped symptoms of
dementia had higher brain weights and a greater number of neurons.</p>
<p>Since that revolutionary finding, research has consistently shown
that people with greater cognitive reserve are more likely to stave off
the degenerative brain changes associated with dementia or other brain
diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, or stroke.3 A
more robust cognitive reserve, the researchers say, can also help you
function better for longer if you’re exposed to unexpected life events
that can impact the brain, including chronic stress, surgery, or toxins
in the environment. These types of circumstances demand extra effort
from your brain, just like a car needs to engage another gear to deal
with the demands of a steep hill. Two forms of cognitive reserve are
often discussed: neural reserve and neural compensation. In neural
reserve, preexisting brain networks that are more efficient or have
greater capacity may be less susceptible to disruption. In neural
compensation, alternate networks may offset or balance out any
disruption of preexisting networks.</p>
<p>So an important goal is to build and sustain your cognitive reserve,
and this can be done by maintaining demands on your brain that keep it
thinking, strategizing, learning, and solving problems. This is not
something you do overnight. Cognitive reserve is a reflection of how
much you have challenged your brain over the years through your
education, work, and other activities. It is the reasoning behind why
epidemiologic evidence suggests that people with higher IQ, education,
occupational achievements, or engagement in leisure
activities—participating in hobbies or sports that are not related to a
job—have a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. These
pursuits force the brain to continually acquire knowledge and work with
that knowledge in ways that ultimately build new networks and strengthen
existing ones. Not surprisingly, animal studies show that cognitive
stimulation increases the density of neurons, synapses, and dendrites.
Put more simply, cognitive stimulation builds a brain more resistant to
disease.</p>
<p>To say that having a higher IQ and advanced degree will help protect
you from dementia is not to suggest that being “smarter” or more degreed
will stave off disease. That’s not the point. In fact, the long-held
theory that a college education will fend off dementia later in life has
been debunked as a result of a 2019 study published in the journal
Neurology.4 The nearly 3,000 participants in the study were around
seventy-eight years old when they enrolled in it. They had on average
16.3 years of education and were followed for eight years. Nearly 700 of
the participants developed dementia during the study; 405 developed
dementia and also died, while 752 died and had a brain autopsy.</p>
<p>Dividing the participants into three education levels, researchers
did find that those with more education scored higher on tests of
thinking and memory skills at the start of the study, even though it was
decades after receiving their college degrees. However, the researchers
did not find an association between higher education and slower
cognitive decline, nor did higher education seem to delay the onset of
dementia. As study author Robert S. Wilson, director of cognitive
neurosciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, described
the findings, “These results did not show a relationship between a
higher level of education and a slower rate of decline of thinking and
memory skills or a later onset of the accelerated decline that happens
as dementia starts.”5 A good explanation for why higher education may
not have an impact on cognitive reserve as much as once was believed is
that the schooling occurs decades before the slow creep of dementia
begins. In other words, you can’t bank on your college or graduate
degree to save you if you haven’t been keeping up with your “continued
education” in the form of reading, learning, and socializing. Again,
when it comes to memory and aging, a use-it-or-lose-it concept applies.
In that sense, this research is encouraging. According to Sarah Lenz
Lock, executive director of AARP’s Global Council on Brain Health, “This
study suggests that anyone can work on improving cognitive reserve at
any age, no matter their previous education levels.”6 Remember that new
brain cell growth can happen even late into adulthood, and the brain
remains plastic throughout life.</p>
<p>Whenever you hear about studies like this, you have to consider them
in a broader context. While lifelong education appears very protective
against dementia, we also know that it—whether formal or not—is a
luxury, typically available to those who have better economic status,
career standing, and social interactions. Teasing out which protective
factors have the greatest impact and how they interact with one another
is challenging. For now, the guidance is to focus on lifelong education
as much as possible. It’s how you continue to build and maintain that
resilience in the brain I mentioned. There’s something to be said for
the stereotype of “letting your brain go to mush” when you don’t
stimulate it by learning new things and challenging its thinking and
calculating abilities. For many people, the easy act of taking a book
out of the library and reading it qualifies as a form of education. You
don’t need to go after a PhD.</p>
<p>THE DEFINITION OF “COGNITIVELY STIMULATING” ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people get it wrong when it comes to defining
cognitively stimulating activities. A large majority of Americans age
fifty and older (92 percent) think that challenging the mind with games
and puzzles is important to maintaining or improving brain health; a
majority (66 percent) also believe that playing online games designed
for brain health is the best way for you to maintain your brain health.7
But the evidence doesn’t support this. Commercial claims to the benefits
of playing “brain games” are everywhere, but they are often exaggerated
and can distract one from engaging in the kinds of activities that are
truly cognitively stimulating. Any product that says it can reduce or
reverse cognitive decline should be met with caution. In recent years,
the Federal Trade Commission has aggressively cracked down on deceptive
advertising from companies claiming their brain-training programs can
protect against dementia and age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Brain-training videos and games such as puzzles and crosswords can
improve working memory—the ability to remember and retrieve information,
especially when distracted. But research has found that although they
can help your brain get better at performing those specific activities,
their benefits do not extend to other brain functions like reasoning and
problem solving, both of which are key to building cognitive reserve.
There is also a reason why taking a traditional class can beat an online
brain-training program. Classes offer a level of complexity that has
long-term benefits; they not only employ cognitive skills, such as
visual comprehension, short- and long-term memory, attention to detail,
and even math and skills, but they often entail a social element with
fellow classmates. Students in a classroom setting are interacting and
communicating with others on a regular basis through lively
conversation.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean taking a class has to be in a traditional academic
setting or even entail acquiring another degree. It can simply be about
learning new skills, such as speaking a foreign language, learning how
to cook or paint, or taking up a new musical instrument. You can study
how to computer code, take salsa dancing, or write a novel—whatever gets
you out there and acquiring new knowledge and aptitudes. Just be sure
that you do something you enjoy. Don’t sign up for a Civil War history
class if that does not appeal to you. Use the opportunity to learn more
of what are you interested in now or wish you had explored before.</p>
<p>Research has long shown that new knowledge, whatever it is, pays off.
For example, a study in the June 2014 issue of Annals of Neurology found
that speaking two or more languages, even if you learned the second
language years or decades after the first, may slow age-related
cognitive decline.8 Such findings have been confirmed by others,
including cognitive neuroscientist Ellen Bialystok, a distinguished
research professor of psychology at York University in Toronto, Canada.
Her own research has found that bilingualism can protect older adults’
brains, even as Alzheimer’s is beginning to affect cognitive function.9
It’s likely that the complexity of the second language acts as part of
that cognitive reserve, shielding against symptoms of decline. And
therein lies a key secret: The complexity of the new skill is critical;
you can’t just come to class and be passive. You need to use your mind
in a manner that gets you out of your comfort zone and demands more
long-term memory.</p>
<p>Although video-based brain games have come under fire for being
overly hyped, some are being further investigated and developed because
certain types are showing promise. The type that’s gotten the most
attention lately is speed training. If you ever played Punch Buggy in
your youth, then you’ve already experienced a mild form of speed
training. Punch Buggy, or “Bug,” was a popular game when I was growing
up, often played by kids in cars (this was long before digital screens
became driving companions). The goal of the game was straightforward: At
the sight of a Volkswagen Beetle, you’d punch your fellow passenger
(usually a sibling) and accumulate points. The person who spotted the
most Bugs wins. Although it’s very basic and juvenile in nature, the
game often required visually scanning the other side of the highway and
quickly filtering through all the cars to spot a Bug and be the first to
call it out. This type of mental exercise, which demands that you focus
intently and rapidly process visual information, appears to be
surprisingly effective at putting off dementia. Speed training games
have since gotten much more sophisticated, digital, and worthy of
serious research.</p>
<p>In 2016, a secondary analysis of an original ten-year study funded by
the National Institutes of Health showed that speed training was more
effective than memory and reasoning exercises in terms of its potential
effects on reducing risk of developing dementia (the results were first
presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in
Toronto that year and published formally in 2017).10 A total of eleven
to fourteen hours of speed training was demonstrated to potentially cut
that risk by 29 percent. The primary study, called ACTIVE (Advanced
Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly), was led by researchers at the
Institute on Aging and six research universities across the country. It
was originally designed to measure people’s cognitive function and their
ability to maintain basic activities of daily living. It enrolled 2,802
healthy older adults (average age at the start was seventy-four) and
randomly assigned them to a control group or one of three interventions:
(1) a group that received instructions on reasoning strategies, (2) a
group that got instructions on memory strategies, or (3) a group that
was given speed processing training with the help of computer video
games specifically designed for this purpose. These games call for
highly focused visual attention, even in the face of a distraction, to
perform a certain task. For example, in the Double Decision game, a
player had to distinguish between two blue cars—one a hardtop and one a
convertible—in a progressively complex and visually distracting setting.
The player might also be asked to find other visuals such as a Route 66
sign. As the player answered correctly, the game became even more
complicated and mentally strenuous with more distracters so the targets
become more difficult to identify. At the same time, the speed of the
presentation ticked up a notch.</p>
<p>The speed training group was given ten initial sessions (sixty to
seventy-five minutes per session) over the first six weeks of the study.
All groups were assessed for functional decline using an array of
cognitive and functional tests at the beginning of the study and again
at intervals over the ten years. Some people also received “booster”
training sessions after the first year and three years into the study.
In the end, not only did the speed training group gain the most
benefits, but the benefits were “dose related”: those who completed more
training sessions benefited more.</p>
<p>The secondary analysis did have its limitations, and the researchers
acknowledged that the results they found related to lower dementia risk
could be due to reverse causation—meaning there may not be a definitive,
direct cause and effect between speed training and lower risk for
dementia. Nevertheless, I think these types of explorations hold much
promise. Just ask Kathy Lasky, a woman in her seventies who tried to
retire several years ago from her job as a pharmaceutical technician but
decided after a few months that not working wasn’t for her. I
interviewed her in San Diego for my show Vital Signs in 2017, and her
story has stuck with me. “Daytime TV gets very old,” she told me. Kathy
was in great shape physically, but she quickly noticed that she was
starting to feel mentally foggy while in retirement. Fearful that she’d
sink into depression or even develop dementia, Kathy went back to work
and enrolled in the ACTIVE study where she was assigned the speed
training exercises. It was the twin forces of work and mental play here
that likely made a difference. Today she feels as vital as ever and
continues to work and participate in speed training exercises using
video games. She calls brain fitness “hot sauce for the mind.” And her
experience in the gaming world may soon reflect a paradigm shift in
brain medicine. Researchers are coming to realize that there’s a largely
unlocked potential for video games to train our brains to be faster,
stronger, better—if those games are developed correctly.</p>
<p>Dr. Adam Gazzaley is a neuroscientist and inventor who knows what it
means to stimulate the brain to improve its function and physiology. He
is the founder and executive director of Neuroscape, a center at the
University of California, San Francisco, that translates brain science
into practical solutions, technologies, and treatments for people to
optimize brain function. Dr. Gazzaley is a professor of neurology,
physiology, and psychiatry at UCSF. He is also cofounder and chief
science advisor of Akili Interactive Labs, a company developing
therapeutic video games to support treatment of brain disorders such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, depression,
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, he
is chief scientist at a venture capital firm investing in experiential
technology to improve human performance. His dream? To one day see
doctors write prescriptions for video games approved by the Food and
Drug Administration rather than pills to turn an aging brain into a
younger one.</p>
<p>MYTH: Playing video games will make your mind turn to mush.</p>
<p>FACT: People who play video games can see more than the rest of us,
on average. They make better and faster use of visual input, as Duke
University researchers have demonstrated.11 The video gaming industry is
poised to explode as we learn more about how to design games to improve
brain health and function.</p>
<p>Dr. Gazzaley is considered a maverick in brain optimization and a
pioneer in digital medicine. He’s defining the difference between what
truly works on the brain to improve its performance and potentially
stave off decline and what’s hype. He appreciates the power of programs
that move the mind. Using the latest technologies to visualize the
brain’s functionality in real time, such as functional and
three-dimensional MRI and electroencephalograms, Gazzaley is able to
watch and document changes in the brain as it’s stimulated in various
ways—notably by video-based brain games that demand concentration,
hand-eye coordination, and avoidance of distractions. He hooks willing
participants up to one of these advanced brain-imaging technologies,
hands over a gaming control, and lets them play. Then he captures their
brains’ activity—identifying which areas light up and gain increased
electrical activity. These kinds of experiments were unheard of just a
few years ago. We’ve come a long way since Pong came on the scene in
1972 and Tetris reigned king in the 1980s.</p>
<p>When I met up with Gazzaley at his lab at the Center for Integrative
Neuroscience at UCSF, I had the pleasure of witnessing his research in
live action with individuals plugged into his revolutionary brain model,
Glass Brain, a computerized simulation of a person’s brain that shows
exactly what’s going on in the instant someone is playing a game and
being mentally, and sometimes physically, challenged. It paints a wild
and vivid picture of all the signaling that’s taking place in the
moment. He gets to see (as did I) where the brain is firing and how
strongly, and correlate that with knowledge about what those areas of
the brain mean for us neurologically. “We focus on attention
processes—how we direct our limited resources where and when we want
them,” he tells me. “When these abilities decline, we see all sorts of
conditions arise, from ADHD and depression to autism and even
Alzheimer’s disease.” Gazzaley has spent the past several years building
his Glass Brain by figuring out how to challenge the brain in just the
right way. For a neuroscientist like me, it was thrilling to go behind
the scenes in his highly proprietary lab. I felt that I was watching the
origins of groundbreaking brain medicine. I now appreciate video games
from a whole different perspective, as they may very well soon become
medical devices.</p>
<p>“Experience drives plasticity in brain,” Gazzaley reminds me. “Based
on the facts of neuroplasticity, we can create experiences targeted and
strong enough to make meaningful change in the brain to improve and
protect brain function.” His work has not gone unnoticed. It was first
highlighted in the journal Nature in 2013, in which he reported on one
of his studies showing that if a game is designed to address a precise
cognitive deficit—in this case, multitasking in older people—it can be
effective.12 What was incredible was finding that after participants
played NeuroRacer three times a week for a month, they improved their
ability to multitask beyond the level of even twenty-year-olds who
played for a single visit. And the improvements were shown lasting six
months later without practice. His team conducted a series of cognitive
tests on the participants before and after training. Certain cognitive
abilities that were not specifically targeted by the game improved and
remained that way, such as working memory and sustained attention. These
skills are important for performing daily tasks, such as handling mail
and bills, and planning and cooking meals.</p>
<p>Gazzaley would agree that we should not overpromote the power of
gaming to improve cognition. Video games will never be a guaranteed
panacea, and there will continue to be unscrupulous players in the field
selling video games with false claims. When I asked Gazzaley about “the
one thing” everyone can do to preserve brain function and prevent
neurodegenerative decline, his advice will sound familiar to you: “Lead
a rich, active, dynamic, complex life.” I can’t argue with that!
Gazzaley has multiple games in development that are undergoing the
rigors of clinical trials; he’s hopeful that FDA-approved games will one
day be on the market and just as important as any drug.</p>
<p>A STRONG SENSE OF PURPOSE</p>
<p>My mother, Damyanti, is one of my heroes. She has always lived with a
sense of purpose and has worked hard to instill that into me and my
younger brother. My mother’s drive was born out of misery. At the age of
five, she was forced to flee an area of the world that is now Pakistan.
It was during the time of the bloody Indian subcontinent partition.
Along with her family, my mother joined one of the largest human
migrations in history. After arriving in India, she lived as a refugee
for the next several years, struggling to survive. People in those
refugee camps didn’t have the luxury of hopes, dreams, and aspirations.
Yet her mother (my grandmother), Gopibai Hingorani, a woman who had
completed only the fourth grade, told her she was going to make sure her
daughter received something that no one could ever take away from her:
an education.</p>
<p>It still gives me shivers to imagine a young girl trapped in a camp
being told she would one day become someone who mattered. By keeping her
promise, my grandmother initially gave my mother her sense of purpose.
My mom completed engineering college in India and made history as the
first female engineer there. It was just the beginning of her life in a
male-dominated space. After reading a biography of Henry Ford, she
dreamed of working for the company that he’d built. Again, my
grandparents came through. They took their savings of a lifetime to send
my mom to the United States in 1965. At age twenty-four, she became the
first woman hired as an engineer at Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>My parents are now retired in Florida, but they stay active, playing
a lot of bridge, singing karaoke, and traveling. My mother spends a lot
of time with her five granddaughters, teaching them the value of a life
lived with purpose. Because of my parents, I began studying the
objective value of purpose from a medical perspective. Over the past two
decades, dozens of studies have shown that older people with a sense of
purpose in life are less likely to develop a slew of ailments—from mild
cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, to disabilities, heart
attacks, and strokes. And they are more likely to live longer than
people without this strong undercurrent. In fact, feeling you have a
purpose in life right now might reduce your risk of future dementia by
up to 20 percent. Some of the research is eye-opening. In 2017, JAMA
Psychiatry published a study out of Harvard revealing that older adults
with a higher sense of purpose tend to retain strong hand grips and
walking speeds.13 That may sound like an odd thing to measure, but these
characteristics have long been indicators of how quickly people are
aging. You’d be surprised by the correlation between how fast you can
walk and how fast you are aging. Another great predictor of health also
happens to be whether you can get up from the floor without using your
hands to prop yourself up.</p>
<p>The explanation for the power of purpose makes sense. With purpose
comes the motivation to remain physically active and take better care of
oneself. And these in turn help people to manage stress and be less
prone to dangerous inflammation. We also know from autopsies performed
on adults in their eighties that those who felt their lives had meaning
suffered far fewer microscopic infarcts, which are small areas of dead
tissue that result from a blockage of blood flow.14 These infarcts boost
the risk of a stroke and developing dementia.</p>
<p>Having a sense of purpose will also help keep your brain plastic and
preserve that cognitive reserve. With purpose comes a love for life and
all the experiences it offers. Purpose also puts a damper on depression,
which can be common in one’s later years and is a huge risk factor in
itself for memory decline, stroke, and dementia. I should add that
ikigai is a word heard a lot in Japan, especially in Okinawa, where
certain populations have incredibly low rates of dementia. Roughly
translated, it means your reason for being. I think of it as the thing
that makes me want to jump out of bed in the morning. We would all do
well to define our ikigai, because it is a daily reminder of our purpose
here on earth. And we can’t forget that with a sense of purpose comes
optimism. In 2018, a Global Council on Brain Health report stated that
optimism is among the important elements of mental well-being, alongside
things like self-acceptance, vitality, and positive relationships.15</p>
<p>GETTING IN THE FLOW</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of ways to stay engaged and maintain a sense of
purpose. As this chapter has already pointed out, you don’t have to keep
a regular job. You can enroll in a class to learn something new,
volunteer, teach, renew your library card, work on your hobbies, be a
good friend to your neighbors, turn your garden into a
sanctuary—whatever you find joyful, satisfying, and meaningful. It’s
also important that you find things to do that put you in the “flow.”
For more than four decades, social theorist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
(pronounced MEE-high, CHEECH-sent-mee-high) has studied the concept he
named flow, which has become a pillar of positive psychology
research.16</p>
<p>We’ve all experienced being “in the moment,” “in the groove,” or “on
fire.” Flow is the word used to describe this phenomenon. It means
you’re in a mental state that has you totally immersed in an activity
without distraction or any sense of agitation whatsoever. You’re deeply
focused, enjoying a feeling of intense energy as you’re absorbed in the
activity. You’re not necessarily stressed; rather, you can feel
blissfully relaxed while at the same time being challenged or “under the
gun.” The concept of flow has been recognized across many fields,
including occupational therapy, the arts, and the sports world. Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi may have given us the popular term in modern times, but
the concept of flow has existed for thousands of years under other
guises, notably in some Eastern religions.</p>
<p>You can’t truly be in the flow without a clear sense of purpose.
Think about the last time you were in the flow. What were you doing? How
long has it been since that time? Who were you with? I encourage you to
write down those experiences. They may inspire you to find new roads to
flow today.</p>
