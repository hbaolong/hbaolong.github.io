<h4 id="chapter-2-cognitive-declineredefined">CHAPTER 2 Cognitive
Decline—Redefined</h4>
<p>You’d better start mixing toothpaste with your shampoo. You’re
getting a cavity in your brain.</p>
<p>ARCHIE BUNKER (ALL IN THE FAMILY, 1971)</p>
<p>When my friend Sarah described to me her mother’s experience with
cognitive decline over several decades that accelerated after she
retired at the age of sixty-two, I thought of my grandfather. I was
immediately reminded of how agonizing it can be to watch someone wither
away mentally—and emotionally. For many people, the downward slope is
slow and steady, like a long-drawn-out illness, while for others it’s
fierce and fast, like a traumatic accident.</p>
<p>The first questions that often enter a family member’s mind when a
loved one seems to be struggling with cognition are the following: When
did it start? What caused it? What can I do to help? That’s what Sarah
asked herself when she noticed something was not right with her mother’s
brain. The best Sarah could describe her mother’s short-term memory was
that it seemed to have a “serious malfunction.” It is interesting that
we detail most medical maladies with words like painful, blockage,
tumor, or swelling, but with dementia, we often resort to mechanical
explanations, as Sarah had. One of the first signs with Sarah’s mother
was that she often misspoke her grandson’s name, calling him Conner
instead of Colin. Over time, she stopped socializing and engaging in
normal everyday activities like cooking, tidying up the house, and
tending to her general hygiene. Although she had a history of mild
depression, her anxiety and moodiness reached all-time highs, and
increasingly she had no filter—she’d make hurtful, rude, inappropriate
comments, and sometimes use abrupt foul language. After retiring, she
became mostly housebound by choice, steadily distancing herself from
friends. She was more frequently choosing to sit in front of the
television rather than read books, go for long walks, or retreat to the
beach as she had enjoyed throughout her life. Sarah’s father, who still
worked full-time, had to take on all the housework and the bills. As I
shared Sarah and her mom’s story with the experts I interviewed, they
all said it was a familiar pattern of symptoms. The progression is often
very similar, starting with little slips and transitioning into more and
more withdrawal.</p>
<p>When Sarah’s mother began to get lost while driving or routinely
leave the car in parking lots because she couldn’t find it after
shopping (or thought she had walked), the keys were taken away. Her mood
also changed. Her mother was always a bit depressive, which made Sarah
wonder how much a lifelong bout with untreated depression contributed to
her mother’s mental demise. Or was it the daily chardonnay habit that
did it? The lack of sufficient exercise? The nutritional deficiencies
from an eating disorder that began in her youth and never really went
away—even with treatment? How much did not engaging in social
activities, hobbies, and challenging work contribute to the acceleration
of the disease? These are the questions millions of families ask
themselves, and there are often few satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>Sarah’s story brings light to the fact that we often don’t and can’t
know what triggers cognitive decline in the first place or what propels
it over time. Multiple forces are likely in play, as there is no single
culprit. Many theories exist, but we have no definitive answer yet. It
is becoming abundantly clear, though, that the decline starts years, if
not decades, before any symptoms emerge. This is a crucial concept: A
thirty-year-old can be on the road to Alzheimer’s disease but not know
it. People often don’t think or worry about dementia until after they
turn fifty, which is why it’s so important that younger generations heed
the message and start thinking of habits that can help prevent
decline.</p>
<p>While we have made so much progress in medicine, more than a century
after the first description of Alzheimer’s disease by a German
psychiatrist and neuropathologist whose surname is forever attached to
the condition, researchers still cannot identify the precise cause or
causes. It is a reminder that we humans are exceedingly complex
organisms. It also means that what causes grave cognitive decline in
person A will not cause it in person B, or C, or D, and so on. Sarah’s
mother and my grandfather both received the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease, but probably for very different reasons. It’s like cancer: What
causes breast or colon cancer in one individual will not always be the
same for anyone else. There are myriad pathways to any particular type
of cancer, and the same is true with dementia. Despite that, as we take
a deeper look at the data, we realize there are still some excellent
insights and strategies to reduce our risk for dementia.</p>
<p>To better understand these strategies, it is worth once again
examining current theories on what is happening in the brain of someone
with Alzheimer’s. As many of you have probably read, the amyloid
hypothesis has led the charge in recent decades. Amyloid, or more
precisely beta-amyloid, are plaques of sticky protein that accumulate in
the brain and destroy those essential synapses that allow brain cells to
communicate. The problem is that treatments based on this hypothesis,
including medicines to extinguish those plaques, have largely failed in
clinical trials. When Merck ended its study on a once-promising
Alzheimer’s disease drug in 2017, Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David
Knopman told Bloomberg that “[r]emoving amyloid once people have
established dementia is closing the barn door after the cows have
left.”1</p>
<p>The progression of the disease, it turns out, is a lot more complex
than any single culprit. Researchers have also investigated whether
cognitive decline is simply an acceleration of normal aging or a
degenerative disease of specific brain pathways. To that end, recent
research has focused on possible triggers: infections, injury, nutrient
deficiency, prolonged metabolic dysfunction, exposure to harmful
chemicals—all of which can stimulate an immune response and inflammatory
reaction that damages the brain. That brings us to inflammation, a
keyword you’re going to read about over and over again. As you’ll learn
shortly, inflammation is a common thread in all of the theories about
brain decline, not to mention most other types of illness. Once you
understand this concept, several of the strategies to lower your risk
will make more sense.</p>
<p>I’ll slow this down for a moment by taking a quick tour of the most
common and possible causes of cognitive decline beyond normal or even
accelerated aging. As you read through this list, you will see just how
much genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors contribute to the
problem.</p>
<p>Eight (Potential) Ways the Brain Begins to Break</p>
<p>Many of the factors outlined in this section can be part of the
problem, some more influential than others depending on individual risk
factors.</p>
<p>The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH)</p>
<p>When Dr. Aloysius Alzheimer first described “a peculiar disease” in a
fifty-one-year-old woman who had profound memory loss, bizarre behavior,
and unexplained psychological changes, he would go down in history as
the original documenter of the haunting disease that now bears his name.
During the autopsy of her brain, he saw dramatic shrinkage and abnormal
deposits in and around nerve cells that he called “senile plaques” in
his 1907 report, which would later be recognized as containing
beta-amyloid. Today, more than one hundred years later, these amyloid
plaques (plaques), along with neurofibrillary tangles (tangles), remain
the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Picture it like this: in
Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid plaques that accumulate between nerve cells
and tangles, primarily consisting of tau protein, are twisted insoluble
fibers found inside the brain’s cells. (Beta-amyloid was discovered in
1984, with tau identified two years later. Tau protein is a microscopic
component of brain cells that is essential to their stability and
survival; more on tau shortly.)</p>
<p>Here’s the tricky part: We need beta-amyloid and tau in our brains.
Healthy versions of these proteins are part of healthy brain biology:
They help supply food to brain cells and make sure important chemicals
move freely between those cells. It’s when beta-amyloid and tau become
damaged, misfolding into sticky clumps, that problems arise. The amyloid
fibrils turn rogue when they morph into watertight rope-like structures
containing proteins that interlock like the teeth of a zipper. These
tight molecular zippers become sealed and difficult to pry apart,
gumming up to form dangerous plaques. According to the amyloid cascade
hypothesis, it is the accumulation of plaques around brain cells that
causes Alzheimer’s disease, even though scientists aren’t sure how or
why that happens. Drugs to reduce beta-amyloid in the human brain have
not succeeded as expected. A string of clinical failures based on this
hypothesis has punched lots of holes into the idea that beta-amyloid
tells the whole story. Some people whose brain is riddled with plaques
show no signs of cognitive decline. These brains are often found to be
filled with plaques on autopsy, and yet the patients died cognitively
intact. While this can be due to what’s called cognitive reserve, a
topic I’ll cover at length, in truth we don’t really know whether the
plaques are an effect rather than a cause of Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>In the Alzheimer’s world, a “unicorn” is when the brain autopsy of
someone with dementia only shows damage from plaques and tangles. The
point is that rarely does a diseased brain show only one form of damage:
lots of changes in an aging brain can result in a diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease. The complexity of this disease has forced
scientists to rethink their entire approach and search for a cure. There
probably won’t be a universal solution. People likely have a mix of
different dementias for which they need a mix of different
treatments.</p>
<p>Genetics can also be a factor. Certain gene abnormalities, such as
mutations in the genes that code for amyloid protein—namely, the amyloid
precursor protein (APP) gene and presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes—can
increase beta-amyloid production and account for the early-onset
Alzheimer’s that affects many members of the families that carry these
mutations. In one particular cluster of cases in a South American
family, for example, many family members showed cognitive impairment
around age forty-seven, progressing to dementia by about age fifty-one,
and they died around age sixty. Scientists have been studying mutation
clans throughout the world where the disease runs heavily in families;
and sometimes within these clans are individuals who have the genetic
profile to develop early-onset Alzheimer’s and they are somehow
protected from that fate thanks to other rare mutations. These lucky
people’s brains show neurological features of the disease but there’s no
outward signs of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>The hope is that by understanding the natural history of the disease
with strong genetic roots, scientists can develop new drug or gene
therapies, including for those who do not carry Alzheimer’s-causing
mutations yet still develop dementia. These amyloid-related genes and
their products are highly complicated with many functions beyond just
the brain’s neurons; they can be difficult to study, but the more we
learn about how they operate and result in disease (or not), the faster
we can arrive at solutions. You have probably heard about the APOE genes
linked to Alzheimer’s; these are one of many sets of genes that could be
linked to an increased (or decreased) risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s
(after age sixty-five). I’ll go into detail about these genes in a later
chapter.</p>
<p>While early-onset Alzheimer’s is more likely to be influenced by
genetics, genes may play some role later in life as well. What makes the
body especially vulnerable as we get older is that the repair system for
fixing DNA mutations becomes less efficient. For example, the dry
molecular amyloid “zipper” I described may start with a single kink in
the chain of amino acids. As we get older, those kinks build up because
repair enzymes can no longer keep up. This is similar to what happens in
cancer: DNA repair weakens as we age, making us more susceptible to
cancer when genetic mutations build up and trigger cancerous growths.
Scientists are trying to understand these zippers to unlock the cascade
that results in Alzheimer’s disease. One international team, led by
UCLA’s Professor David Eisenberg, is hoping these sorts of insights will
eventually lead to new therapies.</p>
<p>Tau and Tangles</p>
<p>Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) reflect a problem with tau protein. Tau
proteins are sometimes likened to the tracks of a railroad inside brain
cells (versus the amyloid plaques that accumulate outside brain
cells—see bottom image, previous page). They are responsible for both
stabilizing nerve cells in the brain and helping various areas of the
brain communicate. But when they undergo chemical changes, they no
longer help hold nerve cells together. They become damaged and knotted
up, which then makes them a liability rather than a benefit. The
clumping and spread of chemically altered tau protein molecules follow
different patterns from those of amyloid plaques, so some researchers
continue to look for a theory that includes problems with tau protein,
not just amyloid. Recent papers have even referred to the “trigger and
bullet” theory—amyloid being the trigger and tau the bullet.2</p>
<p>Tau proteins are also implicated in chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE), a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated blows to the head
and associated with behavior problems, depression, memory loss, and
dementia. CTE is especially prevalent in professional athletes playing
high-contact sports, such as boxing, wrestling, soccer, and football. In
2019, former soccer stars and World Cup championship players Brandi
Chastain and Michelle Akers launched a study of former female soccer
stars. They want to know whether their “senior moments” are a sign of
something to come. Both headed the ball multiple times during games and
also had head-to-head or head-to-ground impacts. The study, led by
neurology professor Robert Stern at Boston University School of
Medicine, will look into possible cognitive effects of all those headers
and collisions.3 One of the first groundbreaking moments in tau research
came in November 2013, when a medical team affiliated with UCLA
diagnosed Tony Dorsett, the fifty-nine-year-old former Dallas Cowboys
All-Pro Hall of Fame running back, with signs of CTE. His brain scans
showed abnormally high concentrations of tau. It was among the first
cases that a living person was diagnosed with degenerative CTE.</p>
<p>Prions are increasingly becoming part of the narrative around plaques
and tangles. Prions are another type of protein found in the brain that
can trigger other proteins (like beta-amyloid and tau) to fold
abnormally. A few diseases are attributed to prions, which are
associated with infections and are universally fatal. The most common
form of prion disease in humans is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a.k.a.
“mad cow disease”) from infected meat products. Some researchers are
looking into whether prion-like forms of both amyloid and tau spread
through the brain, forcing normal proteins to become misfolded and
knotted up, setting the stage for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Blood Flow</p>
<p>Plaques, and sometimes tangles, are known to occur more frequently
and severely in people with advanced vascular disease, which is a class
of diseases that affect the blood vessels (arteries and veins). This
suggests that blood flow abnormalities in the brain may be important in
the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Decreased blood flow to the
brain, a condition called hypoperfusion, has long been associated as a
precursor to the buildup of plaques and tangles. It is likely that
changes in blood flow to the brain create a crisis among neurons and
their support staff cells called glia, leading to degeneration of these
cells and subsequent cognitive impairment. Remember that the brain is a
highly vascular organ; it demands a lot from the circulatory system to
continually deliver nutrients and oxygen. Any factor—from smoking to
high cholesterol levels—that affects the blood flow system in the brain
has a significant impact on its function and risk for decline.</p>
<p>In addition, the vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease may
explain why people who have a history of high blood pressure or have had
a stroke are more vulnerable to developing the disease. High blood
pressure can cause microscopic damage in the arteries leading to the
brain, which can further reduce blood flow and oxygenation. Brain cells
need energy in the form of glucose and oxygen. When that energy to the
active brain is compromised by lack of adequate blood flow, trouble
looms. Recent research has also shown that blood flow to the brain is
decreased when the blood-brain barrier, a semipermeable barrier in the
brain’s capillaries, breaks down.4 Because the brain is so precious, it
is protected not only by the skull and a bath of cerebrospinal fluid;
the blood-brain barrier also effectively walls off the brain from the
body’s blood supply. When working properly, this wall lets oxygen,
glucose, and other necessary substances across the barrier but stops
larger, sometimes toxic, molecules from getting into the brain. Gaps can
form in this barrier, however, thereby letting harmful molecules enter
the brain and accumulate. The result is a gradual swelling of the brain,
which increases the pressure inside the cranium and inhibits blood flow
to the brain. And once again, with less oxygenated blood reaching the
brain, the crisis in neurons and glia is ignited. In turn, this causes
more brain swelling, lesions, and the formation of beta-amyloid plaques
and tau tangles. Recent studies have shown the hippocampus is especially
vulnerable to this “leaky blood-brain barrier” condition, and as it
loses it protective barrier, toxic substances from the blood vessels can
penetrate the neurons and worsen an individual’s memory loss and
cognitive impairment.5</p>
<p>Metabolic Disorders</p>
<p>Another big risk factor for dementia is the broad category of
metabolic disorders. Nearly 35 percent of all U.S. adults and 50 percent
of those sixty years of age or older are estimated to have what’s called
metabolic syndrome, a combination of health conditions you don’t want to
have, such as obesity, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, type 2
diabetes, or a poor lipid profile (too much bad cholesterol, not enough
good cholesterol).6 Since 2005, researchers have been finding
correlations between diabetes and risk for Alzheimer’s disease,
especially when the diabetes is not controlled and a person suffers from
chronic high blood sugar.7 Some have gone so far as to refer to
Alzheimer’s disease as “type 3 diabetes,” because the disease often
involves a disrupted relationship with insulin, the metabolic hormone
involved in both types 1 and 2 diabetes. Insulin is the hormone needed
to deliver sugar (glucose) into cells for use. Without insulin, cells
cannot absorb glucose, which they need to produce energy and thrive. In
type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, a person cannot make insulin
because the body has killed the specialized cells in the pancreas needed
to make insulin. For this reason, those with type 1 diabetes have to
inject themselves with insulin to make up for their lack of being able
to produce the substance on their own. Type 2 diabetes is a disease
characterized by chronic high blood sugar that causes dramatic surges in
insulin so high that cells become desensitized to the hormone. Think of
it as being in a room where the volume of the music is cranked up so
high that you feel the need to cover your ears. That’s essentially what
the cells do in the presence of too much insulin: They shut down the
receptors that normally bind insulin and transport it inside. So while a
person with type 2 diabetes can produce insulin, his or her cells don’t
use it as well as they should (we call this insulin resistance) and
sugar remains in the blood, where it doesn’t belong. Unlike type 1
diabetes, which is triggered by a faulty immune system, type 2 diabetes
is mostly caused by diet—too much sugar and processed carbohydrates that
force more insulin to be pumped out by the pancreas. And what the
science is now revealing is that Alzheimer’s disease could be another
potential side effect of a sugary Western diet.</p>
<p>People with type 2 diabetes may be at least twice as likely to
develop Alzheimer’s disease, and those with prediabetes or metabolic
syndrome may have an increased risk for having predementia or mild
cognitive impairment (MCI).8 Not all studies confirm the connection, but
the evidence is mounting, forcing scientists to think differently and
see broader relationships when it comes to risk for brain disease. The
path from a poor diet to Alzheimer’s doesn’t appear to have to go
through type 2 diabetes. In other words, studies are now showing that
people with high blood sugar have a higher rate of cognitive decline
than those with normal blood sugar. This was true in one particularly
alarming longitudinal study following more than five thousand people
over ten years.9 Their rate of cognitive decline, regardless of whether
they were diabetic, hinged on blood sugar levels. The higher the blood
sugar, the faster the decline.</p>
<p>At the root of type 3 diabetes is the phenomenon that neurons in the
brain become unable to respond to insulin, which means they can no
longer absorb glucose, ultimately leading to cell starvation and death
as insulin signaling becomes disrupted. Some researchers believe insulin
deficiency or resistance is central to the cognitive decline of
Alzheimer’s disease and could be implicated in the formation of those
infamous plaques.</p>
<p>A 2017 study from Dr. Guojun Bu, a Mayo Clinic neuroscientist and
professor of medicine, found more evidence for type 3 diabetes when he
showed that the variant of the Alzheimer’s gene known as APOE4 is
responsible for interrupting how the brain processes insulin.10 APOE4 is
found in approximately 20 percent of the general population and more
than half of Alzheimer’s cases. In Dr. Bu’s study, the mice with the
APOE4 gene showed insulin impairment, particularly in old age.</p>
<p>Put all of this information together, and it lends credence to the
link of genetics, poor diet, and risk for cognitive decline. I find it
interesting that not only have we witnessed a parallel rise in the
number of type 2 diabetes cases and the number of people who are
considered obese, but we’ve also begun to document the same pattern
among those with dementia: As the rate of type 2 diabetes increases, so
does the rate of Alzheimer’s disease. Remember this, because it will
explain some of the strategies in the Keep Sharp plan later in the
book.</p>
<p>I should also add something about weight here, because we all know
that there’s often a relationship between weight and risk for diabetes.
If the risk for Alzheimer’s disease goes up with metabolic disorders,
then it makes sense that the risk also rises with unhealthy weight gain
that has metabolic consequences. The science now speaks to this fact.
Carrying extra weight around the abdomen has been shown to be
particularly harmful to the brain. One study that garnered lots of media
attention looked at over six thousand individuals aged forty to
forty-five and measured the size of their bellies between 1964 and
1973.11 A few decades later, they were evaluated to see who had
developed dementia and how that related to their waist size at the start
of the study. The correlation between risk of dementia and thicker
midsections twenty-seven years earlier was remarkable: Those with the
highest level of abdominal fat had an increased risk of dementia of
almost three-fold in comparison to those with the lowest abdominal
weight. There is plenty of evidence that managing your weight now will
go a long way toward preventing brain decline later.</p>
<p>Toxic Substances</p>
<p>More research is needed to understand which chemicals can result in
brain abnormalities. I am not talking about well-known neurotoxins that
can adversely affect brain function such as lead, tetanus toxin (from a
bacteria), and mercury. I am talking about the exposure to chemicals we
inadvertently encounter in our daily lives that could be inflicting harm
slowly over time—for example, certain pesticides, insecticides,
substances in plastic, food additives, and chemicals in our general
household goods. For a long time, aluminum was feared as a “cause” of
Alzheimer’s disease, motivating many people to throw out their aluminum
pots and pans. Although aluminum’s neurotoxicity is incontrovertible, it
is more difficult to establish a direct association between aluminum and
Alzheimer’s disease. Today, the theory that aluminum causes dementia has
been largely discredited, but there are many other neurotoxins of
concern, which is why future research will likely provide some
answers.</p>
<p>In summer 2019, I went to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to spend time with
Paul Alan Cox, an ethnobotanist who studies the way indigenous people
interact with their environment, particularly plants. His work took him
to Guam, where he studied the native Chamorro people, who were known to
be one hundred times more likely to develop a complex of
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, compared to the rest
of the world. Puzzled, he began putting his skills to work and created a
consortium of scientists from a wide range of disciplines to
investigate. What they found may one day be relevant to everyone.
Because of their diet, which includes the fox bat as a delicacy, the
Chamorro have been inadvertently poisoning themselves with BMAA, a
neurotoxin produced by blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). While the
Chamorro take it in high doses, because it is concentrated in the fox
bat, it turns out that we are all exposed to BMAA, which could be a
significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s. The BMAA neurotoxin causes the
proteins, such as amyloid and tau, to misfold and clump together in
plaques and tangles. Because of this, Cox believes, as increasingly do
other scientists, that amyloid and tau aren’t the cause of Alzheimer’s
disease but a consequence of it. It’s a big idea, but even more
important is Cox’s team’s ongoing investigation into how to treat
Alzheimer’s disease in a remarkably simple way.</p>
<p>By replacing one of the building blocks of these proteins with an
amino acid known as L-serine, they have shown that the misfolding of
amyloid and tau doesn’t continue happening, effectively halting the
progression of Alzheimer’s disease. So far, Cox’s team has demonstrated
this only in fervet monkeys, but human trials are now underway at
Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Best part of all, L-serine is widely
available (in supplement form, usually a capsule), seems to have hardly
any side effects, and costs just a few dollars. Cox will be the first to
tell you that it is not a cure, meaning it won’t reverse cognitive
decline that has already occurred. Remember, however, that Alzheimer’s
disease typically starts in the brain long before someone develops
symptoms. If a simple treatment could be given during this early stage,
it could prevent someone from developing the symptoms in the first
place. It’s exciting work and further deflates the beta-amyloid
hypothesis, providing more evidence that amyloid plaques could be a
symptom of the disease, not the source.</p>
<p>Infections</p>
<p>Can infections earlier in life set the stage for Alzheimer’s disease
decades later? We have known for some time that infections from various
pathogens can have neurological effects, from Lyme disease caused by the
bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi to herpes simplex virus, Zika, syphilis,
rabies, and even gum disease.12 A hypothesis is now developing among
scientists that serious forms of neurodegenerative decline can stem from
the body’s reaction to these infections.13 This remains a hotly debated
topic because we don’t know if the germs’ presence is causing or
accelerating the disease or is merely a consequence of it. But the
theory is plausible enough to attract the attention of top
scientists.</p>
<p>A provocative study from Harvard researchers led by the late
Dr. Robert D. Moir in 2016 proposed that infections, including mild ones
that barely produce symptoms, fire up the immune system in the brain and
leave a debris trail that is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s.14 The theory:
a virus, bacterium, or fungus sneaks past the blood-brain barrier (which
does become leaky as we age) and triggers the brain’s self-defense
system. To combat the intruder, the brain makes beta-amyloid to act as a
kind of sticky web to trap the invader. The beta-amyloid is in fact an
antimicrobial peptide—basically, a protein that the immune system
creates to physically trap a germ. So what’s left is the webby plaque
that we see in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>More work is needed in this area because not everyone who has had a
brain infection develops Alzheimer’s and not everyone who gets dementia
can attribute the condition solely to an infection. Some people’s brains
may just be better genetically equipped to clear out those balls of
beta-amyloid after they have killed the microbes, and other people’s
brains may be more vulnerable. Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, who is director of the
Genetics and Aging Research Unit at MassGeneral Institute for
Neurodegenerative Disease, is now leading the Brain Microbiome Project
to learn what bacteria the brain can harbor and how to decipher the
friendly colonies from the potentially harmful ones. When I spoke with
Dr. Tanzi, who is also credited with discovering the Alzheimer’s genes
in the 1980s and 1990s, he clarified the connection between certain
infections and Alzheimer’s disease. See below, “Dr. Rudy Tanzi’s
‘Alzheimer’s in a Dish.’ ”</p>
<p>DR. RUDY TANZI’S “ALZHEIMER’S IN A DISH”</p>
<p>Since 2014, scientists have made great strides in understanding
Alzheimer’s pathology thanks to Rudy Tanzi’s “Alzheimer’s in a dish,”
the world’s first petri dish model of the disease. He and his team took
mini–human brain organoids—clumps of brain cells used to develop
“mini-brains”—grew them in a petri dish, inserted the Alzheimer’s genes,
and then watched what happened. This is how he observed the interplay
between the plaques and tangles and then what followed:
neuroinflammation, then significant nerve cell death. His metaphor is
frightening but makes the point: “Amyloid plaques are the match, tangles
are the brushfires, and neuroinflammation is the forest fire,” he told
me. Tanzi believes the brain’s immune system tries to extinguish the
brushfires by sending a surge of inflammatory cells. This
neuroinflammation then kills up to one hundred times more nerve cells,
laying the ground for future dementia.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Tanzi, this sequence of events helps explain why
clinical trials have failed: They try to hit amyloid way too late. The
best way to prevent a forest fire is to blow out the match first. The
key is to stop amyloid from developing in the first place and target
people before symptoms even develop.</p>
<p>So what strikes the match? Dr. Tanzi’s lab has found that amyloid
forms rather instantly around viruses like the herpes virus or bacteria
and fungi like yeast. “Within twenty-four hours, a plaque forms with the
virus trapped inside it. These are called extracellular traps and
they’re part of our innate immune system. Antibodies take a while to
kick in when we get an infection, but before that, our primitive immune
system tries to help us.” While the immune system helps protect us at
the time of infection, though, it may also set the stage for Alzheimer’s
later in life.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you need a germ present to make a plaque. Other
“ingredients” can cause plaques to form as well, and genetics certainly
plays a role in making some people more likely to form plaques. This
also doesn’t mean certain germs definitively cause Alzheimer’s. But
what’s interesting to note is that as we get older, our viral and
bacterial loads from a lifetime of exposures are much higher than they
were when we were kids. Some germs, such as the herpes simplex virus 1
that causes cold sores, can reactivate later in life. And when that
happens, amyloid instantly gets seeded in a way that resembles cloud
seeding. A big mass forms around the virus and traps it to protect the
nerve cells in the brain. From Tanzi’s perspective, we all need a little
bit of beta-amyloid protein to protect the brain, but there may be a
point when that protection can also pose a problem. As to why some
people live with lots of brain plaques but never develop dementia? Tanzi
calls those “resilient brains,” and we’ll get to the secrets to that
later in the book. The key is making sure the brain’s immune system
doesn’t overreact with neuroinflammation. I will teach you strategies to
help with that as well.</p>
<p>Head Trauma and Injury</p>
<p>Repeated blows to the head can do lasting damage. Dr. Gary Small,
founding director of the UCLA Memory Clinic, professor of psychiatry,
and the director of the UCLA Center on Aging, as well as an expert for
the Global Council on Brain Health, was the doctor who diagnosed Tony
Dorsett’s CTE. Dr. Small’s group’s finding was among the first to link
multiple concussions to damaging tau buildup. Dorsett had suffered from
depression and memory loss for many years and went to UCLA for answers.
He wanted to know whether there could be a connection between all the
concussions he endured in the 1970s and 1980s playing football and the
debilitating symptoms he suffered later in life. Since Dorsett’s
diagnosis, scores of other former football players have been diagnosed
with CTE, and lawsuits have been filed against the National Football
League. Gary Small has been a pioneer in brain medicine for decades, and
I’ve had the opportunity to consult with him on his research and
findings. You’ll read more about his top strategies to keep sharp in
part 2.</p>
<p>Immune System Challenges and Chronic Inflammation</p>
<p>I’ve already covered the immune system’s potential role in
neurodegeneration and the downstream effects of inflammation. It is
worth highlighting a few more specifics because chronic inflammation
associated with aging (“inflamm-aging”) is at the center of virtually
all degenerative conditions, from those that increase one’s risk for
dementia, such as diabetes and vascular diseases, to those that are
directly brain related, such as depression and Alzheimer’s disease. For
decades scientists have debated the role of inflammation in a diseased
brain, but now a burst of new research suggests that inflammation not
only adds to disease processes in the brain that cause decline, but it
also ignites those processes in the first place. One new study published
in 2019 out of Johns Hopkins showed that chronic inflammation at midlife
is linked to later cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.15</p>
<p>To be sure, inflammation is the body’s defense system for taking care
of potential insults and injury, but when that system is constantly
deploying chemical substances and keying up the immune system, it
becomes problematic. Although studies in the past showed that people who
have taken common anti-inflammatory medications such as Advil
(ibuprofen) and Aleve (naproxen) for two or more years may have a
reduced risk for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, subsequent
clinical trials have failed to show that these anti-inflammatory drugs
can significantly lessen or totally prevent Alzheimer’s, and taking them
comes with their own side effects and other risks.16 At the same time,
other studies have shown heightened levels of cytokines in the brains of
individuals suffering from these and other degenerative brain disorders.
Cytokines are the substances secreted by cells in the body that act like
traffic signals for the inflammatory process, among other things. What
this means is that chronic inflammation likely plays a big role in brain
decline. Today, new imaging technology is finally allowing us to see
cells actively involved in producing inflammatory cytokines in the
brains of Alzheimer’s patients.</p>
<p>Inflammation in the brain can also be directly related to those
amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which again shows how interconnected
and interrelated some of these “causes” for Alzheimer’s can be.
Specialized “housekeeping” or “support staff” cells in the brain called
microglia, or simply glia or glial cells as I previously defined,
sometimes recognize these proteins as foreign debris and release
inflammatory molecules to get rid of them. Glial cells are the brain’s
unique immune cells and are related to types of white blood cells called
macrophages. The resulting inflammation from the glial cells’ actions
further impairs the working of neurons, thereby worsening the disease
process. But, once again, the exact cause-and-effect mechanism remains a
mystery. We can’t say for sure that inflammation directly causes
Alzheimer’s disease, though it’s likely to be a big part of the whole
picture.</p>
<p>TYPES OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS</p>
<p>Just as different types of cognitive deficits can be experienced,
there is not a well-defined road to full-blown Alzheimer’s from a normal
aging brain. Let’s take a look at the terms often used to differentiate
certain conditions from others. Alzheimer’s disease is one type of
dementia, and the individual experience with it can vary greatly from
person to person. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, up to 40
percent of dementias are caused by conditions other than
Alzheimer’s.17</p>
<p>Normal Aging</p>
<p>Your brain, like the rest of your body, changes as you grow older.
While there is normal age-related tissue loss and degeneration of the
synapses, here’s a new finding we all should rejoice over. In 2018,
researchers from Columbia University showed for the first time that
healthy older folks can generate just as many new brain cells as younger
people.18 The researchers found that the ability to make new neurons
from precursor cells in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center, does
not hinge solely on age. Although older folks have less vascularization
(fewer and less robust blood vessels) and perhaps less ability of new
neurons to make connections, they don’t necessarily lose their ability
to grow new brain cells. The key word here, though, is healthy—as in
healthy individuals. It should be clear by now that to maintain
neurogenesis, vascularization, and make new neural connections, you have
to stay healthy overall. This is another reason the connection between
the mind and the body is so strong.</p>
<p>It’s important to bear in mind that the brain begins to age in one’s
mid-twenties and can structurally begin to deteriorate as early as age
thirty. After age forty, the hippocampus shrinks by about 0.5 percent
per year. This shrinkage, however, is quite variable among individuals
and heavily depends on lifestyle choices, environmental factors, genetic
predisposition, and medical conditions. These factors have an impact on
the hippocampus more than any other part of the brain. Dozens of
neuroscience research studies have shown that the hippocampus is fragile
and shrinks more than any other brain area—with whatever insults happen
to the brain. For example, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, or vitamin
B12 deficiency results in atrophy in the hippocampus more so than other
brain regions.</p>
<p>We all experience a breakdown of the assembly process of memory
described earlier, and that breakdown can begin in a subtle way when we
are young, worsening as we reach our fifties and beyond. I have seen the
physical changes of an aged brain upon autopsy. The brain has shrunk,
the folds are more prominent, and the blood vessels are hardened and
less robust. Under the microscope, you may also see evidence of neuronal
cell death and even changes in the synapses. Still, none of this
necessarily correlates with outward signs of cognitive decline while the
individual was alive. The point is that there has been a conceptual
shift away from the view of aging as a disease, even if aging is a risk
factor for certain diseases. In other words, aging does not mean there
will be inevitable cognitive decline. Any cognitive decline, be it
“normal” or abnormal, is more than just a factor of age and brain
degeneration.</p>
<p>Mild Cognitive Impairment</p>
<p>MCI is often the beginning stage of dementia, but not everyone with
MCI will go on to develop a more severe form or Alzheimer’s disease.
They are simply at an increased risk. MCI causes a slight, often
unnoticeable, decline in memory function. An example is a
seventy-five-year-old person who repeats the same question five or six
times in an hour but can still drive and manage daily routines. Unlike
other types of cognitive impairment that affect speech and bodily
control, with MCI only memory is impacted. It’s important to treat signs
and symptoms as early as possible. Nearly 10 to 20 percent of people
sixty-five and older are estimated to have MCI.19</p>
<p>Dementia</p>
<p>The term dementia is a general one used to describe various symptoms
and severities of cognitive decline, starting with mild cognitive
impairment and moving to severe dementia. In other words, dementia is
not a single disease in itself; it encompasses several underlying
diseases and brain disorders that impair memory, communication, and
thinking. There are several types of dementia.</p>
<p>Vascular Dementia. This type of dementia is caused by an impaired
blood supply to the brain and may be brought on by a blood vessel
blockage or damage leading to strokes or bleeding in the brain.
Sometimes a person can show symptoms of both vascular dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease at the same time. The location and amount of the
brain damage determines whether dementia will result and how the
individual’s thinking and physical functioning will be affected. It used
to be that evidence of vascular dementia was used to exclude a diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s (and vice versa). That practice is no longer used because
the brain changes of Alzheimer’s and of vascular dementia commonly
coexist. Only about 10 percent of brains from individuals with dementia
show evidence of vascular dementia alone, and about half of all people
with Alzheimer’s have signs of silent strokes.20</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). This condition affects about one in
every five patients with dementia. Proteins, called alpha-synuclein or
Lewy bodies, will build up in certain parts of the brain responsible for
cognition, movement, and overall behavior. As a result, patients have
memory problems and symptoms similar to Parkinson’s. Visual
hallucinations often occur early and can be an important clue for the
diagnosis.</p>
<p>The Road to Severe Dementia</p>
<p>Frontotemporal Lobar Dementia (FTLD). Also known as Pick’s disease,
FTLD is a group of disorders triggered by gradual nerve cell loss in the
brain’s frontal and temporal lobes, resulting in changes in behavior
(e.g., socially inappropriate responses, loss of empathy, lack of
inhibition, poor judgment), difficulty speaking, and memory
problems—though memory is usually spared in the early stages of this
disease. The changes in personality and behavior are often the first
signs. About 60 percent of people with FTLD are forty-five to sixty
years old, but FTLD accounts for only 10 percent of dementia
cases.21</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s Disease. This is the most common form of dementia. It is
a progressive disease with symptoms that typically develop gradually
before they intensify and become severe. In its late stages, the disease
can make it difficult for a person to handle daily tasks, think clearly,
control bodily movements, and live independently. Alzheimer’s disease
accounts for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, affects one in nine
Americans age sixty-five and older, and is the sixth leading cause of
death in the United States. Nearly 6 million people are living with this
disease. When someone shows signs of having both Alzheimer’s and other
dementias, it’s called mixed dementia.22</p>
<p>NORMAL VERSUS NOT NORMAL</p>
<p>You forgot what day of the week it was when you woke up this morning.
Normal or a sign of something serious? You can’t remember the phone
number you had twenty years ago or the name of your high school track
coach. Typical? One of the first questions people ask themselves upon
forgetting something seemingly basic or being unable to recall a
long-lost classmate’s first name at a reunion is: Is this normal or the
first stages of cognitive decline? Mary A. Fischer explains six types of
normal memory lapses for AARP that are not a cause for worry.
Whew!23</p>
<p>Absentmindedness. Where did you put your keys down? Or what was the
reason to walk into the dining room? We all experience this on occasion,
and we can blame a general lack of attention or focus. It’s normal to
forget directions to somewhere you haven’t visited in a while. But if
you finish grocery shopping at your usual store and then can’t find your
way home, that could be a problem that is beyond absentmindedness. In
their seminal work, The Memory Book, Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas
eloquently describe the important process of what they call establishing
“original awareness.”24 They use the term simply to refer to the “first
time”—as in the first time you see or do something that you want to
remember. When you set your keys down on a table, you need to have an
original awareness when you initially set them down in order to remember
that you put them there. You need to actively observe what you’re doing.
In fact, observation is essential to original awareness, and it’s not
the same as just “seeing.” There is a difference between what the eyes
“see” and what the mind “observes.” If your mind is “absent” when you
perform an action, there can be no observation; more important, there
can be no awareness of the action (learning) and subsequent creation of
the memory.</p>
<p>Blocking. This is the classic but frustrating experience of not being
able to recall something from memory that you feel is right there. You
know what you’re trying to say, but it’s hidden. Blocking usually
results from several similar memories creating a disruption. Multiple
studies have shown that older participants often activate more areas of
the brain to perform a memory task than the study’s young subjects.25
Think of it as if your memory retrieval button gets jammed from time to
time.</p>
<p>Scrambling. If you’ve ever gotten the details wrong but can
accurately remember most of an event or other chunks of information,
you’re scrambling—confusing those little details. For example, a good
friend tells you that she is taking a writing class to finish her novel.
Later, you correctly recall this bit of information but think she told
you in person when it was during a phone conversation. A glitch in the
hippocampus is likely to blame for this. It has incorrectly recorded the
time and place of the facts.</p>
<p>Fading away. The brain continually cleans out older memories to make
room for new ones. Memories that are not recalled often can begin to
fade away because those memories are not being reinforced. Which is why
it’s relatively easier to remember the details of what you did more
recently than what happened many years ago. This basic use-it-or-lose-it
characteristic of memory is called transience, and it’s normal at all
ages.</p>
<p>Struggling for retrieval. This one is similar to absentmindedness.
You just met someone for the first time, and seconds later, you can’t
remember her name. Or you saw a great movie, but when you tell a friend
about it the next day, you’ve completely forgotten the title or the
starring actor’s name. Aging changes the strengths of the connections
between neurons in the brain, and new information can delete other items
from short-term memory unless it is repeated again and again. This is
why paying special attention to learning someone’s name on the spot and
associating that name with something particular or familiar will help
you avoid this glitch.</p>
<p>Muddled multitasking: At some point, the number of things you can do
effectively at one time diminishes. Maybe you can’t type an email and
watch TV at the same time. Studies show that the older we get, the more
effort it takes the brain to maintain focus, and it takes longer to get
back to an original task after an interruption. We’ll see in chapter 6
how ending attempts to multitask can actually be a good thing for the
brain.</p>
<p>RETHINKING COGNITIVE DECLINE</p>
<p>Is Alzheimer’s disease overdiagnosed? It’s a provocative question,
and one that can lead to a surprisingly uplifting idea. Because there is
no definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s as you can diabetes or heart
disease, it is possible to saddle people with this label too quickly.
For some people, the reality is they can reverse their cognitive decline
because they never had Alzheimer’s in the first place. It’s a point
Dr. Majid Fotuhi raised with me in a lively discussion, and it’s worth
considering his perspective.</p>
<p>Dr. Fotuhi is a neurologist and neuroscientist with more than
twenty-five years of research and clinical experience at Johns Hopkins
and Harvard Medical School in the field of memory, aging, and brain
rehabilitation. Today he treats patients with a wide range of
complicated neurological issues, from cognitive impairments to
postconcussion syndrome, vertigo, chronic migraine, and attention
deficit disorders. He reports that he has achieved remarkable results
when he puts patients through his multidisciplinary protocols tailored
to each unique individual. For him, a comprehensive brain fitness
program focuses on lifestyle strategies to modify risk factors such as
vascular disorders, vitamin deficiencies, obesity, diabetes, depression,
anxiety, sleep apnea, and sedentary behavior. In his own research, he
has documented vast improvements in patients who at one time felt
hopeless about the future of their brains. But he proved them wrong by
letting the results speak for themselves. He has even documented
substantial growth in volume of that all-important memory center of the
brain, the hippocampus, within weeks of an interventional program.</p>
<p>The suggestions I make for you to do at home will no doubt echo some
of the protocols he offers to C-suite executives around the country who
have access to his exclusive care. “I want to change the conversation,”
says Dr. Fotuhi. By focusing on brain growth and repair rather than
telling people they have a fatal condition, he hopes more people will be
inspired by the possibility of building bigger, better brains today. He
goes so far as to suggest we do away with the doomsday term Alzheimer’s
disease and instead establish new terminology that simply uses words
like mild, moderate, and severe cognitive impairment. Like many of the
other researchers I spoke to for this book, Dr. Fotuhi is critical of
the amyloid cascade hypothesis as the basis for all patients with
Alzheimer’s. In his 2009 Nature Review article, he provided an
alternative theory, the dynamic polygon hypothesis.26</p>
<p>This is how he explains it: “Multiple risk factors—and protective
factors—interact with each other to help us either stay sharp with aging
or decline rapidly. I continue to believe that it is naive to target
amyloid as the sole culprit for a decline that happens to most people in
late life—with variable speed and with many different clinical
manifestations. Amyloid is the sole culprit only in patients with
early-onset Alzheimer’s disease—which is quite different than late-life
‘Alzheimer’s disease.’ ” Remember this point. For many patients
diagnosed with cognitive decline, the reality is they may have neither
amyloid nor Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>FOCUS ON YOUR BRAIN, AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL FOLLOW</p>
<p>When I interviewed top experts in brain health from a wide variety of
professionals and pioneers in the field, one individual’s statement
stood out from the rest. It came from Dr. Dan Johnston, a former
lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army who has served as a physician and
researcher in the army from the Pentagon to Iraq and recently cofounded
BrainSpan, a company and laboratory that develops products and programs
to help people measure, track, and improve brain function. As a health
care provider, his company delivers its products mostly through
physicians.</p>
<p>To say Johnston’s goal is to optimize brain health and performance is
an understatement. He aims to shift the way we think about health by
“starting at the top,” as he puts it. When it comes to health, many of
us immediately turn to things like weight, cholesterol levels, risk for
cancer, blood sugar levels, and heart health, and we forget about the
brain. Those other things are seemingly easier to grasp because the
brain is encased in bone and has a mystical quality. The medical
establishment has typically interfaced with the brain only when it is
diseased or damaged. But here’s the key point: when you put your brain
first, everything else health-wise falls into place. The brain is ground
zero. Don’t forget that it is what makes you. Your heart ticks, yes, but
it’s your brain that ultimately makes you tick and determines your
quality of life. Without a healthy brain, you cannot even make healthy
decisions. And with a healthy brain comes not only a healthy body,
weight, heart, and so on, but also a stronger sense of confidence, a
more solid financial future thanks to smart decisions, better
relationships, more love in your life, and heightened overall
happiness.</p>
<p>The upcoming chapters put the brain first. If you’re worried about
something else—maybe those extra twenty pounds, the general aches and
pains, the insomnia and chronic headaches—challenge yourself to make
brain health a priority and watch what happens.</p>
