<h4 id="chapter-9-putting-it-all-together">CHAPTER 9 Putting It All
Together</h4>
<p>12 Weeks to Sharper</p>
<p>One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two,
never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty
without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is
there and don’t throw it away.</p>
<p>STEPHEN HAWKING</p>
<p>I had a chance to spend a few days with Stephen Hawking in the late
1990s. I was working at the White House and helped plan a series of
evenings for the President and First Lady. When we were thinking about
how best to celebrate science, we unanimously agreed on having the famed
theoretical physicist as our featured guest. Because of his ALS, Hawking
typed (with one finger) his entire talk into his computer and then
played it after going onstage. We had even planned the
question-and-answer part of the evening ahead of time. I knew the
audience would be engaged and entertained by his brilliance in the world
of physics, but it was his life lessons that have stayed with me more
than twenty years later. Hawking’s disease slowly robbed him of his
ability to walk, speak, and participate in life the way most of us can,
but he had a mind that nobody and nothing could take away from him. It
remained sharp until his peaceful death, which happened to be on the
139th anniversary of Einstein’s birth.</p>
<p>Since my youth, I have appreciated the idea that we each “own” our
brains. And like Hawking, I’ve never taken mine for granted. When I was
a child, my father was mugged and robbed. It was pretty traumatic for
everyone in the family, and I didn’t realize how much I had internalized
the feeling that my family had been violated. It practically felt like I
had been violated—that the culprit had taken something from me. Once
when I was speaking to a teacher about it, he told me (while pointing to
his head): “They can take away everything you own, but they can never
take away this.”</p>
<p>It’s true. There will always be bad guys out there trying to steal
our possessions and momentarily disrupting our life, but they cannot
pilfer our minds. Our minds are uniquely our own, and our perceptions of
the world are uniquely our own as a result. As soon as sensory stimuli
come in—through smell, sight, sound, touch, taste—they go through
hundreds of relay stations, each one changing the stimulus ever so
slightly so that the final interpretation of the stimulus is highly
individual. This is what makes each of our lives distinctive as well. I
plan to continue living a wholly unique life of adventure and discovery
for as long as possible. It will create a mind that is like a
fingerprint, unlike anyone else’s. My hope is the same for you.</p>
<p>I’ve given you a lot of information in this part of the book, much of
it geared toward teaching you strategies that will keep you sharp. Now I
offer you a twelve-week outline of a program you can use to put my ideas
into daily practice. Never forget that the brain is exceptionally
plastic—it can rewire and reshape itself through your experiences and
habits, and a lot of this remolding can be achieved in a mere twelve
weeks. It’s like building any other muscle.</p>
<p>You might be feeling overwhelmed or perhaps panicky at the thought of
following this program if it means ditching some of your favorite foods,
starting an exercise routine after having been sedentary for a long
time, trying to learn to meditate, and getting out of the house more
often to socialize. I realize that for some people, breaking an
addiction to sugar and breaking a sweat more often can be tough. Change
is a challenge, and changing long-established habits takes effort.
You’re wondering if this is truly doable in the real world if your
willpower is weak.</p>
<p>Well, let me say that you can do this. Take the plunge and experience
the initial effects. Within a couple of weeks, I predict that you’ll
have fewer anxious thoughts, better sleep, and improved energy. You’ll
feel clearer-minded, less moody, and more resilient to your daily
stressors. Over time, you’ll likely experience weight loss, and specific
laboratory tests will show vast improvements in many areas of your
biochemistry—from what’s going on in your brain to how your metabolism
and immune system are functioning.</p>
<p>It’s smart to check with your doctor about beginning this new
program, especially if you have any health issues such as diabetes. Do
not change any of your medications or other doctor-prescribed
recommendations. But do think about getting some baseline testing done
with your doctor to see where you can reduce your risk from a metabolic
standpoint. As I’ve outlined, things like blood pressure, and levels of
cholesterol, blood sugar, and inflammation all factor into risk for
cognitive decline. You can fight those numbers and bring them into a
healthy range either through lifestyle changes or in combination with
certain drugs. This is standard bloodwork done at regular checkups. It
can further motivate you. The program outlined below will automatically
help you to address these important areas, and I encourage you to
re-check your numbers after you’ve gone through the program. My guess is
you’ll see improvements.</p>
<p>Take this one day, one change at a time. You do not need to follow
this program precisely. All I ask is that you do what you can and aim to
establish at least one new habit a week throughout these next twelve
weeks.</p>
<p>Over the course of the twelve weeks, you will achieve five important
goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Move more throughout your day and build an exercise routine into
your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Find new ways to stimulate your brain through learning and
challenging your mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize getting restful, routine sleep at night and
incorporate daily destressing practices into your routine.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a new way of nourishing your body.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect authentically with others and maintain a vibrant social
life.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>During the first week, you will start five new habits each day based
on the five pillars, and then repeat the new series of habits the
following week. In the third week, you’ll incorporate more habits into
your days until you’ve reached the twelfth week with a whole new rhythm.
It may take you a little longer to fully establish and maintain these
healthy behaviors for life, but the first twelve weeks will get you
started. It’s your launchpad. You needn’t do anything to prepare; you
can start today. Although some planning will be involved, such as
scheduling workout times, shopping for my menu ideas, or creating a
weekend get-together with friends, you can work these suggestions into
your life as you see fit.</p>
<p>I won’t be asking you to buy anything to make this program work for
you. I’d love for you to invest in yourself in the form of enrolling in
a creative writing class, for example, or joining a local yoga studio,
but these may not align with your preferences. Tailor this program to
your needs and proclivities. If I make a suggestion that you don’t like,
skip it or replace it with another. I want this program to be flexible,
doable, and personalized. Don’t second-guess your ability to succeed at
this; I’ve designed this program to be as practical and easy to follow
as possible. Most important, it will end up being tailored and highly
individualized for you.</p>
<p>WEEKS 1 AND 2: DIVE INTO THE FIVE</p>
<p>You can address five areas in your life in these next two weeks and
start building a better brain.</p>
<p>Move More</p>
<p>If you already exercise regularly, keep it up, but try something
different this week to surprise your body and use new muscles. If you’re
a jogger, try swimming or a cycling class. Aim to increase your workouts
to a minimum of thirty minutes a day, at least five days a week. Don’t
forget to engage in strength training two to three days this week,
avoiding back-to-back strength training days so you give your muscles
time to recover. On the days when you don’t want to do anything
strenuous, go for a long walk or take a restorative yoga class.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t busted a move in a while, time to get moving.
If you’ve been totally sedentary, start with five to ten minutes of
burst exercise (thirty seconds of maximal effort and ninety seconds of
recovery) and work up to twenty minutes at least three times per week.
You can do this any number of ways: walking outside and varying your
speed and levels of intensity with hills; using classic gym equipment
such as treadmills and StairMasters; or taking online exercise classes
at places like Daily Burn or Booya Fitness to perform a routine in the
comforts of home (most of these require a fee or monthly subscription,
but they offer free trial sessions so you can find the one you like the
best). Get out your calendar, and schedule your physical activities.</p>
<p>If you have a day with absolutely no time to devote to a continuous
segment of formal exercise, then think about the ways you can get in
more minutes of physical activity during that day. There’s a general
lack of walking, standing, and moving our bodies on a regular basis to
counteract all the harm that can result from sitting for the majority of
the day. All the research indicates that you can achieve similar health
benefits from doing three ten-minute bouts of exercise as you would from
doing a single thirty-minute workout. When you are short on time on any
given day, break up your routine and think of ways to combine exercise
with other tasks; for example, conduct a meeting with a colleague at
work while walking outside, or stream your favorite show while you
complete a set of yoga poses on the floor. Limit the minutes you spend
sitting down. Every time you are about to sit, ask yourself: “Can I stay
standing and moving instead?” Walk around while you talk on the phone,
take the stairs rather than the elevator, and park a distance away from
the front door to your building. Simply make a point to get up every
hour for a five-minute stroll or jog in place. The more you move
throughout the day, the more your body and brain benefit.</p>
<p>Love to Learn</p>
<p>In chapter 5, I covered the importance of participating in
cognitively stimulating activities. How often are you reading books and
learning about topics outside your professional interest? Have you
wanted to learn a new language? Take a painting or cooking class? Join a
writing group to finish that book of yours? Now’s the time to make this
happen. I don’t expect you to sign up right away, but begin to explore
the possibilities in your community. Check out the local university’s
adult education courses, or maybe your local rec center has programs.
You can probably do much of this homework online.</p>
<p>Sleep Hygiene</p>
<p>I gave you plenty of tips for establishing good sleep hygiene in
chapter 6. If you get fewer than six hours of sleep per night, you can
start by increasing that period of time to at least seven hours. This is
the bare minimum if you want to have normal, healthy functioning
physiology from your brain on down. If you don’t know where to start
with better sleep habits, focus on the following:</p>
<p>Time your last meal smartly. Leave approximately three hours between
dinner and bedtime so your stomach is settled and poised for you to go
to sleep. Avoid late-night binges. Stop caffeine after 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Be ritualistic with your sleep habits. Go to bed and get up at
roughly the same time daily no matter what. In the hour before bedtime,
do something calming: take a warm bath or read a book. Keep your bedroom
quiet, dark, and electronics free.</p>
<p>In addition, pick one stress-reducing strategy to practice once a day
for at least fifteen minutes. It can be deep breathing, meditating, or
journal writing. Just fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Eat Sanjay Style</p>
<p>I try to eat only when the sun is shining. Some have called this
chrono eating—“chrono” meaning relating to the body’s sense of time and
its circadian rhythm throughout the twenty-four-hour solar day. I
believe when you eat is also important, not just what you eat. I eat
breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a peasant.
Frontloading calories seems to help me, and studies have shown we tend
to eat less overall as long as we are consistent. I rarely snack, which
for most people is just a form of recreational or comfort eating.</p>
<p>When I lived with the indigenous Tsimané tribe in the Amazon rain
forest for several days in the summer of 2017, it was one of the wildest
experiences of my life. From La Paz, Bolivia, we flew into Rurranbaque,
a little town on the edge of the Amazon. From there we took a
four-by-four as far as we could go into the rain forest. Then we got
into dugout canoes and spent hours on the rivers and tributaries of the
Amazon until we found the tribe. I went on the journey because I had
heard the Tsimané tribe, as they are called, has almost no evidence of
heart disease, diabetes, or dementia. It is an extraordinary thing,
considering that in the United States, we spend a billion dollars a day
on heart disease, and it remains the biggest killer of men and women
alike. In the middle of the Amazon, they didn’t even have a health care
system, and they seemed to have found something that had eluded us in
one of the wealthiest countries in the world. I was determined to learn
about their secrets to health. I went spearfishing with one tribe member
who thought he was eighty-four years old, but he really didn’t know for
sure. His shirt was off, and he was balancing himself on the canoe, just
looking at the water, spearing fish. His eyesight was perfect, as was
his hearing. The entire indigenous tribe was very much like him. What I
found is that they typically eat 70 percent carbs (unrefined and
unprocessed), 15 percent fat, and 15 percent protein, a percentage I
strive for as well.</p>
<p>Members of the Tsimané tribe typically walk (not run) about seventeen
thousand steps per day, they rarely sit, and they get nine hours of
sleep every night—waking up to the rooster’s crow. To be clear, their
life expectancy isn’t higher because they tend to die of trauma:
accidents, snake bites, childbirth, etc. But until the day they die,
they are typically very healthy.</p>
<p>When you start the Sharp program, avoid eating out during the first
two weeks so you can focus on getting the dietary protocol down. This
will prepare you for the day you do venture outside your home for a meal
and have to make good decisions. The first two weeks will also
dramatically curb your cravings, so there’s less temptation when you’re
looking at a menu filled with brain-busting foods. When you’re
time-starved and don’t have access to a kitchen, often the case during
lunch at work, pack food. Remember S.H.A.R.P. (see chapter 7 for
details):</p>
<p>S Slash the sugar.</p>
<p>H Hydrate smartly.</p>
<p>A Add more omega-3s from natural sources like wild cold-water
fish.</p>
<p>R Reduce portions.</p>
<p>P Plan meals ahead.</p>
<p>Below are some ideas for meal making:</p>
<p>Building a Better Breakfast</p>
<p>Instead of pastries, doughnuts, bagels, or cereals, try one of the
following:</p>
<p>Egg frittata with lots of colorful veggies and a side of whole-grain
toast topped with almond butter</p>
<p>Steel-cut oatmeal with cinnamon, blueberries, crushed raw walnuts,
and a drizzle of honey</p>
<p>Greek-style yogurt (plain, 2 percent) topped with flaxseed, fresh
berries, and a tablespoon of real maple syrup (not the kind made with
high-fructose corn syrup)</p>
<p>Whole-grain waffles or pancakes with blueberries and crushed walnuts,
topped with a tablespoon of real maple syrup</p>
<p>Skip the juices, smoothies, and frappuccinos, and choose a tall glass
of water, black coffee, or tea instead. I don’t drink a lot of juices
and smoothies in general, despite their popularity. Given that digestion
begins in the mouth, juices or smoothies—even super-healthy ones—don’t
get absorbed as well because they pass through the stomach and first
part of the small intestine before digestion really begins. As a result,
you are not getting the “good stuff” out of food as easily. Remember
that we drink to hydrate more than to obtain calories or nutrients. I
stick to real food for these things.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I have been “drinking” a chewable juice
called Chuice (there are a few other brands on the market). With nuts
and whole plants in the drink, you are forced to chew your juice,
release salivary amylase, and begin the digestion process. Because you
are chewing, your stomach and digestive tract are prepared for this
bolus of food, and absorption is much more efficient and complete. So if
juices and smoothies are your thing—and they can be very helpful when
you have on-the-go mornings—look for one of these chewable varieties.
Make sure it’s low in sugar.</p>
<p>Smarter Lunching</p>
<p>Instead of hitting a fast-food drive-through or buying a highly
processed lunch, try these:</p>
<p>A leafy green salad with lots of colors and a serving of healthy
protein such as chicken, salmon, or tofu, topped with seeds, nuts, a
drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and balsamic vinegar</p>
<p>A turkey or grilled chicken sandwich on whole-grain bread or
sourdough with a side of leafy greens</p>
<p>Swap out your daily fix of soda or sugary energy drinks and go for
water, unsweetened tea, or try kombucha tea. For a touch of sweetness
after lunch, have a serving of fruit or two squares of dark
chocolate.</p>
<p>My Kind of Dinner</p>
<p>Again, avoid the fast-food options and put some effort into lively
conversation around the dinner table with friends or family. Try
these:</p>
<p>Turkey chili with a veggie-rich side salad</p>
<p>Grilled fish or chicken with spices of your choice (I’d do the
turmeric—you know that!) and sides of roasted veggies and wild rice</p>
<p>A simple pasta dish with homemade pesto and side salad</p>
<p>Stick with water to drink, and if you choose to, you can add a glass
of wine, preferably red. See if you can go without dessert.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bonus: If you’ve gotten the green light from your doctor to try
intermittent fasting, you can do a mild version once or twice a week by
making sure you stop eating after 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. and then going until
9:00 or 10:00 the next morning, respectively, before your next meal.
That’s a twelve-hour fast, much of which you’ll spend sleeping. A more
rigorous version is for sixteen hours, and that can be done by skipping
breakfast entirely. But again, be sure you can do this given any
personal health issues. If you have diabetes, be sure to get some
guidance from your doctor.</p>
<p>Connect with People</p>
<p>Chapter 8 listed several ways you can elevate your social life. Kudos
to you if you already consider yourself a socially active individual.
Keep it up. For those who feel more isolated, make it a goal to call
someone you haven’t spoken with in a while and invite a friend over for
dinner.</p>
<p>WEEKS 3 AND 4</p>
<p>Add more to your new routine by choosing at least two of the
following options:</p>
<p>Go for a twenty-minute power walk after lunch most days of the
week.</p>
<p>Invite a neighbor over for dinner.</p>
<p>Have at least two of your meals each week feature cold-water fish
like salmon or trout.</p>
<p>Download a meditation app if you haven’t done so already, and start
to use it daily.</p>
<p>If you’re still drinking soft drinks, diet or regular, try to
eliminate these from your life and switch to just water. You can drink
carbonated, flavored water as long as it does not contain any sugar or
artificial sweeteners. In the morning, coffee and tea are fine.</p>
<p>WEEKS 5 AND 6</p>
<p>Add more to your new routine by choosing at least three of the
following options:</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried to keep a gratitude journal yet, start one. Each
morning, spend five minutes making a list of at least five people or
situations you are grateful for. If weather permits, do this outside in
the fresh air and morning sunlight. If you repeat items on your previous
list, that’s okay. Think of things that happened the day before that can
be added to the list. They can be as minor as being grateful that you
felt pretty good and reached your goals for the day.</p>
<p>Add fifteen more minutes to your exercise routine.</p>
<p>Try a yoga or Pilates class or go on a hike with a friend.</p>
<p>Avoid all processed foods.</p>
<p>Add a relaxing activity to your bedtime routine such as taking a warm
Epsom salt bath or engaging in some mindfulness meditation during which
you simply sit in a comfortable, quiet place and take notice of your
thoughts and feelings. That’s it! No judging, no problem solving, no
list making—just a few quiet moments of stillness and focusing on your
breath.</p>
<p>WEEKS 7 AND 8</p>
<p>Add more to your new routine by checking off all five of the
following ideas:</p>
<p>Look for opportunities to volunteer in your community or at your
children’s or grandchildren’s schools. Find the time. It will be worth
it.</p>
<p>Explore your local farmers’ market and buy fresh foods.</p>
<p>Schedule a checkup with your doctor if you haven’t had one within the
year. Be sure to address your current medications, if you take any, and
speak candidly about your risk factors for cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Write a handwritten letter to a younger loved one in the family,
describing something you’ve learned in your life that you can pass down
as an important lesson.</p>
<p>Read a book in a genre or subject area that interests you but that
you’re not used to reading. If you typically read mystery thrillers but
loved the play Hamilton, try reading the namesake biography by Ron
Chernow.</p>
<p>WEEKS 9 AND 10</p>
<p>At this juncture, I encourage you to ask yourself the following
questions and adjust accordingly based on your answers:</p>
<p>Am I getting at least thirty minutes of exercise at least five days a
week and including strength or resistance training at least two days a
week?</p>
<p>Am I learning something new that challenges my mind and demands
developing different skills?</p>
<p>Am I getting more restful sleep on a regular basis and managing
stress better?</p>
<p>Am I following the S.H.A.R.P. dietary protocol?</p>
<p>Am I connecting with friends and family members regularly?</p>
<p>If you cannot answer these questions in the affirmative, go back and
read the chapter that covers the area in particular and see if you can
make the necessary tweaks to your lifestyle. If you’re still not getting
results, it may be time to seek professional help. For example, if your
sleep is still troubling you, ask your doctor about a sleep study and be
sure any medications you take are not interfering. If chronic stress is
an issue or you think you might meet the definition for depression, seek
a qualified psychiatrist or therapist, or both.</p>
<p>Your environment is more influential to your habit making and habit
keeping than anything else, genes included, so pay particular attention
to it. In 2019, two promising clinical drugs trials that were in phase 3
for treating Alzheimer’s disease were abruptly halted when they were not
shown to benefit patients any better than placebo. The drug was supposed
to remove damaging beta-amyloid plaques. It was a blow to hopes, yet it
once again underscored the complexity of the disease and the fact that
we may not be able to rely on a miracle cure through drugs to save us.
What will save many of our brains from disease, however, is a focus on
prevention and the various things we can control within our environment
to foster superior brain health. Take a look around you and where you
spend the most time. Is it conducive to living a healthy life?</p>
<p>WEEK 11</p>
<p>During this week, think about how you’d want your family members to
deal with a diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. This
is a sensitive subject and not something any of us wants to consider.
But it’s important to have these conversations in advance so we’re
prepared. As Maria Shriver reminded me, a disease like Alzheimer’s is an
emotional, financial, and physical journey. Talk to your kids. Write
down your wishes, and be as explicit as possible for the what-ifs. I’ll
be giving you more ideas in part 3 for addressing this area and knowing
what your options could be.</p>
<p>WEEK 12</p>
<p>Congratulations. You are in the final week. Make a list of all the
things you’ve done differently these past several weeks and ask
yourself: What worked? What didn’t work? Where can I improve? Then use
this week to plan ahead. Take a brisk walk with a friend and discuss
what is bothering you.</p>
<p>Create nonnegotiables that you will commit to regularly, such as
engaging in physical exercise every day, being in bed the same time
every night, and eating according to the S.H.A.R.P. plan. Consider apps
that help you track how many steps you take a day and how well you
sleep. These tools are not for everyone, but you might find a few
programs that ultimately help you maintain a brain-healthy lifestyle.
Remember to be flexible but consistent. When you momentarily stray from
the program, don’t be judgmental and simply get back on. Find goals that
can be huge motivators, and write them down. It can be anything from
walking or running your town’s 10K to planning an ecotour trip with your
family. People who decide to focus on their health often do so for
specific reasons, such as, “I want to be more productive and have more
energy,” “I want to live longer without illness,” and “I don’t want to
die in the way my mother did.” Keep the big picture in mind at all
times. This will help you not only maintain a healthy lifestyle but also
get back on track if you occasionally cheat. It’s cliché, but it’s true:
Progress is better than perfection.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-the-diagnosis">PART 3 THE DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>WHAT TO DO, HOW TO THRIVE</p>
<p>An Alzheimer’s diagnosis stirs more fear than any other major
life-threatening disease, including cancer and stroke, according to a
survey by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. Each of us at some
point will know someone who is living with a form of dementia, be it a
family member, friend, or oneself, and the diagnosis will likely be the
most devastating that person has ever received. At the time someone
hears the news, the awful statistics around Alzheimer’s really start to
set in. There is no cure, and no new drugs to treat symptoms of dementia
have been approved for fifteen years, as 99.6 percent of drug trials
terminate in failure and well over four hundred dead ends have cost
billions of dollars. (The FDA continues to review experimental drugs,
and one could have been approved by the time you read this.)</p>
<p>We’ve known about Alzheimer’s for more than a century and cannot
treat it easily, let alone cure it. It’s a difficult, complex disease
that remains a killer. Dementia also takes a devastating emotional,
financial, and physical toll on the families of those who are diagnosed
with it. In 2016, nearly 16 million family members and friends provided
more than 18 billion hours of unpaid caregiving assistance to those with
Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia.</p>
<p>That’s all bad news, no question, but while writing this book, many
people reminded me of the signs of hope that are starting to emerge.
Remember, every form of cancer was incurable forty years ago, but now
people are surviving. In 1981, HIV came on to the scene and even that’s
now survivable—some would say close to curable. Researchers strongly
believe that we will see not only new treatments for dementia in the
near future but also novel diagnostic approaches to detect problems
early and intervene much sooner for better outcomes. They believe there
may be some sea changes coming that will improve both the length and
quality of life for those living with dementia. Dementia doesn’t have to
be a conversation ender; the old notion of “diagnose and adios” needs to
be reframed. Life doesn’t end for people with dementia. Much to the
contrary, many people can find renewed purpose and a zest for life after
the diagnosis, though most do have to go through a grieving period as
they accept their diagnosis and plan for their future. That future can
feel like the great unknown that involves a lot of uncertainty.
Everyone’s journey is different, but everyone can personalize it to
match their unique needs and resources.</p>
<p>In this final part of the book, I turn to the challenges with
diagnosing and treating brain disease, particularly forms of dementia. I
also offer solutions to leveraging what we do know to best manage these
difficult diagnoses and continue to live a fulfilling life. Dementia
does not have to be a death sentence or feel like one for either the
patient or the caregivers. My hope is to leave you hopeful. Only ten
years from now, the first millennials will be turning forty-nine,
Gen-Xers will begin turning sixty-five, and the first boomers will be
turning eighty-four—an age at which dementia is most prevalent. The time
has come to end this disease.</p>
