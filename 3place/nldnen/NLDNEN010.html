<h4 id="chapter-6-the-need-for-sleep-and-relaxation">CHAPTER 6 The Need
for Sleep and Relaxation</h4>
<p>Even a soul submerged in sleep is hard at work and helps make
something of the world.</p>
<p>HERACLITUS</p>
<p>How well did you sleep last night? Do you remember dreaming? Did you
sleep solidly without waking? Do you rely on an alarm to wake you up? If
you can’t call yourself a good sleeper, you’re not alone. Fully
two-thirds of us who live in the modern, developed world are chronically
sleep deprived. That’s tens of millions of us. As I mentioned in part 1,
I sorely underestimated the value of sleep for far too long and wish I
could gain back all those hours—years, probably—that I lost. Now I rank
sleep close to the top of my list in terms of priorities.</p>
<p>The subject of sleep has produced lots of bad information. People who
tell you they can get by on four hours of sleep do not know what they
are talking about.I And if they do get only that much sleep, they are
living with a much higher risk for all sorts of health challenges.1
Chronic inadequate sleep puts people at higher risk for dementia,
depression and mood disorders, learning and memory problems, heart
disease, high blood pressure, weight gain and obesity, diabetes,
fall-related injuries, and cancer. It can even trigger biases in
behavior, causing you to focus on negative information when making
decisions. Lack of sleep is not a badge of honor or sign of integrity.
If you think rising at 4:00 a.m. after going to bed at midnight will
make you more successful, think again. There is no data that shows
successful people get less sleep, despite the trend among celebrities
and entrepreneurs to extol the virtues of their super-early mornings.
You cannot game your body clock. Once you learn how important sleep is
in your life, my hope is that you begin to prioritize it. We all need
seven to eight hours nightly, and yet on average, Americans sleep less
than seven hours a night—about two fewer hours than they did a century
ago. Dr. Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at
the University of California, Berkeley, is among today’s pioneering
researchers in the power of sleep.2 He used to say that sleep is the
third pillar of good health, alongside diet and exercise. But given his
latest finding about how sleep supports the brain and nervous system, he
now teaches that sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to
reset our brains and bodies, as well as increase a healthy life span.
How could something we spend about twenty-five years of our lives doing
be useless?</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, sleep is not a state of neural idleness.
It is a critical phase during which the body replenishes itself in a
variety of ways that ultimately affect every system, from the brain to
the heart, the immune system, and all the inner workings of our
metabolism. It is normal for sleep to change with age, but poor-quality
sleep with age is not normal. While sleep disorders such as sleep apnea
and early waking become more common with age, they often can be treated
with simple lifestyle changes to improve sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea, which affects millions of people, is caused by a
collapse of the airway during sleep; muscles in the back of the throat
fail to keep the airway open. This results in frequent cessation of
breathing, which causes sleep to be fragmented. Dreamless sleep and loud
snoring are telltale signs of the condition. Sleep apnea can be treated,
usually with the help of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
device worn during sleep. Because extra weight can also exacerbate sleep
apnea, people who are overweight and lose weight often find relief and
may no longer need a CPAP device.</p>
<p>MYTH: The body shuts down during sleep. Losing a little sleep is not
a big deal, and even when you do, you can catch up over the weekend.</p>
<p>TRUTH: Sleep is anything but a waste of time. It’s when the body
heals tissues, strengthens memory, and even grows. Losing sleep will
have both short- and long-term consequences on your health, and you
cannot necessarily catch up on sleep later on by sleeping in over the
weekend or taking a long, sleepy vacation.</p>
<p>SLEEP MEDICINE</p>
<p>The subject of sleep and the reason for its existence remained a
mystery until the previous few decades. Sleep medicine was unheard of a
few generations ago, but today it’s a highly respected field of study
that continues to clue us into the power of sleep in the support of
health and mental wellness. If sleep were not important, so many
creatures wouldn’t do it; even the simplest creatures, including flies
and worms, need to sleep. But we mammals appear to be particularly
dependent on it. Rats that are forced to stay awake die in about a
month, sometimes within days.</p>
<p>The quality and amount of sleep you get has an astonishing impact on
you. Your body does not momentarily press the pause button during sleep.
It’s more like a reset button because sleep is a necessary phase of
regeneration. Billions of molecular tasks go on during sleep at the
cellular level to ensure that you can live another day. Sufficient sleep
keeps you sharp, creative, attentive, and able to process information
quickly. Studies have convincingly proven that sleep habits ultimately
rule everything about you—how big your appetite is, how fast your
metabolism runs, how strong your immune system is, how insightful you
can be, how well you cope with stress, how adept you are at learning,
and how well you can consolidate experiences in your brain and remember
things. Banking six or fewer hours for a single night reduces daytime
alertness by about a third and can even impair your ability to operate a
car or other machinery.</p>
<p>Several years ago I met with Dr. William Dement at Stanford
University’s Sleep Research Center, which is part of the medical school
there. He is fondly known as the father of sleep science. He began
studying sleep in the 1950s when few people realized how much there was
to discover. He quickly learned that sleep is complicated, with a lot of
unknowns. In summer 1970, he opened the first sleep disorders clinic and
sleep laboratory in the world to study sleep and treat the number one
problem for his patients: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This occurs
when tissues in the back of the throat collapse, blocking the airway.
It’s caused by excess weight, large tonsils, or just the structure of
one’s throat. For ten seconds to a minute or more, a person with sleep
apnea stops breathing, which lowers blood-oxygen levels and strains the
heart. These micro-awakenings can go on hundreds of times a night,
fragmenting sleep and preventing a person from experiencing all cycles
of sleep that include the most restorative one: deep sleep. OSA is
incredibly common today, affecting approximately 20 percent of U.S.
adults. But of these people, as many as nine in ten are undiagnosed,
according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.3 It’s more
prevalent in people over the age of fifty and in men (affecting 24
percent of men compared to 9 percent of women). The condition can
increase the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and
cancer. It also increases the risk of car accidents and lowers quality
of life in general largely due to daytime exhaustion and lack of energy.
Treatments are available, but the key, of course, is to get
diagnosed.</p>
<p>Dr. Dement has since studied all aspects of sleep, from the
importance of adequate slumber to the dangers of sleep deprivation. His
accomplishments have paved the way for modern sleep research that can
dig into what’s really going on inside the brain when we close our eyes
and let go. For example, one aspect to sleep that is underappreciated
and uniquely influential to our sense of well-being is its control of
our hormonal cycles. Each one of us, men and women, has a circadian
rhythm that includes our sleep-wake cycle, the rise and fall of
hormones, and the fluctuations of body temperature that all correlates
with the solar day. It repeats roughly every twenty-four hours, but if
your rhythm is not synchronized properly with the solar day, you don’t
feel 100 percent. If you’ve traveled across time zones and experienced
jet lag, then you know—often painfully—what it means to have a disrupted
circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Your circadian rhythm revolves around your sleep habits. A healthy
rhythm directs normal hormonal secretion patterns, from those associated
with hunger cues to those that relate to stress and cellular recovery.
Our chief appetite hormones, leptin and ghrelin, for example,
orchestrate the stop and go of our eating patterns. Ghrelin tells us we
need to eat, and leptin says we’ve had enough. Ever wonder why you
suddenly feel hungry right before you go to bed? It makes no sense
biologically because you are about to sleep. That is likely a circadian
rhythm that is out of sync. The science that has made these digestive
hormones so popular lately is breathtaking: we have data now to
demonstrate that inadequate sleep creates an imbalance of both hormones,
which adversely affects hunger and appetite. In one well-cited study,
people who slept just four hours a night for two consecutive nights
experienced a 24 percent increase in hunger and gravitated toward
high-calorie treats, salty snacks, and starchy foods.4 This is probably
due to the body’s search for a quick energy fix in the form of carbs,
which are all too easy to find in processed, refined foods. And we all
know what increased intake of refined carbs can lead to: weight gain.
That excess weight will then haunt your metabolism and raise the risk of
brain decline.</p>
<p>Entire books have been written on the value of sleep, but here I’m
going to outline specifically the importance of sleep on brain health
and function.</p>
<p>MYTH: The older you get, the less sleep you need.</p>
<p>FACT: Although our sleep patterns change as we age—we tend to have a
harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep than when we
were younger—our sleep needs remain constant throughout adulthood.</p>
<p>A WELL-RESTED BRAIN IS A HEALTHY BRAIN</p>
<p>Early explorations on sleep initially looked into its impact on
memory. In the early twentieth century, Cornell University psychologists
John G. Jenkins and Karl M. Dallenbach were among the first scientists
to experiment and write about the role of sleep in improving memory.
Back then, we didn’t really know if sleep had anything to do with
memory, but these prescient researchers set out to test and quantify
sleep’s relationship with how we remember. Recruiting unsuspecting
students for their experiment, they gave the students lists of nonsense
syllables to memorize either in the morning or just before going to bed.
I say “unsuspecting” because the students had no idea what goals and
questions were driving the experiment. They were tested for their memory
of the lists one, two, four, or eight hours later. When the students
learned the lists at night, the time between learning and then having to
recall the syllables was spent in sleep; in the other case, the people
were awake during the intervening period. Who do you think fared better
in the recall of syllables? Answer: the group that slept between the
tests. It may be better described as having a slower rate of forgetting.
This study has been repeated through the years in many different ways.
Jenkins and Dallenbach’s seminal 1924 paper in the American Journal of
Psychology set the stage for future research that continues to this day.
(Interesting tidbit: The term oblivescence is used to describe the
process of forgetting, in this case during sleep; “oblivisi” means
“forget.”)5</p>
<p>Scientists have proposed several pathways for how sleep deprivation
seems to induce a nearly universal “brain fog” that makes it hard for us
to concentrate or remember important facts. One of the most recent
theories about memory and sleep suggests that sleep helps us triage
important memories to ensure we encode the most significant events in
our brains. Sleep is essential for consolidating our memories and filing
them away for later recall. Research is showing that brief bursts of
brain activity during deep sleep, called sleep spindles, effectively
move recent memories, including what we learned that day, from the
short-term space of the hippocampus to the “hard drive” of our
neocortex.6 Sleep, in other words, cleans up the hippocampus so it can
take in new information that it then processes. Without sleep, this
memory organization cannot happen. More than just affecting memory, a
sleep deficit prevents you from processing information in general. So
not only do you lack the ability to remember, you cannot even interpret
information—to bring it in and think about it.</p>
<p>Could sleep loss be setting us up for irreversible memory issues?
That’s a good question, one that science is finally addressing. An
alarming 2013 study found that older adults who experience fragmented
sleep are more prone to develop Alzheimer’s disease.7 Their rate of
cognitive decline was also higher than that of people who routinely got
a good night’s sleep. Although we’ve known that chronic bad sleep is
commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases like dementia,
recent data show us that this problem can occur years before a person is
even diagnosed. In other words, sleep problems could be an early warning
sign. And getting enough sleep now can improve your chances of fending
off dementia in the future.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation causes a number of other problems, all of them
related. A 2017 paper published by the American Heart Association showed
that in people who had suffered a sudden reduction or blockage of blood
flow to the heart (usually due to a blood clot in the heart’s arteries
or a plaque rupture), fewer than six hours of sleep was associated with
a 29 percent higher risk of having another major coronary event.8
Another 2017 study, this one of eighteen thousand adults, revealed that
logging fewer than six hours of sleep a night was associated with a 44
percent increased risk for those with prediabetes going on to develop
full-blown diabetes; getting less than five hours a night increased the
risk by 68 percent.9</p>
<p>This is key information because of the well-documented relationship
between diabetes and brain health. You’ll recall from part 1 that people
with type 2 diabetes can have a much higher rate of cognitive decline
than those who do not have the condition (and who can maintain normal
blood sugar levels). As I also mentioned, this has led some scientists
to refer to Alzheimer’s as a type of diabetes. When the body’s insulin
system is broken and neurons in particular cannot use insulin properly
to fuel their metabolism, the stage is set for decline.</p>
<p>Finally, chronic inflammation also plays a role. We still have a lot
to learn about the specifics of the relationship between sleep and
inflammation, but a strong body of evidence already shows that lack of
sleep raises levels of inflammation. This has been shown with acute
sleep deprivation, as in not getting any sleep for a full
twenty-four-hour period, and partial sleep deprivation—recurring
insufficient sleep that many of us experience in our nightly lives. A
single night of inadequate sleep is enough to activate inflammatory
processes in the body, especially in women for reasons we don’t know
yet.10</p>
<p>While it may be natural to write off one bad night’s sleep as not a
big deal, rarely is it ever just one bad night, and those periodic
episodes of inflammation then add up to cause real harm. One of the most
seminal longitudinal studies documenting the relationship between
systemic inflammation and neurodegeneration was published by a large
group of researchers across multiple institutions in 2017, including
Johns Hopkins University, Baylor University, the University of
Minnesota, and the Mayo Clinic.11 It was based on the ongoing
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, which began in 1987,
to study risk factors for atherosclerosis by following people in four
communities through the years and involving more than 15,000
individuals. The 2017 study measured biological markers of inflammation
in a group of 1,633 individuals whose average age was fifty-three at the
start of the study. Researchers followed the participants for
twenty-four years, assessing their memory and brain volumes as the years
progressed. Those who originally had the highest level of inflammation
in their body had an increased risk for brain shrinkage. In fact, their
memory centers were 5 percent smaller in comparison to those who had
lower markers of inflammation at the start. Although 5 percent may not
sound like a large number, don’t think of this as a linear phenomenon.
Even a small percentage dip affects the ability to think and remember.
In the people whose brains had shrunk, their ability to recall words was
shown to be much weaker than those whose retained brain volume. These
findings speak volumes and provide a cogent message for younger people
who can’t visualize how their habits could be affecting their long-term
ability to preserve their brains. Every night of sleep counts.</p>
<p>MYTH: There’s nothing wrong with taking sleep aids. They help you to
fall asleep faster so you get more overall sleep.</p>
<p>TRUTH: Virtually all sleep aids, whether they are prescription or
over-the-counter (OTC), will help you fall asleep faster, but they do
not allow you to experience sleep as restful as natural sleep. Some even
increase the risk for brain decline and dementia. Benzodiazepines (e.g.,
Valium, Xanax), which are often prescribed for insomnia or anxiety, are
habit forming and have been associated with developing dementia. Other
sedatives, such as Ambien and Lunesta, have been shown in clinical
studies to impair thinking and balance. And common OTC drugs like
anticholinergics (e.g., Benadryl, Nyquil, “PM” formulas) have been
linked to a higher chance of developing Alzheimer’s. These medications
have the chemical property of blocking the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine, which is essential for processing memory and learning and
is decreased in both concentration and function in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, the Alzheimer’s drug donepezil (Aricept)
is a cholinesterase inhibitor, meaning it inhibits the enzyme that
breaks down acetylcholine.</p>
<p>THE RINSE CYCLE</p>
<p>Among the more recent and captivating findings about sleep has been
discovering its “washing” effects on the brain. The body clears waste
and fluid from tissues through the lymphatic system. Lymph is the
colorless fluid in specialized vessels that carries toxic waste and
cellular debris. These compounds are filtered as they pass through lymph
nodes. The lymph itself then goes back into the bloodstream. Scientists
long thought that the brain didn’t have a lymphatic system and instead
relied on waste slowly diffusing from brain tissue into the
cerebrospinal fluid. But then a paper landed that rewrote the scientific
narrative.</p>
<p>In 2012, Dr. Jeffrey J. Iliff and his team at Oregon Health Sciences
University published a description of the brain’s self-cleaning function
to get rid of waste.12 Their research ignited a new field of exploration
into the drainage pathway that is now referred to as the glymphatic
system. One year later, another paper by Dr. Iliff and two colleagues,
Dr. Lulu Xie and Dr. Maiken Nedergaard from the Department of
Neurosurgery at the University of Rochester, documented that the
glymphatic system goes into overdrive at night, suggesting that sleep
provides the setting for a cleansing or wash of sorts.13 And failure to
remove this brain trash may be linked to a higher risk of developing
dementia. Just as one night of sleep deprivation can spike levels of
inflammation, so can one night of bad sleep be associated with the
accumulation of beta-amyloid, the brain protein that has been associated
with Alzheimer’s disease.14 Moreover, there’s data that now points to a
relationship between higher levels of brain amyloid and incidence of
depression, and this is particularly the case for those with major
depressive disorder who are not responding to any treatment.15 The
University of Rochester team showed that cerebrospinal fluid flow
through the brain shot up in mice only when they were sleeping.16 This
fluid, found in the brain and spinal cord, bathes and protects the
central nervous system and eliminates waste products. The Rochester team
hypothesized that this flow might function like the lymphatic system in
the body, draining tissues of cellular breakdown products and waste for
eventual disposal. Much in the way sleep tidies up our memory hub, the
hippocampus, it also scrubs the brain of metabolic refuse. Sleep
performs double-duty: decluttering and taking the garbage out.</p>
<p>Since these seminal studies, others have shown that indeed, the brain
has a “clean cycle” system for washing away metabolic debris and junk,
including sticky proteins that can contribute to those amyloid plaques.
Dr. David Holtzman is a neurologist at Washington University’s School of
Medicine in St. Louis. In one of his landmark experiments, he disrupted
some of the mice’s sleep right when their brains would normally begin to
clear beta-amyloid.17 These sleep-deprived animals went on to develop
more than two times as many amyloid plaques over about a month, compared
to their well-rested counterparts. His team has also demonstrated that
the difference in deeply sleeping versus wide-awake mice’s levels of
amyloid in the brain is about 25 percent. Over time those proteins can
gather to form amyloid plaques. Think of amyloid plaques like litter in
the gutter; it eventually sparks inflammation and the buildup of those
tau proteins, which may destroy neurons and start the march toward
Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>A vicious cycle can set in between the brain’s ability to cleanse
itself as it ages and the body’s ability to sleep. A 2014 paper that
examined how the glymphatic system works showed that the drainage rate
was 40 percent worse in older mice versus young ones.18 While we
certainly cannot change some of the natural effects of aging, this
information is important because sleep disturbances are common in the
elderly and too often ignored or overlooked. The first goal is to figure
out what might be causing the problem. Is it a medical issue such as
sleep apnea or arthritis? A side effect of medications? Maybe it is a
shift in the circadian rhythm that has the older person feeling sleepier
earlier in the evening than when she was younger, and so she goes to bed
earlier but may not sleep through the night.</p>
<p>Dr. Kristine Yaffe is a professor of psychiatry, neurology, and
epidemiology at the University of California San Francisco, where she is
director of the Center for Population Brain Health. She is
world-renowned for her studies on cognitive aging and dementia and a
governance member of the Global Council on Brain Health. At her memory
disorders clinic, she hears a common complaint: difficulty falling
asleep and staying asleep. People feel fatigued throughout the day and
are compelled to nap. When Yaffe led a series of studies looking at more
than thirteen hundred adults older than seventy-five over a five-year
period, she documented that those with disrupted sleep had more than
double the risk of developing dementia years later.19 Most of these
people had conditions that adversely impacted their sleep, such as
sleep-disordered breathing, sleep apnea, breaks in their natural
circadian rhythm, or chronic awakenings at night.</p>
<p>The other issue is the fact that Alzheimer’s itself disrupts sleep.
You can likely see the dangerous cycle here that can set in: Bad sleep
prevents the brain from cleansing itself of debris, leading to extra
amyloid hanging around to trigger Alzheimer’s disease. The disease then
sends the brain down the road to a graveyard of neurons and worsening
sleep. Meanwhile, the sleep deprivation disrupts the circadian rhythm,
affecting both the body’s metabolism and levels of the hormone
melatonin, which helps the body to sleep. This disruption in metabolism
and important sleep-related hormones exacerbates the sleep disturbance,
and the cycle continues. Unless this cycle is broken, the damage
worsens.</p>
<p>What all of these studies are clearly beginning to show is the
probability of a bidirectional relationship between sleep and the risk
of cognitive decline. Dementia doesn’t just make it hard to sleep; poor
sleep may drive the development of brain decline too. More research is
needed, especially among humans, but the lesson should be obvious: sleep
is medicine. We need it to function during the day and refresh during
the night. So with that in mind, let’s turn to some strategies for a
better night’s sleep.</p>
<p>THE TOP TEN SECRETS TO SLUMBER</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Stick to a schedule and avoid long naps. Get up at the same time
every day, weekends and holidays included. Although many people try to
shift their sleep habits on weekends to make up their sleep deficiency
accumulated during the week, this can quickly sabotage a healthy
circadian rhythm. If you stay up later on Friday and Saturday nights to
socialize and then sleep in the next morning, you will suffer from
what’s called “social jet lag”; irregular sleep patterns like this are
detrimental to health. The evidence on whether naps are beneficial to
brain health in older adults is still unclear. If you must, limit
napping to thirty minutes in the early afternoon. Longer naps later in
the day can disrupt nighttime sleep. In 2019, it was reported in the
journal Alzheimer’s andandandand Dementia that napping can be an early
warning sign of Alzheimer’s disease.20 Of course, napping does not cause
Alzheimer’s; nevertheless, dozing off during the day could indicate that
certain networks of the brain that are supposed to keep you awake are
damaged. In particular, the brain areas promoting wakefulness degenerate
due to the accumulation of tau, and this can happen silently early on.
This may also explain why people with the disease have a tendency to nap
excessively before more classic signs of the memory-robbing illness
emerge, such as forgetfulness and confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be a night owl. The best bedtime is when you feel most
sleepy before midnight. Non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep tends to
dominate sleep cycles in the early part of the night. As night moves
closer to dawn, dream-rich REM sleep begins to take over. Although both
types of sleep are important and offer separate benefits, non-REM,
slow-wave sleep is deeper and more restorative than REM sleep. Note that
your ideal bedtime will likely change as you age. The older you get, the
earlier your bedtime will become and the earlier you will naturally wake
up, but your overall sleeping hours should not change.</p></li>
<li><p>Wake up to early morning light. Expose your eyes to sunlight
first thing in the morning to help set your body clock. Everything about
our evolutionary biology and neuroscience screams about the importance
of mornings. We are wired to get up early and absorb the rising
sun.</p></li>
<li><p>Get moving. Regular physical activity promotes good sleep; it can
also help you achieve and maintain an ideal weight, which also can
improve sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch what you eat and drink. Avoid caffeine after lunch
(definitely not after 2:00 p.m.), and don’t eat or drink for three hours
before bed to keep from waking up to use the bathroom. Heavy meals at
dinner can also be disruptive if you consume them too close to bedtime.
Be mindful of alcohol intake too. While alcohol can make you feel
sleepy, its effects on the body disturb normal sleep cycles and they
particularly disrupt the restorative slow-wave sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Mind your medicines. Pharmaceuticals, whether over-the-counter or
prescribed, can contain ingredients that affect sleep. For example, many
headache remedies contain caffeine. Some cold remedies can have
stimulating decongestants (such as pseudoephedrine). Side effects in
many commonly used drugs, such as antidepressants, steroids,
beta-blockers, and medicines for Parkinson’s, can all affect sleep too.
Be aware of what you are taking, and if they are necessary medicines,
see if you can take them earlier in the day when they will have the
least impact on sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool, quiet, and dark. The ideal temperature for sleeping is
between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Sleep in the dark, and minimize
light sources nearby, including that from an electronic device (see tip
8). Consider a sleep mask if it is not possible to black out your
environment. Try a sound machine or white noise generator to block out
noises from the street if you live in an urban environment. And keep
pets out of the bedroom. Bar them especially if they disrupt your sleep
by moving around or making noise during the night.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate electronics. Keep the bedroom for sleeping, not looking
at any type of screen, your phone included. Nearly all light—whether
natural sunlight in origin or artificial from lightbulbs, TV screens,
computers, and smartphones—contains blue wavelengths that are a potent
suppressor of melatonin, the hormone needed for sleep, and stimulate the
alert centers in the brain—a double whammy for sleep. In 2015,
neuroscientist Anne-Marie Chang and colleagues showed that
light-emitting devices such as e-readers caused people to take longer to
fall asleep because of reduced sensations of sleepiness, decreased
secretion of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, and a later circadian
schedule, and they were less alert the next morning than people who read
paper books.21 The problem is that light-emitting diodes (LEDs) produce
quite a bit of blue wavelengths, and these are ubiquitous in
televisions, smartphones, tablets, and computers. Avoid blue light for a
few hours before bedtime for optimum melatonin production. Use warm
wavelengths in your home LED lighting (2700–3000K is good). If you have
persistent problems falling asleep, it might be easier to get eyeglasses
that filter out blue light. Make sure that your clocks, nightlights,
dimmers, and so on use red, or “warm glow,” lights rather than blue or
green. Red light has the least power to shift circadian rhythm and
suppress melatonin. Get an app that changes the color temperature of
your screen to avoid blue light, particularly if you like to read in
bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish bedtime rituals. Try to set aside at least thirty
minutes to an hour before bedtime to unwind and perform tasks that help
your body know that bedtime is coming soon. Disconnect from stimulating
tasks (such as working, being on the computer, or using a cell phone)
and engage in activities that are calming, such as taking a warm bath,
reading, drinking herbal tea, or listening to soothing music. Stretch or
do something relaxing. Wearing socks to keep your feet warm can also
help you fall asleep more easily. Stay away from difficult
conversations, and keep everything peaceful before bedtime. No arguing
or discussing touchy, contentious topics either (issues always seem
better in the morning anyhow).</p></li>
<li><p>Know the warning signs. You may have a bona fide sleep disorder
that could benefit from treatment if you have several of the following
symptoms: trouble falling or staying asleep three times a week for at
least three months; frequent snoring; persistent daytime sleepiness; leg
discomfort before sleep; acting out your dreams during sleep; and
grinding your teeth or waking with a headache or aching jaws.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have tried all of these approaches and still fail to get a
good night’s sleep or find yourself relying on sleep aids regularly,
talk to your doctor about your sleep. He or she might recommend that you
undergo a sleep study to rule out issues such as undiagnosed sleep
apnea. This will require that you spend the night in a sleep lab that
can monitor and record your sleep. These centers are not as unusual as
you might think. Many hospitals large and small offer these
services.</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET DAYTIME RandandandandR</p>
<p>Sleep is a rejuvenating activity that the body demands, but there is
a difference between sleep and rest. We need both and must include other
activities of rest and relaxation into our waking lives in order to stay
sharp. Our mental well-being in general depends on this too—and we know
that greater mental well-being is associated with reduced dementia
risks. We also know the opposite is true: Conditions like certain types
of anxiety and depression can be warning signs for cognitive decline and
Alzheimer’s disease. So combating these by reducing stress and building
mental resilience is important.</p>
<p>I’m a big proponent of meditation. I practice it every day using a
type known as analytical meditation. I picked up the habit after
spending time with the Dalai Lama a few years ago at the Drepung
Monastery in Mundgod, India. I’ll admit that at first, I wasn’t sold on
the idea. I was terrified! Just thinking about meditating with His
Holiness was making me anxious. But who says no to a chance to meditate
with the Dalai Lama? I agreed to join him early one morning at his
private residence.22</p>
<p>All my meditation insecurities immediately started to kick in once I
was sitting with him cross-legged and trying to focus on my breathing
with my eyes closed. After a few minutes, I heard his deep, distinctive
baritone voice: “Any questions?”</p>
<p>I looked up and saw his smiling face, starting to break into his
characteristic head-bobbing laugh.</p>
<p>“This is hard for me,” I said.</p>
<p>“Me too!” he exclaimed. “After doing daily for sixty years, it is
still hard.”</p>
<p>It was at once surprising and reassuring to hear him say this. The
Dalai Lama, Buddhist monk and spiritual leader of Tibet, can also have
trouble meditating.</p>
<p>“I think you will like a type of analytical meditation,” he told me.
Instead of focusing on a chosen object, as in single-point meditation,
he suggested I think about a problem I was trying to solve, a topic I
may have read about recently, or one of the philosophical areas from our
previous discussions. He wanted me to separate the problem or issue from
everything else by placing it in a large, clear bubble. With my eyes
closed, I thought of something nagging at me—something I couldn’t quite
solve. As I placed the physical embodiment of this problem into the
bubble, several things started to happen very naturally.</p>
<p>The problem was now directly in front of me, floating weightlessly.
In my mind, I could rotate it, spin it, or flip it upside down. It was
an exercise to develop hyperfocus. As the bubble was rising, it was also
disentangling itself from other attachments, such as subjective
emotional considerations. I could visualize it as the problem isolated
itself and came into a clear view.</p>
<p>Too often, we allow unrelated emotional factors to blur the elegant
and practical solutions right in front of us. It can be dispiriting and
frustrating. Through analytical meditation, His Holiness told me, we can
use logic and reason to more clearly identify the question at hand,
separate it from irrelevant considerations, erase doubt, and brightly
illuminate the answers. It was simple and sensible. Most important for
me is that it worked.</p>
<p>As a neuroscientist, I never expected that a Buddhist monk, even the
Dalai Lama, would teach me how to better incorporate deduction and
critical thinking in my life, but that is what happened. It changed me,
and I am better for it. I practice analytical meditation every day. The
first two minutes, as I create my thought bubble and let it float above
me, are still the hardest. After that, I reach what can best be
described as that quintessential flow state, in which twenty to thirty
minutes pass easily. I am more convinced than ever that even the most
ardent skeptics could find success with analytical meditation.</p>
<p>Over the holidays, I spent as much time as possible relaying the
Dalai Lama’s teachings to my family and friends and teaching them basic
principles of analytical meditation. This was the gift I most wanted to
share with them—and now with you. It is an ingredient to get crucial
rest in your day, one that is different than sleep.</p>
<p>Practices in mindfulness are on the rise. In 2018 the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention released a report stating that between
2012 and 2017, participation in yoga increased 50 percent, from 9.5 to
14.3 percent, and the use of meditation more than tripled from 4.1 to
14.2 percent.23 These practices share a common theme: being present in
the moment and observing what’s happening in your life. We often hear
anecdotally that mindfulness activities can combat stress, but it’s
important to know that this idea has been well substantiated in the
medical literature. These habits are even making their way into places
where you’d least expect them: military combat zones. In 2014, for
instance, a group of Marines received training in mindfulness-based
techniques and were subsequently found to have enhanced cardiovascular
and pulmonary recovery after exposure to high-stress simulations of
military activity.24</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a soldier to benefit from this training. One
effect that is easily generalized to all of us is that mindfulness
practices also appear to lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. In
one of the most comprehensive and well-cited studies in this area, a
meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association reviewed all relevant trials on the subject, finding that
mindfulness significantly reduces anxiety, depression, and pain.25
Another meta-analysis looked at the effect of transcendental meditation,
a type of mindful practice that involves the use of a mantra, on 1,295
people across sixteen studies.26 It too found that the practice led to
significant diminishment in anxiety, which became even more pronounced
in those starting off with high levels of it.</p>
<p>Meditation has a long and storied history that has only recently
gained scientific validity. Researchers are finally beginning to
understand how it can affect the aging process itself. It started in
2005 when Harvard’s Massachusetts General Hospital published an imaging
study showing that particular areas of the cerebral cortex, including
the prefrontal area, were thicker in people who frequently meditated.27
Since then, numerous follow-up studies by the same group and others
around the world have documented that “thick-brained” people tend to be
smarter and have stronger memories. These cortical areas help with
attention and sensory processing and are used for planning complicated
cognitive actions.</p>
<p>The so-called relaxation response that’s achieved through meditation
can also happen through various forms of yoga, tai chi, breathing
exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and even
repetitive prayer. One of the reasons that deep breathing, for instance,
is so effective is that it triggers a parasympathetic nerve response, as
opposed to a sympathetic nerve response, the latter of which is
sensitive to stress and anxiety. When you perceive stress, the
sympathetic nervous system springs into action, resulting in surges of
the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline. The parasympathetic nervous
system instead can trigger a relaxation response, and deep breathing is
one of the quickest means of getting there. In a deeply relaxed state,
your heartbeat calms down, breathing slows, and blood pressure
lowers.</p>
<p>Deep breathing can be done anywhere, anytime. If you’ve never
meditated before, a deep breathing practice twice daily will get you
started and give you a foundation for trying more advanced techniques.
All you have to do is sit comfortably in a chair or on the floor, close
your eyes, and make sure your body is relaxed—releasing all tension in
your neck, arms, legs, and back. Inhale through your nose for as long as
you can, feeling your diaphragm and abdomen rise as your stomach moves
outward. Take in a little more air when you think you’ve reached the top
of your lungs. Slowly exhale to a count of twenty, pushing every breath
of air from your lungs. Continue for at least five rounds of deep
breaths.</p>
<p>Mindfulness can be achieved in all kinds of ways, from using an app
on your phone to guide you through a fifteen-minute practice, to
participating in a restorative yoga class, to Japanese forest bathing,
or shinrin-yoku—which means just being in the presence of trees. Forest
bathing has been popular lately as a way to lower heart rate and blood
pressure and reduce stress hormone production. When you are forest
bathing and breathing in the “aroma of the forest,” you are also
absorbing substances known as phytoncides, which protect trees from
insects and other stressors. As we have learned over the past decade,
these phytoncides can also protect us by increasing our natural killer
immune cells and decreasing cortisol levels.28 While spending time in
nature or green spaces has long been recommended to improve mental
well-being, we now understand what that aroma of the forest is really
doing for our bodies and brains. You needn’t travel to a far-off forest;
you can do well by yourself just by digging in the dirt of your own
garden or visiting a local park. I have always loved the ancient Indian
concept of creating a harmonious 100-year life by spending the third
stage (around the ages fifty to seventy-five) living in a forest as part
of a contemplative, tranquil lifestyle called vanprastha (life as a
forest dweller). Some research has found that walking in nature, as
opposed to walking in urban environments, may help people manage stress,
calm rumination, and regulate emotion.29 A number of studies have found
that green spaces and parks in cities are linked to positive mental
health.30 I spend a lot of time indoors—and in windowless operating
rooms—so I cherish the times I can roam and play outside and absorb the
pleasures of nature.</p>
<p>Here are some other RandandandandR ideas to consider in the name of
mental well-being. These strategies also have the effect of helping you
build a more resilient, productive brain:</p>
<p>Become a regular volunteer in your community. Those who volunteer
tend to have less anxiety, depression, loneliness, and social isolation,
as well as a sense of purpose. The 2018 AARP survey found that adults
age fifty or older who volunteer at least once a year have higher mental
well-being scores than those who don’t volunteer at least once a year.31
Consider taking a leadership role in a group or organization of which
you are a part.</p>
<p>Express gratitude. Begin or end your day by thinking of things for
which you are grateful. Consider keeping a gratitude journal. Research
finds that gratitude reduces depression and anxiety, lowers stress, and
increases happiness and empathy.32 It is hard to be angry or distressed
when you are practicing gratitude. My active gratitude practice is a big
part of giving my brain a time-out. It acts like a big reset button on
my brain and lets the less significant issues (that are a
disproportionate brain drain) melt away. I do this myself and with my
family every day I can.</p>
<p>Practice the art of forgiveness. Positive psychology research has
found that forgiving oneself and others promotes life satisfaction and
self-esteem.33</p>
<p>Look for things that make you laugh. Explore humorous movies, books,
or online videos. Laughter triggers the secretion of “feel good”
hormones such as endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin, which can relieve
stress and reduce tension and anxiety—even lessen pain.</p>
<p>Take breaks from email and social media. Consider turning off
notifications. Put your smartphone in another room, and turn off the
sound to help you focus on a task. Consider checking social media (e.g.,
Facebook, Instagram) on a schedule and avoiding smartphones during meals
and family time. Avoid emails first thing in the morning. Mornings are
golden time. Use them to do your most creative work as opposed to
procedural.</p>
<p>Find another hour in your day at least once a week. If you want to
“create” another hour in your day, be very strict with your time spent
looking at a screen (computer, phone, TV, tablet). If you set aside one
day a week to be screen-free, I bet you’ll find at least an hour extra
of time to do whatever you like.</p>
<p>Establish a system of rewards. The brain and body like rewards;
anticipating a reward can release a little dopamine surge. The Pomodoro
technique works for this reason. It’s a proven strategy in gaining the
most out of your time by using mini-breaks at timed intervals as
rewards. And it’s easy: Simply pick a task—hopefully your most important
one of the day—and set your timer for twenty-five minutes. Work solely
on that task with no distractions until the timer rings. Then take a
five-minute break and repeat as necessary.</p>
<p>Don’t multitask—tackle your day like a surgeon. Contrary to our
attempts to manage multiple tasks at the same time, the brain doesn’t
like to do that. Surely you can walk and talk at the same time while
digesting your lunch, but the brain can’t concentrate on executing two
activities that demand conscious effort, thinking, comprehension, or
skill. Would you want me operating on your brain while I write an email
and take a phone call? The brain handles tasks sequentially but can
switch attention between tasks so quickly that we’re given the illusion
that we can perform multiple tasks together. So if you want to get more
done using less effort, aim to work on what’s called your attentional
ability: focus and concentrate on one sequence—one task—at a time and
avoid distractions. This can be a surprisingly joyous experience—one
that I experience whenever I am in the operating room. The OR is one of
the few places where distractions aren’t allowed. You are scrubbed,
unable to check your phone as you enter a fully focused state on the
task in front of you. It is like taking your turbo-powered brain on an
empty flat road and letting it rip. Most of the time, our brains are
stuck in stop-and-go traffic, working hard and getting nowhere. Let your
brain roam free every now and then. You will not only get more done than
you thought possible, but you will also achieve a level of bliss that is
tough to replicate. When you try to mentally multitask, you slow down
your thinking and everything takes longer to accomplish. The brain loves
the rhythm of sequences. It also helps with sanity!</p>
<p>Identify your marbles and sand and plan accordingly: If you have a
jar that you are filling with marbles and sand, which do you put in
first? The marbles. Then you can allow the sand to fill the spaces in
between. This is a key metaphor for planning your day and maximizing
your time. Think of the marbles as the important blocks of your day
(appointments, commitments, projects, important tasks including exercise
and sleep), and the sand is everything else (checking email, returning a
call, dealing with nonurgent things). Don’t get stuck in the sand. Tip:
Plan to set aside thirty minutes every Sunday night for your weekly
check-in and ask yourself this powerful question: “What goals do I need
to accomplish in the next seven days for me to feel this week was a
success?”</p>
<p>Declutter your life. Clean out closets, basements, storage places,
and garages. Donate old clothes and books that no longer bring you
pleasure. Toss old magazines and catalogs. Throw away or shred mail,
bills, and letters that you don’t need. Make a habit of immediately
throwing away things that don’t have relevance personally or create
value productively. Overall, manage your environment. Mess creates
stress, as disorganization equates with distraction.</p>
<p>Set aside fifteen minutes each day for yourself. Use this time to
engage in a de-stressing activity such as meditation, which can be as
simple as sitting quietly for a few minutes and focusing on taking deep,
calming breaths. There are smartphone apps and web pages for guided
meditation that can help. Or use this time to write in a journal. Avoid
anything too stimulating or distracting like scrolling through social
media or shopping online. The key is to get to really know yourself, and
most of us are not that good at self-awareness. I wasn’t taught that in
medical school, but it has since become a vital part of my personal
compass. We are all different, and the best person to help guide you is
you.</p>
<p>Let yourself daydream. The mind can’t stay in one gear all day long.
We tend to force the brain to be directing our thoughts as much as
possible, rather than let the thoughts take over and run themselves.
Daydreaming, however, can act as a neural reset button.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to seek help from a health professional if you have
concerns about your mental health. Conditions such as anxiety and
depression are common and can be treated.</p>
<p>LIFE’S TRANSITIONS</p>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we all go through phases in life
that bring different challenges. With age come transitions punctuated by
events like the birth of children, the death of loved ones, shifts in
marital status, changes in financial means, retirement, accidents,
illness, perhaps the loss of some independence such as the ability to
drive. People who can adapt to changing life circumstances and
experiences may more quickly resume close-to-normal feelings and states
of mental well-being. Prolonged sadness or bereavement is not part of
the normal response to these transitions and ups the risk for cognitive
impairment.</p>
<p>There is a surprising silver lining with age, however. Despite
feelings of loss that often occur as people age, getting older does not
necessarily mean people become less happy. On average, most people
report greater mental well-being as they age past their mid-fifties into
the later stages of life. This tendency to report high levels of
happiness and well-being around the ages of eighteen to twenty-one,
declining through young adulthood and midlife with significant increases
starting around age fifty, is often described as a U-shaped curve of
happiness over the life span.34 People tend to be happier when they are
younger and older but have a decrease in happiness during midlife. A
number of studies have also found a positivity effect of aging, meaning
that older adults tend to remember and pay attention to positive
information more than negative information.35 Why is midlife—ages
thirty-five to roughly fifty-five—such a downer? It’s typically the
period when stressors peak: You are straddling the competing demands of
aging parents and dependent children, all while working to maintain a
career and save for retirement. This U-bend of life does have its
critics, and it can be hard to generalize happiness across different
populations in their lifetime, but I bring it up because it’s often part
of the conversation.</p>
<p>It’s important that you do what you can to keep track of your mental
well-being and seek help when your stress levels reach toxic levels.
Although scientists don’t think that depression, especially at midlife,
causes dementia later in life, this area continues to be studied.
Depression is a risk factor for dementia, but we don’t know if the
relationship is cause-and-effect or just correlated somehow. We do have
evidence that people who experience depression in later life (over the
age of fifty) are more than twice as likely to develop vascular dementia
and 65 percent more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than people
who are not depressed.36 And people who do develop dementia and have a
history of depression often have an increase in new symptoms of the
problem about a decade before their dementia becomes evident.</p>
<p>In 2019, my HBO special, One Nation under Stress, aired after I’d
spent two years traveling around the country in search of understanding
why “deaths of despair” due to suicide and overdoses are on the rise.
Too many people suffer from what I call toxic stress that fuels levels
of unimaginable depression. The goal of my film was to call attention to
society’s need for better ways to cope with life’s ups and downs. Since
then, it’s been reassuring to see more attention given to mental health
issues, though it became clear to me as I traveled all over the country
that we all need to do a better job taking care of each other.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sleep and daytime stress-reducing activities can work wonders on the
brain and body, but they are not the only habits we must maintain to
keep sharp and mentally well. As you’re about to find out, there’s a
tremendous power in what we put on our plates.</p>
<p>I A very small percentage of people have what’s called a short sleep
gene, a rare mutation in a gene that reduces their need for sleep. These
individuals naturally sleep for just four to six hours and function
normally. But we don’t have long-term data on this phenomenon, and the
vast majority of people are not genetically equipped to be short
sleepers, even if they “train” themselves to wake up early.</p>
