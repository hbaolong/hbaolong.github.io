<h4 id="chapter-1-what-makes-you-you">CHAPTER 1 What Makes You You</h4>
<p>Imagine the brain, that shiny mound of being, that mouse-gray
parliament of cells, that dream factory, that petit tyrant inside a ball
of bone, that huddle of neurons calling all the plays, that little
everywhere, that fickle pleasure dome, that wrinkled wardrobe of selves
stuffed into the skull like too many clothes into a gym bag.</p>
<p>DIANE ACKERMAN (FROM AN ALCHEMY OF MIND)</p>
<p>It was 1992 when I first saw a living human brain, a powerful and
life-changing experience for me. It was, and still is, hard for me to
believe that so much of what we are, who we will become, and how we
interpret the world resides in that intricately woven bundle of tissue.
When I am describing a neurosurgery procedure, most people try to
visualize what the human brain looks like, and they typically are a
little off base. For starters, it doesn’t look like a dull and bland
gray mass on the outside, despite being referred to as gray matter. It
is more pinkish with whitish yellow patches and large blood vessels
coursing on and through it. It has deep crevasses, known as sulci, and
mountainous peaks, known as gyri. Deep fissures separate the brain into
the various lobes in a surprisingly consistent way. During an operation,
the brain pulsates gently out of the skull’s borders and looks very much
alive. Consistency wise, it is not so much rubbery as squishy, more like
gelatin. It has always amazed me how fragile the brain is despite its
incredible function and versatility. Once you see the brain, you very
much want to protect it and take care of it.</p>
<p>To me, the brain has always been a bit mystical. Weighing in at a
little over three pounds, it comprises all the circuitry we need to do
just about everything. Think about that for a moment: It weighs less
than most laptop computers, yet it can perform in a way that no computer
can or will ever rival. In fact, the oft-cited metaphor of brains being
like computers fails in oh-so-many ways. We may speak in terms of the
brain’s processing speed, its storage capacity, its circuitry, and its
encodings and encryptions. But the brain doesn’t have a fixed memory
capacity that is waiting to be filled up, and it doesn’t calculate in
the manner a computer does. Even how we each see and perceive the world
is an active interpretation and result of what we pay attention to and
anticipate—not a passive receiving of inputs. It is true that our eyes
see the world upside down. The brain then takes the input and converts
it into a coherent image. In addition, the back of the eye, the retina,
provides the brain with two-dimensional images from each eye, which the
brain then converts into beautiful, textured three-dimensional images,
providing depth perception. And we all have blind spots in our vision
that our brain constantly fills in using constant data you probably
didn’t even realize you were collecting. No matter how sophisticated
artificial intelligence becomes, there will always be some things the
human brain can do that no computer can.</p>
<p>Compared to other mammals, our brain’s size relative to the rest of
our body is astonishingly large. Consider the brain of an elephant: It
takes up 1/550 of the animal’s total weight. Our brain, on the other
hand, is about 1/40 of our body weight. But the feature that most sets
us apart from all other species is our amazing ability to think in ways
that reach far beyond mere survival. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, and
birds, for instance, are assumed not to do much “thinking,” at least in
the way we conceive of it. But all animals concern themselves with the
everyday business of eating, sleeping, reproducing, and
surviving—automatic instinctual processes under the control of what’s
called the “reptilian brain.” We have our own inner primitive reptilian
brain that performs the same functions for us, and in fact it drives
much of our behavior (perhaps more than we’d like to admit). It is the
complexity and large size of our outer cerebral cortex that allows us to
perform more sophisticated tasks than, say, cats and dogs. We can more
successfully use language, acquire complex skills, create tools, and
live in social groups thanks to that bark-like layer of our brain.
Cortex means bark in Latin, and in this case, it is the outer layer of
the brain, full of folds, ridges, and valleys. Because the brain folds
back on itself over and over again, its surface area is far larger than
you might guess—a little over two square feet on average, though exact
calculations do vary (e.g., it would spread out over a page or two of a
standard newspaper).1 And probably somewhere deep in those crevasses is
likely the seat of consciousness. Heady stuff!</p>
<p>The human brain contains an estimated (give or take) 100 billion
brain cells, or neurons, and billions of nerve fibers (although nobody
knows these numbers exactly for sure—because exact calculations are
impossible as of yet).2 These neurons are linked by trillions of
connections called synapses. It is through these connections that we are
able to think abstractly, feel angry or hungry, remember, rationalize,
make decisions, be creative, form language, reminisce about the past,
plan the future, hold moral convictions, communicate our intentions,
contemplate complex stories, pass judgment, respond to nuanced social
cues, coordinate dance moves, know which way is up or down, solve
complex problems, tell a lie or a joke, walk on our tiptoes, notice a
scent in the air, breathe, sense fear or danger, engage in
passive-aggressive behavior, learn to build spaceships, sleep well at
night and dream, express and experience deeply felt emotions such as
love, analyze information and stimuli in an exceptionally sophisticated
fashion, and so on. We can do many of these tasks at the same time, too.
Perhaps you’re reading this book, drinking a beverage, digesting your
lunch, plotting when you’ll get to your cluttered garage this year,
thinking about your weekend plans (“in the back of your mind”), and
breathing, among many other things.</p>
<p>Each part of the brain serves a special, defined purpose, and these
parts link together to function in a coordinated manner. That last part
is key to our new understanding of the brain. When I was in middle
school, the brain was thought to be segmented by purpose—one area was
for abstract thought, another for coloring within the lines, yet another
for forming language. If you took high school biology, you may have
heard the story of Phineas Gage, one of the most famous survivors of a
serious brain injury. You may not know, however, just how much his
unfortunate accident illuminated for scientists the inner workings of
the brain at a time long before we had advanced techniques to measure,
test, and examine brain functions. In 1848, the twenty-five-year-old
Gage was working on the construction of a railroad in Cavendish,
Vermont. One day, as he was packing explosive powder into a hole using a
large iron rod measuring 43 inches long and 1¼ inches in diameter and
weighing 13¼ pounds, the powder detonated. The rod shot upward into his
face, penetrating Gage’s left cheek. It traveled all the way through his
head (and brain) and out the top. His left eye was blinded, but he
didn’t die and possibly didn’t even lose consciousness or experience
severe pain, telling the doctor who first attended to him, “Here is
business enough for you.” On the next page is a photo (known as a
daguerreotype in early photographic technology) taken of Gage after
recovering from the accident as he holds the offending tamping iron.
This photo was only recently discovered and identified in 2009. To the
right is a drawing made by Dr. John Harlow who treated him and recorded
this sketch in his notes that became a publication of the Massachusetts
Medical Society.3</p>
<p>Gage’s personality, however, did not survive the blow intact.
According to some accounts, he went from being a model gentleman to a
mean, violent, unreliable person. The curious case of Phineas Gage was
the first to demonstrate a link between trauma to certain regions of the
brain and personality change. It had never been that clear-cut before.
Keep in mind that in the 1800s, phrenologists still believed that
measuring the size of bumps on a person’s skull could be used to assess
personality. Twelve years after the accident, Phineas Gage died at age
thirty-six after experiencing a series of seizures. He has been written
about in the medical literature ever since, becoming one of
neuroscience’s most famous patients. There was something else Phineas
Gage taught us that is particularly important for this book. Some
accounts of his life document a return of his more amiable nature closer
to his death, which indicated the ability of the brain to heal and
rehabilitate itself, even after significant trauma. This process of
reestablishing networks and connections in areas of the brain damaged by
the injury is what’s called neuroplasticity, an important concept we’ll
be exploring. The brain is a lot less static than we thought in the
past. It’s alive, growing, learning, and changing—all throughout our
lives. This dynamism offers hope for everyone looking to keep their
mental faculties intact.</p>
<p>Photo of Phineas Gage and line drawing made by the town doctor, John
M. Harlow, who helped treat him.</p>
<p>Although documentation on Gage’s accident gave us a glimpse of the
brain’s complexity and the connection to behavior, it still took more
than another century for us to understand that the brain’s stunning
power isn’t simply due to its individual anatomical compartments. It’s
the circuitry and communication between those sections that make up our
complicated responses and behaviors. Many areas of the brain develop at
different paces and in different stages of our life. For this reason, an
adult solves problems differently and faster than a child does, an older
person might struggle with motor skills such as walking and coordination
in the dark, and the teenager might be a track-and-field star with
perfect vision.</p>
<p>When most of us think about the brain, we probably think about the
element of it that makes us, well, us. We ponder the mind—the part that
includes our consciousness and is reflected by that quintessential inner
voice or, as some would say, that monologic chatter we listen to all day
long. It is your you that bosses you around all day, raises important as
well as inane questions, beats you up emotionally on occasion, and makes
life a series of decisions. I also have been mystified that every moment
of jealousy, insecurity, and fear we have ever experienced lies within
the caverns of the brain. And somehow the brain can take in data and
create hope, joy, and pleasure.</p>
<p>The mind is what first drove me to study the brain. Oddly, however,
we still don’t really know precisely where consciousness resides in the
brain or if it is even in the brain entirely. I find this to be a
fundamentally important point. That state of being aware of oneself and
one’s surroundings—consciousness—on which everything else is predicated,
remains elusive. Sure, I can tell you where in your brain rests the
networks for processing sight, solving a math equation, knowing how to
speak a language, walking, tying your shoelaces, and planning a
vacation. But I cannot tell you exactly where your self-awareness comes
from; it is probably the result of a confluence of factors throughout
the brain—the outcome of metacognition, activities that involve multiple
regions of the brain in their interconnectivity.</p>
<p>Getting to the brain is a highly orchestrated and meticulously
planned journey. First, the skin is cut. Incidentally, it is the skin
that contains pain fibers that must be dulled to perform brain surgery;
the skull and the brain itself, that organ that innervates the entire
body, has no sensory receptors of its own. It is why conducting brain
surgery on an awake patient is an option (and probably why Phineas Gage
felt little pain). The dura mater (“tough mother”)—the layer covering
the brain—has a few sensory fibers as well, but the brain itself does
not. It is “so meta,” as the kids say.</p>
<p>Once I’ve gotten inside someone’s head (literally), I usually have a
moment when I reflect on the fact that the brain can now be manipulated
way too easily. After you have snuck into the castle (the skull), you
have free rein. The brain floats in a bath of clear fluid and has no
discernible smell. The brain offers nearly no resistance as you dissect,
prod, probe, and cut. A patient could lose function of a limb if too
much pressure is placed in one area or develop crippling dizziness from
pressure in another section. A single snip could rob the patient’s sense
of smell, and a bigger snip could be blinding or worse. I’ve often
wondered why the brain wouldn’t put up more of a fight.</p>
<p>Knowing how vulnerable a brain can be on its exposure during surgery,
I feel like a SWAT team member whenever I operate on one, or maybe I’m
more like a highly trained thief. My goal is to get in, take what I
need—say, a tumor, abscess, or aneurysm—and get the hell out without
ever being detected. I want to disrupt the brain as little as
possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it is encased in solid bone, the brain is often
treated as a black box, viewed only in terms of its inputs and outputs
without full knowledge of its internal workings. Impenetrable and
indecipherable. And perhaps that is why the medical establishment simply
resorted to the convenient adage that “what is good for the heart is
also good for the brain.” Truth is, though, that the saying became
popular largely because both the heart and the brain have blood vessels.
The brain, of course, is exponentially more intricate. What’s more, the
heart is a glorified pump, an engineering marvel for sure, but still a
pump that can now be replicated in an engineer’s laboratory. There is no
true metaphor for the brain. If you become brain dead due to some
horrible head injury, there is no replacement. It is the command central
for not just our body but for our existence. Despite how much we have
mapped it, probed it, infused it with chemicals, we are still not
exactly sure what makes it tick or slows its tick. This has no doubt
played into our frustrations in understanding and treating
neurodegenerative decline and complex disease processes and disorders of
the brain, from autism to Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>Now here’s the silver lining: We may never know all the mysterious
perplexities of the human brain and come to control it like my parents
can an automobile, and that is okay. Maybe we are not supposed to know
where consciousness resides or how our personal perceptions and
perspectives are neuronally born. No, we can’t touch our brains the way
we can our skin or nose, but we know it’s there, just like the air we
breathe and the wind we feel on our face. We also know it’s home to
another bewildering marvel we cannot see, touch, or feel but immediately
associate with the brain: memory—the process of remembering—but it’s
much more than that, as you are about to learn. It is what makes us
uniquely human, and it’s the first pillar of having a sharp,
fast-thinking, resilient brain.</p>
<p>Brainy Facts</p>
<p>The typical human brain comprises about 2 to 2.5 percent of the
body’s total weight but uses 20 percent of its total energy and oxygen
intake.</p>
<p>Your brain is roughly 73 percent water (same for your heart), and
that is why it takes only 2 percent dehydration to affect your
attention, memory and other cognitive skills, so drinking just a few
ounces of water can reverse that.</p>
<p>Your brain weighs a little over three pounds. Sixty percent of the
dry weight is fat, making the brain the fattiest organ in the body.</p>
<p>All brain cells are not alike. There are many different types of
neurons in the brain, each serving an important function.</p>
<p>The brain is the last organ to mature. As any parent can attest,
children’s and teenagers’ brains are not fully formed, which is why they
take to risky behaviors and can have a harder time regulating their
emotions. It isn’t until about the age of twenty-five that the human
brain reaches full maturity.</p>
<p>Brain information can travel faster than some race cars, up to more
than 250 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Your brain generates enough electricity to power a low-wattage LED
light.</p>
<p>The average brain is believed to generate tens of thousands of
thoughts per day, give or take.</p>
<p>Every minute, 750 to 1,000 milliliters of blood flow through the
brain. This is enough to fill a wine bottle and then some. Every
minute!</p>
<p>Your brain can process a visual image in less time than it takes for
you to blink.</p>
<p>The hippocampus, the part of the brain considered the memory center,
has been documented to be significantly larger in people whose jobs have
high cognitive demands, compared to the average person. London cab
drivers, for instance, get a mental workout while navigating London’s
25,000 streets. However, those memory centers may be getting smaller
because of GPS.</p>
<p>Your brain starts slowing down by the surprisingly young age of
twenty-four, right before maximum maturity, but it peaks for different
cognitive skills at different ages. No matter how old you are, you’re
likely still getting better at some things. An extreme case is
vocabulary skills, which may peak as late as the early seventies!4</p>
<p>THE ESSENCE OF MEMORY, THINKING, AND HIGH MENTAL FUNCTIONING</p>
<p>Memory, as the ancient Greek dramatist Aeschylus said, is the mother
of all wisdom. But it’s also the mother of everything about us. The
smell of your grandma’s cooking, the sound of your child’s voice, the
image of your late father’s face, the thrills of a vacation you took
twenty years ago: These are the memories that form our ongoing
experiences of life and give us a sense of self and identity. Memories
are what make us feel alive, capable, and valuable. They also help us
feel comfortable with certain people and surroundings, connect the past
with the present, and yield a framework for the future. Even bad
memories can be useful, as they help us to avoid certain situations and
inform better decision making.</p>
<p>Memory is the most commonly recognized cognitive function, a higher
brain function. In addition to memory, cognition includes attention,
writing, reading, abstract thinking, decision making, problem solving,
and performing everyday tasks like navigating your way while driving,
figuring out the tip at a restaurant, appreciating the benefits or
harmful effects of the food you eat, or admiring the works of different
artists. Memory is the cornerstone of all learning, for it is where we
store knowledge and process that knowledge. Our memory must decide what
information is worth keeping and where it fits in relation to previous
knowledge that we have already stored. What we store in our memories
helps us process new situations.</p>
<p>Many of us, however, mistake memory for “memorizing.” We view memory
as a warehouse where we keep our knowledge when we are not using it, but
that metaphor is not correct because memory is not static like a
physical building. Our memories are constantly changing as we take in
fresh information and interpret it. From your brain’s perspective, new
information and experiences in the future can change the memories of our
past. Consider this in evolutionary terms: Being able to recall all the
details of a particular event is not necessarily a survival advantage.
The function of our memory is more about helping to build and maintain a
cohesive life narrative that fits with who we are while also constantly
changing with new experiences. This dynamism is partly why it’s also
true that our memories are not an accurate, objective record of the
past. They can be contaminated or changed fairly easily, even in people
who have no problems with their memory. Years ago, I did a story about
Bugs Bunny and Disney World. It was based on research by psychology
professor Elizabeth Loftus, in which she presented advertisements
featuring the characters to visitors at a Disney theme park. Some of the
ads showed Bugs Bunny, and the people who saw those ads were often
convinced they had in fact met Bugs Bunny in the Disney park and even
shook hands with him. They would sometimes describe a carrot in his
mouth, his floppy ears, and things he may have said, like, “What’s up,
Doc?” The problem is that Bugs Bunny is a Warner Bros. character and
would never be seen in a Disney park. Loftus demonstrated just how
easily memories can be implanted or manipulated.</p>
<p>Now consider what happens as you read an article in a magazine, in a
newspaper, or online. As you digest the new information, you’re using
information you’ve already got tucked in your memory. The new
information also evokes certain ingrained beliefs, values, and ideas
that are unique to you and help interpret the information, make sense of
it, fit it into your worldview, and then decide whether you will retain
it (while altering previously stored information) or let it be
forgotten. Thus, as you read the article, your memory actually changes
by both adding new information and finding a new place to put that
information. At the same time, you’re giving yourself a different way to
link the new information with older, now slightly modified information.
It’s complicated, and probably not at all how you have previously
thought about your memory. But it is important to know that memory is
fundamentally a learning process—the result of constantly interpreting
and analyzing incoming information. And every time you use your memory,
you change it. This is important. When we talk about improving or
preserving memory, we need to first understand what it is, and what it
represents to any given person.</p>
<p>We tend to worry about our ability to remember names or where we put
our keys, but we should also worry about the memory we need to be a
great performer in whatever role we fill as a professional, parent,
sibling, friend, innovator, mentor, and so on. Whether we’re talking
about the kind of memory we need to remain cognitively intact for the
duration of our life and avoid dementia, or whether we’re referring to
the memory we need to achieve peak performance in our everyday goals and
responsibilities, we’re talking about the same thing—the same memory.
The reason I am describing this in such detail is that the more you
understand your memory, the more inspired you’ll be to improve it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that neuroscientists described memory using
metaphors like a filing cabinet that stores individual memory files. But
today we know that memory cannot be described in such concrete terms. It
is far more complex and dynamic. We also now know that memory is not
really confined or generated in one particular location of the brain. It
is a brain-wide active collaboration that involves virtually every part
of it when running full throttle. That is why it makes sense that new
research is showing promise for the ability to tune our memories.
Because memory calls on an expansively distributed network and
coordinates those interactions through slow-frequency, thrumming rhythms
called theta waves, neuroscientists are finding ways to stimulate key
regions in the brain with noninvasive electric currents to physically
synchronize neural circuits, akin to an orchestra conductor tuning the
strings section to the wind. This kind of research and resulting
potential therapy is in its infancy, but the belief is that one day we
may be able to tune a seventy-year-old’s memory into that of someone
decades younger.</p>
<p>If I asked you to recall what you had for dinner last night, an image
might come to mind. Perhaps it was a plate of chicken marsala or a bowl
of chili. That memory was not sitting in some neural alleyway waiting to
be retrieved. The mental picture of your dinner was the outcome of an
astoundingly intricate choreography of processes scattered throughout
the brain that involved multiple neural networks. Construction of a
memory is about reassembling different memory “snapshots” or impressions
from a lattice-like pattern of cells found throughout the brain. In
other words, your memory is not a single system—it’s comprised of a
network of systems, each playing a unique role in creating, storing, and
recalling. When your brain processes information normally, all of these
systems work together in synchronicity to provide cohesive thought.
Single memories therefore are the result of a complex construction.
Think of your favorite pet. Let’s say it’s a dog named Bosco. When your
brain pictures the dog, it’s not just grabbing a memory of what Bosco
looks like from one place. It retrieves the dog’s name, appearance,
behavior, and sound of his bark. Your feelings toward him also
participate. Each part of the memory of what Bosco encompasses comes
from a different region of the brain, so your comprehensive image of
Bosco is actively reconstructed from many areas. Scientists who study
the brain are only beginning to understand how the parts are marshalled
into a coherent whole. You can think of it like this: When you recall a
memory, it is like assembling a giant jigsaw puzzle from a few small
pieces to get it started. As the pieces come together, link, and define
an image, they begin to tell a story, convey a picture, or share
knowledge. The puzzle becomes grander and larger, showing more and more
of its meaning. By the time you place the last piece, you have gathered
the information to complete a full “memory.” Given this analogy, you can
see that in order for memory to work properly, the right pieces of the
puzzle have to be present and attached together appropriately, which is
akin to integrating information from all these different parts of the
brain into something that makes sense. If pieces are missing or are not
joined together as designed, the memory won’t come together perfectly.
There will be gaps, holes, and an undefined result.</p>
<p>Music is an illustrative example. If you want to sing a song, you
must first retrieve the words and be able to say them. That typically
involves the left side of the brain, specifically the temporal lobe.
Singing those words requires more than just saying them: You have to
engage the right parietal and temporal lobes, which handle nonverbal
memory such as pitch and tone. All of this information must move to and
from the right and left sides of the brain to sync up and integrate
data. If you want to add a rhythm or beat to the music, that usually
comes from the back of the brain, known as the cerebellum. You get the
idea. Watching the brain of someone who is singing a song in a
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner is like watching a
light show on a clear night sky. And yet we know people with even
advanced dementia who can still sing songs from their childhood without
a problem. Collectively, disparate places in their brains are still able
to coordinate and work together, even if discrete parts of the memory
system are starting to fail.</p>
<p>The same elaborate process takes place when you perform what would
otherwise seem to be a single action, such as driving a car. Your memory
of how to operate the vehicle comes from one set of brain cells; the
memory of how to navigate the streets to get to your destination springs
from another set of neurons; the memory of driving rules and following
street signs originates from another family of brain cells; and the
thoughts and feelings you have about the driving experience itself,
including any close calls with other cars, come from yet another group
of cells. You do not have conscious awareness of all these separate
mental plays and cognitive neural firings, yet they somehow work
together in beautiful harmony to synthesize your overall experience. In
fact, we don’t even know the real difference between how we remember and
how we think. But, we do know they are strongly intertwined. That is why
truly improving memory can never simply be about using memory hacks or
tricks, although they can be helpful in strengthening certain components
of memory. Here’s the bottom line: To improve and preserve memory at the
cognitive level, you have to work on all functions of your brain.</p>
<p>Scientists haven’t sorted out the precise physiology behind how the
brain thinks, organizes memories, and recalls information, but they have
offered enough of a working knowledge to state a few reliable facts
about this amazing feat.</p>
<p>It helps to consider memory building in three phases: encoding,
storage, and retrieval.</p>
<p>Building a Memory (Encoding)</p>
<p>Creating a memory starts with encoding, which begins with your
perception of an experience using your senses. Think about your memory
of meeting someone you fell in love with, perhaps even married. In that
first meeting, your eyes, ears, and nose took note of that person’s
physical features, voice sounds, and personal scent. Maybe you also
touched the person. All of these separate sensations traveled to the
hippocampus, the area of the brain that integrates these perceptions or
impressions as they were happening into one single experience—in this
case, the experience of the individual.</p>
<p>While the function of memory is facilitated in areas throughout the
brain, the hippocampus is your brain’s memory center. (Studies show that
as your hippocampus shrinks, so does your memory; studies also show that
a higher waist-to-hip ratio—ahem, carrying extra weight—equates with a
smaller hippocampus. More on this later.) With the help of the brain’s
frontal cortex, your hippocampus takes the helm to analyze these various
sensory inputs and evaluate whether they are worth remembering. Now,
it’s important to understand how memory and learning are occurring at a
biochemical level, which will help you grasp why the strategies I
suggest will work for you. All of the analyzing and filtering of your
perceptions occur using the brain’s language of electricity and chemical
messengers. As you already know, nerve cells connect with other cells at
an endpoint called the synapse. Here, electrical pulses carrying
messages jump across super small spaces or “gaps” between cells, which
triggers the release of chemical messengers aptly named
neurotransmitters. Examples of common neurotransmitters are dopamine,
norepinephrine, and epinephrine. When they move across these gaps
between cells, they attach themselves to neighboring cells. A typical
brain has trillions of synapses. The segments of the brain cells that
receive these electric impulses are called dendrites, which literally
means “treelike” because they are short branched extensions of a nerve
cell that reach out to nearby brain cells.</p>
<p>The attachments between brain cells are incredibly dynamic in nature.
In other words, they are not fixed like a line of cable. They change and
grow (or shrink) continually. Working together in a network, brain cells
organize themselves into specialized groups to serve in different kinds
of information processing. When one brain cell sends signals to another,
the synapse between the two strengthens. The more often a particular
signal is sent between them, the stronger the connection grows. That is
why “practice makes perfect.” Every time you experience something new,
your brain slightly rewires to accommodate that new experience. Novel
experiences and learning cause new dendrites to form, whereas repeated
behavior and learning cause existing dendrites to become more
entrenched. Both are important, of course. The creation of new
dendrites, even weak ones, is called plasticity. It is this plasticity
that can help your brain rewire itself if it is ever damaged. It is also
the core ingredient for resilience, vital for building a better brain
(see chapter 3). So, as you navigate the world and learn new things,
changes happen at the synapses and dendrites—more connections are
generated, while some may be weakened. The brain perpetually organizes
and reorganizes itself in response to your experiences, your education,
the challenges you face, and the memories you make.</p>
<p>These neural changes are reinforced with use. As you learn new
information and practice new skills, the brain builds intricate circuits
of knowledge and memory (hence the saying “what wires together fires
together”). If you play Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata on the piano over
and over, for example, the repeated firing of certain brain cells in a
certain order makes it easier to replicate this firing later. The result
is that you get more adept at playing the piece effortlessly. You can
play it without even thinking about it note for note, measure by
measure. Practice it repeatedly and long enough, and you will eventually
be able to play it flawlessly “from memory.” If you stop practicing for
several weeks, though, and then try to play the piece again, you may not
be able to play it as perfectly as before. Your brain has already begun
to “forget” what you once knew so well. The dendrites that were so well
defined start to wither away a bit fairly quickly. Luckily, it is not
difficult to read the notes even years later and build up those neural
connections once again.</p>
<p>There is a caveat, however, to all this memory making. You have to
pay attention to properly encode a memory. Do you need to read that
again? Put simply, you must have an awareness of what you’re
experiencing. Because you cannot pay attention to everything you
encounter, a lot of potential stimuli is automatically filtered out. In
reality, only select stimuli reach your conscious awareness. If your
brain remembered every single thing it noticed, its memory system would
be overwhelmed to the point you’d find basic functioning difficult. What
scientists are not sure about is whether stimuli are screened out after
the brain processes its significance or during the sensory input stage.
How you pay attention to incoming data, however, may be the most
important factor in how much of that information you remember.</p>
<p>I should point out that forgetting does have significant value. As I
mentioned, if you remembered everything that comes into your brain, your
brain would not work properly and your ability to creatively think and
imagine would be diminished. Everyday life would be difficult; sure,
you’d be able to recall long lists and cite elegiac love poems, but
you’d struggle to grasp abstract concepts and even to recognize faces.
There’s a group of neurons that are charged with helping the brain to
forget, and that are most active at night during sleep when the brain is
reorganizing itself and preparing for the next day of incoming
information. Scientists discovered these “forgetting” neurons in 2019,
which helps us further understand the importance of sleep—and the merits
of forgetting. It’s a beautiful paradox: In order to remember, we have
to forget to some degree.</p>
<p>Short- versus Long-Term Memory (Storage)</p>
<p>It’s common knowledge that our memories work on two different levels:
short-term memory and long-term memory. But even before an experience
can become part of our short-term memory, which includes what you focus
on in the moment—what holds your attention—there is a sensory stage that
lasts a fraction of a second. During this initial stage, your perception
of an experience gets logged in your brain as you register incoming
information—what you see, feel, and hear. Sensory memory allows that
perception to remain after the stimulation is over, though only
momentarily. Then the sensation moves into short-term memory.</p>
<p>Most of us can hold only about seven items of information in
short-term memory at any given time, such as a list of seven grocery
items or a seven-digit phone number. You may be able to increase this
capacity a little through various memory tricks or strategies. For
example, a ten-digit number such as 6224751288 may be too long to
remember all at once. But broken up into orderly blocks, as in a
hyphenated telephone number, 622-475-1288 you’ll more easily store that
in your short-term memory and be able to recall it (your Social Security
number is hyphenated and therefore easier to remember). Repeating the
number to yourself also helps pack the information into short-term
memory. To learn information so that you can retain and recall it, you
must transfer it from short-term to long-term memory. Short-term memory
is closely linked to the function of your hippocampus, while long-term
memory is closely linked to functions of the outer layer of the brain,
your cortex (see image below).</p>
<p>Short- vs. Long-Term Memory Areas of Your Brain</p>
<p>Long-term memory includes all the information that you really know
and can recall. In many ways, it becomes part of you. It’s how you
remember events from last week, last year, or your childhood. Once
information becomes part of your long-term memory, you have access to it
for a long time. Unlike sensory and short-term memory, which are limited
and decay rapidly, long-term memory allows us to recall functions to
store unlimited amounts of information indefinitely. Certain things can
interrupt the process of moving a memory from short term to long term,
however. Alcohol, for example, puts a glitch in the process. For someone
who is intoxicated, the encoding into long-term memory often does not
occur very well, or at all. And that is why, days later, someone may
have a hard time remembering something that was so vivid earlier when
the memory was still in short-term storage. In these cases, they can’t
retrieve the memory from the long-term bucket because it was never there
in the first place. Sleep deprivation can also disrupt the movement of
memories from short to long term. During sleep, your body consolidates
and transfers your short-term memories to long-term memories—the kind
you’ll have for much of the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Retrieval</p>
<p>Of course, none of this works without retrieval. When you call up a
memory, you first fetch the information at an unconscious level and
willfully drop it into your conscious mind. Most people see themselves
as having either a “good” or a “bad” memory, but the truth is we each
are fairly adept at remembering some types of things and not so great at
remembering others. If you struggle with remembering, say, people’s
names and you’re not suffering from a physical disease or dementia, it’s
usually not the failing of your entire memory system. It could be a lack
of attention at the time you were being introduced and first heard the
person’s name. It could also be an inefficient retrieval system. In
those cases, people often feel like the name is “on the tip of their
tongue.” Sometimes that can easily be rectified by sharpening your
memory skills for that particular weakness, encoding or retrieval. Many
memory champions started off believing they had poor memory until they
spent time practicing techniques focusing on a very specific component
of memory.</p>
<p>For some people, however, memory problems do tend to increase as they
get older. Memory speed and accuracy naturally begin to slip in our
twenties, especially our working memory that holds information
temporarily in the mind so we can get through the day and make good
decisions. But as I reiterate throughout this book, memory problems are
not inevitable with age. There are things we can do to maintain,
enhance, and sharpen our abilities to remember, retain, and retrieve
that information as long as we live. Now, let’s turn to some of the
terminology you’ll need going forward. How is cognitive decline defined?
What is considered normal and abnormal? Is it reversible?</p>
