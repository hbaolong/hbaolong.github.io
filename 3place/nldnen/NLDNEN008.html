<h4 id="chapter-4-the-miracle-of-movement">CHAPTER 4 The Miracle of
Movement</h4>
<p>Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a
healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual
activity.</p>
<p>JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>
<p>When people ask me what’s the single most important thing they can do
to enhance their brain’s function and resiliency to disease, I answer
with one word: exercise—as in move more and keep a regular physical
fitness routine. Maybe you expected me to say diet, crossword puzzles,
or higher education, but it is all about physical movement. Truth is,
even if you’ve never maintained a consistent workout in the past, you
can start today and have quick and significant effects on your brain’s
health (and your whole body, obviously). Fitness could very well be the
most important ingredient to living as long as possible, despite all the
other risk factors you bear—age and genetics included. And while it may
seem hard to believe, exercise is the only behavioral activity
scientifically proven to trigger biological effects that can help the
brain. We cannot yet say that exercise will reverse cognitive deficits
and dementia, but evidence is mounting to heed the advice that we all
would do well to follow: get in motion. Remember: A body in motion tends
to stay in motion. And, if you have not been exercising, starting today
can significantly protect your brain later. It’s never too late!</p>
<p>Do you know any octogenarians who can bench-press 115 pounds? I do;
she lives in Baltimore and teaches a workout class at the gym. But
Ernestine Shepherd didn’t start exercising until she turned fifty-six,
when she decided to get into shape with her sister. How about a
seventy-seven-year-old ballerina (Madame Suzelle Poole) and a fifty-some
professional soccer player (Kazuyoshi Miura)? In 2018,
eighty-seven-year-old John Starbrook became the oldest runner to
complete the London Marathon. Linda Ashmore swam the English Channel at
seventy-one. These people are proof that exercise can be a lifelong
activity and it’s never too late to start. Scientists are finally
getting around to studying “master athletes”—people who engage in sports
and are thirty-five or older. They give us a wonderful glimpse into
what’s physically possible as we age and how exercise tangibly benefits
us not only physically, but also mentally. For starters, these studies
are debunking a lot of myths about the aging process. Contrary to what
you might think, we don’t get that much slower with age until we reach
seventy. And we can gain a lot more than we previously realized from
relatively low-intensity activities like walking, gardening, or ballroom
dancing. When I saw the chart on the previous page, the first thing that
went through my mind was, “I have no excuse anymore!” It immediately put
things into perspective.</p>
<p>THE PACE OF AGING</p>
<p>The influence of exercise on brain function is so spectacular that in
early 2018, the American Academy of Neurology published new guidelines
for doctors like me to use in deciding best choices when treating
patients, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often
a precursor to dementia.1 The subcommittee assigned to updating the
recommendations diligently reviewed eight medications that might prove
helpful in slowing the progression from MCI to full-blown Alzheimer’s
disease. Having arrived at this point in the book, it probably won’t
surprise you that the panel concluded not a single drug was effective:
Although there are Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs for
treating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s dementia, “[t]here are no
FDA-approved medications for the treatment of MCI. Moreover, there are
no high-quality, long-term studies identifying pharmacologic or dietary
agents that either improve cognition or delay progression in patients
with MCI.” But what the scientists did declare is that exercise should
be recommended: “Six-month studies suggest a possible benefit of
twice-weekly exercise for cognition in MCI. Exercise also has general
health benefits and generally limited risk.” If that doesn’t sound
compelling enough, you should also recognize that physical inactivity
has been calculated to be the most significant risk factor in cognitive
decline and the development of dementia.2</p>
<p>Consider that while no particular medication is universally
recommended, exercise is, if for no other reason than to prevent
inactivity. It is an example of how the body and the brain want to heal
and how movement can help make that happen. The Mayo Clinic’s Dr. Ron
Petersen—a founding member of the Global Council on Brain Health—was
among the authors of the new guidelines. Dr. Petersen is a neurologist
who has dedicated his life to studying cognition in normal aging, as
well as in a variety of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body
dementia, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (progressive loss of
nerve cells in the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain, causing
decline in behavior, language, or movement; it’s the most common form of
dementia for people under age sixty). He is a world leader in the field
of Alzheimer’s research and directs the Mayo Clinic’s Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center and its Study of Aging. When I spoke with him
about his thoughts on preserving brain function overall, exercise was at
the top of his list. “The literature is pretty good about the role of
exercise, especially aerobic exercise,” he said. “Brisk walking can do
it.” Walking! It seems the basics really do apply, even when you speak
to scientists at the highest levels who have dedicated their lives to
studying the brain.</p>
<p>Dr. Petersen has seen his field revolutionized by imaging technology
over his career. In his early days, doctors like him could diagnose
Alzheimer’s disease only on autopsy. Now special PET scans allow us to
look inside the living brain and see what’s going on without having to
bring a scalpel anywhere close. All kinds of various imaging
technologies are helping us measure changes in the brain under certain
circumstances. Physical activity has the strongest evidence to date of
positive brain changes. And again, it takes far less exercise than you
might imagine: if brisk walking alone can accomplish the job, then
there’s your directive. But you have to engage in regular physical
exercise at least 150 minutes a week and incorporate interval and
strength training into the mix. Interval training means you alternate
between varying levels of speed, intensity, and effort. Think of it as
surprising the body so you don’t fall into well-worn ruts that fail to
challenge the body and lead to a plateau in your progress. Strength
training refers to the use of weights or just your own body weight as
resistance. This helps build muscle mass and tone and helps balance and
coordination.</p>
<p>People often tell me they “don’t have time” to exercise, but you must
make the time. On your busy schedule, it may be the first thing to get
cancelled, but it’s time to change that. Remember, this isn’t about
vanity or looks; it’s about your life and well-being. Physical exercise
may offer the greatest return on investment in yourself, and it’s an
antidote to many things that play into your risk for decline. Here’s a
simple example: You already know that having high blood pressure or
diabetes increases your chances of suffering from dementia later in
life, but it turns out that exercise is one of the most powerful tools
for gaining control of those problems too.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fully 80
percent of Americans don’t get enough regular exercise. Only about 23
percent of men and 18 percent of women meet the recommended
requirements. The people most likely to exercise are between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-four (almost 31 percent of exercisers). An analysis
of U.S. adults aged fifty to seventy-one found those who had exercised
between two and eight hours a week from their teens through to their
sixties had a 29 to 36 percent lower chance of dying from any cause over
the twenty-year study period.3</p>
<p>SMARTER AND BIGGER BRAINS IN MINUTES OF MOVEMENT</p>
<p>I know I’m not the first to tell you about the tremendous physical
healing power of exercise, but I may be the first to explain how it
makes you mentally sharper. Broadly speaking, exercise improves
digestion, metabolism, body tone and strength, and bone density. Most of
us think about it as a weight loss tool, which it is. But it’s much more
than that. It can turn on your “smart genes,” support emotional
stability, and stave off depression and dementia. When you choose the
right exercise for you, it’s enjoyable and increases your self-worth and
confidence. Don’t take this lightly because I really mean it: You can be
smarter by some measures after one hour of exercise through the effects
of movement on the brain. So how does this happen?</p>
<p>It’s not that exercise automatically injects the brain with facts
about history or how to perform complex math or fly an airplane. But you
will be boosting your brain in ways that help you think more quickly and
clearly and be focused. This happens through both multiple direct and
indirect effects, which we’ll explore shortly. Try it yourself. Go out
for a fast-paced walk around the block, and when you return, note how
you feel and how your mind is humming. My bet is you will have more
mental energy even if the walk left you out of breath. And you will
probably feel more optimistic and better able to tackle the challenges
of the day. Philosopher and psychologist William James stated it
perfectly in the nineteenth century: “Keep the faculty of effort alive
in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day.”</p>
<p>I came to be a consistent exerciser later in life. Always more of a
bookish person, I didn’t equate physical exercise as anything more than
a way to get fit or provide a form of recreation. I was about thirty
when I started to think about exercise as a way to improve my brain.
This was during a time when schools around the country were cutting back
on the length of recess and physical education classes in favor of more
basic curriculum courses. What partly triggered the shift was a dip in
the standardized test scores in the United States, which were lagging
far behind those in other countries. The prevailing sentiment became
“more math and less recreation.”</p>
<p>I began to look into the research on the impact of these sorts of
policy changes on learning overall, and what I found was unmistakable:
Places where students spent more time and energy engaging in individual
and team sports enjoyed a positive learning impact, and places that had
cut back on those had the opposite effect. It was the first time I
started to think of exercise as a way of improving not only my body but
my mind as well. Truth is, while anecdotal evidence going back millennia
revealed benefits to exercise, it wasn’t until the mid-twentieth century
that large-scale studies were performed showing that physical fitness
both prevented illness and protected health. Before that, it was
considered mainly just a form of leisure and sport. Exercise physiology
became a bona fide field of study. Now, a new study seems to emerge
every week showing the neuroprotective benefits of exercise and that
sedentarism (a.k.a. couch potato syndrome) appears to cause the brain to
atrophy, or physically shrink, while simultaneously increasing the risk
for Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn’t about your body habitus. Simply being
inactive, regardless of your body weight, has been shown to be twice as
deadly as being obese. And if you’ve been keeping up with the latest
health news, you’ve likely come across headlines calling couch potatoes
“smokers”—as in, “sitting is the new smoking.” That’s a misleading
overstatement because you can’t compare those two habits. The risks of
chronic disease and premature death associated with smoking are
substantially higher than for sitting. But the headlines nonetheless
highlight an important fact: Prolonged sitting—more than eight hours a
day with zero physical activity—can kill you or lead to an early death.
Most of that damage is metabolic. Here is what happens. When you are
immobile, your circulation slows down and your body uses less of your
blood sugar, which means more sugar is circulating. Being motionless
also negatively influences blood fats, high-density lipoprotein (the
good cholesterol), resting blood pressure, and the satiety hormone
leptin (which tells you when to stop eating). Sitting puts muscles into
a sort of dormant state where their electrical activity is diminished,
leading to atrophy and breakdown. Moreover, the production of
lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme that breaks down fat molecules in the
blood, is shut down, leading to more fat circulating as well. As your
metabolic rate plummets, you stop burning as many calories.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you’re active, even those few minutes in
motion will counter the effects of being on your butt too much. The
point is that while lack of exercise is a risk factor for early illness
and death, simple movement itself is shown to prevent such a fate. A
2015 study out of the University of Utah School of Medicine, for
instance, showed that getting up for light activity such as walking for
two minutes every hour was associated with a 33 percent lower chance of
dying over a three-year period.4 Two minutes! That’s a big boost in
prevention for a short period of time. A mere 120 seconds each hour can
offset the damaging effects that prolonged sitting has on the body.</p>
<p>MYTH: As you age, muscle mass is not as important as having healthy
cardiorespiratory fitness.</p>
<p>TRUTH: People fail to appreciate how valuable muscle mass is to
quality of life, recovery from illness and injury, and the ability to
stay mobile and active and perform basic everyday tasks, as well as to
overall metabolic health. Unlike fat, which mostly stores calories,
muscle is a highly active tissue that burns calories. This helps explain
why lean, more muscular people tend to burn more calories at rest than
do people with higher proportions of body fat. So in addition to keeping
a cardio routine that gets your heart rate up, you’ll want to continue
to build and maintain muscle mass. Gradual muscle loss over time goes
with aging, but you can counter this decline with strength and
resistance training.</p>
<p>MOVING THROUGH EVOLUTION</p>
<p>Throughout most of human history, we’ve been physically active every
day. We had to be in order to survive. Science has even proven that over
millions of years, our genome evolved in a state of constant physical
challenge—that is, it took a massive amount of physical effort to find
food and water. Put another way, our genome expects and requires
frequent movement. I often tell my students: “We humans were not
designed to sit or lie down for twenty-three hours a day and then go to
the gym for an hour. Science has revealed that we humans are designed to
be pretty consistently active right down to our molecular core.”</p>
<p>Biologist and paleoanthropologist Daniel E. Lieberman of Harvard
knows a lot about the power of physical activity on how the body looks
and functions. His research into the evolution of Homo sapiens and our
history of athleticism culminated in a highly referenced 2004 paper in
the journal Nature coauthored with Dennis M. Bramble of the University
of Utah.5 They say that we’ve survived this long on the planet by virtue
of our athletic agility. When our ancestors tracked predators and hunted
down valuable prey for food, they cemented our continuing existence. We
were able to find sustenance and gain energy for mating, which could
then allow us to pass on our genes to the next generation of stronger,
hardier humans. In his 2013 book, The Story of the Human Body,
Dr. Lieberman makes a strong case that our epidemic levels of chronic
disease today are the result of a mismatch between our evolutionary
roots and modern lifestyles: “We still don’t know how to counter
once-adaptive primal instincts to eat donuts and take the elevator.”6 In
a follow-up 2015 paper, Lieberman calls out the paradox: “Humans evolved
to be adapted for regular, moderate amounts of endurance physical
activity into late age,” but “humans also were selected to avoid
unnecessary exertion.”7 And he sums up the secrets to a good long life
in the following passage from the introduction to his 2013 book, which
starts with exercise: “Men and women aged forty-five to seventy-nine who
are physically active, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, do not
smoke, and consume alcohol moderately have on average one-fourth the
risk of death during a given year than people with unhealthy habits.”8
This should inspire you because these dictums are practical. Anyone can
follow them.</p>
<p>It is documented that during 600 BCE—more than 2.5 millennia ago—a
physician from Sushruta, an Indus Valley civilization, was the first
recorded doctor to prescribe moderate daily exercise for his patients
and to indicate that “it should be taken every day.”9 Sushruta
recommended exercise because it made the body strong, firm, and light;
supported the growth of limbs and muscles; improved digestion and
complexion; prevented laziness; and reduced senility. English
translations of the original text in Sanskrit call exercise “absolutely
conducive to a better preservation of health.”10 More than two thousand
years ago, the medical community recognized the link between movement of
the body and the health of the brain, and once again it is starting to
take center stage.</p>
<p>Benefits of Exercise11</p>
<p>Exercise has long been linked to positive brain health. We know that,
but I want to make sure you understand how movement of your body
improves your brain. A big factor is the control of blood sugar through
exercise. Using sugar to fuel your muscles instead of sitting idle in
your blood helps prevent dramatic glucose and insulin fluctuations that
you have already learned increase the risk for dementia. Exercise also
helps lower inflammation and that is critical in preventing dementia.
Consider these other benefits:</p>
<p>Lowered risk of death from all causes</p>
<p>Increased stamina, strength, flexibility, and energy</p>
<p>Increased muscle tone and bone health</p>
<p>Increased blood and lymph circulation and oxygen supply to cells and
tissues</p>
<p>More restful, sounder sleep</p>
<p>Stress reduction</p>
<p>Increased self-esteem and sense of well-being</p>
<p>Release of endorphins, the brain chemicals that act as natural mood
lifters and pain relievers</p>
<p>Decreased blood sugar levels and risk for insulin resistance and
diabetes</p>
<p>Ideal weight distribution and maintenance</p>
<p>Increased heart health, with lower risk for cardiovascular disease
and high blood pressure</p>
<p>Decreased inflammation and risk for age-related disease, from cancer
to dementia</p>
<p>Stronger immune system</p>
<p>SHAPE YOUR BRAIN BY GETTING INTO SHAPE</p>
<p>The biology of how exercise benefits brain health goes far beyond the
reasoning that it facilitates oxygenated blood flow, delivering
nutrients for neural cell growth and maintenance. We’ve known for a long
time that cerebral blood flow is a good thing. The latest science behind
the magic of movement in protecting and preserving brain function,
however, is worth understanding and less known among the general public.
Again, there are generally two ways that exercise benefits the brain.
For one, exercise effectively uses circulating blood sugar and reduces
inflammation while stimulating the release of growth factors, substances
that promote both the proliferation and function of cells. In the brain,
these growth factors support the health of new neurons, the recruitment
of blood vessels, and the survival of all neurons. The other way that
exercise can benefit the brain may seem a little less objective, but it
is no less important. We now know that regular movement measurably
reduces stress and anxiety while improving sleep and mood—all of which
can also positively affect brain structure and function. These combined
effects build critically important brain resilience in the long term and
help pave the way for us to be creative and insightful and to solve
problems in the short term.</p>
<p>I have little doubt that we will soon have sufficient evidence to
conclusively state that physical activity reduces the risk of dementia.
We already know that people who lead a physically active life have a
lower risk of cognitive decline, and research is now emerging to show
that greater fitness is correlated with maintaining better processing
skills in aging brains. A 2018 study, for instance, showed that the more
fit an older person was, the better the chances he or she could recall
words, as compared to those who were less fit.12 I agree with what many
of my colleagues like to say: Exercise can act as a “first aid kit” for
damaged brain cells, speeding up recovery after injury, stroke, or a
significant emotional stress. I don’t know of a single pill that can do
all that.</p>
<p>I’ve witnessed the merits of fitness in my own reporting and my own
life. After all the years traveling the world meeting people from
different backgrounds and cultures, the one pattern I’ve noticed is that
those who are physically fit enjoy sharper minds. You have probably seen
it as well. These are people whose brains don’t seem to age. And for me,
staying in shape is what allows me to do all that crazy traveling and at
times be unreasonably productive. Exercise helps me think better and
consolidate new information. Without it, I find that most of what I
think are my “new” thoughts are basically a repackaging of old ideas.
With my brain on exercise, I find that I am more likely to have truly
novel thoughts, an incredible feeling.</p>
<p>Inner strength and mental toughness are often the result of
controlling one ubiquitous reality of modern life: stress. When it comes
to the positive effects of exercise on the brain, stress reduction is
something you have likely experienced every time you work out. I’ve
mentioned the stress-reducing effects of exercise numerous times
already, but here’s how it works. When your body senses stress, it
releases the stress-related hormone cortisol, which is increasingly
being blamed for creating long-lasting brain changes. This is why young
people who are exposed to chronic stress in early childhood are prone to
mental problems such as anxiety and mood disorders later in life.
Daniela Kaufer is an integrative biologist at the University of
California, Berkeley, and a few years ago, she and her colleagues
conducted a series of experiments demonstrating that chronic stress and
elevated levels of cortisol can also negatively affect memory and
learning in surprising ways.13 The scientists found that too much
cortisol can generate an overproduction of myelin-producing cells, known
as oligodendrocytes, and an underproduction of neurons. Think of this as
having electrical wire with a lot of coating, which is the myelin, but
little actual copper, the neurons, to conduct the electricity. This led
to a shrinking of the hippocampus, the memory hub in our brain. Her team
also found that chronic stress causes neuronal stem cells, baby
precursor cells that would normally turn into neurons, to instead flip
into cells that inhibit connections to the prefrontal cortex area of the
brain, which is where learning and memory occur.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how stress affects the brain. Try
and visualize this interplay between stress and your brain. Once you
grasp this concept, you will be better equipped to control stress and
its resulting flood of cortisol. Again, one of the best and simplest
ways to do that is through exercise.</p>
<p>MYTH: Exercise can be dangerous when you get older and the body grows
increasingly frail.</p>
<p>TRUTH: Exercise should be a lifetime activity. It will boost your
brain and body in ways that can physically de-age you while preventing
and even treating frailty. It is one of the most effective, drug-free
methods to improve mobility and independence in older people.14 Recent
studies of recreational cyclists aged fifty-five to seventy-nine suggest
they have the capacity to do everyday tasks very easily and efficiently
because nearly all parts of their body are in remarkably good
condition.15 The cyclists also scored high on tests measuring mental
agility, mental health, and quality of life. This doesn’t mean you need
to choose cycling as your go-to exercise. Choose something you like and
that works with your body. If you’re prone to falls or have
osteoarthritis or bad knees, you’ll want to pick an activity that
doesn’t make you more vulnerable to injury or exacerbate any condition.
Swimming, for example, is an excellent way to get a great workout
without any impact or risk of falling.</p>
<p>Earlier I referenced studies showing that people with high blood
sugar—whether or not their blood sugar level technically makes them
diabetic—have a faster rate of cognitive decline than those with normal
blood sugar. But I haven’t explained yet how this happens. High blood
sugar can lead to dementia for several reasons. For starters, the
condition can weaken the blood vessels and thus increase the likelihood
of ministrokes in the brain, which can then trigger various forms of
dementia. Second, a high intake of simple sugars can make cells,
including those in the brain, insulin resistant. That means the insulin
is present but is not working as well. In turn, brain cells can’t
adequately absorb sugar to fuel their activity. That means no matter how
much you are eating, your brain cells could still be starving.</p>
<p>Just as blood sugar is more easily managed when you eat right and
move, so is high blood pressure, or hypertension, another important risk
factor for dementia. In a 2014 study that followed thousands of
Americans since the 1980s, some with and some without high blood
pressure, Johns Hopkins neurologist Rebecca Gottesman revealed that
having hypertension at midlife is a major risk factor for cognitive
decline. And get this: The finding was independent of other risk factors
such as obesity.16</p>
<p>In 2017, Dr. Gottesman published a follow-up study that showed how
much certain risk factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and
a smoking habit, have on your chance of suffering dementia later in
life.17 Smoking and diabetes were the biggest threats: Diabetes was
linked to a 77 percent greater risk, and smoking in middle age was
associated with 41 percent higher odds of dementia. Hypertension was
associated with 39 percent greater odds of dementia. Gottesman’s work
has also documented that obesity can double the risk of having elevated
amyloid proteins in the brain later in life.18</p>
<p>One recent study in particular that I want to point out was done in
2018. Instead of simply looking for a connection between self-reported
exercise habits and brain health, this one, from the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, used a more precise way of measuring
physical fitness.19 The researchers decided to test the participants’
maximum oxygen consumption during aerobic exercise. This is known as the
VO2 max test, a method recognized by the American Heart Association as a
more definitive way of evaluating cardiovascular fitness. The
participants were a mix of healthy older adults and people with mild
cognitive impairment. Their average age was 65.</p>
<p>All of the participants took a series of tests: a VO2 max aerobic
test on a treadmill (similar to a cardiac stress test that lasts about
ten minutes), and cognitive tests of memory and reasoning. In addition,
the researchers imaged their brains with special scanning technology to
see the integrity, or functionality, of their white matter—the bundles
of nerve fibers through which messages pass between different areas of
gray matter. We know that the health of white matter signifies how well
brain areas communicate. If it begins to break down, which can happen
with age, weak white matter means weaker connections throughout the
brain.</p>
<p>The study’s results highlighted an important aspect of the effects
exercise has on the brain. It showed a strong association between lower
levels of aerobic fitness and weaker white matter in those with mild
cognitive impairment, which correlated with lower brain function. These
individuals didn’t do so well on the tests for memory and reasoning. In
sum, the researchers connected the dots and concluded that being
physically fit correlates with healthier white matter. And healthier
white matter correlates with better memory and reasoning abilities.
Research is underway to understand what fitness level is ideal to
markedly reduce the risk of dementia and perhaps significantly slow down
the progression once symptoms develop. If the simple act of moving more
can slash your risk of dementia and put the brakes on any disease in
motion, then there’s no excuse.</p>
<p>JUST AS YOU WOULD BRUSH YOUR TEETH</p>
<p>“Exercise” includes a combination of purposeful aerobic cardio work
(e.g., swimming, cycling, jogging, group exercise classes), strength
training (e.g., free weights, resistance bands, gym machines, mat
Pilates, lunges, squats), and routines that promote flexibility and
balance (e.g., stretching, yoga). It also includes leading a physically
active life throughout the day (e.g., taking the stairs instead of the
elevator; avoiding prolonged sitting; going for walks during breaks;
engaging in hobbies such as dancing, hiking, and gardening).</p>
<p>For me, exercise is a daily nonnegotiable activity like brushing my
teeth. Make it the same for you. I try to break a sweat every day,
aiming for about an hour of exercise in addition to as much natural
movement as possible throughout the day. My go-to’s are either swimming,
cycling, or running, and I throw in dedicated strength training a few
times a week as well. I started participating in triathlons when I
turned forty because I felt that my own aging process was sapping my
energy and muscle mass. I also began to worry more about the heart
disease in my family that strikes men in their forties. The same old
routine of occasionally playing tennis and doing some running was no
longer having an impact on me. I had to build more structure into my
fitness regimen and add more variety. I also made exercise a greater
priority in my life. As a father of three with a demanding job and
ongoing projects, I still find a way to fit exercise in every day. Human
behavior dictates that you will fill whatever time you are given to
complete a task, and people think of exercise as the first expendable
thing when they get busy and want another hour of time for something
else. I just don’t do that; exercise is sacred time on my schedule.</p>
<p>Wherever I am in the world, I have my running shoes, swimsuit, and
goggles. I take resistance bands with me as well to get in some strength
training and, at the recommendation of my chair of neurosurgery, I do a
hundred push-ups every day. For me, convenience is critically important.
I make exercise accessible to me by having certain tools within easy
reach. For example, I keep weights in my bedroom, and I’ve got a door
frame pull-up bar at home and in my office. Incidentally, pull-ups are a
great way to build your back muscles and strengthen your core. They are
hard at first, but you start to feel the payoff almost immediately.
People often neglect upper body strength, especially as they get older,
but it’s good for posture, bone density, and metabolism, and it even
helps your lungs ward off pneumonia, especially if you find yourself in
a hospital or bedridden.</p>
<p>I’ll be encouraging you to get moving with a twelve-week program that
you can tailor to your needs. You don’t need to become a championship
bodybuilder like Ernestine, buy into a gym membership, or start training
for an endurance event (though I love watching people in their seventies
and eighties on the racetrack). Regular exercise that gets your heart
pumping and your muscles flexing is all you need to do. Ideally, and at
a minimum, you’ll aim for at least thirty minutes of cardio work five
days a week. You’ll want to get your heart rate up at least 50 percent
above your resting baseline for at least twenty of those thirty minutes.
Sorry, but golfing with a cart doesn’t count. On the other two days, try
a restorative yoga class or leisure activity like walking; don’t be
totally sedentary.</p>
<p>If you want to gain the most benefits out of exercise and lower your
risk of dying prematurely, newer research points to a tripling of that
150-minute per week recommendation to a little more than an hour per
day. Now that may seem like a lot, but keep in mind that this amount
reflects cumulative minutes of exercise, not just gym time. The study
backing this claim was published in 2015 by JAMA Internal Medicine.
Researchers with the National Cancer Institute, Harvard University, and
other institutions gathered and pooled data about people’s exercise
habits using six large, ongoing health surveys.20 They ended up with
information about more than half a million adults. What the researchers
did to identify the relationship between minutes spent exercising and
risk of mortality was to divide the people up into categories: there
were those who did not exercise at all, those who worked out ten times
or more the recommended amount (twenty-five hours or more per week), and
everything in between those extremes. Then the researchers turned to the
death records. Who died? How did the death rates sync up with the time
spent exercising?</p>
<p>Not to their surprise, they found that the people who were at the
highest risk of premature death were the sedentary ones. Next came the
group that exercised a little but didn’t meet the recommendations of at
least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise; yet they still reduced
their risk by 20 percent. The individuals who fulfilled the guidelines
had 31 percent less risk of dying during the fourteen-year period
compared with those who never exercised and lived longer. The keys to
the longevity kingdom, however, were bestowed on those who worked out
for 450 minutes weekly. And get this: these people achieved these
benefits mostly by walking. Walking! Compared to the people who shunned
exercise entirely, they were 39 percent less likely to die prematurely.
How much of those benefits pertain to brain health is yet to be
determined, but I wanted to mention those figures because I find the
data compelling. That’s 64 minutes a day for a long, sharp life. And
dare I repeat myself, those minutes can be spent in a moderately-paced
stroll.</p>
<p>Weightlifting is important, but not enough on its own. Pumping iron
does confer cognitive benefits, as some studies show among older people
who just lifted weights for a year. But to gain the most benefits, and
which most studies prove, you have to get aerobic through activities
like jogging, swimming, bicycling, dancing, hiking, or brisk walking at
least five days a week for at least twenty minutes.</p>
<p>I hope the evidence I’ve provided in this chapter will motivate you
to get moving more often if you don’t already maintain an exercise
routine. I’ll ask that you make an effort during the program to focus on
this important area of your life and start a regular workout if you
don’t already have one. Rethink those priorities. And if you are active,
then you can work on increasing the duration and intensity of your
workouts or try something new. It is all a part of becoming physically
stronger and mentally sharper.</p>
