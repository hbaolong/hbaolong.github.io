<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>
<p>The scientists who wake up every morning with the belief that
diseases are not preordained, that memory loss need not accompany aging,
and that everyone can make their brains better inspired me to write this
book. Over nearly two decades, I would speak to these scientists at the
big brain meetings, in their laboratories and in their homes. They would
share their scientific findings but also let me in on the deeply
personal reasons they had chosen to study the brain in the first place.
They convinced me not only that we would one day make diseases like
dementia a thing of the past, but that even a healthy brain could be
improved and made more resilient. Thank you for your candor and your
willingness to help take some of the most remarkable new knowledge about
the brain and make it relevant for anyone, anywhere.</p>
<p>Priscilla Painton, executive editor is your title but it does not
nearly begin to describe the role you have played in this book. From the
beginning, your vision was clear and your collaboration far exceeded my
expectations. Your remarks and notes were always spot-on, and always
added great value. You have an ability to see around corners and
anticipate the direction of the book. I have been fortunate to have such
a dedicated and professional team working on Keep Sharp, and we have
also become a family along the way. Richard Rhorer, Julia Prosser,
Elizabeth Gay, Elise Ringo, Yvette Grant, Carly Loman, Jackie Seow, Lisa
Erwin, Marie Florio, Hana Park, and finally Megan Hogan, who now holds a
land speed record on returning emails, and always with a smile. Thanks
to all of you.</p>
<p>Jonathan Karp, you are the definition of a gentleman and a scholar. I
knew after the first meeting in your office, when we discussed
everything from stem cells to Springsteen, that I was dealing with
someone truly engaged with the world. Thanks for believing in me and
this book.</p>
<p>Bob Barnett is a world-famous lawyer. He has represented presidents
and the pope. Yet you would never know it. He is so incredibly humble
and hardworking. One of the best days in my life was the day Bob Barnett
agreed to help me with my career. His guidance has been remarkably
prescient and insightful.</p>
<p>The collaboration I have had with my partner and friend, Kristin
Loberg, has been truly speical. We should all be lucky enough to have a
real mind meld with someone like Kristin, who immediately understood
what I was trying to convey and always helped me get there. She is the
very best at what she does, and quite simply, this book would not have
been possible without her.</p>
<p>About the Author</p>
<p>Sanjay Gupta fell in love with the brain as a young boy in middle
school. He later went on to spend four years earning a medical degree
and then seven years completing residency training so he could become a
neurosurgeon—a practice he has been enjoying for the last twenty-some
years. The brain is his first and truest love.</p>
<p>Dr. Gupta is a three-time New York Times bestselling author and
serves as the chief medical correspondent for CNN. Since 2001, Gupta has
covered the biggest health headlines of our time—often telling the
harrowing and touching stories of brave first responders, and reporting
from the front lines of nearly every conflict, natural disaster, and
disease outbreak anywhere in the world. He has hosted several long-form
documentaries based on deep investigations, including his Weed series
and One Nation Under Stress for HBO. For his work, he has achieved
multiple Emmy and Peabody awards, as well as the DuPont award—the
broadcast equivalent of the Pulitzer. To write his nonfiction books,
Chasing Life and Cheating Death, Gupta gathered stories by traveling the
world looking at long-lived cultures and societies pushing back the
boundaries of death.</p>
<p>Gupta is widely regarded as one of the most trusted reporters in the
media. In addition to his accolades in journalism, Gupta is the
recipient of several honorary degrees and has been recognized with many
humanitarian awards for his care of people injured in wars and natural
disasters. Forbes magazine named him one of the ten most influential
celebrities. In 2019, Gupta was elected to the National Academy of
Medicine, one of the highest honors in the medical field.</p>
<p>Gupta lives in Atlanta where he is also an associate professor of
neurosurgery at Emory University Hospital and associate chief of
neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital. He serves as a diplomate of the
American Board of Neurosurgery. Sanjay is married to Rebecca, who, after
reading this, reminded him that she was in fact his truest love. He
wisely conceded this point. They have three teen and preteen daughters,
who find it hilarious their father is writing a book about memory. As
they put it, the Gupta Girls believe their father “literally can’t
remember anything.”</p>
