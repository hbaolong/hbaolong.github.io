<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>Like any intellectual, Hari Seldon had made use of the Galactic
Library freely. For the most part, it had been done long-distance
through computer, but occasionally he had visited it, more to get away
from the pressures of the Psychohistory Project than for any other
purpose. And, for the past couple of years, since he had first
formulated his plan to find others like Wanda, he had kept a private
office there, so he could have ready access to any of the Library’s vast
collection of data. He had even rented a small apartment in an adjacent
sector under the dome so that he would be able to walk to the Library
when his ever-increasing research there prevented him from returning to
the Streeling Sector.</p>
<p>Now, however, his plan had taken on new dimensions and he wanted to
meet Las Zenow. It was the first time he had ever met him
face-to-face.</p>
<p>It was not easy to arrange a personal interview with the Chief
Librarian of the Galactic Library. His own perception of the nature and
value of his office was high and it was frequently said that when the
Emperor wished to consult the Chief Librarian, even he had to visit the
Library himself and wait his turn.</p>
<p>Seldon, however, had no trouble. Zenow knew him well, though he had
never seen Hari Seldon in person. “An honor, First Minister,” he said in
greeting.</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “I trust you know that I have not held that post in
sixteen years.”</p>
<p>“The honor of the title is still yours. Besides, sir, you were also
instrumental in ridding us of the brutal rule of the junta. The junta,
on a number of occasions, violated the sacred rule of the neutrality of
the Library.”</p>
<p>(Ah, thought Seldon, that accounts for the readiness with which he
saw me.)</p>
<p>“Merely rumor,” he said aloud.</p>
<p>“And now, tell me,” said Zenow, who could not resist a quick look at
the time band on his wrist, “what can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“Chief Librarian,” began Seldon, “I have not come to ask anything
easy of you. What I want is more space at the Library. I want permission
to bring in a number of my associates. I want permission to undertake a
long and elaborate program of the greatest importance.”</p>
<p>Las Zenow’s face drew into an expression of distress. “You ask a
great deal. Can you explain the importance of all this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Empire is in the process of disintegration.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Then Zenow said, “I have heard of your
research into psychohistory. I have been told that your new science
bears the promise of predicting the future. Is it psychohistorical
predictions of which you are speaking?”</p>
<p>“No. I have not yet reached the point in psychohistory where I can
speak of the future with certainty. But you don’t need psychohistory to
know that the Empire is disintegrating. You can see the evidence
yourself.”</p>
<p>Zenow sighed. “My work here consumes me utterly, Professor Seldon. I
am a child when it comes to political and social matters.”</p>
<p>“You may, if you wish, consult the information contained in the
Library. Why look around this very office—it is chock-full of every
conceivable sort of information from throughout the entire Galactic
Empire.”</p>
<p>“I’m the last to keep up with it all, I’m afraid,” Zenow said,
smiling sadly. “You know the old proverb: The shoemaker’s child has no
shoes. It seems to me, though, that the Empire is restored. We have an
Emperor again.”</p>
<p>“In name only, Chief Librarian. In most of the outlying provinces,
the Emperor’s name is mentioned ritualistically now and then, but he
plays no role in what they do. The Outer Worlds control their own
programs and, more important, they control the local armed forces, which
are outside the grip of the Emperor’s authority. If the Emperor were to
try to exert his authority anywhere outside the Inner Worlds, he would
fail. I doubt that it will take more than twenty years, at the outside,
before some of the Outer Worlds declare their independence.”</p>
<p>Zenow sighed again. “If you are right, we live in worse times than
the Empire has ever seen. But what has this to do with your desire for
more office space and additional staff here in the Library?”</p>
<p>“If the Empire falls apart, the Galactic Library may not escape the
general carnage.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but it must,” said Zenow earnestly. “There have been bad times
before and it has always been understood that the Galactic Library on
Trantor, as the repository of all human knowledge, must remain
inviolate. And so it will be in the future.”</p>
<p>“It may not be. You said yourself that the junta violated its
neutrality.”</p>
<p>“Not seriously.”</p>
<p>“It might be more serious next time and we can’t allow this
repository of all human knowledge to be damaged.”</p>
<p>“How will your increased presence here prevent that?”</p>
<p>“It won’t. But the project I am interested in will. I want to create
a great Encyclopedia, containing within it all the knowledge humanity
will need to rebuild itself in case the worst happens—an Encyclopedia
Galactica, if you will. We don’t need everything the Library has. Much
of it is trivial. The provincial libraries scattered over the Galaxy may
themselves be destroyed and, if not, all but the most local data is
obtained by computerized connection with the Galactic Library in any
case. What I intend, then, is something that is entirely independent and
that contains, in as concise a form as possible, the essential
information humanity needs.”</p>
<p>“And if it, too, is destroyed?”</p>
<p>“I hope it will not be. It is my intention to find a world far away
on the outskirts of the Galaxy, one where I can transfer my
Encyclopedists and where they can work in peace. Until such a place is
found, however, I want the nucleus of the group to work here and to use
the Library facilities to decide what will be needed for the
project.”</p>
<p>Zenow grimaced. “I see your point, Professor Seldon, but I’m not sure
that it can be done.”</p>
<p>“Why not, Chief Librarian?”</p>
<p>“Because being Chief Librarian does not make me an absolute monarch.
I have a rather large Board—a kind of legislature—and please don’t think
that I can just push your Encyclopedia Project through.”</p>
<p>“I’m astonished.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be. I am not a popular Chief Librarian. The Board has been
fighting, for some years now, for limited access to the Library. I have
resisted. It galls them that I have afforded you your small office
space.”</p>
<p>“Limited access?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. The idea is that if anyone needs information, he or she
must communicate with a Librarian and the Librarian will get the
information for the person. The Board does not wish people to enter the
Library freely and deal with the computers themselves. They say that the
expense required to keep the computers and other Library equipment in
shape is becoming prohibitive.”</p>
<p>“But that’s impossible. There’s a millennial tradition of an open
Galactic Library.”</p>
<p>“So there is, but in recent years, appropriations to the Library have
been cut several times and we simply don’t have the funds we used to
have. It is becoming very difficult to keep our equipment up to the
mark.”</p>
<p>Seldon rubbed his chin. “But if your appropriations are going down, I
imagine you have to cut salaries and fire people—or, at least, not hire
new ones.”</p>
<p>“You are exactly right.”</p>
<p>“In which case, how will you manage to place new labors on a
shrinking work force by asking your people to obtain all the information
that the public will request?”</p>
<p>“The idea is that we won’t find all the information that the public
will request but only those pieces of information that we consider
important.”</p>
<p>“So that not only will you abandon the open Library but also the
complete Library?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that any Librarian would want this.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know Gennaro Mummery, Professor Seldon.” At Seldon’s blank
look, Zenow continued. “ ‘Who is he?’ you wonder. The leader of that
portion of the Board that wishes to close off the Library. More and more
of the Board are on his side. If I let you and your colleagues into the
Library as an independent force, a number of Board members who may not
be on Mummery’s side but who are dead set against any control of any
part of the Library except by Librarians may decide to vote with him.
And in that case, I will be forced to resign as Chief Librarian.”</p>
<p>“See here,” said Seldon with sudden energy. “All this business of
possibly closing down the Library, of making it less accessible, of
refusing all information—all this business of declining
appropriations—all this is itself a sign of Imperial disintegration.
Don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>“If you put it that way, you may be right.”</p>
<p>“Then let me talk to the Board. Let me explain what the future may
hold and what I wish to do. Perhaps I can persuade them, as I hope I’ve
persuaded you.”</p>
<p>Zenow thought for a moment. “I’m willing to let you try, but you must
know in advance that your plan may not work.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to take that chance. Please do whatever has to be done and
let me know when and where I can meet the Board.”</p>
<p>Seldon left Zenow in a mood of unease. Everything he had told the
Chief Librarian was true—and trivial. The real reason he needed the use
of the Library remained hidden.</p>
<p>Partly this was because he didn’t yet see that use clearly
himself.</p>
