<h4 id="section">34</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili left the University grounds at 0300.
Seldon realized that Dors had to be the leader. She knew Trantor better
than he did—two years better. She was obviously a close friend of Hummin
(how close? the question kept nagging at him) and she understood his
instructions.</p>
<p>Both she and Seldon were swathed in light swirling cloaks with
tight-fitting hoods. The style had been a short-lived clothing fad at
the University (and among young intellectuals, generally) some years
back and though right now it might provoke laughter, it had the saving
grace of covering them well and of making them unrecognizable—at least
at a cursory glance.</p>
<p>Hummin had said, “There’s a possibility that the event Upperside was
completely innocent and that there are no agents after you, Seldon, but
let’s be prepared for the worst.”</p>
<p>Seldon had asked anxiously, “Won’t you come with us?”</p>
<p>“I would like to,” said Hummin, “but I must limit my absence from
work if I am not to become a target myself. You understand?”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. He understood.</p>
<p>They entered an Expressway car and found a seat as far as possible
from the few who had already boarded. (Seldon wondered why anyone should
be on the Expressways at three in the morning—and then thought that it
was lucky some were or he and Dors would be entirely too
conspicuous.)</p>
<p>Seldon fell to watching the endless panorama that passed in review as
the equally endless line of coaches moved along the endless monorail on
an endless electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>The Expressway passed row upon row of dwelling units, few of them
very tall, but some, for all he knew, very deep. Still, if tens of
millions of square kilometers formed an urbanized total, even forty
billion people would not require very tall structures or very closely
packed ones. They did pass open areas, in most of which crops seemed to
be growing—but some of which were clearly parklike. And there were
numerous structures whose nature he couldn’t guess. Factories? Office
buildings? Who knew? One large featureless cylinder struck him as though
it might be a water tank. After all, Trantor had to have a fresh water
supply. Did they sluice rain from Upperside, filter and treat it, then
store it? It seemed inevitable that they should.</p>
<p>Seldon did not have very long to study the view, however.</p>
<p>Dors muttered, “This is about where we should be getting off.” She
stood up and her strong fingers gripped his arm.</p>
<p>They were off the Expressway now, standing on solid flooring while
Dors studied the directional signs.</p>
<p>The signs were unobtrusive and there were many of them. Seldon’s
heart sank. Most of them were in pictographs and initials, which were
undoubtedly understandable to native Trantorians, but which were alien
to him.</p>
<p>“This way,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“Which way? How do you know?”</p>
<p>“See that? Two wings and an arrow.”</p>
<p>“Two wings? Oh.” He had thought of it as an upside-down “w,” wide and
shallow, but he could see where it might be the stylized wings of a
bird.</p>
<p>“Why don’t they use words?” he said sullenly.</p>
<p>“Because words vary from world to world. What an ‘air-jet’ is here
could be a ‘soar’ on Cinna or a ‘swoop’ on other worlds. The two wings
and an arrow are a Galactic symbol for an air vessel and the symbol is
understood everywhere. —Don’t you use them on Helicon?”</p>
<p>“Not much. Helicon is a fairly homogeneous world, culturally
speaking, and we tend to cling to our private ways firmly because we’re
overshadowed by our neighbors.”</p>
<p>“See?” said Dors. “There’s where your psychohistory might come in.
You could show that even with different dialects the use of set symbols,
Galaxy-wide, is a unifying force.”</p>
<p>“That won’t help.” He was following her through empty dim alley ways
and part of his mind wondered what the crime rate might be on Trantor
and whether this was a high-crime area. “You can have a billion rules,
each covering a single phenomenon, and you can derive no generalizations
from that. That’s what one means when one says that a system might be
interpreted only by a model as complex as itself. —Dors, are we heading
for an air-jet?”</p>
<p>She stopped and turned to look at him with an amused frown. “If we’re
following the symbols for air-jets, do you suppose we’re trying to reach
a golf course? —Are you afraid of air-jets in the way so many
Trantorians are?”</p>
<p>“No no. We fly freely on Helicon and I make use of air-jets
frequently. It’s just that when Hummin took me to the University, he
avoided commercial air travel because he thought we would leave too
clear a trail.”</p>
<p>“That’s because they knew where you were to begin with, Hari, and
were after you already. Right now, it may be that they don’t know where
you are and we’re using an obscure port and a private air-jet.”</p>
<p>“And who’ll be doing the flying?”</p>
<p>“A friend of Hummin’s, I presume.”</p>
<p>“Can he be trusted, do you suppose?”</p>
<p>“If he’s a friend of Hummin’s, he surely can.”</p>
<p>“You certainly think highly of Hummin,” said Seldon with a twinge of
discontent.</p>
<p>“With reason,” said Dors with no attempt at coyness. “He’s the
best.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s discontent did not dwindle.</p>
<p>“There’s the air-jet,” she said.</p>
<p>It was a small one with oddly shaped wings. Standing beside it was a
small man, dressed in the usual glaring Trantorian colors.</p>
<p>Dors said, “We’re psycho.”</p>
<p>The pilot said, “And I’m history.”</p>
<p>They followed him into the air-jet and Seldon said, “Whose idea were
the passwords?”</p>
<p>“Hummin’s,” said Dors.</p>
<p>Seldon snorted. “Somehow I didn’t think Hummin would have a sense of
humor. He’s so solemn.”</p>
<p>Dors smiled.</p>
<p>SUNMASTER FOURTEEN—… A leader of the Mycogen Sector of ancient
Trantor … As is true of all the leaders of this ingrown sector, little
is known of him. That he plays any role at all in history is due
entirely to his interrelationship with Hari Seldon in the course of The
Flight …</p>
