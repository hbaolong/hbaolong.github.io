<p>FACING THE PACK</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The Far Star came to rest at the bottom of a small rise, a hill in
the generally flat countryside. Almost without thought, Trevize had
taken it for granted that it would be best for the ship not to be
visible for miles in every direction.</p>
<p>He said, “The temperature outside is 24 C., the wind is about eleven
kilometers per hour from the west, and it is partly cloudly. The
computer does not know enough about the general air circulation to be
able to predict the weather. However, since the humidity is some forty
percent, it seems scarcely about to rain. On the whole, we seem to have
chosen a comfortable latitude or season of the year, and after
Comporellon that’s a pleasure.”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” said Pelorat, “that as the planet continues to
unterraform, the weather will become more extreme.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure of that,” said Bliss.</p>
<p>“Be as sure as you like,” said Trevize. “We have thousands of years
of leeway. Right now, it’s still a pleasant planet and will continue to
be so for our lifetimes and far beyond.”</p>
<p>He was clasping a broad belt about his waist as he spoke, and Bliss
said sharply, “What’s that, Trevize?”</p>
<p>“Just my old navy training,” said Trevize. “I’m not going into an
unknown world unarmed.”</p>
<p>“Are you seriously intending to carry weapons?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Here on my right”—he slapped a holster that contained a
massive weapon with a broad muzzle—“is my blaster, and here on my
left”—a smaller weapon with a thin muzzle that contained no opening—“is
my neuronic whip.”</p>
<p>“Two varieties of murder,” said Bliss, with distaste.</p>
<p>“Only one. The blaster kills. The neuronic whip doesn’t. It just
stimulates the pain nerves, and it hurts so that you can wish you were
dead, I’m told. Fortunately, I’ve never been at the wrong end of
one.”</p>
<p>“Why are you taking them?”</p>
<p>“I told you. It’s an enemy world.”</p>
<p>“Trevize, it’s an empty world.”</p>
<p>“Is it? There’s no technological society, it would seem, but what if
there are post-technological primitives. They may not possess anything
worse than clubs or rocks, but those can kill, too.”</p>
<p>Bliss looked exasperated, but lowered her voice in an effort to be
reasonable. “I detect no human neuronic activity, Trevize. That
eliminates primitives of any type, post-technological or otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Then I won’t have to use my weapons,” said Trevize. “Still, what
harm would there be in carrying them? They’ll just make me a little
heavier, and since the gravitational pull at the surface is about
ninety-one percent that of Terminus, I can afford the weight. —Listen,
the ship may be unarmed as a ship, but it has a reasonable supply of
hand-weapons. I suggest that you two also—”</p>
<p>“No,” said Bliss at once. “I will not make even a gesture in the
direction of killing—or of inflicting pain, either.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a question of killing, but of avoiding being killed, if you
see what I mean.”</p>
<p>“I can protect myself in my own way.”</p>
<p>“Janov?”</p>
<p>Pelorat hesitated. “We didn’t have arms on Comporellon.”</p>
<p>“Come, Janov, Comporellon was a known quantity, a world associated
with the Foundation. Besides we were at once taken into custody. If we
had had weapons, they would have been taken away. Do you want a
blaster?”</p>
<p>Pelorat shook his head. “I’ve never been in the Navy, old chap. I
wouldn’t know how to use one of those things and, in an emergency, I
would never think of it in time. I’d just run and—and get killed.”</p>
<p>“You won’t get killed, Pel,” said Bliss energetically. “Gaia has you
in my/our/its protection, and that posturing naval hero as well.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Good. I have no objection to being protected, but I am
not posturing. I am simply making assurance doubly sure, and if I never
have to make a move toward these things, I’ll be completely pleased, I
promise you. Still I must have them.”</p>
<p>He patted both weapons affectionately and said, “Now let’s step out
on this world which may not have felt the weight of human beings upon
its surface for thousands of years.”</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>“I have a feeling,” said Pelorat, “that it must be rather late in the
day, but the sun is high enough to make it near noon, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“I suspect,” said Trevize, looking about the quiet panorama, “that
your feeling originates out of the sun’s orange tint, which gives it a
sunset feel. If we’re still here at actual sunset and the cloud
formations are proper, we ought to experience a deeper red than we’re
used to. I don’t know whether you’ll find it beautiful or depressing.
—For that matter it was probably even more extreme on Comporellon, but
there we were indoors virtually all the time.”</p>
<p>He turned slowly, considering the surroundings in all directions. In
addition to the almost subliminal oddness of the light, there was the
distinctive smell of the world—or this section of it. It seemed a little
musty, but far from actively unpleasant.</p>
<p>The trees nearby were of middling height, and looked old, with
gnarled bark and trunks a little off the vertical, though because of a
prevailing wind or something off-color about the soil he couldn’t tell.
Was it the trees that lent a somehow menacing ambience to the world or
was it something else—less material?</p>
<p>Bliss said, “What do you intend to do, Trevize? Surely we didn’t come
all this distance to enjoy the view?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Actually, perhaps that ought to be my part of it just
now. I would suggest that Janov explore this place. There are ruins off
in that direction and he’s the one who can judge the value of any
records he might find. I imagine he can understand writings or films in
archaic Galactic and I know quite well I wouldn’t. And I suppose, Bliss,
you want to go with him in order to protect him. As for me, I will stay
here as a guard on the outer rim.”</p>
<p>“A guard against what? Primitives with rocks and clubs?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” And then the smile that had hovered about his lips faded
and he said, “Oddly enough, Bliss, I’m a little uneasy about this place.
I can’t say why.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Come, Bliss. I’ve been a home-body collector of old
tales all my life, so I’ve never actually put my hands on ancient
documents. Just imagine if we could find—”</p>
<p>Trevize watched them walk away, Pelorat’s voice fading as he walked
eagerly toward the ruins, Bliss swinging along at his side.</p>
<p>Trevize listened absently and then turned back to continue his study
of the surroundings. What could there be to rouse apprehension?</p>
<p>He had never actually set foot upon a world without a human
population, but he had viewed many from space. Usually, they were small
worlds, not large enough to hold either water or air, but they had been
useful as marking a meeting site during naval maneuvers (there had been
no war in his lifetime, or for a century before his birth—but maneuvers
went on), or as an exercise in simulated emergency repairs. Ships he had
been on had been in orbit about such worlds, or had even rested on them,
but he had never had occasion to step off the ships at those times.</p>
<p>Was it that he was now actually standing on an empty world? Would he
have felt the same if he had been standing on one of the many small,
airless worlds he had encountered in his student days—and even
since?</p>
<p>He shook his head. It wouldn’t have bothered him. He was sure of
that. He would have been in a space suit, as he had been innumerable
times when he was free of his ship in space. It was a familiar situation
and contact with a mere lump of rock would have produced no alteration
in the familiarity. Surely!</p>
<p>Of course— He was not wearing a space suit now.</p>
<p>He was standing on a habitable world, as comfortable to the feel as
Terminus would be—far more comfortable than Comporellon had been. He
experienced the wind against his cheek, the warmth of the sun on his
back, the rustle of vegetation in his ears. Everything was familiar,
except that there were no human beings on it—at least, not any
longer.</p>
<p>Was that it? Was it that that made the world seem so eerie? Was it
that it was not merely an uninhabited world, but a deserted one?</p>
<p>He had never been on a deserted world before; never heard of a
deserted world before; never thought a world could be deserted. All the
worlds he had known of till now, once they had been populated by human
beings, remained so populated forever.</p>
<p>He looked up toward the sky. Nothing else had deserted it. An
occasional bird flew across his line of vision, seeming more natural,
somehow, than the slate-blue sky between the orange-tinted fair-weather
clouds. (Trevize was certain that, given a few days on the planet, he
would become accustomed to the off-color so that sky and clouds would
grow to seem normal to him.)</p>
<p>He heard birdsongs from the trees, and the softer noise of insects.
Bliss had mentioned butterflies earlier and here they were—in surprising
numbers and in several colorful varieties.</p>
<p>There were also occasional rustlings in the clumps of grass that
surrounded the trees, but he could not quite make out what was causing
them.</p>
<p>Nor did the obvious presence of life in his vicinity rouse fear in
him. As Bliss had said, terraformed worlds had, from the very first,
lacked dangerous animals. The fairy tales of childhood, and the heroic
fantasies of his teenage years were invariably set on a legendary world
that must have been derived from the vague myths of Earth. The
hyperdrama holoscreen had been filled with monsters—lions, unicorns,
dragons, whales, brontosaurs, bears. There were dozens of them with
names he could not remember; some of them surely mythical, and perhaps
all of them. There were smaller animals that bit and stung, even plants
that were fearful to the touch—but only in fiction. He had once heard
that primitive honeybees were able to sting, but certainly no real bees
were in any way harmful.</p>
<p>Slowly, he walked to the right, skirting the border of the hill. The
grass was tall and rank, but sparse, growing in clumps. He made his way
among the trees, also growing in clumps.</p>
<p>Then he yawned. Certainly, nothing exciting was happening, and he
wondered if he might not retreat to the ship and take a nap. No,
unthinkable. Clearly, he had to stand on guard.</p>
<p>Perhaps he ought to do sentry duty—marching, one, two, one two,
swinging about with a snap and performing complicated maneuverings with
a parade electro-rod. (It was a weapon no warrior had used in three
centuries, but it was still absolutely essential at drill, for no reason
anyone could ever advance.)</p>
<p>He grinned at the thought of it, then wondered if he ought to join
Pelorat and Bliss in the ruins. Why? What good would he do?</p>
<p>Suppose he saw something that Pelorat had happened to overlook?
—Well, time enough to make the attempt after Pelorat returned. If there
was anything that might be found easily, by all means let Pelorat make
the discovery.</p>
<p>Might the two be in trouble? Foolish! What possible kind of
trouble?</p>
<p>And if there were trouble, they would call out.</p>
<p>He stopped to listen. He heard nothing.</p>
<p>And then the irresistible thought of sentry duty recurred to him and
he found himself marching, feet moving up and down with a stamp, an
imaginary electro-rod coming off one shoulder, whirling, and being held
out straight before him, exactly vertical—whirling again, end over end,
and back over the other shoulder. Then, with a smart about-face, he was
looking toward the ship (rather far-off now) once more.</p>
<p>And when he did that, he froze in reality, and not in sentry
make-believe.</p>
<p>He was not alone.</p>
<p>Until then, he had not seen any living creature other than plant
growth, insects, and an occasional bird. He had neither seen nor heard
anything approach—but now an animal stood between him and the ship.</p>
<p>Sheer surprise at the unexpected event deprived him, for a moment, of
the ability to interpret what he saw. It was not till after a
perceptible interval that he knew what he was looking at.</p>
<p>It was only a dog.</p>
<p>Trevize was not a dog person. He had never owned a dog and he felt no
surge of friendliness toward one when he encountered it. He felt no such
surge this time, either. He thought, rather impatiently, that there was
no world on which these creatures had not accompanied men. They existed
in countless varieties and Trevize had long had the weary impression
that each world had at least one variety characteristic of itself.
Nevertheless, all varieties were constant in this: whether they were
kept for entertainment, show, or some form of useful work—they were bred
to love and trust human beings.</p>
<p>It was a love and trust Trevize had never appreciated. He had once
lived with a woman who had had a dog. That dog, whom Trevize tolerated
for the sake of the woman, conceived a deep-seated adoration for him,
followed him about, leaned against him when relaxing (all fifty pounds
of him), covered him with saliva and hair at unexpected moments, and
squatted outside the door and moaned whenever he and the woman were
trying to engage in sex.</p>
<p>From that experience, Trevize had emerged with the firm conviction
that for some reason known only to the canine mind and its
odor-analyzing ability, he was a fixed object of doggish devotion.</p>
<p>Therefore, once the initial surprise was over, he surveyed the dog
without concern. It was a large dog, lean and rangy, and with long legs.
It was staring at him with no obvious sign of adoration. Its mouth was
open in what might have been taken as a welcoming grin, but the teeth
displayed were somehow large and dangerous, and Trevize decided that he
would be more comfortable without the dog in his line of view.</p>
<p>It occurred to him, then, that the dog had never seen a human being,
and that countless canine generations preceding had never seen one. The
dog might have been as astonished and uncertain at the sudden appearance
of a human being as Trevize had been at that of the dog. Trevize, at
least, had quickly recognized the dog for what it was, but the dog did
not have that advantage. It was still puzzled, and perhaps alarmed.</p>
<p>Clearly, it would not be safe to leave an animal that large, and with
such teeth, in an alarmed state. Trevize realized that it would be
necessary to establish a friendship at once.</p>
<p>Very slowly, he approached the dog (no sudden motions, of course). He
held out his hand, ready to allow it to be sniffed, and made soft,
soothing sounds, most of which consisted of “Nice doggy”—something he
found intensely embarrassing.</p>
<p>The dog, eyes fixed on Trevize, backed away a step or two, as though
in distrust, and then its upper lip wrinkled into a snarl and from its
mouth there issued a rasping growl. Although Trevize had never seen a
dog behave so, there was no way of interpreting the action as
representing anything but menace.</p>
<p>Trevize therefore stopped advancing and froze. His eyes caught motion
to one side, and his head turned slowly. There were two other dogs
advancing from that direction. They looked just as deadly as the
first.</p>
<p>Deadly? That adjective occurred to him only now, and its dreadful
appropriateness was unmistakable.</p>
<p>His heart was suddenly pounding. The way to the ship was blocked. He
could not run aimlessly, for those long canine legs would reach him in
yards. If he stood his ground and used his blaster, then while he killed
one, the other two would be upon him. Off in the distance, he could see
other dogs approaching. Was there some way in which they communicated?
Did they hunt in packs?</p>
<p>Slowly, he shifted ground leftward, in a direction in which there
were no dogs—as yet. Slowly. Slowly.</p>
<p>The dogs shifted ground with him. He felt certain that all that saved
him from instant attack was the fact that the dogs had never seen or
smelled anything like himself before. They had no established behavior
pattern they could follow in his case.</p>
<p>If he ran, of course, that would represent something familiar to the
dogs. They would know what to do if something the size of Trevize showed
fear and ran. They would run, too. Faster.</p>
<p>Trevize kept sidling toward a tree. He had the wildest desire to move
upward where the dogs could not follow. They moved with him, snarling
softly, coming closer. All three had their eyes fixed unwinkingly upon
him. Two more were joining them and, farther off, Trevize could see
still other dogs approaching. At some point, when he was close enough,
he would have to make the dash. He could not wait too long, or run too
soon. Either might be fatal.</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>He probably set a personal record for acceleration and even so it was
a near thing. He felt the snap of jaws close on the heel of one foot,
and for just a moment he was held fast before the teeth slid off the
tough ceramoid.</p>
<p>He was not skilled at climbing trees. He had not climbed one since he
was ten and, as he recalled, that had been a clumsy effort. In this
case, though, the trunk was not quite vertical, and the bark was gnarled
and offered handholds. What was more, he was driven by necessity, and it
is remarkable what one can do if the need is great enough.</p>
<p>Trevize found himself sitting in a crotch, perhaps ten meters above
the ground. For the moment he was totally unaware that he had scraped
one hand and that it was oozing blood. At the base of the tree, five
dogs now sat on their haunches, staring upward, tongues lolling, all
looking patiently expectant.</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<ol start="37" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Trevize was not in a position to think about the situation in logical
detail. Rather, he experienced flashes of thought in odd and distorted
sequence which, if he had eventually sorted them out, would have come to
this—</p>
<p>Bliss had earlier maintained that in terraforming a planet, human
beings would establish an unbalanced economy, which they would be able
to keep from falling apart only by unending effort. For instance, no
Settlers had ever brought with them any of the large predators. Small
ones could not be helped. Insects, parasites—even small hawks, shrews,
and so on.</p>
<p>Those dramatic animals of legend and vague literary accounts—tigers,
grizzly bears, orcs, crocodiles? Who would carry them from world to
world even if there were sense to it? And where would there be sense to
it?</p>
<p>It meant that human beings were the only large predators, and it was
up to them to cull those plants and animals that, left to themselves,
would smother in their own overplenty.</p>
<p>And if human beings somehow vanished, then other predators must take
their place. But what predators? The most sizable predators tolerated by
human beings were dogs and cats, tamed and living on human bounty.</p>
<p>What if no human beings remained to feed them? They must then find
their own food—for their survival and, in all truth, for the survival of
those they preyed on, whose numbers had to be kept in check lest
overpopulation do a hundred times the damage that predations would
do.</p>
<p>So dogs would multiply, in their variations, with the large ones
attacking the large, untended herbivores; the smaller ones preying on
birds and rodents. Cats would prey by night as dogs did by day; the
former singly, the latter in packs.</p>
<p>And perhaps evolution would eventually produce more varieties, to
fill additional environmental niches. Would some dogs eventually develop
sea-going characteristics to enable them to live on fish; and would some
cats develop gliding abilities to hunt the clumsier birds in the air as
well as on the ground?</p>
<p>In flashes, all this came to Trevize while he struggled with more
systematic thought to tell him what he might do.</p>
<p>The number of dogs kept growing. He counted twenty-three now
surrounding the tree and there were others approaching. How large was
the pack? What did it matter? It was large enough already.</p>
<p>He withdrew his blaster from its holster, but the solid feel of the
butt in his hand did not give him the sense of security he would have
liked. When had he last inserted an energy unit into it and how many
charges could he fire? Surely not twenty-three.</p>
<p>What about Pelorat and Bliss? If they emerged, would the dogs turn on
them? Were they safe even if they did not emerge? If the dogs sensed the
presence of two human beings inside the ruins, what could stop them from
attacking them there? Surely there would be no doors or barriers to hold
them off.</p>
<p>Could Bliss stop them, and even drive them away? Could she
concentrate her powers through hyperspace to the desired pitch of
intensity? For how long could she maintain them?</p>
<p>Should he call for help then? Would they come running if he yelled,
and would the dogs flee under Bliss’s glare? (Would it take a glare or
was it simply a mental action undetectable to onlookers without the
ability?) Or, if they appeared, would they then be torn apart under the
eyes of Trevize, who would be forced to watch, helplessly, from the
relative safety of his post in the tree?</p>
<p>No, he would have to use his blaster. If he could kill one dog and
frighten them off for just a while, he could scramble down the tree,
yell for Pelorat and Bliss, kill a second dog if they showed signs of
returning, and all three could then hustle into the ship.</p>
<p>He adjusted the intensity of the microwave beam to the three-quarter
mark. That should be ample to kill a dog with a loud report. The report
would serve to frighten the dogs away, and he would be conserving
energy.</p>
<p>He aimed carefully at a dog in the middle of the pack, one who seemed
(in Trevize’s own imagination, at least) to exude a greater malignancy
than the rest—perhaps only because he sat more quietly and, therefore,
seemed more cold-bloodedly intent on his prey. The dog was staring
directly at the weapon now, as though it scorned the worst Trevize could
do.</p>
<p>It occurred to Trevize that he had never himself fired a blaster at a
human being, or seen anyone else do it. There had been firing at
water-filled dummies of leather and plastic during training; with the
water almost instantaneously heated to the boiling point, and shredding
the covering as it exploded.</p>
<p>But who, in the absence of war, would fire at a human being? And what
human being would withstand a blaster and force its use? Only here, on a
world made pathological by the disappearance of human beings—</p>
<p>With that odd ability of the brain to note something utterly beside
the point, Trevize was aware of the fact that a cloud had hidden the
sun—and then he fired.</p>
<p>There was an odd shimmer of the atmosphere on a straight line from
the muzzle of the blaster to the dog; a vague sparkle that might have
gone unnoticed if the sun were still shining unhindered.</p>
<p>The dog must have felt the initial surge of heat, and made the
smallest motion as though it were about to leap. And then it exploded,
as a portion of its blood and cellular contents vaporized.</p>
<p>The explosion made a disappointingly small noise, for the dog’s
integument was simply not as tough as that of the dummies they had
practiced on. Flesh, skin, blood, and bone were scattered, however, and
Trevize felt his stomach heave.</p>
<p>The dogs started back, some having been bombarded with uncomfortably
warm fragments. That was only a momentary hesitation, however. They
crowded against each other suddenly, in order to eat what had been
provided. Trevize felt his sickness increase. He was not frightening
them; he was feeding them. At that rate, they would never leave. In
fact, the smell of fresh blood and warm meat would attract still more
dogs, and perhaps other smaller predators as well.</p>
<p>A voice called out, “Trevize. What—”</p>
<p>Trevize looked outward. Bliss and Pelorat had emerged from the ruins.
Bliss had stopped short, her arms thrown out to keep Pelorat back. She
stared at the dogs. The situation was obvious and clear. She had to ask
nothing.</p>
<p>Trevize shouted, “I tried to drive them off without involving you and
Janov. Can you hold them off?”</p>
<p>“Barely,” said Bliss, not shouting, so that Trevize had trouble
hearing her even though the dogs’ snarling had quieted as though a
soothing sound-absorbent blanket had been thrown over them.</p>
<p>Bliss said, “There are too many of them, and I am not familiar with
their pattern of neuronic activity. We have no such savage things on
Gaia.”</p>
<p>“Or on Terminus. Or on any civilized world,” shouted Trevize. “I’ll
shoot as many of them as I can and you try to handle the rest. A smaller
number will give you less trouble.”</p>
<p>“No, Trevize. Shooting them will just attract others. —Stay behind
me, Pel. There’s no way you can protect me. —Trevize, your other
weapon.”</p>
<p>“The neuronic whip?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That produces pain. Low power. Low power!”</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of hurting them?” called out Trevize in anger. “Is
this a time to consider the sacredness of life?”</p>
<p>“I’m considering Pel’s. Also mine. Do as I say. Low power, and shoot
at one of the dogs. I can’t hold them much longer.”</p>
<p>The dogs had drifted away from the tree and had surrounded Bliss and
Pelorat, who stood with their backs to a crumbling wall. The dogs
nearest the two made hesitant attempts to come closer still, whining a
bit as though trying to puzzle out what it was that held them off when
they could sense nothing that would do it. Some tried uselessly to
scramble up the wall and attack from behind.</p>
<p>Trevize’s hand was trembling as he adjusted the neuronic whip to low
power. The neuronic whip used much less energy than the blaster did, and
a single power-cartridge could produce hundreds of whip-like strokes
but, come to think of it, he didn’t remember when he had last charged
this weapon, either.</p>
<p>It was not so important to aim the whip. Since conserving energy was
not as critical, he could use it in a sweep across the mass of dogs.
That was the traditional method of controlling crowds that showed signs
of turning dangerous.</p>
<p>However, he followed Bliss’s suggestion. He aimed at one dog and
fired. The dog fell over, its legs twitching. It emitted loud,
high-pitched squeals.</p>
<p>The other dogs backed away from the stricken beast, ears flattening
backward against their heads. Then, squealing in their turn, they turned
and left, at first slowly, then more rapidly, and finally, at a full
race. The dog who had been hit, scrambled painfully to its legs, and
limped away whimpering, much the last of them.</p>
<p>The noise vanished in the distance, and Bliss said, “We had better
get into the ship. They will come back. Or others will.”</p>
<p>Trevize thought that never before had he manipulated the ship’s entry
mechanism so rapidly. And it was possible he might never do so
again.</p>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Night had fallen before Trevize felt something approaching the
normal. The small patch of syntho-skin on the scrape on his hand had
soothed the physical pain, but there was a scrape on his psyche for
which soothing was not so easy.</p>
<p>It was not the mere exposure to danger. He could react to that as
well as any ordinarily brave person might. It was the totally
unlooked-for direction from which the danger had come. It was the
feeling of the ridiculous. How would it look if people were to find out
he had been treed by snarling dogs? It would scarcely be worse if he had
been put to flight by the whirring of angry canaries.</p>
<p>For hours, he kept listening for a new attack on the part of the
dogs, for the sound of howls, for the scratch of claws against the outer
hull.</p>
<p>Pelorat, by comparison, seemed quite cool. “There was no question in
my mind, old chap, that Bliss would handle it, but I must say you fired
the weapon well.”</p>
<p>Trevize shrugged. He was in no mood to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Pelorat was holding his library—the one compact disc on which his
lifetime of research into myths and legends were stored—and with it he
retreated into his bedroom where he kept his small reader.</p>
<p>He seemed quite pleased with himself. Trevize noticed that but didn’t
follow it up. Time for that later when his mind wasn’t quite as taken up
with dogs.</p>
<p>Bliss said, rather tentatively, when the two were alone, “I presume
you were taken by surprise.”</p>
<p>“Quite,” said Trevize gloomily. “Who would think that at the sight of
a dog—a dog—I should run for my life.”</p>
<p>“Twenty thousand years without men and it would not be quite a dog.
Those beasts must now be the dominant large predators.”</p>
<p>Trevize nodded. “I figured that out while I was sitting on the tree
branch being a dominated prey. You were certainly right about an
unbalanced ecology.”</p>
<p>“Unbalanced, certainly, from the human standpoint—but considering how
efficiently the dogs seem to be going about their business, I wonder if
Pel may be right in his suggestion that the ecology could balance
itself, with various environmental niches being filled by evolving
variations of the relatively few species that were once brought to the
world.”</p>
<p>“Oddly enough,” said Trevize, “the same thought occurred to me.”</p>
<p>“Provided, of course, the unbalance is not so great that the process
of righting itself takes too long. The planet might become completely
nonviable before that.”</p>
<p>Trevize grunted.</p>
<p>Bliss looked at him thoughtfully, “How is it that you thought of
arming yourself?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “It did me little good. It was your ability—”</p>
<p>“Not entirely. I needed your weapon. At short notice, with only
hyperspatial contact with the rest of Gaia, with so many individual
minds of so unfamiliar a nature, I could have done nothing without your
neuronic whip.”</p>
<p>“My blaster was useless. I tried that.”</p>
<p>“With a blaster, Trevize, a dog merely disappears. The rest may be
surprised, but not frightened.”</p>
<p>“Worse than that,” said Trevize. “They ate the remnants. I was
bribing them to stay.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I see that might be the effect. The neuronic whip is different.
It inflicts pain, and a dog in pain emits cries of a kind that are well
understood by other dogs who, by conditioned reflex, if nothing else,
begin to feel frightened themselves. With the dogs already disposed
toward fright, I merely nudged their minds, and off they went.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you realized the whip was the more deadly of the two in
this case. I did not.”</p>
<p>“I am accustomed to dealing with minds. You are not. That’s why I
insisted on low power and aiming at one dog. I did not want so much pain
that it killed a dog and left him silent. I did not want the pain so
dispersed as to cause mere whimpering. I wanted strong pain concentrated
at one point.”</p>
<p>“And you got it, Bliss,” said Trevize. “It worked perfectly. I owe
you considerable gratitude.”</p>
<p>“You begrudge that,” said Bliss thoughtfully, “because it seems to
you that you played a ridiculous role. And yet, I repeat, I could have
done nothing without your weapons. What puzzles me is how you can
explain your arming yourself in the face of my assurance that there were
no human beings on this world, something I am still certain is a fact.
Did you foresee the dogs?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Trevize. “I certainly didn’t. Not consciously, at least.
And I don’t habitually go armed, either. It never even occurred to me to
put on weapons at Comporellon. —But I can’t allow myself to trip into
the trap of feeling it was magic, either. It couldn’t have been. I
suspect that once we began talking about unbalanced ecologies earlier, I
somehow had an unconscious glimpse of animals grown dangerous in the
absence of human beings. That is clear enough in hindsight, but I might
have had a whiff of it in foresight. Nothing more than that.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Don’t dismiss it that casually. I participated in the
same conversation concerning unbalanced ecologies and I didn’t have that
same foresight. It is that special trick of foresight in you that Gaia
values. I can see, too, that it must be irritating to you to have a
hidden foresight the nature of which you cannot detect; to act with
decision, but without clear reason.”</p>
<p>“The usual expression on Terminus is ‘to act on a hunch.’”</p>
<p>“On Gaia we say, ‘to know without thought.’ You don’t like knowing
without thought, do you?”</p>
<p>“It bothers me, yes. I don’t like being driven by hunches. I assume
the hunch has reason behind it, but not knowing the reason makes me feel
I’m not in control of my own mind—a kind of mild madness.”</p>
<p>“And when you decided in favor of Gaia and Galaxia, you were acting
on a hunch, and now you seek the reason.”</p>
<p>“I have said so at least a dozen times.”</p>
<p>“And I have refused to accept your statement as literal truth. For
that I am sorry. I will oppose you in this no longer. I hope, though,
that I may continue to point out items in Gaia’s favor.”</p>
<p>“Always,” said Trevize, “if you, in turn, recognize that I may not
accept them.”</p>
<p>“Does it occur to you, then, that this Unknown World is reverting to
a kind of savagery, and perhaps to eventual desolation and
uninhabitability, because of the removal of a single species that is
capable of acting as a guiding intelligence? If the world were Gaia, or
better yet, a part of Galaxia, this could not happen. The guiding
intelligence would still exist in the form of the Galaxy as a whole, and
ecology, whenever unbalanced, and for whatever reason, would move toward
balance again.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean that dogs would no longer eat?”</p>
<p>“Of course they would eat, just as human beings do. They would eat,
however, with purpose, in order to balance the ecology under deliberate
direction, and not as a result of random circumstance.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “The loss of individual freedom might not matter to
dogs, but it must matter to human beings. —And what if all human beings
were removed from existence, everywhere, and not merely on one world or
on several? What if Galaxia were left without human beings at all? Would
there still be a guiding intelligence? Would all other life forms and
inanimate matter be able to put together a common intelligence adequate
for the purpose?”</p>
<p>Bliss hesitated. “Such a situation,” she said, “has never been
experienced. Nor does there seem any likelihood that it will ever be
experienced in the future.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “But doesn’t it seem obvious to you, that the human
mind is qualitatively different from everything else, and that if it
were absent, the sum total of all other consciousness could not replace
it. Would it not be true, then, that human beings are a special case and
must be treated as such? They should not be fused even with one another,
let alone with nonhuman objects.”</p>
<p>“Yet you decided in favor of Galaxia.”</p>
<p>“For an overriding reason I cannot make out.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that overriding reason was a glimpse of the effect of
unbalanced ecologies? Might it not have been your reasoning that every
world in the Galaxy is on a knife-edge, with instability on either side,
and that only Galaxia could prevent such disasters as are taking place
on this world—to say nothing of the continuing interhuman disasters of
war and administrative failure.”</p>
<p>“No. Unbalanced ecologies were not in my mind at the time of my
decision.”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure?”</p>
<p>“I may not know what it is I’m foreseeing, but if something is
suggested afterward, I would recognize it if that were indeed what I
foresaw. —As it seems to me I may have foreseen dangerous animals on
this world.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Bliss soberly, “we might have been dead as a result of
those dangerous animals if it had not been for a combination of our
powers, your foresight and my mentalism. Come, then, let us be
friends.”</p>
<p>Trevize nodded. “If you wish.”</p>
<p>There was a chill in his voice that caused Bliss’s eyebrows to rise,
but at this point Pelorat burst in, nodding his head as though prepared
to shake it off its foundations.</p>
<p>“I think,” he said, “we have it.”</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Trevize did not, in general, believe in easy victories, and yet it
was only human to fall into belief against one’s better judgment. He
felt the muscles in his chest and throat tighten, but managed to say,
“The location of Earth? Have you discovered that, Janov?”</p>
<p>Pelorat stared at Trevize for a moment, and deflated. “Well, no,” he
said, visibly abashed. “Not quite that. —Actually, Golan, not that at
all. I had forgotten about that. It was something else that I discovered
in the ruins. I suppose it’s not really important.”</p>
<p>Trevize managed a long breath and said, “Never mind, Janov. Every
finding is important. What was it you came in to say?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Pelorat, “it’s just that almost nothing survived, you
understand. Twenty thousand years of storm and wind don’t leave much.
What’s more, plant life is gradually destructive and animal life— But
never mind all that. The point is that ‘almost nothing’ is not the same
as ‘nothing.’</p>
<p>“The ruins must have included a public building, for there was some
fallen stone, or concrete, with incised lettering upon it. There was
hardly anything visible, you understand, old chap, but I took
photographs with one of those cameras we have on board ship, the kind
with built-in computer enhancement—I never got round to asking
permission to take one, Golan, but it was important, and I—”</p>
<p>Trevize waved his hand in impatient dismissal. “Go on!”</p>
<p>“I could make out some of the lettering, which was very archaic. Even
with computer enhancement and with my own fair skill at reading Archaic,
it was impossible to make out much except for one short phrase. The
letters there were larger and a bit clearer than the rest. They may have
been incised more deeply because they identified the world itself. The
phrase reads, ‘Planet Aurora,’ so I imagine this world we rest upon is
named Aurora, or was named Aurora.”</p>
<p>“It had to be named something,” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“Yes, but names are very rarely chosen at random. I made a careful
search of my library just now and there are two old legends, from two
widely spaced worlds, as it happens, so that one can reasonably suppose
them to be of independent origin, if one remembers that. —But never mind
that. In both legends, Aurora is used as a name for the dawn. We can
suppose that Aurora may have actually meant dawn in some pre-Galactic
language.</p>
<p>“As it happens, some word for dawn or daybreak is often used as a
name for space stations or other structures that are the first built of
their kind. If this world is called Dawn in whatever language, it may be
the first of its kind, too.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Are you getting ready to suggest that this planet is
Earth and that Aurora is an alternate name for it because it represents
the dawn of life and of man?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I couldn’t go that far, Golan.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, with a trace of bitterness, “There is, after all, no
radioactive surface, no giant satellite, no gas giant with huge
rings.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. But Deniador, back on Comporellon, seemed to think this was
one of the worlds that was once inhabited by the first wave of
Settlers—the Spacers. If it were, then its name, Aurora, might indicate
it to have been the first of those Spacer worlds. We might, at this very
moment, be resting on the oldest human world in the Galaxy except for
Earth itself. Isn’t that exciting?”</p>
<p>“Interesting, at any rate, Janov, but isn’t that a great deal to
infer merely from the name, Aurora?”</p>
<p>“There’s more,” said Pelorat excitedly. “As far as I could check in
my records there is no world in the Galaxy today with the name of
‘Aurora,’ and I’m sure your computer will verify that. As I said, there
are all sorts of world and other objects named ‘Dawn’ in various ways,
but no one uses the actual word ‘Aurora.’”</p>
<p>“Why should they? If it’s a pre-Galactic word, it wouldn’t be likely
to be popular.”</p>
<p>“But names do remain, even when they’re meaningless. If this were the
first settled world, it would be famous; it might even, for a while,
have been the dominant world of the Galaxy. Surely, there would be other
worlds calling themselves ‘New Aurora,’ or ‘Aurora Minor,’ or something
like that. And then others—”</p>
<p>Trevize broke in. “Perhaps it wasn’t the first settled world. Perhaps
it was never of any importance.”</p>
<p>“There’s a better reason in my opinion, my dear chap.”</p>
<p>“What would that be, Janov?”</p>
<p>“If the first wave of settlements was overtaken by a second wave to
which all the worlds of the Galaxy now belong—as Deniador said—then
there is very likely to have been a period of hostility between the two
waves. The second wave—making up the worlds that now exist—would not use
the names given to any of the worlds of the first wave. In that way, we
can infer from the fact that the name ‘Aurora’ has never been repeated
that there were two waves of Settlers, and that this is a world of the
first wave.”</p>
<p>Trevize smiled. “I’m getting a glimpse of how you mythologists work,
Janov. You build a beautiful superstructure, but it may be standing on
air. The legends tell us that the Settlers of the first wave were
accompanied by numerous robots, and that these were supposed to be their
undoing. Now if we could find a robot on this world, I’d be willing to
accept all this first-wave supposition, but we can’t expect after twenty
thou—”</p>
<p>Pelorat, whose mouth had been working, managed to find his voice.
“But, Golan, haven’t I told you? —No, of course I haven’t. I’m so
excited I can’t put things in the right order. There was a robot.”</p>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Trevize rubbed his forehead, almost as though he were in pain. He
said, “A robot? There was a robot?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Pelorat, nodding his head emphatically.</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Why, it was a robot. How could I fail to know one if I see one?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen a robot before?”</p>
<p>“No, but it was a metal object that looked like a human being. Head,
arms, legs, torso. Of course, when I say metal, it was mostly rust, and
when I walked toward it, I suppose the vibration of my tread damaged it
further, so that when I reached to touch it—”</p>
<p>“Why should you touch it?”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose I couldn’t quite believe my eyes. It was an
automatic response. As soon as I touched it, it crumbled. But—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Before it quite did, its eyes seemed to glow very faintly and it
made a sound as though it were trying to say something.”</p>
<p>“You mean it was still functioning?”</p>
<p>“Just barely, Golan. Then it collapsed.”</p>
<p>Trevize turned to Bliss. “Do you corroborate all this, Bliss?”</p>
<p>“It was a robot, and we saw it,” said Bliss.</p>
<p>“And was it still functioning?”</p>
<p>Bliss said tonelessly, “As it crumbled, I caught a faint sense of
neuronic activity.”</p>
<p>“How can there have been neuronic activity? A robot doesn’t have an
organic brain built of cells.”</p>
<p>“It has the computerized equivalent, I imagine,” said Bliss, “and I
would detect that.”</p>
<p>“Did you detect a robotic rather than a human mentality?”</p>
<p>Bliss pursed her lips and said, “It was too feeble to decide anything
about it except that it was there.”</p>
<p>Trevize looked at Bliss, then at Pelorat, and said, in a tone of
exasperation, “This changes everything.”</p>
