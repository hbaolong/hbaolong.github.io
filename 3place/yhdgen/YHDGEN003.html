<h4 id="section">2</h4>
<p>The ship landed in a medley of noises. There was the far-off hiss of
the atmosphere cutting and sliding past the metal of the ship. There was
the steady drone of the conditioners fighting the heat of friction, and
the slower rumble of the engines enforcing deceleration. There was the
human sound of men and women gathering in the debarkation rooms and the
grind of the hoists lifting baggage, mail, and freight to the long axis
of the ship, from which they would be later moved along to the unloading
platform.</p>
<p>Gaal felt the slight jar that indicated the ship no longer had an
independent motion of its own. Ship’s gravity had been giving way to
planetary gravity for hours. Thousands of passengers had been sitting
patiently in the debarkation rooms which swung easily on yielding
force-fields to accommodate its orientation to the changing direction of
the gravitational forces. Now they were crawling down curving ramps to
the large, yawning locks.</p>
<p>Gaal’s baggage was minor. He stood at a desk, as it was quickly and
expertly taken apart and put together again. His visa was inspected and
stamped. He himself paid no attention.</p>
<p>This was Trantor! The air seemed a little thicker here, the gravity a
bit greater, than on his home planet of Synnax, but he would get used to
that. He wondered if he would get used to immensity.</p>
<p>Debarkation Building was tremendous. The roof was almost lost in the
heights. Gaal could almost imagine that clouds could form beneath its
immensity. He could see no opposite wall; just men and desks and
converging floor till it faded out in haze.</p>
<p>The man at the desk was speaking again. He sounded annoyed. He said,
“Move on, Dornick.” He had to open the visa, look again, before he
remembered the name.</p>
<p>Gaal said, “Where—where—”</p>
<p>The man at the desk jerked a thumb, “Taxis to the right and third
left.”</p>
<p>Gaal moved, seeing the glowing twists of air suspended high in
nothingness and reading, “TAXIS TO ALL POINTS.”</p>
<p>A figure detached itself from anonymity and stopped at the desk, as
Gaal left. The man at the desk looked up and nodded briefly. The figure
nodded in return and followed the young immigrant.</p>
<p>He was in time to hear Gaal’s destination.</p>
<p>Gaal found himself hard against a railing.</p>
<p>The small sign said, “Supervisor.” The man to whom the sign referred
did not look up. He said, “Where to?”</p>
<p>Gaal wasn’t sure, but even a few seconds hesitation meant men queuing
in line behind him.</p>
<p>The Supervisor looked up, “Where to?”</p>
<p>Gaal’s funds were low, but there was only this one night and then he
would have a job. He tried to sound nonchalant: “A good hotel,
please.”</p>
<p>The Supervisor was unimpressed. “They’re all good. Name one.”</p>
<p>Gaal said, desperately, “The nearest one, please.”</p>
<p>The Supervisor touched a button. A thin line of light formed along
the floor, twisting among others which brightened and dimmed in
different colors and shades. A ticket was shoved into Gaal’s hands. It
glowed faintly.</p>
<p>The Supervisor said, “One point twelve.”</p>
<p>Gaal fumbled for the coins. He said, “Where do I go?”</p>
<p>“Follow the light. The ticket will keep glowing as long as you’re
pointed in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Gaal looked up and began walking. There were hundreds creeping across
the vast floor, following their individual trails, sifting and straining
themselves through intersection points to arrive at their respective
destinations.</p>
<p>His own trail ended. A man in glaring blue and yellow uniform,
shining and new in unstainable plastotextile, reached for his two
bags.</p>
<p>“Direct line to the Luxor,” he said.</p>
<p>The man who followed Gaal heard that. He also heard Gaal say, “Fine,”
and watched him enter the blunt-nosed vehicle.</p>
<p>The taxi lifted straight up. Gaal stared out the curved, transparent
window, marvelling at the sensation of airflight within an enclosed
structure and clutching instinctively at the back of the driver’s seat.
The vastness contracted and the people became ants in random
distribution. The scene contracted further and began to slide
backward.</p>
<p>There was a wall ahead. It began high in the air and extended upward
out of sight. It was riddled with holes that were the mouths of tunnels.
Gaal’s taxi moved toward one, then plunged into it. For a moment, Gaal
wondered idly how his driver could pick out one among so many.</p>
<p>There was now only blackness, with nothing but the past-flashing of a
colored signal light to relieve the gloom. The air was full of a rushing
sound.</p>
<p>Gaal leaned forward against deceleration then and the taxi popped out
of the tunnel and descended to ground-level once more.</p>
<p>“The Luxor Hotel,” said the driver, unnecessarily. He helped Gaal
with his baggage, accepted a tenth-credit tip with a businesslike air,
picked up a waiting passenger, and was rising again.</p>
<p>In all this, from the moment of debarkation, there had been no
glimpse of sky.</p>
<p>TRANTOR— … At the beginning of the thirteenth millennium, this
tendency reached its climax. As the center of the Imperial Government
for unbroken hundreds of generations and located, as it was, toward the
central regions of the Galaxy among the most densely populated and
industrially advanced worlds of the system, it could scarcely help being
the densest and richest clot of humanity the Race had ever seen.</p>
<p>Its urbanization, progressing steadily, had finally reached the
ultimate. All the land surface of Trantor, 75,000,000 square miles in
extent, was a single city. The population, at its height, was well in
excess of forty billions. This enormous population was devoted almost
entirely to the administrative necessities of Empire, and found
themselves all too few for the complications of the task. (It is to be
remembered that the impossibility of proper administration of the
Galactic Empire under the uninspired leadership of the later Emperors
was a considerable factor in the Fall.) Daily, fleets of ships in the
tens of thousands brought the produce of twenty agricultural worlds to
the dinner tables of Trantor.…</p>
<p>Its dependence upon the outer worlds for food and, indeed, for all
necessities of life, made Trantor increasingly vulnerable to conquest by
siege. In the last millennium of the Empire, the monotonously numerous
revolts made Emperor after Emperor conscious of this, and Imperial
policy became little more than the protection of Trantor’s delicate
jugular vein.…</p>
