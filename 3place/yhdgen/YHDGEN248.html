<h4 id="section">16</h4>
<p>Raych was listening with an agonized impatience that he was trying
not to show. He was sitting in an improvised cell, deep in the warrens
of Billibotton, having been accompanied through alleys he no longer
remembered. (He, who in the old days could have threaded those same
alleys unerringly and lost any pursuer.) The man with him, clad in the
green of the Joranumite Guard, was either a missionary, a brainwasher,
or a kind of theologian-manqué. At any rate, he had announced his name
to be Sander Nee and he was delivering a long message in a thick Dahlite
accent that he had clearly learned by heart.</p>
<p>“If the people of Dahl want to enjoy equality, they must show
themselves worthy of it. Good rule, quiet behavior, seemly pleasures are
all requirements. Aggressiveness and the bearing of knives are the
accusations others make against us to justify their intolerance. We must
be clean in word and—”</p>
<p>Raych broke in. “I agree with you, Guardsman Nee, every word. —But I
must see Mr. Joranum.”</p>
<p>Slowly the guardsman shook his head. “You can’t ’less you got some
appointment, some permission.”</p>
<p>“Look, I’m the son of an important professor at Streeling University,
a mathematics professor.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know no professor. —I thought you said you was from Dahl.”</p>
<p>“Of course I am. Can’t you tell the way I talk?”</p>
<p>“And you got an old man who’s a professor at a big University? That
don’t sound likely.”</p>
<p>“Well, he’s my foster father.”</p>
<p>The guardsman absorbed that and shook his head. “You know anyone in
Dahl?”</p>
<p>“There’s Mother Rittah. She’ll know me.” (She had been very old when
she had known him. She might be senile by now—or dead.) “Never heard of
her.”</p>
<p>(Who else? He had never known anyone likely to penetrate the dim
consciousness of this man facing him. His best friend had been another
youngster named Smoodgie—or at least that was the only name he knew him
by. Even in his desperation, Raych could not see himself saying: “Do you
know someone my age named Smoodgie?”) Finally he said, “There’s Yugo
Amaryl.”</p>
<p>A dim spark seemed to light Nee’s eyes. “Who?”</p>
<p>“Yugo Amaryl,” said Raych eagerly. “He works for my foster father at
the University.”</p>
<p>“He a Dahlite, too? Everyone at the University Dahlites?”</p>
<p>“Just he and I. He was a heatsinker.”</p>
<p>“What’s he doing at the University?”</p>
<p>“My father took him out of the heatsinks eight years ago.”</p>
<p>“Well— I’ll send someone.”</p>
<p>Raych had to wait. Even if he escaped, where would he go in the
intricate alleyways of Billibotton without being picked up
instantly?</p>
<p>Twenty minutes passed before Nee returned with the corporal who had
arrested Raych in the first place. Raych felt a little hope; the
corporal, at least, might conceivably have some brains.</p>
<p>The corporal said, “Who is this Dahlite you know?”</p>
<p>“Yugo Amaryl, Corporal, a heatsinker who my father found here in Dahl
eight years ago and took to Streeling University with him.”</p>
<p>“Why did he do that?”</p>
<p>“My father thought Yugo could do more important things than heatsink,
Corporal.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Mathematics. He—”</p>
<p>The corporal held up his hand. “What heatsink did he work in?”</p>
<p>Raych thought for a moment. “I was only a kid then, but it was at
C-2, I think.”</p>
<p>“Close enough. C-3.”</p>
<p>“Then you know about him, Corporal?”</p>
<p>“Not personally, but the story is famous in the heatsinks and I’ve
worked there, too. And maybe that’s how you’ve heard of it. Have you any
evidence that you really know Yugo Amaryl?”</p>
<p>“Look. Let me tell you what I’d like to do. I’m going to write down
my name on a piece of paper and my father’s name. Then I’m going to
write down one word. Get in touch—any way you want—with some official in
Mr. Joranum’s group—Mr. Joranum will be here in Dahl tomorrow—and just
read him my name, my father’s name, and the one word. If nothing
happens, then I’ll stay here till I rot, I suppose, but I don’t think
that will happen. In fact, I’m sure that they will get me out of here in
three seconds and that you’ll get a promotion for passing along the
information. If you refuse to do this, when they find out I am here—and
they will—you will be in the deepest possible trouble. After all, if you
know that Yugo Amaryl went off with a big-shot mathematician, just tell
yourself that same big-shot mathematician is my father. His name is Hari
Seldon.”</p>
<p>The corporal’s face showed clearly that the name was not unknown to
him.</p>
<p>He said, “What’s the one word you’re going to write down?”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory.”</p>
<p>The corporal frowned. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. Just pass it along and see what happens.”</p>
<p>The corporal handed him a small sheet of paper, torn out of a
notebook. “All right. Write it down and we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>Raych realized that he was trembling. He wanted very much to know
what would happen. It depended entirely on who it was that the corporal
would talk to and what magic the word would carry with it.</p>
