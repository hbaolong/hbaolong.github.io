<h4 id="section">26</h4>
<p>“Order! I will have order!” bellowed Judge Tejan Popjens Lih. The
public hearing of Professor Raven Seldon and his young associate,
Stettin Palver, had generated a hue and cry among the populace of
Trantor. Here was the man who had predicted the Fall of the Empire, the
decay of civilization, who exhorted others to harken back to the golden
age of civility and order—here was he who, according to an eyewitness,
had ordered the brutal beating of three young Trantorians for no
apparent provocation. Ah yes, it promised to be a spectacular hearing,
one which would lead, no doubt, to an even more spectacular trial.</p>
<p>The judge pressed a contact set into a recessed panel on her bench
and a sonorous gong resounded through the packed courtroom. “I will have
order,” she repeated to the now-hushed throng. “If need be, the
courtroom will be cleared. That is a warning. It will not be
repeated.”</p>
<p>The judge cut an imposing figure in her scarlet robe. Originally from
the Outer World of Lystena, Lih’s complexion had a slight bluish cast,
which turned darker when she became exercised, practically purple when
she was really angry. It was rumored that, for all her years on the
bench, in spite of her reputation as a top judicial mind,
notwithstanding her position as one of the most revered interpreters of
Imperial law, Lih was ever so slightly vain about the colorful
appearance she gave, the way in which the bright red robes set off her
soft turquoise skin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lih had a reputation for coming down hard on those who
brooked Imperial law; she was one of the few judges left who upheld the
civil code without wavering.</p>
<p>“I have heard of you, Professor Seldon, and your theories about our
imminent destruction. And I have spoken with the magistrate who recently
heard another case in which you were involved, one in which you struck a
man with your lead-filled cane. In that instance, too, you claimed to be
the victim of assault. Your reasoning stemmed, I believe, from a
previous unreported incident in which you and your son allegedly were
assaulted by eight hoodlums. You were able to convince my esteemed
colleague, Professor Seldon, of your plea of self-defense, even though
an eyewitness testified otherwise. This time, Professor, you will have
to be much more convincing.”</p>
<p>The three hoodlums who were bringing charges against Seldon and
Palver snickered in their seats at the plaintiff’s table. They presented
a much different appearance today than they had the evening of the
attack. The young men were sporting clean loose-fitting unisuits; the
young lady was wearing a crisply pleated tunic. All in all, if one
didn’t look (or listen) too closely, the three presented a reassuring
picture of Trantorian youth.</p>
<p>Seldon’s lawyer, Civ Novker (who was representing Palver as well),
approached the bench. “Your Honor, my client is an upstanding member of
the Trantorian community. He is a former First Minister of stellar
repute. He is a personal acquaintance of our Emperor Agis XIV. What
possible benefit could Professor Seldon derive from attacking innocent
young people? He is one of the most vocal proponents of stimulating the
intellectual creativity of Trantorian youth—his Psychohistory Project
employs numerous student volunteers; he is a beloved member of the
Streeling University faculty.</p>
<p>“Further—” Here Novker paused, sweeping his gaze around the packed
courtroom, as if to say, Wait till you hear this—you’ll be ashamed that
you ever for a second doubted the veracity of my client’s claims,
“Professor Seldon is one of the very few private individuals officially
allied with the prestigious Galactic Library. He has been granted
unlimited use of Library facilities for work on what he calls the
Encyclopedia Galactica, a veritable paean to Imperial civilization.</p>
<p>“I ask you, how can this man even be questioned in such a
matter?”</p>
<p>With a flourish of his arm, Novker gestured toward Seldon, who was
sitting at the defendant’s table with Stettin Palver, looking decidedly
uncomfortable. Hari’s cheeks were flushed from the unaccustomed praise
(after all, lately his name was the subject of derisive snickers rather
than flowery plaudits) and his hand shook slightly on the carved handle
of his trusty cane.</p>
<p>Judge Lih gazed down at Seldon, clearly unimpressed. “What benefit,
indeed, Counselor. I have been asking myself that very question. I’ve
lain awake these past nights, racking my brains for a plausible reason.
Why would a man of Professor Seldon’s stature commit unprovoked assault
and battery when he himself is one of our most outspoken critics of the
so-called ‘breakdown’ of civil order?</p>
<p>“And then it dawned on me. Perhaps, in his frustration at not being
believed, Professor Seldon feels he must prove to the worlds that his
predictions of doom and gloom really are coming to pass. After all, here
is a man who has spent his entire career foretelling the Fall of the
Empire and all he can really point to are a few burned-out bulbs in the
dome, an occasional glitch in public transport, a budget cut here or
there—nothing very dramatic. But an attack—or two or three—now, that
would be something.”</p>
<p>Lih sat back and folded her hands in front of her, a satisfied
expression on her face. Seldon stood, leaning heavily on the table for
support. With great effort, he approached the bench, waving off his
lawyer, walking headlong into the steely gaze of the judge.</p>
<p>“Your Honor, please permit me to say a few words in my defense.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Professor Seldon. After all, this is not a trial, only a
hearing to air all allegations, facts, and theories pertinent to the
case before deciding whether or not to go ahead with a trial. I have
merely expressed a theory; I am most interested to hear what you have to
say.”</p>
<p>Seldon cleared his throat before beginning. “I have devoted my life
to the Empire. I have faithfully served the Emperors. My science of
psychohistory, rather than being a harbinger of destruction, is intended
to be used as an agent for rejuvenation. With it we can be prepared for
whatever course civilization takes. If, as I believe, the Empire
continues to break down, psychohistory will help us put into place
building blocks for a new and better civilization founded on all that is
good from the old. I love our worlds, our peoples, our Empire—what would
it behoove me to contribute to the lawlessness that saps its strength
daily?</p>
<p>“I can say no more. You must believe me. I, a man of intellect, of
equations, of science—I am speaking from my heart.” Seldon turned and
made his way slowly back to his chair beside Palver. Before sitting, his
eyes sought Wanda, sitting in the spectators’ gallery. She smiled wanly
and winked at him.</p>
<p>“From the heart or not, Professor Seldon, this decision will require
much thought on my part. We have heard from your accusers; we have heard
from you and Mr. Palver. There is one more party whose testimony I need.
I’d like to hear from Rial Nevas, who has come forward as an eyewitness
to this incident.”</p>
<p>As Nevas approached the bench, Seldon and Palver looked at each other
in alarm. It was the boy whom Hari had admonished just before the
attack.</p>
<p>Lih was asking the youth a question. “Would you describe, Mr. Nevas,
exactly what you witnessed on the night in question?”</p>
<p>“Well,” started Nevas, fixing Seldon with his sullen stare, “I was
walkin’ along, mindin’ my own business, when I saw those two,”—he turned
and pointed at Seldon and Palver—“on the other side of the walkway,
comin’ toward me. And then I saw those three kids.” (Another point of
the finger, this time toward the three sitting at the plaintiff’s
table.) “The two older guys were walkin’ behind the kids. They didn’t
see me, though, on account of I was on the other side of the walkway and
besides, they were concentratin’ on their victims. Then wham! Just like
that, that old guy swings at ’em with his stick, then the younger guy
jumps ’em and kicks ’em and before you know it, they’re all down on the
ground. Then the old guy and his pal, they just took off, just like
that. I couldn’t believe it.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lie!” Seldon exploded. “Young man, you’re playing with our
lives here!” Nevas only stared back at Seldon impassively.</p>
<p>“Judge,” Seldon implored, “can’t you see that he is lying? I remember
this fellow. I scolded him for littering just minutes before we were
attacked. I pointed it out to Stettin as another instance of the
breakdown of our society, the apathy of the citizenry, the—”</p>
<p>“Enough, Professor Seldon,” commanded the judge. “Another outburst
like that and I will have you ejected from this courtroom. Now,
Mr. Nevas,” she said, turning back to the witness. “What did you do
throughout the sequence of events you just described?”</p>
<p>“I, uh, I hid. Behind some trees. I hid. I was afraid they’d come
after me if they saw me, so I hid. And when they were gone, well, I ran
and called the security officers.”</p>
<p>Nevas had started to sweat and he inserted a finger into the
constricting collar of his unisuit. He fidgeted, shifting his weight
from one foot to the other as he stood on the raised speaker’s platform.
He was uncomfortably aware of the crowd’s eyes upon him; he tried to
avoid looking into the audience, but each time he did, he found himself
drawn to the steady gaze of a pretty blond girl sitting in the first
row. It was as if she was asking him a question, pressing him for an
answer, willing him to speak.</p>
<p>“Mr. Nevas, what do you have to say about Professor Seldon’s
allegation that he and Mr. Palver did see you prior to the attack, that
the professor actually exchanged words with you?”</p>
<p>“Well, uh, no, you see, it was just like I said … I was walkin’ along
and—” And now Nevas looked over at Seldon’s table. Seldon looked at the
young man sadly, as if he realized all was lost. But Seldon’s companion,
Stettin Palver, turned a fierce gaze on Nevas and Nevas jumped,
startled, at the words he heard: Tell the truth! It was as if Palver had
spoken, but Palver’s lips hadn’t moved. And then, confused, Nevas
snapped his head in the direction of the blond girl; he thought he heard
her speak—Tell the truth!—but her lips were still as well.</p>
<p>“Mr. Nevas, Mr. Nevas,” the judge’s voice broke in on the youth’s
jumbled thoughts. “Mr. Nevas, if Professor Seldon and Mr. Palver were
walking toward you, behind the three plaintiffs, how is it that you
noticed Seldon and Palver first? That is how you put it in your
statement, is it not?”</p>
<p>Nevas glanced around the courtroom wildly. He couldn’t seem to escape
the eyes, all the eyes screaming at him to Tell the truth! Looking over
at Hari Seldon, Rial Nevas said simply, “I’m sorry” and, to the
amazement of the entire courtroom assemblage, the fourteen-year-old boy
started to cry.</p>
