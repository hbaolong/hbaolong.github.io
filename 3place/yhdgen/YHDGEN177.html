<h4 id="section">39</h4>
<p>The next morning found Hari using the calling device again. He was
angry because, for one thing, he was hungry.</p>
<p>His attempt to reach Sunmaster Fourteen was deflected by someone who
insisted that Sunmaster could not be disturbed.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Seldon had asked waspishly.</p>
<p>“Obviously, there is no need to answer that question,” came back a
cold voice.</p>
<p>“We were not brought here to be prisoners,” said Seldon with equal
coldness. “Nor to starve.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have a kitchen and ample supplies of food.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we do,” said Seldon. “And I do not know how to use the kitchen
devices, nor do I know how to prepare the food. Do you eat it raw, fry
it, boil it, roast it …?”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you are ignorant in such matters.”</p>
<p>Dors, who had been pacing up and down during this colloquy, reached
for the device and Seldon fended her off, whispering, “He’ll break the
connection if a woman tries to speak to him.”</p>
<p>Then, into the device, he said more firmly than ever, “What you
believe or don’t believe doesn’t matter to me in the least. You send
someone here—someone who can do something about our situation—or when I
reach Sunmaster Fourteen, as I will eventually, you will pay for
this.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was two hours before someone arrived (by which time
Seldon was in a state of savagery and Dors had grown rather desperate in
her attempt to soothe him).</p>
<p>The newcomer was a young man whose bald pate was slightly freckled
and who probably would have been a redhead otherwise.</p>
<p>He was bearing several pots and he seemed about to explain them when
he suddenly looked uneasy and turned his back on Seldon in alarm.
“Tribesman,” he said, obviously agitated. “Your skincap is not well
adjusted.”</p>
<p>Seldon, whose impatience had reached the breaking point, said, “That
doesn’t bother me.”</p>
<p>Dors, however, said, “Let me adjust it, Hari. It’s just a bit too
high here on the left side.”</p>
<p>Seldon then growled, “You can turn now, young man. What is your
name?”</p>
<p>“I am Gray cloud Five,” said the Mycogenian uncertainly as he turned
and looked cautiously at Seldon. “I am a novitiate. I have brought a
meal for you.” He hesitated. “From my own kitchen, where my woman
prepared it, tribesman.”</p>
<p>He put the pots down on the table and Seldon raised one lid and
sniffed the contents suspiciously. He looked up at Dors in surprise.
“You know, it doesn’t smell bad.”</p>
<p>Dors nodded. “You’re right. I can smell it too.”</p>
<p>Graycloud said, “It’s not as hot as it ought to be. It cooled off in
transport. You must have crockery and cutlery in your kitchen.”</p>
<p>Dors got what was needed, and after they had eaten, largely and a bit
greedily, Seldon felt civilized once more.</p>
<p>Dors, who realized that the young man would feel unhappy at being
alone with a woman and even unhappier if she spoke to him, found that,
by default, it fell to her to carry the pots and dishes into the kitchen
and wash them—once she deciphered the controls of the washing
device.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Seldon asked the local time and said, somewhat abashed,
“You mean it’s the middle of the night?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, tribesman,” said Graycloud. “That’s why it took a while to
satisfy your need.”</p>
<p>Seldon understood suddenly why Sunmaster could not be disturbed and
thought of Graycloud’s woman having to be awakened to prepare him a meal
and felt his conscience gnaw at him. “I’m sorry,” he said. “We are only
tribespeople and we didn’t know how to use the kitchen or how to prepare
the food. In the morning, could you have someone arrive to instruct us
properly?”</p>
<p>“The best I can do, tribesman,” said Graycloud placatingly, “is to
have two Sisters sent in. I ask your pardon for inconveniencing you with
feminine presence, but it is they who know these things.”</p>
<p>Dors, who had emerged from the kitchen, said (before remembering her
place in the masculine Mycogenian society), “That’s fine, Graycloud.
We’d love to meet the Sisters.”</p>
<p>Graycloud looked at her uneasily and fleetingly, but said
nothing.</p>
<p>Seldon, convinced that the young Mycogenian would, on principle,
refuse to have heard what a woman said to him, repeated the remark.
“That’s fine, Graycloud. We’d love to meet the Sisters.”</p>
<p>His expression cleared at once. “I will have them here as soon as it
is day.”</p>
<p>When Graycloud had left, Seldon said with some satisfaction, “The
Sisters are likely to be exactly what we need.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? And in what way, Hari?” asked Dors.</p>
<p>“Well, surely if we treat them as though they are human beings, they
will be grateful enough to speak of their legends.”</p>
<p>“If they know them,” said Dors skeptically. “Somehow I have no faith
that the Mycogenians bother to educate their women very well.”</p>
