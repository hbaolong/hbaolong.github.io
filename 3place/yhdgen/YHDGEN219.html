<h4 id="section">81</h4>
<p>Davan asked, “What happened?”</p>
<p>Seldon felt minimally relieved. Surely, the addition of Davan could
scarcely count against the full force of the Dahl Sector, but, then
again, he commanded a number of people who might create enough
confusion—</p>
<p>He said, “You should know, Davan. I suspect that many of the crowd
who were at Tisalver’s place this morning were your people.”</p>
<p>“Yes, a number were. The story is that you were being arrested and
that you manhandled a squadron of Sunbadgers. But why were you being
arrested?”</p>
<p>“Two,” said Seldon, lifting two fingers. “Two Sunbadgers. And that’s
bad enough. Part of the reason we were being arrested was that we had
gone to see you.”</p>
<p>“That’s not enough. The Sunbadgers don’t bother with me much as a
general thing.” He added bitterly, “They underestimate me.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” said Seldon, “but the woman from whom we rent our rooms
reported us for having started a riot … over the newsman we ran into on
our way to you. You know about that. With your people on the scene
yesterday and again this morning and with two officers badly hurt, they
may well decide to clean out these corridors—and that means you will
suffer. I really am sorry. I had no intention or expectation of being
the cause of any of this.”</p>
<p>But Davan shook his head. “No, you don’t know the Sunbadgers. That’s
not enough either. They don’t want to clean us up. The sector would have
to do something about us if they did. They’re only too happy to let us
rot in Billibotton and the other slums. No, they’re after you—you. What
have you done?”</p>
<p>Dors said impatiently, “We’ve done nothing and, in any case, what
does it matter? If they’re not after you and they are after us, they’re
going to come down here to flush us out. If you get in the way, you’ll
be in deep trouble.”</p>
<p>“No, not me. I have friends—powerful friends,” said Davan. “I told
you that last night. And they can help you as well as me. When you
refused to help us openly, I got in touch with them. They know who you
are, Dr. Seldon. You’re a famous man. They’re in a position to talk to
the Mayor of Dahl and see to it that you are left alone, whatever you
have done. But you’ll have to be taken away—out of Dahl.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. Relief flooded over him. He said, “You know someone
powerful, do you, Davan? Someone who responds at once, who has the
ability to talk the Dahl government out of taking drastic steps, and who
can take us away? Good. I’m not surprised.” He turned to Dors, smiling.
“It’s Mycogen all over again. How does Hummin do it?”</p>
<p>But Dors shook her head. “Too quick. —I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I believe he can do anything.”</p>
<p>“I know him better than you do—and longer—and I don’t believe
that.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled, “Don’t underestimate him.” And then, as though anxious
not to linger longer on that subject, he turned to Davan. “But how did
you find us? Raych said you knew nothing about this place.”</p>
<p>“He don’t,” shrilled Raych indignantly. “This place is all mine. I
found it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been here before,” said Davan, looking about. “It’s an
interesting place. Raych is a corridor creature, perfectly at home in
this maze.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Davan, we gathered as much ourselves. But how did you find
it?”</p>
<p>“A heat-seeker. I have a device that detects infra-red radiation, the
particular thermal pattern that is given off at thirty-seven degrees
Celsius. It will react to the presence of human beings and not to other
heat sources. It reacted to you three.”</p>
<p>Dors was frowning. “What good is that on Trantor, where there are
human beings everywhere? They have them on other worlds, but—”</p>
<p>Davan said, “But not on Trantor. I know. Except that they are useful
in the slums, in the forgotten, decaying corridors and alleyways.”</p>
<p>“And where did you get it?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>Davan said, “It’s enough that I have it. —But we’ve got to get you
away, Master Seldon. Too many people want you and I want my powerful
friend to have you.”</p>
<p>“Where is he, this powerful friend of yours?”</p>
<p>“He’s approaching. At least a new thirty-seven-degree source is
registering and I don’t see that it can be anyone else.”</p>
<p>Through the door strode a newcomer, but Seldon’s glad exclamation
died on his lips. It was not Chetter Hummin.</p>
<p>WYE—… A sector of the world-city of Trantor … In the latter centuries
of the Galactic Empire, Wye was the strongest and stablest portion of
the world-city. Its rulers had long aspired to the Imperial throne,
justifying that by their descent from early Emperors. Under Mannix IV,
Wye was militarized and (Imperial authorities later claimed) was
planning a planet-wide coup …</p>
