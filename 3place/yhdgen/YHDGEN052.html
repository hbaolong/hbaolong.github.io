<p>THE DEAD HAND</p>
<p>Bel Riose interrupted his annoyed stridings to look up hopefully when
his aide entered. “Any word of the Starlet?”</p>
<p>“None. The scouting party has quartered space, but the instruments
have detected nothing. Commander Yume has reported that the Fleet is
ready for an immediate attack in retaliation.”</p>
<p>The general shook his head. “No, not for a patrol ship. Not yet. Tell
him to double—Wait! I’ll write out the message. Have it coded and
transmitted by tight beam.”</p>
<p>He wrote as he talked and thrust the paper at the waiting officer.
“Has the Siwennian arrived yet?”</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>“Well, see to it that he is brought in here as soon as he does
arrive.”</p>
<p>The aide saluted crisply and left. Riose resumed his caged
stride.</p>
<p>When the door opened a second time, it was Ducem Barr that stood on
the threshold. Slowly, in the footsteps of the ushering aide, he stepped
into the garish room whose ceiling was an ornamented holographic model
of the Galaxy, and in the center of which Bel Riose stood in field
uniform.</p>
<p>“Patrician, good day!” The general pushed forward a chair with his
foot and gestured the aide away with a “That door is to stay closed till
I open it.”</p>
<p>He stood before the Siwennian, legs apart, hand grasping wrist behind
his back, balancing himself slowly, thoughtfully, on the balls of his
feet.</p>
<p>Then, harshly, “Patrician, are you a loyal subject of the
Emperor?”</p>
<p>Barr, who had maintained an indifferent silence till then, wrinkled a
noncommittal brow. “I have no cause to love Imperial rule.”</p>
<p>“Which is a long way from saying that you would be a traitor.”</p>
<p>“True. But the mere act of not being a traitor is also a long way
from agreeing to be an active helper.”</p>
<p>“Ordinarily also true. But to refuse your help at this point,” said
Riose, deliberately, “will be considered treason and treated as
such.”</p>
<p>Barr’s eyebrows drew together. “Save your verbal cudgels for your
subordinates. A simple statement of your needs and wants will suffice me
here.”</p>
<p>Riose sat down and crossed his legs. “Barr, we had an earlier
discussion half a year ago.”</p>
<p>“About your magicians?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You remember what I said I would do.”</p>
<p>Barr nodded. His arms rested limply in his lap. “You were going to
visit them in their haunts, and you’ve been away these four months. Did
you find them?”</p>
<p>“Find them? That I did,” cried Riose. His lips were stiff as he
spoke. It seemed to require effort to refrain from grinding molars.
“Patrician, they are not magicians; they are devils. It is as far from
belief as the outer galaxies from here. Conceive it! It is a world the
size of a handkerchief, of a fingernail; with resources so petty, power
so minute, a population so microscopic as would never suffice the most
backward worlds of the dusty prefects of the Dark Stars. Yet with that,
a people so proud and ambitious as to dream quietly and methodically of
Galactic rule.</p>
<p>“Why, they are so sure of themselves that they do not even hurry.
They move slowly, phlegmatically; they speak of necessary centuries.
They swallow worlds at leisure; creep through systems with dawdling
complacence.</p>
<p>“And they succeed. There is no one to stop them. They have built up a
filthy trading community that curls its tentacles about the systems
further than their toy ships dare reach. For parsecs, their
Traders—which is what their agents call themselves—penetrate.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr interrupted the angry flow. “How much of this information
is definite; and how much is simply fury?”</p>
<p>The soldier caught his breath and grew calmer. “My fury does not
blind me. I tell you I was in worlds nearer to Siwenna than to the
Foundation, where the Empire was a myth of the distance, and where
Traders were living truths. We ourselves were mistaken for Traders.”</p>
<p>“The Foundation itself told you they aimed at Galactic dominion?”</p>
<p>“Told me!” Riose was violent again. “It was not a matter of telling
me. The officials said nothing. They spoke business exclusively. But I
spoke to ordinary men. I absorbed the ideas of the common folk; their
‘manifest destiny,’ their calm acceptance of a great future. It is a
thing that can’t be hidden; a universal optimism they don’t even try to
hide.”</p>
<p>The Siwennian openly displayed a certain quiet satisfaction. “You
will notice that so far it would seem to bear out quite accurately my
reconstruction of events from the paltry data on the subject that I have
gathered.”</p>
<p>“It is no doubt,” replied Riose with vexed sarcasm, “a tribute to
your analytical powers. It is also a hearty and bumptious commentary on
the growing danger to the domains of His Imperial Majesty.”</p>
<p>Barr shrugged his unconcern, and Riose leaned forward suddenly, to
seize the old man’s shoulders and stare with curious gentleness into his
eyes.</p>
<p>He said, “Now, patrician, none of that. I have no desire to be
barbaric. For my part, the legacy of Siwennian hostility to the Imperium
is an odious burden, and one which I would do everything in my power to
wipe out. But my province is the military and interference in civil
affairs is impossible. It would bring about my recall and ruin my
usefulness at once. You see that? I know you see that. Between yourself
and myself then, let the atrocity of forty years ago be repaid by your
vengeance upon its author and so forgotten. I need your help. I frankly
admit it.”</p>
<p>There was a world of urgency in the young man’s voice, but Ducem
Barr’s head shook gently and deliberately in a negative gesture.</p>
<p>Riose said pleadingly, “You don’t understand, patrician, and I doubt
my ability to make you. I can’t argue on your ground. You’re the
scholar, not I. But this I can tell you. Whatever you think of the
Empire, you will admit its great services. Its armed forces have
committed isolated crimes, but in the main they have been a force for
peace and civilization. It was the Imperial navy that created the Pax
Imperium that ruled over all the Galaxy for thousands of years. Contrast
the millennia of peace under the Sun-and-Spaceship of the Empire with
the millennia of interstellar anarchy that preceded it. Consider the
wars and devastations of those old days and tell me if, with all its
faults, the Empire is not worth preserving.</p>
<p>“Consider,” he drove on forcefully, “to what the outer fringe of the
Galaxy is reduced in these days of their breakaway and independence, and
ask yourself if for the sake of a petty revenge you would reduce Siwenna
from its position as a province under the protection of a mighty Navy to
a barbarian world in a barbarian Galaxy, all immersed in its fragmentary
independence and its common degradation and misery.”</p>
<p>“Is it so bad—so soon?” murmured the Siwennian.</p>
<p>“No,” admitted Riose. “We would be safe ourselves no doubt, were our
lifetimes quadrupled. But it is for the Empire I fight; that, and a
military tradition which is something for myself alone, and which I
cannot transfer to you. It is a military tradition built on the Imperial
institution which I serve.”</p>
<p>“You are getting mystical, and I always find it difficult to
penetrate another person’s mysticism.”</p>
<p>“No matter. You understand the danger of this Foundation.”</p>
<p>“It was I who pointed out what you call the danger before ever you
headed outward from Siwenna.”</p>
<p>“Then you realize that it must be stopped in embryo or perhaps not at
all. You have known of this Foundation before anyone had heard of it.
You know more about it than anyone else in the Empire. You probably know
how it might best be attacked; and you can probably forewarn me of its
countermeasures. Come, let us be friends.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr rose. He said flatly, “Such help as I could give you means
nothing. So I will make you free of it in the face of your strenuous
demand.”</p>
<p>“I will be the judge of its meaning.”</p>
<p>“No, I am serious. Not all the might of the Empire could avail to
crush this pygmy world.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Bel Riose’s eyes glistened fiercely. “No, stay where you
are. I’ll tell you when you may leave. Why not? If you think I
underestimate this enemy I have discovered, you are wrong. Patrician,”
he spoke reluctantly, “I lost a ship on my return. I have no proof that
it fell into the hands of the Foundation; but it has not been located
since and were it merely an accident, its dead hulk should certainly
have been found along the route we took. It is not an important
loss—less than the tenth part of a fleabite, but it may mean that the
Foundation has already opened hostilities. Such eagerness and such
disregard for consequences might mean secret forces of which I know
nothing. Can you help me then by answering a specific question? What is
their military power?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t any notion.”</p>
<p>“Then explain yourself on your own terms. Why do you say the Empire
cannot defeat this small enemy?”</p>
<p>The Siwennian seated himself once more and looked away from Riose’s
fixed glare. He spoke heavily, “Because I have faith in the principles
of psychohistory. It is a strange science. It reached mathematical
maturity with one man, Hari Seldon, and died with him, for no man since
has been capable of manipulating its intricacies. But in that short
period, it proved itself the most powerful instrument ever invented for
the study of humanity. Without pretending to predict the actions of
individual humans, it formulated definite laws capable of mathematical
analysis and extrapolation to govern and predict the mass action of
human groups.”</p>
<p>“So—”</p>
<p>“It was that psychohistory which Seldon and the group he worked with
applied in full force to the establishment of the Foundation. The place,
time, and conditions all conspire mathematically and so, inevitably, to
the development of a Second Galactic Empire.”</p>
<p>Riose’s voice trembled with indignation. “You mean that this art of
his predicts that I would attack the Foundation and lose such and such a
battle for such and such a reason? You are trying to say that I am a
silly robot following a predetermined course into destruction.”</p>
<p>“No,” replied the old patrician, sharply. “I have already said that
the science had nothing to do with individual actions. It is the vaster
background that has been foreseen.”</p>
<p>“Then we stand clasped tightly in the forcing hand of the Goddess of
Historical Necessity.”</p>
<p>“Of Psychohistorical Necessity,” prompted Barr, softly.</p>
<p>“And if I exercise my prerogative of freewill? If I choose to attack
next year, or not to attack at all? How pliable is the Goddess? How
resourceful?”</p>
<p>Barr shrugged. “Attack now or never; with a single ship, or all the
force in the Empire; by military force or economic pressure; by candid
declaration of war or by treacherous ambush. Do whatever you wish in
your fullest exercise of freewill. You will still lose.”</p>
<p>“Because of Hari Seldon’s dead hand?”</p>
<p>“Because of the dead hand of the mathematics of human behavior that
can neither be stopped, swerved, nor delayed.”</p>
<p>The two faced each other in deadlock, until the general stepped
back.</p>
<p>He said simply, “I’ll take that challenge. It’s a dead hand against a
living will.”</p>
<p>CLEON II.… commonly called “The Great.” The last strong Emperor of
the First Empire, he is important for the political and artistic
renaissance that took place during his long reign. He is best known to
romance, however, for his connection with Bel Riose, and to the common
man, he is simply “Riose’s Emperor.” It is important not to allow events
of the last year of his reign to overshadow forty years of …</p>
