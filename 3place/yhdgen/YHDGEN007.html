<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>The trial (Gaal supposed it to be one, though it bore little
resemblance legalistically to the elaborate trial techniques Gaal had
read of) had not lasted long. It was in its third day. Yet already, Gaal
could no longer stretch his memory back far enough to embrace its
beginning.</p>
<p>He himself had been but little pecked at. The heavy guns were trained
on Dr. Seldon himself. Hari Seldon, however, sat there unperturbed. To
Gaal, he was the only spot of stability remaining in the world.</p>
<p>The audience was small and drawn exclusively from among the Barons of
the Empire. Press and public were excluded and it was doubtful that any
significant number of outsiders even knew that a trial of Seldon was
being conducted. The atmosphere was one of unrelieved hostility toward
the defendants.</p>
<p>Five of the Commission of Public Safety sat behind the raised desk.
They wore scarlet and gold uniforms and the shining, close-fitting
plastic caps that were the sign of their judicial function. In the
center was the Chief Commissioner Linge Chen. Gaal had never before seen
so great a Lord and he watched him with fascination. Chen, throughout
the trial, rarely said a word. He made it quite clear that much speech
was beneath his dignity.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Advocate consulted his notes and the examination
continued, with Seldon still on the stand:</p>
<p>Q.  Let us see, Dr. Seldon. How many men are now engaged in the
project of which you are head?</p>
<p>A.  Fifty mathematicians.</p>
<p>Q.  Including Dr. Gaal Dornick?</p>
<p>A.  Dr. Dornick is the fifty-first.</p>
<p>Q.  Oh, we have fifty-one then? Search your memory, Dr. Seldon.
Perhaps there are fifty-two or fifty-three? Or perhaps even more?</p>
<p>A.  Dr. Dornick has not yet formally joined my organization. When he
does, the membership will be fifty-one. It is now fifty, as I have
said.</p>
<p>Q.  Not perhaps nearly a hundred thousand?</p>
<p>A.  Mathematicians? No.</p>
<p>Q.  I did not say mathematicians. Are there a hundred thousand in all
capacities?</p>
<p>A.  In all capacities, your figure may be correct.</p>
<p>Q.  May be? I say it is. I say that the men in your project number
ninety-eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-two.</p>
<p>A.  I believe you are counting women and children.</p>
<p>Q.  (raising his voice) Ninety-eight thousand five hundred and
seventy-two individuals is the intent of my statement. There is no need
to quibble.</p>
<p>A.  I accept the figures.</p>
<p>Q.  (referring to his notes) Let us drop that for the moment, then,
and take up another matter which we have already discussed at some
length. Would you repeat, Dr. Seldon, your thoughts concerning the
future of Trantor?</p>
<p>A.  I have said, and I say again, that Trantor will lie in ruins
within the next three centuries.</p>
<p>Q.  You do not consider your statement a disloyal one?</p>
<p>A.  No, sir. Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.</p>
<p>Q.  You are sure that your statement represents scientific truth?</p>
<p>A.  I am.</p>
<p>Q.  On what basis?</p>
<p>A.  On the basis of the mathematics of psychohistory.</p>
<p>Q.  Can you prove that this mathematics is valid?</p>
<p>A.  Only to another mathematician.</p>
<p>Q.  (with a smile) Your claim then is that your truth is of so
esoteric a nature that it is beyond the understanding of a plain man. It
seems to me that truth should be clearer than that, less mysterious,
more open to the mind.</p>
<p>A.  It presents no difficulties to some minds. The physics of energy
transfer, which we know as thermodynamics, has been clear and true
through all the history of man since the mythical ages, yet there may be
people present who would find it impossible to design a power engine.
People of high intelligence, too. I doubt if the learned
Commissioners—</p>
<p>At this point, one of the Commissioners leaned toward the Advocate.
His words were not heard but the hissing of the voice carried a certain
asperity. The Advocate flushed and interrupted Seldon.</p>
<p>Q.  We are not here to listen to speeches, Dr. Seldon. Let us assume
that you have made your point. Let me suggest to you that your
predictions of disaster might be intended to destroy public confidence
in the Imperial Government for purposes of your own!</p>
<p>A.  That is not so.</p>
<p>Q.  Let me suggest that you intend to claim that a period of time
preceding the so-called ruin of Trantor will be filled with unrest of
various types.</p>
<p>A.  That is correct.</p>
<p>Q.  And that by the mere prediction thereof, you hope to bring it
about, and to have then an army of a hundred thousand available.</p>
<p>A.  In the first place, that is not so. And if it were, investigation
will show you that barely ten thousand are men of military age, and none
of these has training in arms.</p>
<p>Q.  Are you acting as an agent for another?</p>
<p>A.  I am not in the pay of any man, Mr. Advocate.</p>
<p>Q.  You are entirely disinterested? You are serving science?</p>
<p>A.  I am.</p>
<p>Q.  Then let us see how. Can the future be changed, Dr. Seldon?</p>
<p>A.  Obviously. This courtroom may explode in the next few hours, or
it may not. If it did, the future would undoubtedly be changed in some
minor respects.</p>
<p>Q.  You quibble, Dr. Seldon. Can the overall history of the human
race be changed?</p>
<p>A.  Yes.</p>
<p>Q.  Easily?</p>
<p>A.  No. With great difficulty.</p>
<p>Q.  Why?</p>
<p>A.  The psychohistoric trend of a planet-full of people contains a
huge inertia. To be changed it must be met with something possessing a
similar inertia. Either as many people must be concerned, or if the
number of people be relatively small, enormous time for change must be
allowed. Do you understand?</p>
<p>Q.  I think I do. Trantor need not be ruined, if a great many people
decide to act so that it will not.</p>
<p>A.  That is right.</p>
<p>Q.  As many as a hundred thousand people?</p>
<p>A.  No, sir. That is far too few.</p>
<p>Q.  You are sure?</p>
<p>A.  Consider that Trantor has a population of over forty billions.
Consider further that the trend leading to ruin does not belong to
Trantor alone but to the Empire as a whole and the Empire contains
nearly a quintillion human beings.</p>
<p>Q.  I see. Then perhaps a hundred thousand people can change the
trend, if they and their descendants labor for three hundred years.</p>
<p>A.  I’m afraid not. Three hundred years is too short a time.</p>
<p>Q.  Ah! In that case, Dr. Seldon, we are left with this deduction to
be made from your statements. You have gathered one hundred thousand
people within the confines of your project. These are insufficient to
change the history of Trantor within three hundred years. In other
words, they cannot prevent the destruction of Trantor no matter what
they do.</p>
<p>A.  You are unfortunately correct.</p>
<p>Q.  And on the other hand, your hundred thousand are intended for no
illegal purpose.</p>
<p>A.  Exactly.</p>
<p>Q.  (slowly and with satisfaction) In that case, Dr. Seldon—Now
attend, sir, most carefully, for we want a considered answer. What is
the purpose of your hundred thousand?</p>
<p>The Advocate’s voice had grown strident. He had sprung his trap;
backed Seldon into a corner; driven him astutely from any possibility of
answering.</p>
<p>There was a rising buzz of conversation at that which swept the ranks
of the peers in the audience and invaded even the row of Commissioners.
They swayed toward one another in their scarlet and gold, only the Chief
remaining uncorrupted.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon remained unmoved. He waited for the babble to
evaporate.</p>
<p>A.  To minimize the effects of that destruction.</p>
<p>Q.  And exactly what do you mean by that?</p>
<p>A.  The explanation is simple. The coming destruction of Trantor is
not an event in itself, isolated in the scheme of human development. It
will be the climax to an intricate drama which was begun centuries ago
and which is accelerating in pace continuously. I refer, gentlemen, to
the developing decline and fall of the Galactic Empire.</p>
<p>The buzz now became a dull roar. The Advocate, unheeded, was yelling,
“You are openly declaring that—” and stopped because the cries of
“Treason” from the audience showed that the point had been made without
any hammering.</p>
<p>Slowly, the Chief Commissioner raised his gavel once and let it drop.
The sound was that of a mellow gong. When the reverberations ceased, the
gabble of the audience also did. The Advocate took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Q.  (theatrically) Do you realize, Dr. Seldon, that you are speaking
of an Empire that has stood for twelve thousand years, through all the
vicissitudes of the generations, and which has behind it the good wishes
and love of a quadrillion human beings?</p>
<p>A.  I am aware both of the present status and the past history of the
Empire. Without disrespect, I must claim a far better knowledge of it
than any in this room.</p>
<p>Q.  And you predict its ruin?</p>
<p>A.  It is a prediction which is made by mathematics. I pass no moral
judgements. Personally, I regret the prospect. Even if the Empire were
admitted to be a bad thing (an admission I do not make), the state of
anarchy which would follow its fall would be worse. It is that state of
anarchy which my project is pledged to fight. The fall of Empire,
gentlemen, is a massive thing, however, and not easily fought. It is
dictated by a rising bureaucracy, a receding initiative, a freezing of
caste, a damming of curiosity—a hundred other factors. It has been going
on, as I have said, for centuries, and it is too majestic and massive a
movement to stop.</p>
<p>Q.  Is it not obvious to anyone that the Empire is as strong as it
ever was?</p>
<p>A.  The appearance of strength is all about you. It would seem to
last forever. However, Mr. Advocate, the rotten tree-trunk, until the
very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two, has all the
appearance of might it ever had. The storm-blast whistles through the
branches of the Empire even now. Listen with the ears of psychohistory,
and you will hear the creaking.</p>
<p>Q.  (uncertainly) We are not here, Dr. Seldon, to lis—</p>
<p>A.  (firmly) The Empire will vanish and all its good with it. Its
accumulated knowledge will decay and the order it has imposed will
vanish. Interstellar wars will be endless; interstellar trade will
decay; population will decline; worlds will lose touch with the main
body of the Galaxy. —And so matters will remain.</p>
<p>Q.  (a small voice in the middle of a vast silence) Forever?</p>
<p>A.  Psychohistory, which can predict the fall, can make statements
concerning the succeeding dark ages. The Empire, gentlemen, as has just
been said, has stood twelve thousand years. The dark ages to come will
endure not twelve, but thirty thousand years. A Second Empire will rise,
but between it and our civilization will be one thousand generations of
suffering humanity. We must fight that.</p>
<p>Q.  (recovering somewhat) You contradict yourself. You said earlier
that you could not prevent the destruction of Trantor; hence,
presumably, the fall;—the so-called fall of the Empire.</p>
<p>A.  I do not say now that we can prevent the fall. But it is not yet
too late to shorten the interregnum which will follow. It is possible,
gentlemen, to reduce the duration of anarchy to a single millennium, if
my group is allowed to act now. We are at a delicate moment in history.
The huge, onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little,—just
a little—It cannot be much, but it may be enough to remove twenty-nine
thousand years of misery from human history.</p>
<p>Q.  How do you propose to do this?</p>
<p>A.  By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is
beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social
fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will
know much of exceedingly tiny facets of what there is to know. They will
be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless,
will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. But,
if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be
lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to
rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty
thousand.</p>
<p>Q.  All this—</p>
<p>A.  All my project; my thirty thousand men with their wives and
children, are devoting themselves to the preparation of an “Encyclopedia
Galactica.” They will not complete it in their lifetimes. I will not
even live to see it fairly begun. But by the time Trantor falls, it will
be complete and copies will exist in every major library in the
Galaxy.</p>
<p>The Chief Commissioner’s gavel rose and fell. Hari Seldon left the
stand and quietly took his seat next to Gaal.</p>
<p>He smiled and said, “How did you like the show?”</p>
<p>Gaal said, “You stole it. But what will happen now?”</p>
<p>“They’ll adjourn the trial and try to come to a private agreement
with me.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’ll be honest. I don’t know. It depends on the Chief
Commissioner. I have studied him for years. I have tried to analyze his
workings, but you know how risky it is to introduce the vagaries of an
individual in the psychohistoric equations. Yet I have hopes.”</p>
