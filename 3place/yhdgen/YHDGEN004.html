<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>Gaal was not certain whether the sun shone, or, for that matter,
whether it was day or night. He was ashamed to ask. All the planet
seemed to live beneath metal. The meal of which he had just partaken had
been labelled luncheon, but there were many planets which lived a
standard timescale that took no account of the perhaps inconvenient
alternation of day and night. The rate of planetary turnings differed,
and he did not know that of Trantor.</p>
<p>At first, he had eagerly followed the signs to the “Sun Room” and
found it but a chamber for basking in artificial radiation. He lingered
a moment or two, then returned to the Luxor’s main lobby.</p>
<p>He said to the room clerk, “Where can I buy a ticket for a planetary
tour?”</p>
<p>“Right here.”</p>
<p>“When will it start?”</p>
<p>“You just missed it. Another one tomorrow. Buy a ticket now and we’ll
reserve a place for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Tomorrow would be too late. He would have to be at the
University tomorrow. He said, “There wouldn’t be an observation tower—or
something? I mean, in the open air.”</p>
<p>“Sure! Sell you a ticket for that, if you want. Better let me check
if it’s raining or not.” He closed a contact at his elbow and read the
flowing letters that raced across a frosted screen. Gaal read with
him.</p>
<p>The room clerk said, “Good weather. Come to think of it, I do believe
it’s the dry season now.” He added, conversationally, “I don’t bother
with the outside myself. The last time I was in the open was three years
ago. You see it once, you know and that’s all there is to it. —Here’s
your ticket. Special elevator in the rear. It’s marked ‘To the Tower.’
Just take it.”</p>
<p>The elevator was of the new sort that ran by gravitic repulsion. Gaal
entered and others flowed in behind him. The operator closed a contact.
For a moment, Gaal felt suspended in space as gravity switched to zero,
and then he had weight again in small measure as the elevator
accelerated upward. Deceleration followed and his feet left the floor.
He squawked against his will.</p>
<p>The operator called out, “Tuck your feet under the railing. Can’t you
read the sign?”</p>
<p>The others had done so. They were smiling at him as he madly and
vainly tried to clamber back down the wall. Their shoes pressed upward
against the chromium of the railings that stretched across the floor in
parallels set two feet apart. He had noticed those railings on entering
and had ignored them.</p>
<p>Then a hand reached out and pulled him down.</p>
<p>He gasped his thanks as the elevator came to a halt.</p>
<p>He stepped out upon an open terrace bathed in a white brilliance that
hurt his eyes. The man, whose helping hand he had just now been the
recipient of, was immediately behind him.</p>
<p>The man said, kindly, “Plenty of seats.”</p>
<p>Gaal closed his mouth; he had been gaping; and said, “It certainly
seems so.” He started for them automatically, then stopped.</p>
<p>He said, “If you don’t mind, I’ll just stop a moment at the railing.
I—I want to look a bit.”</p>
<p>The man waved him on, good-naturedly, and Gaal leaned out over the
shoulder-high railing and bathed himself in all the panorama.</p>
<p>He could not see the ground. It was lost in the ever increasing
complexities of man-made structures. He could see no horizon other than
that of metal against sky, stretching out to almost uniform grayness,
and he knew it was so over all the land-surface of the planet. There was
scarcely any motion to be seen—a few pleasure-craft lazed against the
sky—but all the busy traffic of billions of men were going on, he knew,
beneath the metal skin of the world.</p>
<p>There was no green to be seen; no green, no soil, no life other than
man. Somewhere on the world, he realized vaguely, was the Emperor’s
palace, set amid one hundred square miles of natural soil, green with
trees, rainbowed with flowers. It was a small island amid an ocean of
steel, but it wasn’t visible from where he stood. It might be ten
thousand miles away. He did not know.</p>
<p>Before very long, he must have his tour!</p>
<p>He sighed noisily, and realized finally that he was on Trantor at
last; on the planet which was the center of all the Galaxy and the
kernel of the human race. He saw none of its weaknesses. He saw no ships
of food landing. He was not aware of a jugular vein delicately
connecting the forty billion of Trantor with the rest of the Galaxy. He
was conscious only of the mightiest deed of man; the complete and almost
contemptuously final conquest of a world.</p>
<p>He came away a little blank-eyed. His friend of the elevator was
indicating a seat next to himself and Gaal took it.</p>
<p>The man smiled. “My name is Jerril. First time on Trantor?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Jerril.”</p>
<p>“Thought so. Jerril’s my first name. Trantor gets you if you’ve got
the poetic temperament. Trantorians never come up here, though. They
don’t like it. Gives them nerves.”</p>
<p>“Nerves!—My name’s Gaal, by the way. Why should it give them nerves?
It’s glorious.”</p>
<p>“Subjective matter of opinion, Gaal. If you’re born in a cubicle and
grow up in a corridor, and work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded
sun-room, then coming up into the open with nothing but sky over you
might just give you a nervous breakdown. They make the children come up
here once a year, after they’re five. I don’t know if it does any good.
They don’t get enough of it, really, and the first few times they scream
themselves into hysteria. They ought to start as soon as they’re weaned
and have the trip once a week.”</p>
<p>He went on, “Of course, it doesn’t really matter. What if they never
come out at all? They’re happy down there and they run the Empire. How
high up do you think we are?”</p>
<p>He said, “Half a mile?” and wondered if that sounded naive.</p>
<p>It must have, for Jerril chuckled a little. He said, “No. Just five
hundred feet.”</p>
<p>“What? But the elevator took about—”</p>
<p>“I know. But most of the time it was just getting up to ground level.
Trantor is tunneled over a mile down. It’s like an iceberg. Nine-tenths
of it is out of sight. It even works itself out a few miles into the
sub-ocean soil at the shorelines. In fact, we’re down so low that we can
make use of the temperature difference between ground level and a couple
of miles under to supply us with all the energy we need. Did you know
that?”</p>
<p>“No, I thought you used atomic generators.”</p>
<p>“Did once. But this is cheaper.”</p>
<p>“I imagine so.”</p>
<p>“What do you think of it all?” For a moment, the man’s good nature
evaporated into shrewdness. He looked almost sly.</p>
<p>Gaal fumbled. “Glorious,” he said, again.</p>
<p>“Here on vacation? Traveling? Sight-seeing?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly. —At least, I’ve always wanted to visit Trantor but I
came here primarily for a job.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Gaal felt obliged to explain further. “With Dr. Seldon’s project at
the University of Trantor.”</p>
<p>“Raven Seldon?”</p>
<p>“Why, no. The one I mean is Hari Seldon. —The psychohistorian
Seldon.I don’t know of any Raven Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Hari’s the one I mean. They call him Raven. Slang, you know. He
keeps predicting disaster.”</p>
<p>“He does?” Gaal was genuinely astonished.</p>
<p>“Surely, you must know.” Jerril was not smiling. “You’re coming to
work for him, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Well yes, I’m a mathematician. Why does he predict disaster? What
kind of disaster?”</p>
<p>“What kind would you think?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I wouldn’t have the least idea. I’ve read the papers
Dr. Seldon and his group have published. They’re on mathematical
theory.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the ones they publish.”</p>
<p>Gaal felt annoyed. He said, “I think I’ll go to my room now. Very
pleased to have met you.”</p>
<p>Jerril waved his arm indifferently in farewell.</p>
<p>Gaal found a man waiting for him in his room. For a moment, he was
too startled to put into words the inevitable “What are you doing here?”
that came to his lips.</p>
<p>The man rose. He was old and almost bald and he walked with a limp,
but his eyes were very bright and blue.</p>
<p>He said, “I am Hari Seldon,” an instant before Gaal’s befuddled brain
placed the face alongside the memory of the many times he had seen it in
pictures.</p>
<p>PSYCHOHISTORY— … Gaal Dornick, using nonmathematical concepts, has
defined psychohistory to be that branch of mathematics which deals with
the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic
stimuli.…</p>
<p>… Implicit in all these definitions is the assumption that the human
conglomerate being dealt with is sufficiently large for valid
statistical treatment. The necessary size of such a conglomerate may be
determined by Seldon’s First Theorem which … A further necessary
assumption is that the human conglomerate be itself unaware of
psychohistoric analysis in order that its reactions be truly
random.…</p>
<p>The basis of all valid psychohistory lies in the development of the
Seldon functions which exhibit properties congruent to those of such
social and economic forces as …</p>
