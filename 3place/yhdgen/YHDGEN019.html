<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>In the ancient days when the Galactic Empire had embraced the Galaxy,
and Anacreon had been the richest of the prefects of the Periphery, more
than one emperor had visited the Viceregal Palace in state. And not one
had left without at least one effort to pit his skill with air speedster
and needle gun against the feathered flying fortress they call the
Nyakbird.</p>
<p>The fame of Anacreon had withered to nothing with the decay of the
times. The Viceregal Palace was a drafty mass of ruins except for the
wing that Foundation workmen had restored. And no Emperor had been seen
in Anacreon for two hundred years.</p>
<p>But Nyak hunting was still the royal sport and a good eye with the
needle gun still the first requirement of Anacreon’s kings.</p>
<p>Lepold I, King of Anacreon and—as was invariably, but untruthfully
added—Lord of the Outer Dominions, though not yet sixteen had already
proved his skill many times over. He had brought down his first Nyak
when scarcely thirteen; had brought down his tenth the week after his
accession to the throne; and was returning now from his forty-sixth.</p>
<p>“Fifty before I come of age,” he had exulted. “Who’ll take the
wager?”</p>
<p>But courtiers don’t take wagers against the king’s skill. There is
the deadly danger of winning. So no one did, and the king left to change
his clothes in high spirits.</p>
<p>“Lepold!”</p>
<p>The king stopped mid-step at the one voice that could cause him to do
so. He turned sulkily.</p>
<p>Wienis stood upon the threshold of his chambers and beetled at his
young nephew.</p>
<p>“Send them away,” he motioned impatiently. “Get rid of them.”</p>
<p>The king nodded curtly and the two chamberlains bowed and backed down
the stairs. Lepold entered his uncle’s room.</p>
<p>Wienis stared at the king’s hunting suit morosely. “You’ll have more
important things to tend to than Nyak hunting soon enough.”</p>
<p>He turned his back and stumped to his desk. Since he had grown too
old for the rush of air, the perilous dive within wing-beat of the Nyak,
the roll and climb of the speedster at the motion of a foot, he had
soured upon the whole sport.</p>
<p>Lepold appreciated his uncle’s sour-grapes attitude and it was not
without malice that he began enthusiastically, “But you should have been
with us today, uncle. We flushed one in the wilds of Samia that was a
monster. And game as they come. We had it out for two hours over at
least seventy square miles of ground. And then I got to Sunwards”—he was
motioning graphically, as though he were once more in his speedster—“and
dived torque-wise. Caught him on the rise just under the left wing at
quarters. It maddened him and he canted athwart. I took his dare and
veered a-left, waiting for the plummet. Sure enough, down he came. He
was within wing-beat before I moved and then—”</p>
<p>“Lepold!”</p>
<p>“Well!—I got him.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you did. Now will you attend?”</p>
<p>The king shrugged and gravitated to the end table where he nibbled at
a Lera nut in quite an unregal sulk. He did not dare to meet his uncle’s
eyes.</p>
<p>Wienis said, by way of preamble, “I’ve been to the ship today.”</p>
<p>“What ship?”</p>
<p>“There is only one ship. The ship. The one the Foundation is
repairing for the navy. The old Imperial cruiser. Do I make myself
sufficiently plain?”</p>
<p>“That one? You see, I told you the Foundation would repair it if we
asked them to. It’s all poppycock, you know, that story of yours about
their wanting to attack us. Because if they did, why would they fix the
ship? It doesn’t make sense, you know.”</p>
<p>“Lepold, you’re a fool!”</p>
<p>The king, who had just discarded the shell of the Lera nut and was
lifting another to his lips, flushed.</p>
<p>“Well now, look here,” he said, with anger that scarcely rose above
peevishness, “I don’t think you ought to call me that. You forget
yourself. I’ll be of age in two months, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and you’re in a fine position to assume regal responsibilities.
If you spent half the time on public affairs that you do on Nyak
hunting, I’d resign the regency directly with a clear conscience.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. That has nothing to do with the case, you know. The
fact is that even if you are the regent and my uncle, I’m still king and
you’re still my subject. You oughtn’t to call me a fool and you oughtn’t
to sit in my presence, anyway. You haven’t asked my permission. I think
you ought to be careful, or I might do something about it—pretty
soon.”</p>
<p>Wienis’s gaze was cold. “May I refer to you as ‘your majesty’?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Very well! You are a fool, your majesty!”</p>
<p>His dark eyes blazed from beneath his grizzled brows and the young
king sat down slowly. For a moment, there was sardonic satisfaction in
the regent’s face, but it faded quickly. His thick lips parted in a
smile and one hand fell upon the king’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Never mind, Lepold. I should not have spoken harshly to you. It is
difficult sometimes to behave with true propriety when the pressure of
events is such as—You understand?” But if the words were conciliatory,
there was something in his eyes that had not softened.</p>
<p>Lepold said uncertainly, “Yes. Affairs of State are deuced difficult,
you know.” He wondered, not without apprehension, whether he were not in
for a dull siege of meaningless details on the year’s trade with Smyrno
and the long, wrangling dispute over the sparsely settled worlds on the
Red Corridor.</p>
<p>Wienis was speaking again. “My boy, I had thought to speak of this to
you earlier, and perhaps I should have, but I know that your youthful
spirits are impatient of the dry detail of statecraft.”</p>
<p>Lepold nodded. “Well, that’s all right—”</p>
<p>His uncle broke in firmly and continued, “However, you will come of
age in two months. Moreover, in the difficult times that are coming, you
will have to take a full and active part. You will be king henceforward,
Lepold.”</p>
<p>Again Lepold nodded, but his expression was quite blank.</p>
<p>“There will be war, Lepold.”</p>
<p>“War! But there’s been truce with Smyrno—”</p>
<p>“Not Smyrno. The Foundation itself.”</p>
<p>“But, Uncle, they’ve agreed to repair the ship. You said—”</p>
<p>His voice choked off at the twist of his uncle’s lip.</p>
<p>“Lepold”—some of the friendliness had gone—“we are to talk man to
man. There is to be war with the Foundation, whether the ship is
repaired or not; all the sooner, in fact, since it is being repaired.
The Foundation is the source of power and might. All the greatness of
Anacreon; all its ships and its cities and its people and its commerce
depend on the dribbles and leavings of power that the Foundation have
given us grudgingly. I remember the time—I, myself—when the cities of
Anacreon were warmed by the burning of coal and oil. But never mind
that; you would have no conception of it.”</p>
<p>“It seems,” suggested the king timidly, “that we ought to be
grateful—”</p>
<p>“Grateful?” roared Wienis. “Grateful that they begrudge us the merest
dregs, while keeping space knows what for themselves—and keeping it with
what purpose in mind? Why, only that they may some day rule the
Galaxy.”</p>
<p>His hand came down on his nephew’s knee, and his eyes narrowed.
“Lepold, you are king of Anacreon. Your children and your children’s
children may be kings of the universe—if you have the power that the
Foundation is keeping from us!”</p>
<p>“There’s something in that.” Lepold’s eyes gained a sparkle and his
back straightened. “After all, what right have they to keep it to
themselves? Not fair, you know. Anacreon counts for something, too.”</p>
<p>“You see, you’re beginning to understand. And now, my boy, what if
Smyrno decides to attack the Foundation for its own part and thus gains
all that power? How long do you suppose we could escape becoming a
vassal power? How long would you hold your throne?”</p>
<p>Lepold grew excited. “Space, yes. You’re absolutely right, you know.
We must strike first. It’s simply self-defense.”</p>
<p>Wienis’s smile broadened slightly. “Furthermore, once, at the very
beginning of the reign of your grandfather, Anacreon actually
established a military base on the Foundation’s planet, Terminus—a base
vitally needed for national defense. We were forced to abandon that base
as a result of the machinations of the leader of that Foundation, a sly
cur, a scholar, with not a drop of noble blood in his veins. You
understand, Lepold? Your grandfather was humiliated by this commoner. I
remember him! He was scarcely older than myself when he came to Anacreon
with his devil’s smile and devil’s brain—and the power of the other
three kingdoms behind him, combined in cowardly union against the
greatness of Anacreon.”</p>
<p>Lepold flushed and the sparkle in his eyes blazed. “By Seldon, if I
had been my grandfather, I would have fought even so.”</p>
<p>“No, Lepold. We decided to wait—to wipe out the insult at a fitter
time. It had been your father’s hope, before his untimely death, that he
might be the one to—Well, well!” Wienis turned away for a moment. Then,
as if stifling emotion, “He was my brother. And yet, if his son
were—”</p>
<p>“Yes, Uncle, I’ll not fail him. I have decided. It seems only proper
that Anacreon wipe out his nest of troublemakers, and that
immediately.”</p>
<p>“No, not immediately. First, we must wait for the repairs of the
battle cruiser to be completed. The mere fact that they are willing to
undertake these repairs proves that they fear us. The fools attempt to
placate us, but we are not to be turned from our path, are we?”</p>
<p>And Lepold’s fist slammed against his cupped palm. “Not while I am
king in Anacreon.”</p>
<p>Wienis’ lip twitched sardonically. “Besides which we must wait for
Salvor Hardin to arrive.”</p>
<p>“Salvor Hardin!” The king grew suddenly round-eyed, and the youthful
contour of his beardless face lost the almost hard lines into which they
had been compressed.</p>
<p>“Yes, Lepold, the leader of the Foundation himself is coming to
Anacreon on your birthday—probably to soothe us with buttered words. But
it won’t help him.”</p>
<p>“Salvor Hardin!” It was the merest murmur.</p>
<p>Wienis frowned. “Are you afraid of the name? It is the same Salvor
Hardin, who on his previous visit, ground our noses into the dust.
You’re not forgetting that deadly insult to the royal house? And from a
commoner. The dregs of the gutter.”</p>
<p>“No. I guess not. No, I won’t. I won’t! We’ll pay him back—but …
but—I’m afraid—a little.”</p>
<p>The regent rose. “Afraid? Of what? Of what, you young—” He choked
off.</p>
<p>“It would be … uh … sort of blasphemous, you know, to attack the
Foundation. I mean—” He paused.</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>Lepold said confusedly, “I mean, if there were really a Galactic
Spirit, he … uh … it mightn’t like it. Don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t,” was the hard answer. Wienis sat down again and his
lips twisted in a queer smile. “And so you really bother your head a
great deal over the Galactic Spirit, do you? That’s what comes of
letting you run wild. You’ve been listening to Verisof quite a bit, I
take it.”</p>
<p>“He’s explained a great deal—”</p>
<p>“About the Galactic Spirit?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Why, you unweaned cub, he believes in that mummery a good deal less
than I do, and I don’t believe in it at all. How many times have you
been told that all this talk is nonsense?”</p>
<p>“Well, I know that. But Verisof says—”</p>
<p>“Pay no heed to Verisof. It’s nonsense.”</p>
<p>There was a short, rebellious silence, and then Lepold said,
“Everyone believes it just the same. I mean all this talk about the
Prophet Hari Seldon and how he appointed the Foundation to carry on his
commandments that there might some day be a return of the Galactic
Paradise: and how anyone who disobeys his commandments will be destroyed
for eternity. They believe it. I’ve presided at festivals, and I’m sure
they do.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they do; but we don’t. And you may be thankful it’s so, for
according to this foolishness, you are king by divine right—and are
semi-divine yourself. Very handy. It eliminates all possibilities of
revolts and insures absolute obedience in everything. And that is why,
Lepold, you must take an active part in ordering the war against the
Foundation. I am only regent, and quite human. You are king, and more
than half a god—to them.”</p>
<p>“But I suppose I’m not really,” said the king reflectively.</p>
<p>“No, not really,” came the sardonic response, “but you are to
everyone but the people of the Foundation. Get that? To everyone but
those of the Foundation. Once they are removed there will be no one to
deny you the godhead. Think of that!”</p>
<p>“And after that we will ourselves be able to operate the power boxes
of the temples and the ships that fly without men and the holy food that
cures cancer and all the rest? Verisof said only those blessed with the
Galactic Spirit could—”</p>
<p>“Yes, Verisof said! Verisof, next to Salvor Hardin, is your greatest
enemy. Stay with me, Lepold, and don’t worry about them. Together we
will recreate an empire—not just the kingdom of Anacreon—but one
comprising every one of the billions of suns of the Empire. Is that
better than a wordy ‘Galactic Paradise’?”</p>
<p>“Ye-es.”</p>
<p>“Can Verisof promise more?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Very well.” His voice became peremptory. “I suppose we may consider
the matter settled.” He waited for no answer. “Get along. I’ll be down
later. And just one thing, Lepold.”</p>
<p>The young king turned on the threshold.</p>
<p>Wienis was smiling with all but his eyes. “Be careful on these Nyak
hunts, my boy. Since the unfortunate accident to your father, I have had
the strangest presentiments concerning you, at times. In the confusion,
with needle guns thickening the air with darts, one can never tell. You
will be careful, I hope. And you’ll do as I say about the Foundation,
won’t you?”</p>
<p>Lepold’s eyes widened and dropped away from those of his uncle.
“Yes—certainly.”</p>
<p>“Good!” He stared after his departing nephew, expressionlessly, and
returned to his desk.</p>
<p>And Lepold’s thoughts as he left were somber and not unfearful.
Perhaps it would be best to defeat the Foundation and gain the power
Wienis spoke of. But afterward, when the war was over and he was secure
on his throne—He became acutely conscious of the fact that Wienis and
his two arrogant sons were at present next in line to the throne.</p>
<p>But he was king. And kings could order people executed.</p>
<p>Even uncles and cousins.</p>
