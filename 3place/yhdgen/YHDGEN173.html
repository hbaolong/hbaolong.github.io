<h4 id="section">35</h4>
<p>There were just two seats behind the compact pilot compartment and
when Seldon sat down on padding that gave slowly beneath him meshed
fabric came forward to encircle his legs, waist, and chest and a hood
came down over his forehead and ears. He felt imprisoned and when he
turned to his left with difficulty—and only slightly—he could see that
Dors was similarly enclosed.</p>
<p>The pilot took his own seat and checked the controls. Then he said,
“I’m Endor Levanian, at your service. You’re enmeshed because there will
be a considerable acceleration at lift-off. Once we’re in the open and
flying, you’ll be released. You needn’t tell me your names. It’s none of
my business.”</p>
<p>He turned in his seat and smiled at them out of a gnomelike face that
wrinkled as his lips spread outward. “Any psychological difficulties,
youngsters?”</p>
<p>Dors said lightly, “I’m an Outworlder and I’m used to flying.”</p>
<p>“That is also true for myself,” said Seldon with a bit of
hauteur.</p>
<p>“Excellent, youngsters. Of course, this isn’t your ordinary air-jet
and you may not have done any night flying, but I’ll count on you to
bear up.”</p>
<p>He was enmeshed too, but Seldon could see that his arms were entirely
free.</p>
<p>A dull hum sounded inside the jet, growing in intensity and rising in
pitch. Without actually becoming unpleasant, it threatened to do so and
Seldon made a gesture as though to shake his head and get the sound out
of his ears, but the attempt to do so merely seemed to stiffen the hold
of the head-mesh.</p>
<p>The jet then sprang (it was the only verb Seldon could find to
describe the event) into the air and he found himself pushed hard
against the back and bottom of his seat.</p>
<p>Through the windshield in front of the pilot, Seldon saw, with a
twinge of horror, the flat rise of a wall—and then a round opening
appear in that wall. It was similar to the hole into which the air-taxi
had plunged the day he and Hummin had left the Imperial Sector, but
though this one was large enough for the body of the jet, it certainly
did not leave room for the wings.</p>
<p>Seldon’s head turned as far to the right as he could manage and did
so just in time to see the wing on his side wither and collapse.</p>
<p>The jet plunged into the opening and was seized by the
electromagnetic field and hurtled along a lighted tunnel. The
acceleration was constant and there were occasional clicking noises that
Seldon imagined might be the passing of individual magnets.</p>
<p>And then, in less than ten minutes, the jet was spewed out into the
atmosphere, headlong into the sudden pervasive darkness of night.</p>
<p>The jet decelerated as it passed beyond the electromagnetic field and
Seldon felt himself flung against the mesh and plastered there for a few
breathless moments.</p>
<p>Then the pressure ceased and the mesh disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>“How are you, youngsters?” came the cheerful voice of the pilot.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” said Seldon. He turned to Dors. “Are you all
right?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” she answered. “I think Mr. Levanian was putting us
through his paces to see if we were really Outworlders. Is that so,
Mr. Levanian?”</p>
<p>“Some people like excitement,” said Levanian. “Do you?”</p>
<p>“Within limits,” said Dors.</p>
<p>Then Seldon added approvingly, “As any reasonable person would
admit.”</p>
<p>Seldon went on. “It might have seemed less humorous to you, sir, if
you had ripped the wings off the jet.”</p>
<p>“Impossible, sir. I told you this is not your ordinary airjet. The
wings are thoroughly computerized. They change their length, width,
curvature, and overall shape to match the speed of the jet, the speed
and direction of the wind, the temperature, and half a dozen other
variables. The wings wouldn’t tear off unless the jet itself was
subjected to stresses that would splinter it.”</p>
<p>There was a spatter against Seldon’s window. He said, “It’s
raining.”</p>
<p>“It often is,” said the pilot.</p>
<p>Seldon peered out the window. On Helicon or on any other world, there
would have been lights visible—the illuminated works of man. Only on
Trantor would it be dark.</p>
<p>—Well, not entirely. At one point he saw the flash of a beacon light.
Perhaps the higher reaches of Upperside had warning lights.</p>
<p>As usual, Dors took note of Seldon’s uneasiness. Patting his hand,
she said, “I’m sure the pilot knows what he’s doing, Hari.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to be sure of it, too, Dors, but I wish he’d share some of
that knowledge with us,” Seldon said in a voice loud enough to be
overheard.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind sharing,” said the pilot. “To begin with, we’re heading
up and we’ll be above the cloud deck in a few minutes. Then there won’t
be any rain and we’ll even see the stars.”</p>
<p>He had timed the remark beautifully, for a few stars began to glitter
through the feathery cloud remnants and then all the rest sprang into
brightness as the pilot flicked off the lights inside the cabin. Only
the dim illumination of his own instrument panel remained to compete and
outside the window the sky sparkled brightly.</p>
<p>Dors said, “That’s the first time in over two years that I’ve seen
the stars. Aren’t they marvelous? They’re so bright—and there are so
many of them.”</p>
<p>The pilot said, “Trantor is nearer the center of the Galaxy than most
of the Outworlds.”</p>
<p>Since Helicon was in a sparse corner of the Galaxy and its star field
was dim and unimpressive, Seldon found himself speechless.</p>
<p>Dors said, “How quiet this flight has become.”</p>
<p>“So it is,” said Seldon. “What powers the jet, Mr. Levanian?”</p>
<p>“A microfusion motor and a thin stream of hot gas.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know we had working microfusion airjets. They talk about
it, but—”</p>
<p>“There are a few small ones like this. So far they exist only on
Trantor and are used entirely by high government officials.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “The fees for such travel must come high.”</p>
<p>“Very high, sir.”</p>
<p>“How much is Mr. Hummin being charged, then?”</p>
<p>“There’s no charge for this flight. Mr. Hummin is a good friend of
the company who owns these jets.”</p>
<p>Seldon grunted. Then he asked, “Why aren’t there more of these
microfusion airjets?”</p>
<p>“Too expensive for one thing, sir. Those that exist fulfill all the
demand.”</p>
<p>“You could create more demand with larger jets.”</p>
<p>“Maybe so, but the company has never managed to make microfusion
engines strong enough for large airjets.”</p>
<p>Seldon thought of Hummin’s complaint that technological innovation
had declined to a low level. “Decadent,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“What?” said Dors.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Seldon. “I was just thinking of something Hummin once
said to me.”</p>
<p>He looked out at the stars and said, “Are we moving westward,
Mr. Levanian?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we are. How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Because I thought that we would see the dawn by now if we were
heading east to meet it.”</p>
<p>But dawn, pursuing the planet, finally caught up with them and
sunlight—real sunlight—brightened the cabin walls. It didn’t last long,
however, for the jet curved downward and into the clouds. Blue and gold
vanished and were replaced by dingy gray and both Seldon and Dors
emitted disappointed cries at being deprived of even a few more moments
of true sunlight.</p>
<p>When they sank beneath the clouds, Upperside was immediately below
them and its surface—at least at this spot—was a rolling mixture of
wooded grottos and intervening grassland. It was the sort of thing
Clowzia had told Seldon existed on Upperside.</p>
<p>Again there was little time for observation, however. An opening
appeared below them, rimmed by lettering that spelled MYCOGEN.</p>
<p>They plunged in.</p>
