<h4 id="section">14</h4>
<p>THE MUTANT</p>
<p>The “hangar” on Kalgan is an institution peculiar unto itself, born
of the need for the disposition of the vast number of ships brought in
by the visitors from abroad, and the simultaneous and consequent vast
need for living accommodations for the same. The original bright one who
had thought of the obvious solution had quickly become a millionaire.
His heirs—by birth or finance—were easily among the richest on
Kalgan.</p>
<p>The “hangar” spreads fatly over square miles of territory, and
“hangar” does not describe it at all sufficiently. It is essentially a
hotel—for ships. The traveler pays in advance and his ship is awarded a
berth from which it can take off into space at any desired moment. The
visitor then lives in his ship as always. The ordinary hotel services
such as the replacement of food and medical supplies at special rates,
simple servicing of the ship itself, special intra-Kalgan transportation
for a nominal sum are to be had, of course.</p>
<p>As a result, the visitor combines hangar space and hotel bill into
one, at a saving. The owners sell temporary use of ground space at ample
profits. The government collects huge taxes. Everyone has fun. Nobody
loses. Simple!</p>
<p>The man who made his way down the shadow-borders of the wide
corridors that connected the multitudinous wings of the “hangar” had in
the past speculated on the novelty and usefulness of the system
described above, but these were reflections for idle moments—distinctly
unsuitable at present.</p>
<p>The ships hulked in their height and breadth down the long lines of
carefully aligned cells, and the man discarded line after line. He was
an expert at what he was doing now—and if his preliminary study of the
hangar registry had failed to give specific information beyond the
doubtful indication of a specific wing—one containing hundreds of
ships—his specialized knowledge could winnow those hundreds into
one.</p>
<p>There was the ghost of a sigh in the silence, as the man stopped and
faded down one of the lines; a crawling insect beneath the notice of the
arrogant metal monsters that rested there.</p>
<p>Here and there the sparkling of light from a porthole would indicate
the presence of an early returner from the organized pleasures to
simpler—or more private—pleasures of his own.</p>
<p>The man halted, and would have smiled if he ever smiled. Certainly
the convolutions of his brain performed the mental equivalent of a
smile.</p>
<p>The ship he stopped at was sleek and obviously fast. The peculiarity
of its design was what he wanted. It was not a usual model—and these
days most of the ships of this quadrant of the Galaxy either imitated
Foundation design or were built by Foundation technicians. But this was
special. This was a Foundation ship—if only because of the tiny bulges
in the skin that were the nodes of the protective screen that only a
Foundation ship could possess. There were other indications, too.</p>
<p>The man felt no hesitation.</p>
<p>The electronic barrier strung across the line of the ships as a
concession to privacy on the part of the management was not at all
important to him. It parted easily, and without activating the alarm, at
the use of the very special neutralizing force he had at his
disposal.</p>
<p>So the first knowledge within the ship of the intruder without was
the casual and almost friendly signal of the muted buzzer in the ship’s
living room that was the result of a palm placed over the little
photocell just one side of the main air lock.</p>
<p>And while that successful search went on, Toran and Bayta felt only
the most precarious security within the steel walls of the Bayta. The
Mule’s clown, who had reported that within his narrow compass of body he
held the lordly name of Magnifico Giganticus, sat hunched over the table
and gobbled at the food set before him.</p>
<p>His sad brown eyes lifted from his meal only to follow Bayta’s
movements in the combined kitchen and larder where he ate.</p>
<p>“The thanks of a weak one are of but little value,” he muttered, “but
you have them, for truly, in this past week, little but scraps have come
my way—and for all my body is small, yet is my appetite unseemly
great.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, eat!” said Bayta, with a smile. “Don’t waste your time
on thanks. Isn’t there a Central Galaxy proverb about gratitude that I
once heard?”</p>
<p>“Truly there is, my lady. For a wise man, I have been told, once
said, ‘Gratitude is best and most effective when it does not evaporate
itself in empty phrases.’ But alas, my lady, I am but a mass of empty
phrases, it would seem. When my empty phrases pleased the Mule, it
brought me a court dress, and a grand name—for, see you, it was
originally simply Bobo, one that pleases him not—and then when my empty
phrases pleased him not, it would bring upon my poor bones beatings and
whippings.”</p>
<p>Toran entered from the pilot room, “Nothing to do now but wait, Bay.
I hope the Mule is capable of understanding that a Foundation ship is
Foundation territory.”</p>
<p>Magnifico Giganticus, once Bobo, opened his eyes wide and exclaimed,
“How great is the Foundation before which even the cruel servants of the
Mule tremble.”</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the Foundation, too?” asked Bayta, with a little
smile.</p>
<p>“And who has not?” Magnifico’s voice was a mysterious whisper. “There
are those who say it is a world of great magic, of fires that can
consume planets, and secrets of mighty strength. They say that not the
highest nobility of the Galaxy could achieve the honor and deference
considered only the natural due of a simple man who could say ‘I am a
citizen of the Foundation,’—were he only a salvage miner of space, or a
nothing like myself.”</p>
<p>Bayta said, “Now, Magnifico, you’ll never finish if you make
speeches. Here, I’ll get you a little flavored milk. It’s good.”</p>
<p>She placed a pitcher of it upon the table and motioned Toran out of
the room.</p>
<p>“Torie, what are we going to do now—about him?” and she motioned
toward the kitchen.</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“If the Mule comes, are we going to give him up?”</p>
<p>“Well, what else, Bay?” He sounded harassed, and the gesture with
which he shoved back the moist curl upon his forehead testified to
that.</p>
<p>He continued impatiently, “Before I came here I had a sort of vague
idea that all we had to do was to ask for the Mule, and then get down to
business—just business, you know, nothing definite.”</p>
<p>“I know what you mean, Torie. I wasn’t much hoping to see the Mule
myself, but I did think we could pick up some firsthand knowledge of the
mess, and then pass it over to people who know a little more about this
interstellar intrigue. I’m no storybook spy.”</p>
<p>“You’re not behind me, Bay.” He folded his arms and frowned. “What a
situation! You’d never know there was a person like the Mule, except for
this last queer break. Do you suppose he’ll come for his clown?”</p>
<p>Bayta looked up at him. “I don’t know that I want him to. I don’t
know what to say or do. Do you?”</p>
<p>The inner buzzer sounded with its intermittent burring noise. Bayta’s
lips moved wordlessly, “The Mule!”</p>
<p>Magnifico was in the doorway, eyes wide, his voice a whimper, “The
Mule?”</p>
<p>Toran murmured, “I’ve got to let them in.”</p>
<p>A contact opened the air lock and the outer door closed behind the
newcomer. The scanner showed only a single shadowed figure.</p>
<p>“It’s only one person,” said Toran, with open relief, and his voice
was almost shaky as he bent toward the signal tube, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“You’d better let me in and find out, hadn’t you?” The words came
thinly out of the receiver.</p>
<p>“I’ll inform you that this is a Foundation ship and consequently
Foundation territory by international treaty.”</p>
<p>“I know that.”</p>
<p>“Come with your arms free, or I’ll shoot. I’m well-armed.”</p>
<p>“Done!”</p>
<p>Toran opened the inner door and closed contact on his blast pistol,
thumb hovering over the pressure point. There was the sound of footsteps
and then the door swung open, and Magnifico cried out, “It’s not the
Mule. It’s but a man.”</p>
<p>The “man” bowed to the clown somberly, “Very accurate. I’m not the
Mule.” He held his hands apart, “I’m not armed, and I come on a peaceful
errand. You might relax and put the blast pistol away. Your hand isn’t
steady enough for my peace of mind.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked Toran, brusquely.</p>
<p>“I might ask you that,” said the stranger, coolly, “since you’re the
one under false pretenses, not I.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who claims to be a Foundation citizen when there’s
not an authorized Trader on the planet.”</p>
<p>“That’s not so. How would you know?”</p>
<p>“Because I am a Foundation citizen, and have my papers to prove it.
Where are yours?”</p>
<p>“I think you’d better get out.”</p>
<p>“I think not. If you know anything about Foundation methods, and
despite your imposture you might, you’d know that if I don’t return
alive to my ship at a specified time, there’ll be a signal at the
nearest Foundation headquarters—so I doubt if your weapons will have
much effect, practically speaking.”</p>
<p>There was an irresolute silence and then Bayta said, calmly, “Put the
blaster away, Toran, and take him at face value. He sounds like the real
thing.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said the stranger.</p>
<p>Toran put his gun on the chair beside him, “Suppose you explain all
this now.”</p>
<p>The stranger remained standing. He was long of bone and large of
limb. His face consisted of hard flat planes and it was somehow evident
that he never smiled. But his eyes lacked hardness.</p>
<p>He said, “News travels quickly, especially when it is apparently
beyond belief. I don’t suppose there’s a person on Kalgan who doesn’t
know that the Mule’s men were kicked in the teeth today by two tourists
from the Foundation. I knew of the important details before evening,
and, as I said, there are no Foundation tourists aside from myself on
the planet. We know about those things.”</p>
<p>“Who are the ‘we’?”</p>
<p>“ ‘We’ are—‘we’! Myself for one! I knew you were at the Hangar—you
had been overheard to say so. I had my ways of checking the registry,
and my ways of finding the ship.”</p>
<p>He turned to Bayta suddenly, “You’re from the Foundation—by birth,
aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Am I?”</p>
<p>“You’re a member of the democratic opposition—they call it ‘the
underground.’ I don’t remember your name, but I do the face. You got out
only recently—and wouldn’t have if you were more important.”</p>
<p>Bayta shrugged, “You know a lot.”</p>
<p>“I do. You escaped with a man. That one?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter what I say?”</p>
<p>“No. I merely want a thorough mutual understanding. I believe that
the password during the week you left so hastily was ‘Seldon, Hardin,
and Freedom.’ Porfirat Hart was your section leader.”</p>
<p>“Where’d you get that?” Bayta was suddenly fierce. “Did the police
get him?” Toran held her back, but she shook herself loose and
advanced.</p>
<p>The man from the Foundation said quietly, “Nobody has him. It’s just
that the underground spreads widely and in queer places. I’m Captain Han
Pritcher of Information, and I’m a section leader myself—never mind
under what name.”</p>
<p>He waited, then said, “No, you don’t have to believe me. In our
business it is better to overdo suspicion than the opposite. But I’d
better get past the preliminaries.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Toran, “suppose you do.”</p>
<p>“May I sit down? Thanks.” Captain Pritcher swung a long leg across
his knee and let an arm swing loose over the back of the chair. “I’ll
start out by saying that I don’t know what all this is about—from your
angle. You two aren’t from the Foundation, but it’s not a hard guess
that you’re from one of the independent Trading worlds. That doesn’t
bother me overmuch. But out of curiosity, what do you want with that
fellow, that clown you snatched to safety? You’re risking your life to
hold on to him.”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you that.”</p>
<p>“Hm-m-m. Well, I didn’t think you would. But if you’re waiting for
the Mule himself to come behind a fanfarade of horns, drums, and
electric organs—relax! The Mule doesn’t work that way.”</p>
<p>“What?” It came from both Toran and Bayta, and in the corner where
Magnifico lurked with ears almost visibly expanded, there was a sudden
joyful start.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ve been trying to contact him myself, and doing a
rather more thorough job of it than you two amateurs can. It won’t work.
The man makes no personal appearance, does not allow himself to be
photographed or simulated, and is seen only by his most intimate
associates.”</p>
<p>“Is that supposed to explain your interest in us, captain?”
questioned Toran.</p>
<p>“No. That clown is the key. That clown is one of the very few that
have seen him. I want him. He may be the proof I need—and I need
something, Galaxy knows—to awaken the Foundation.”</p>
<p>“It needs awakening?” broke in Bayta with sudden sharpness. “Against
what? And in what role do you act as alarm, that of rebel democrat or of
secret police and provocateur?”</p>
<p>The captain’s face set in its hard lines. “When the entire Foundation
is threatened, Madame Revolutionary, both democrats and tyrants perish.
Let us save the tyrants from a greater, that we may overthrow them in
their turn.”</p>
<p>“Who’s the greater tyrant you speak of?” flared Bayta.</p>
<p>“The Mule! I know a bit about him, enough to have been my death
several times over already, if I had moved less nimbly. Send the clown
out of the room. This will require privacy.”</p>
<p>“Magnifico,” said Bayta, with a gesture, and the clown left without a
sound.</p>
<p>The captain’s voice was grave and intense, and low enough so that
Toran and Bayta drew close.</p>
<p>He said, “The Mule is a shrewd operator—far too shrewd not to realize
the advantage of the magnetism and glamour of personal leadership. If he
gives that up, it’s for a reason. That reason must be the fact that
personal contact would reveal something that is of overwhelming
importance not to reveal.”</p>
<p>He waved aside questions, and continued more quickly. “I went back to
his birthplace for this, and questioned people who for their knowledge
will not live long. Few enough are still alive. They remember the baby
born thirty years before—the death of his mother—his strange youth. The
Mule is not a human being!”</p>
<p>And his two listeners drew back in horror at the misty implications.
Neither understood, fully or clearly, but the menace of the phrase was
definite.</p>
<p>The captain continued, “He is a mutant, and obviously from his
subsequent career, a highly successful one. I don’t know his powers or
the exact extent to which he is what our thrillers would call a
‘superman,’ but the rise from nothing to the conqueror of Kalgan’s
warlord in two years is revealing. You see, don’t you, the danger? Can a
genetic accident of unpredictable biological properties be taken into
account in the Seldon plan?”</p>
<p>Slowly, Bayta spoke, “I don’t believe it. This is some sort of
complicated trickery. Why didn’t the Mule’s men kill us when they could
have, if he’s a superman?”</p>
<p>“I told you that I don’t know the extent of his mutation. He may not
be ready, yet, for the Foundation, and it would be a sign of the
greatest wisdom to resist provocation until ready. Now let me speak to
the clown.”</p>
<p>The captain faced the trembling Magnifico, who obviously distrusted
this huge, hard man who faced him.</p>
<p>The captain began slowly, “Have you seen the Mule with your own
eyes?”</p>
<p>“I have but too well, respected sir. And felt the weight of his arm
with my own body as well.”</p>
<p>“I have no doubt of that. Can you describe him?”</p>
<p>“It is frightening to recall him, respected sir. He is a man of
mighty frame. Against him, even you would be but a spindling. His hair
is of a burning crimson, and with all my strength and weight I could not
pull down his arm, once extended—not a hair’s thickness.” Magnifico’s
thinness seemed to collapse upon itself in a huddle of arms and legs.
“Often, to amuse his generals or to amuse only himself, he would suspend
me by one finger in my belt from a fearful height, while I chattered
poetry. It was only after the twentieth verse that I was withdrawn, and
each improvised and each a perfect rhyme, or else start over. He is a
man of overpowering might, respected sir, and cruel in the use of his
power—and his eyes, respected sir, no one sees.”</p>
<p>“What? What’s that last?”</p>
<p>“He wears spectacles, respected sir, of a curious nature. It is said
that they are opaque and that he sees by a powerful magic that far
transcends human powers. I have heard,” and his voice was small and
mysterious, “that to see his eyes is to see death; that he kills with
his eyes, respected sir.”</p>
<p>Magnifico’s eyes wheeled quickly from one watching face to another.
He quavered, “It is true. As I live, it is true.”</p>
<p>Bayta drew a long breath, “Sounds like you’re right, captain. Do you
want to take over?”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s look at the situation. You don’t owe anything here? The
hangar’s barrier above is free?”</p>
<p>“I can leave any time.”</p>
<p>“Then leave. The Mule may not wish to antagonize the Foundation, but
he runs a frightful risk in letting Magnifico get away. It probably
accounts for the hue and cry after the poor devil in the first place. So
there may be ships waiting for you upstairs. If you’re lost in space,
who’s to pin the crime?”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” agreed Toran, bleakly.</p>
<p>“However, you’ve got a shield and you’re probably speedier than
anything they’ve got, so as soon as you’re clear of the atmosphere make
the circle in neutral to the other hemisphere, then just cut a track
outwards at top acceleration.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Bayta coldly, “and when we are back on the Foundation,
what then, captain?”</p>
<p>“Why, you are then co-operative citizens of Kalgan, are you not? I
know nothing to the contrary, do I?”</p>
<p>Nothing was said. Toran turned to the controls. There was an
imperceptible lurch.</p>
<p>It was when Toran had left Kalgan sufficiently far in the rear to
attempt his first interstellar jump, that Captain Pritcher’s face first
creased slightly—for no ship of the Mule had in any way attempted to bar
their leaving.</p>
<p>“Looks like he’s letting us carry off Magnifico,” said Toran. “Not so
good for your story.”</p>
<p>“Unless,” corrected the captain, “he wants us to carry him off, in
which case it’s not so good for the Foundation.”</p>
<p>It was after the last jump, when within neutral-flight distance of
the Foundation, that the first hyper-wave news broadcast reached the
ship.</p>
<p>And there was one news item barely mentioned. It seemed that a
warlord—unidentified by the bored speaker—had made representations to
the Foundation concerning the forceful abduction of a member of his
court. The announcer went on to the sports news.</p>
<p>Captain Pritcher said icily, “He’s one step ahead of us after all.”
Thoughtfully, he added, “He’s ready for the Foundation, and he uses this
as an excuse for action. It makes things more difficult for us. We will
have to act before we are really ready.”</p>
