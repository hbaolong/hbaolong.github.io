<p>Janov Pelorat looked out at the dim landscape in the graying dawn
with an odd mixture of regret and uncertainty.</p>
<p>“We aren’t staying long enough, Golan. It seems a pleasant and
interesting world. I would like to learn more about it.”</p>
<p>Trevize looked up from the computer with a wry smile. “You don’t
think I would like to? We had three proper meals on the planet—totally
different and each excellent. I’d like more. And the only women we saw,
we saw briefly—and some of them looked quite enticing, for—well, for
what I’ve got in mind.”</p>
<p>Pelorat wrinkled his nose slightly. “Oh, my dear chap. Those cowbells
they call shoes, and all wrapped around in clashing colors, and whatever
do they do to their eyelashes. Did you notice their eyelashes?”</p>
<p>“You might just as well believe I noticed everything, Janov. What you
object to is superficial. They can easily be persuaded to wash their
faces and, at the proper time, off come the shoes and the colors.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I’ll take your word for that, Golan. However, I was
thinking more of investigating the matter of Earth further. What we’ve
been told about Earth, thus far, is so unsatisfactory, so
contradictory—radiation according to one person, robots according to
another.”</p>
<p>“Death in either case.”</p>
<p>“True,” said Pelorat reluctantly, “but it may be that one is true and
not the other, or that both are true to some extent, or that neither is
sure. Surely, Golan, when you hear tales that simply shroud matters in
thickening mists of doubt, surely you must feel the itch to explore, to
find out.”</p>
<p>“I do,” said Golan. “By every dwarf star in the Galaxy, I do. The
problem at hand, however, is Gaia. Once that is straightened out, we can
go to Earth, or come back here to Sayshell for a more extended stay. But
first, Gaia.”</p>
<p>Pelorat nodded. “The problem at hand! If we accept what Quintesetz
told us, death is waiting for us on Gaia. Ought we to be going?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I ask myself that. Are you afraid?”</p>
<p>Pelorat hesitated as though he were probing his own feelings. Then he
said in a quite simple and matter-of-fact manner, “Yes. Terribly!”</p>
<p>Trevize sat back in his chair and swiveled to face the other. He
said, just as quietly and matter-of-factly, “Janov, there’s no reason
for you to chance this. Say the word and I’ll let you off on Sayshell
with your personal belongings and with half our credits. I’ll pick you
up when I return and it will be on to Sirius Sector, if you wish, and
Earth, if that’s where it is. If I don’t return, the Foundation people
on Sayshell will see to it that you get back to Terminus. No hard
feelings if you stay behind, old friend.”</p>
<p>Pelorat’s eyes blinked rapidly and his lips pressed together for a
few moments. Then he said, rather huskily, “Old friend? We’ve known each
other what? A week or so? Isn’t it strange that I’m going to refuse to
leave the ship? I am afraid, but I want to remain with you.”</p>
<p>Trevize moved his hands in a gesture of uncertainty. “But why? I
honestly don’t ask it of you.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure why, but I ask it of myself. It’s—it’s— Golan, I have
faith in you. It seems to me you always know what you’re doing. I wanted
to go to Trantor, where probably—as I now see—nothing would have
happened. You insisted on Gaia and Gaia must somehow be a raw nerve in
the Galaxy. Things seem to happen in connection with it. And if that’s
not enough, Golan, I watched you force Quintesetz to give you the
information about Gaia. That was such a skillful bluff. I was lost in
admiration.”</p>
<p>“You have faith in me, then.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>Trevize put his hand on the other’s upper arm and seemed, for a
moment, to be searching for words. Finally he said, “Janov, will you
forgive me in advance if my judgment is wrong, and if you in one way or
another meet with—whatever unpleasant may be awaiting us?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Oh, my dear fellow, why do you ask? I make the
decision freely for my reasons, not yours. And, please—let us leave
quickly. I don’t trust my cowardice not to seize me by the throat and
shame me for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>“As you say, Janov,” said Trevize. “We’ll leave at the earliest
moment the computer will permit. This time, we’ll be moving
gravitically—straight up—as soon as we can be assured the atmosphere
above is clear of other ships. And as the surrounding atmosphere grows
less and less dense, we’ll put on more and more speed. Well within the
hour, we’ll be in open space.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Pelorat said and pinched the tip off a plastic coffee
container. The opened orifice almost at once began steaming. Pelorat put
the nipple to his mouth and sipped, allowing just enough air to enter
his mouth to cool the coffee to a bearable temperature.</p>
<p>Trevize grinned. “You’ve learned how to use those things beautifully.
You’re a space veteran, Janov.”</p>
<p>Pelorat stared at the plastic container for a moment and said, “Now
that we have ships that can adjust a gravitational field at will, surely
we can use ordinary containers, can’t we?”</p>
<p>“Of course, but you’re not going to get space people to give up their
space-centered apparatus. How is a space rat going to put distance
between himself and surface worms if he uses an open-mouthed cup? See
those rings on the walls and ceilings? Those have been traditional in
spacecraft for twenty thousand years and more, but they’re absolutely
useless in a gravitic ship. Yet they’re there and I’ll bet the entire
ship to a cup of coffee that your space rat will pretend he’s being
squashed into asphyxiation on takeoff and will then sway back and forth
from those rings as though he’s under zero-grav when its
gee-one—normal-grav, that is—on both occasions.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking.”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe a little, but there’s always social inertia to
everything—even technological advance. Those useless wall rings are
there and the cups they supply us have nipples.”</p>
<p>Pelorat nodded thoughtfully and continued to sip at his coffee.
Finally he said, “And when do we take off?”</p>
<p>Trevize laughed heartily and said, “Got you. I began talking about
wall rings and you never noticed that we were taking off right at that
time. We’re a mile high right now.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean it.”</p>
<p>“Look out.”</p>
<p>Pelorat did and then said, “But I never felt a thing.”</p>
<p>“You’re not supposed to.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t we breaking the regulations? Surely we ought to have followed
a radio beacon in an upward spiral, as we did in a downward spiral on
landing?”</p>
<p>“No reason to, Janov. No one will stop us. No one at all.”</p>
<p>“Coming down, you said—”</p>
<p>“That was different. They weren’t anxious to see us arrive, but
they’re ecstatic to see us go.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that, Golan? The only person who talked to us about
Gaia was Quintesetz and he begged us not to go.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you believe it, Janov. That was for form. He made sure we’d go
to Gaia. —Janov, you admired the way I bluffed the information out of
Quintesetz. I’m sorry, but I don’t deserve the admiration. If I had done
nothing at all, he would have offered the information. If I had tried to
plug my ears, he would have shouted it at me.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that, Golan? That’s crazy.”</p>
<p>“Paranoid? Yes, I know.” Trevize turned to the computer and extended
his sense intently. He said, “We’re not being stopped. No ships in
interfering distance, no warning messages of any kind.”</p>
<p>Again he swiveled in the direction of Pelorat. He said, “Tell me,
Janov, how did you find out about Gaia? You knew about Gaia while we
were still on Terminus. You knew it was in the Sayshell Sector. You knew
the name was, somehow, a form of Earth. Where did you hear all
this?”</p>
<p>Pelorat seemed to stiffen. He said, “If I were back in my office on
Terminus, I might consult my files. I have not brought everything with
me—certainly not the dates on which I first encountered this piece of
data or that.”</p>
<p>“Well, think about it,” said Trevize grimly. “Consider that the
Sayshellians themselves are close-mouthed about the matter. They are so
reluctant to talk about Gaia as it really is that they actually
encourage a superstition that has the common people of the sector
believing that no such planet exists in ordinary space. In fact, I can
tell you something else. Watch this!”</p>
<p>Trevize swung to the computer, his fingers sweeping across the
direction hand-rests with the ease and grace of long practice. When he
placed his hands on the manuals, he welcomed their warm touch and
enclosure. He felt, as always, a bit of his will oozing outward.</p>
<p>He said, “This is the computer’s Galactic map, as it existed within
its memory banks before we landed on Sayshell. I am going to show you
that portion of the map that represents the night sky of Sayshell as we
saw it this past night.”</p>
<p>The room darkened and a representation of a night sky sprang out onto
the screen.</p>
<p>Pelorat said in a low voice, “As beautiful as we saw it on
Sayshell.”</p>
<p>“More beautiful,” said Trevize, impatiently. “There is no atmospheric
interference of any kind, no clouds, no absorption at the horizon. But
wait, let me make an adjustment.”</p>
<p>The view shifted steadily, giving the two the uncomfortable
impression that it was they who were moving. Pelorat instinctively took
hold of the arms of his chair to steady himself.</p>
<p>“There!” said Trevize. “Do you recognize that?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Those are the Five Sisters—the pentagon of stars that
Quintesetz pointed out. It is unmistakable.”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed. But where is Gaia?”</p>
<p>Pelorat blinked. There was no dim star at the center.</p>
<p>“It’s not there,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s not there. And that’s because its location is not
included in the data banks of the computer. Since it passes the bounds
of likelihood that those data banks were deliberately made incomplete in
this respect for our benefit, I conclude that to the Foundation
galactographers who designed those data banks—and who had tremendous
quantities of information at their disposal—Gaia was unknown.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose if we had gone to Trantor—” began Pelorat.</p>
<p>“I suspect we would have found no data on Gaia there, either. Its
existence is kept a secret by the Sayshellians—and even more so, I
suspect, by the Gaians themselves. You yourself said a few days ago it
was not entirely uncommon that some worlds deliberately stayed out of
sight to avoid taxation or outside interference.”</p>
<p>“Usually,” said Pelorat, “when mapmakers and statisticians come
across such a world, they are found to exist in thinly populated
sections of the Galaxy. It’s isolation that makes it possible for them
to hide. Gaia is not isolated.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s another of the things that makes it unusual. So
let’s leave this map on the screen so that you and I might continue to
ponder the ignorance of our galactographers—and let me ask you again— In
view of this ignorance on the part of the most knowledgeable of people,
how did you come to hear of Gaia?”</p>
<p>“I have been gathering data on Earth myths, Earth legends, and Earth
histories for over thirty years, my good Golan. Without my complete
records, how could I possibly—”</p>
<p>“We can begin somewhere, Janov. Did you learn about it in, say, the
first fifteen years of your research or in the last fifteen?”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, if we’re going to be that broad, it was later on.”</p>
<p>“You can do better than that. Suppose I suggest that you learned of
Gaia only in the last couple of years.”</p>
<p>Trevize peered in Pelorat’s direction, felt the absence of any
ability to read an unseen expression in the dimness, and raised the
light level of the room a bit. The glory of the representation of the
night sky on the screen dimmed in proportion. Pelorat’s expression was
stony and revealed nothing.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking,” said Pelorat mildly. “You may be right. I wouldn’t
swear to it. When I wrote Jimbor of Ledbet University, I didn’t mention
Gaia, though in that case it would have been appropriate to do so, and
that was in—let’s see—in ’95 and that was three years ago. I think
you’re right, Golan.”</p>
<p>“And how did you come upon it?” asked Trevize. “In a communication? A
book? A scientific paper? Some ancient song? How?—Come on!”</p>
<p>Pelorat sat back and crossed his arms. He fell into deep thought and
didn’t move. Trevize said nothing and waited.</p>
<p>Finally Pelorat said, “In a private communication. —But it’s no use
asking me from whom, my dear chap. I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>Trevize moved his hands over his sash. They felt clammy as he
continued his efforts to elicit information without too clearly forcing
words into the other’s mouth. He said, “From a historian? From an expert
in mythology? From a galactographer?”</p>
<p>“No use. I cannot match a name to the communication.”</p>
<p>“Because, perhaps, there was none.”</p>
<p>“Oh no. That scarcely seems possible.”</p>
<p>“Why? Would you have rejected an anonymous communication?”</p>
<p>“I suppose not.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever receive any?”</p>
<p>“Once in a long while. In recent years, I had become well known in
certain academic circles as a collector of particular types of myths and
legends and some of my correspondents were occasionally kind enough to
forward material they had picked up from nonacademic sources. Sometimes
these might not be attributed to anyone in particular.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Yes, but did you ever receive anonymous information
directly, and not by way of some academic correspondent?”</p>
<p>“That sometimes happened—but very rarely.”</p>
<p>“And can you be certain that this was not so in the case of
Gaia?”</p>
<p>“Such anonymous communications took place so rarely that I should
think I would remember if it had happened in this case. Still, I can’t
say certainly that the information was not of anonymous origin. Mind,
though, that’s not to say that I did receive the information from an
anonymous source.”</p>
<p>“I realize that. But it remains a possibility, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, very reluctantly, “I suppose it does. But what’s all
this about?”</p>
<p>“I’m not finished,” said Trevize peremptorily. “Where did you get the
information from—anonymous or not? What world?”</p>
<p>Pelorat shrugged. “Come now, I haven’t the slightest idea.”</p>
<p>“Could it possibly have been from Sayshell?”</p>
<p>“I told you. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I’m suggesting you did get it from Sayshell.”</p>
<p>“You can suggest all you wish, but that does not necessarily make it
so.”</p>
<p>“No? When Quintesetz pointed out the dim star at the center of the
Five Sisters, you knew at once it was Gaia. You said so later on to
Quintesetz, identifying it before he did. Do you remember?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“How was that possible? How did you recognize at once that the dim
star was Gaia?”</p>
<p>“Because in the material I had on Gaia, it was rarely referred to by
that name. Euphemisms were common, many different ones. One of the
euphemisms, several times repeated, was ‘the little Brother of the Five
Sisters.’ Another was ‘the Pentagon’s Center’ and sometimes it was
called ‘o Pentagon.’ When Quintesetz pointed out the Five Sisters and
the central star, the allusions came irresistibly to mind.”</p>
<p>“You never mentioned those allusions to me earlier.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what they meant and I didn’t think it would have been
important to discuss the matter with you, who were a—” Pelorat
hesitated.</p>
<p>“A nonspecialist?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You realize, I hope, that the pentagon of the Five Sisters is an
entirely relative form.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Trevize laughed affectionately. “You surface worm. Do you think the
sky has an objective shape of its own? That the stars are nailed in
place? The pentagon has the shape it has from the surface of the worlds
of the planetary system to which Sayshell Planet belongs—and from there
only. From a planet circling any other star, the appearance of the Five
Sisters is different. They are seen from a different angle, for one
thing. For another, the five stars of the pentagon are at different
distances from Sayshell and, seen from other angles, there could be no
visible relationship among them at all. One or two stars might be in one
half of the sky, the others in the other half. See here—”</p>
<p>Trevize darkened the room again and leaned over the computer. “There
are eighty-six populated planetary systems making up the Sayshell Union.
Let us keep Gaia—or the spot where Gaia ought to be—in place” (as he
said that, a small red circle appeared in the center of the pentagon of
the Five Sisters) “and shift to the skies as seen from any of the other
eighty-six worlds taken at random.”</p>
<p>The sky shifted and Pelorat blinked. The small red circle remained at
the center of the screen, but the Five Sisters had disappeared. There
were bright stars in the neighborhood but no tight pentagon. Again the
sky shifted, and again, and again. It went on shifting. The red circle
remained in place always, but at no time did a small pentagon of equally
bright stars appear. Sometimes what might be a distorted pentagon of
stars—unequally bright—appeared, but nothing like the beautiful asterism
Quintesetz had pointed out.</p>
<p>“Had enough?” said Trevize. “I assure you, the Five Sisters can never
be seen exactly as we have seen it from any populated world but the
worlds of the Sayshell planetary system.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “The Sayshellian view might have been exported to other
planets. There were many proverbs in Imperial times—some of which linger
into our own, in fact—that are Trantor-centered.”</p>
<p>“With Sayshell as secretive about Gaia as we know it to be? And why
should worlds outside the Sayshell Union be interested? Why would they
care about a ‘little Brother of the Five Sisters’ if there were nothing
in the skies at which to point?”</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Then don’t you see that your original information must have come
from Sayshell itself? Not just from somewhere in the Union, but
precisely from the planetary system to which the capital world of the
Union belongs.”</p>
<p>Pelorat shook his head. “You make it sound as though it must, but
it’s not something I remember. I simply don’t.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, you do see the force of my argument, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“Next—When do you suppose the legend could have originated?”</p>
<p>“Anytime. I should suppose it developed far back in the Imperial Era.
It has the feel of an ancient—”</p>
<p>“You are wrong, Janov. The Five Sisters are moderately close to
Sayshell Planet, which is why they’re so bright. Four of them have high
proper motions in consequence and no two are part of a family, so that
they move in different directions. Watch what happens as I shift the map
backward in time slowly.”</p>
<p>Again the red circle that marked the site of Gaia remained in place,
but the pentagon slowly fell apart, as four of the stars drifted in
different directions and the fifth shifted slightly.</p>
<p>“Look at that, Janov,” said Trevize. “Would you say that was a
regular pentagon?”</p>
<p>“Clearly lopsided,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>“And is Gaia at the center?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s well to the side.”</p>
<p>“Very well. That is how the asterism looked one hundred and fifty
years ago. One and a half centuries, that’s all. —The material you
received concerning ‘the Pentagon’s Center’ and so on made no real sense
till this century anywhere, not even in Sayshell. The material you
received had to originate in Sayshell and sometime in this century,
perhaps in the last decade. And you got it, even though Sayshell is so
close-mouthed about Gaia.”</p>
<p>Trevize put the lights on, turned the star map off, and sat there
staring sternly at Pelorat.</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I’m confused. What’s this about?”</p>
<p>“You tell me. Consider! Somehow I got the idea into my head that the
Second Foundation still existed. I was giving a talk during my election
campaign. I started a bit of emotional byplay designed to squeeze votes
out of the undecided with a dramatic ‘If the Second Foundation still
existed—’ and later that day I thought to myself: What if it did still
exist? I began reading history books and within a week, I was convinced.
There was no real evidence, but I have always felt that I had the knack
of snatching the right conclusion out of a welter of speculation. This
time, though—”</p>
<p>Trevize brooded a bit, then went on. “And look at what has happened
since. Of all people, I chose Compor as my confidant and he betrayed me.
Whereupon Mayor Branno had me arrested and sent into exile. Why into
exile, rather than just having me imprisoned, or trying to threaten me
into silence? And why in a very late-model ship which gives me
extraordinary powers of Jumping through the Galaxy? And why, of all
things, does she insist I take you and suggest that I help you search
for Earth?</p>
<p>“And why was I so certain that we should not go to Trantor? I was
convinced you had a better target for our investigations and at once you
come up with the mystery world of Gaia, concerning which, as it now
turns out, you gained information under very puzzling circumstances.</p>
<p>“We go to Sayshell—the first natural stop—and at once we encounter
Compor, who gives us a circumstantial story about Earth and its death.
He then assures us its location is in the Sirius Sector and urges us to
go there.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “There you are. You seem to be implying that all
circumstances are forcing us toward Gaia, but, as you say, Compor tried
to persuade us to go elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“And in response, I was determined to continue on our original line
of investigation out of my sheer distrust for the man. Don’t you suppose
that that was what he might have been counting on? He may have
deliberately told us to go elsewhere just to keep us from doing so.”</p>
<p>“That’s mere romance,” muttered Pelorat.</p>
<p>“Is it? Let’s go on. We get in touch with Quintesetz simply because
he was handy—”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Pelorat. “I recognized his name.”</p>
<p>“It seemed familiar to you. You had never read anything he had
written—that you could recall. Why was it familiar to you? —In any case,
it turned out he had read a paper of yours and was overwhelmed by it—and
how likely was that? You yourself admit your work is not widely
known.</p>
<p>“What’s more, the young lady leading us to him quite gratuitously
mentions Gaia and goes on to tell us it is in hyperspace, as though to
be sure we keep it in mind. When we ask Quintesetz about it, he behaves
as though he doesn’t want to talk about it, but he doesn’t throw us
out—even though I am rather rude to him. He takes us to his home instead
and, on the way there, goes to the trouble of pointing out the Five
Sisters. He even makes sure we note the dim star at the center. Why? Is
not all this an extraordinary concatenation of coincidence?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “If you list it like that—”</p>
<p>“List it any way you please,” said Trevize. “I don’t believe in
extraordinary concatenations of coincidence.”</p>
<p>“What does all this mean, then? That we are being maneuvered to
Gaia?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“By whom?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Surely there can be no question about that. Who is
capable of adjusting minds, of giving gentle nudges to this one or that,
of managing to divert progress in this direction or that?”</p>
<p>“You’re going to tell me it’s the Second Foundation.”</p>
<p>“Well, what have we been told about Gaia? It is untouchable. Fleets
that move against it are destroyed. People who reach it do not return.
Even the Mule didn’t dare move against it—and the Mule, in fact, was
probably born there. Surely it seems that Gaia is the Second
Foundation—and finding that, after all, is my ultimate goal.”</p>
<p>Pelorat shook his head. “But according to some historians, the Second
Foundation stopped the Mule. How could he have been one of them?”</p>
<p>“A renegade, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“But why should we be so relentlessly maneuvered toward the Second
Foundation by the Second Foundation?”</p>
<p>Trevize’s eyes were unfocused, his brow furrowed. He said, “Let’s
reason it out. It has always seemed important to the Second Foundation
that as little information as possible about it should be available to
the Galaxy. Ideally it wants its very existence to remain unknown. We
know that much about them. For a hundred twenty years, the Second
Foundation was thought to be extinct and that must have suited them
right down to the Galactic core. Yet when I began to suspect that they
did exist, they did nothing. Compor knew. They might have used him to
shut me up one way or another—had me killed, even. Yet they did
nothing.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “They had you arrested, if you want to blame that on
the Second Foundation. According to what you told me, that resulted in
the people of Terminus not knowing about your views. The people of the
Second Foundation accomplished that much without violence and they may
be devotees of Salvor Hardin’s remark that ‘Violence is the last refuge
of the incompetent.’”</p>
<p>“But keeping it from the people of Terminus accomplishes nothing.
Mayor Branno knows my view and—at the very least—must wonder if I am
correct. So now, you see, it is too late for them to harm us. If they
had gotten rid of me to begin with, they would be in the clear. If they
had left me alone altogether, they might have still remained in the
clear, for they might have maneuvered Terminus into believing I was an
eccentric, perhaps a madman. The prospective ruin of my political career
might even have forced me into silence as soon as I saw what the
announcement of my beliefs would mean.</p>
<p>“And now it is too late for them to do anything. Mayor Branno was
suspicious enough of the situation to send Compor after me and—having no
faith in him either, being wiser than I was—she placed a hyper-relay on
Compor’s ship. In consequence, she knows we are on Sayshell. And last
night, while you were sleeping, I had our computer place a message
directly into the computer of the Foundation ambassador here on
Sayshell, explaining that we were on our way to Gaia. I took the trouble
of giving its coordinates, too. If the Second Foundation does anything
to us now, I am certain that Branno will have the matter
investigated—and the concentrated attention of the Foundation must
surely be what they don’t want.”</p>
<p>“Would they care about attracting the Foundation’s attention, if they
are so powerful?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize forcefully. “They lie hidden because, in some
ways, they must be weak and because the Foundation is technologically
advanced perhaps beyond even what Seldon himself might have foreseen.
The very quiet, even stealthy, way in which they’ve been maneuvering us
to their world would seem to show their eager desire to do nothing that
will attract attention. And if so, then they have already lost, at least
in part—for they’ve attracted attention and I doubt they can do anything
to reverse the situation.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “But why do they go through all this? Why do they ruin
themselves—if your analysis is correct—by angling for us across the
Galaxy? What is it they want of us?”</p>
<p>Trevize stared at Pelorat and flushed. “Janov,” he said, “I have a
feeling about this. I have this gift of coming to a correct conclusion
on the basis of almost nothing. There’s a kind of sureness about me that
tells me when I’m right—and I’m sure now. There’s something I have that
they want—and want enough to risk their very existence for. I don’t know
what it can be, but I’ve got to find out, because if I’ve got it and if
it’s that powerful, then I want to be able to use it for what I feel is
right.” He shrugged slightly. “Do you still want to come along with me,
old friend, now that you see how much a madman I am?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I told you I had faith in you. I still do.”</p>
<p>And Trevize laughed with enormous relief. “Marvelous! Because another
feeling I have is that you are, for some reason, also essential to this
whole thing. In that case, Janov, we move on to Gaia, full speed.
Forward!”</p>

</ol>
<p>Mayor Harla Branno looked distinctly older than her sixty-two years.
She did not always look older, but she did now. She had been
sufficiently wrapped up in thought to forget to avoid the mirror and had
seen her image on her way into the map room. So she was aware of the
haggardness of her appearance.</p>
<p>She sighed. It drained the life out of one. Five years a Mayor and
for twelve years before that the real power behind two figureheads. All
of it had been quiet, all of it successful, all of it—draining. How
would it have been, she wondered, if there had been
strain—failure—disaster.</p>
<p>Not so bad for her personally, she suddenly decided. Action would
have been invigorating. It was the horrible knowledge that nothing but
drift was possible that had worn her out.</p>
<p>It was the Seldon Plan that was successful and it was the Second
Foundation that made sure it would continue to be. She, as the strong
hand at the helm of the Foundation (actually the First Foundation, but
no one on Terminus ever thought of adding the adjective) merely rode the
crest.</p>
<p>History would say little or nothing about her. She merely sat at the
controls of a spaceship, while the spaceship was maneuvered from
without.</p>
<p>Even Indbur III, who had presided over the Foundation’s catastrophic
fall to the Mule, had done something. He had, at least, collapsed.</p>
<p>For Mayor Branno there would be nothing!</p>
<p>Unless this Golan Trevize, this thoughtless Councilman, this
lightning rod, made it possible—</p>
<p>She looked at the map thoughtfully. It was not the kind of structure
produced by a modern computer. It was, rather, a three-dimensional
cluster of lights that pictured the Galaxy holographically in midair.
Though it could not be made to move, to turn, to expand, or to contract,
one could move about it and see it from any angle.</p>
<p>A large section of the Galaxy, perhaps a third of the whole
(excluding the core, which was a “no-life’s land”) turned red when she
touched a contact. That was the Foundation Federation, the more than
seven million inhabited worlds ruled by the Council and by herself—the
seven million inhabited worlds who voted for and were represented in the
House of Worlds, which debated matters of minor importance, and then
voted on them, and never, by any chance, dealt with anything of major
importance.</p>
<p>Another contact and a faint pink jutted outward from the edges of the
Federation, here and there. Spheres of influence! This was not
Foundation territory, but the regions, though nominally independent,
would never dream of resistance to any Foundation move.</p>
<p>There was no question in her mind that no power in the Galaxy could
oppose the Foundation (not even the Second Foundation, if one but knew
where it was), that the Foundation could, at will, reach out its fleet
of modern ships and simply set up the Second Empire.</p>
<p>But only five centuries had passed since the beginning of the Plan.
The Plan called for ten centuries before the Second Empire could be set
up and the Second Foundation would make sure the Plan would hold. The
Mayor shook her sad, gray head. If the Foundation acted now, it would
somehow fail. Though its ships were irresistible, action now would
fail.</p>
<p>Unless Trevize, the lightning rod, drew the lightning of the Second
Foundation—and the lightning could be traced back to its source.</p>
<p>She looked about. Where was Kodell? This was no time for him to be
late.</p>
<p>It was as though her thought had called him, for he came striding in,
smiling cheerfully, looking more grandfatherly than ever with his
gray-white mustache and tanned complexion. Grandfatherly, but not old.
To be sure, he was eight years younger than she was.</p>
<p>How was it he showed no marks of strain? Did not fifteen years as
Director of Security leave its scar?</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Kodell nodded slowly in the formal greeting that was necessary in
initiating a discussion with the Mayor. It was a tradition that had
existed since the bad days of the Indburs. Almost everything had
changed, but etiquette least of all.</p>
<p>He said, “Sorry I’m late, Mayor, but your arrest of Councilman
Trevize is finally beginning to make its way through the anesthetized
skin of the Council.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” said the Mayor phlegmatically. “Are we in for a palace
revolution?”</p>
<p>“Not the least chance. We’re in control. But there’ll be noise.”</p>
<p>“Let them make noise. It will make them feel better, and I—I shall
stay out of the way. I can count, I suppose, on general public
opinion?”</p>
<p>“I think you can. Especially away from Terminus. No one outside
Terminus cares what happens to a stray Councilman.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Ah? More news?”</p>
<p>“Liono,” said the Mayor, “I want to know about Sayshell.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a two-legged history book,” said Liono Kodell, smiling.</p>
<p>“I don’t want history. I want the truth. Why is Sayshell independent?
—Look at it.” She pointed to the red of the Foundation on the
holographic map and there, well into the inner spirals, was an
in-pocketing of white.</p>
<p>Branno said, “We’ve got it almost encapsulated—almost sucked in—yet
it’s white. Our map doesn’t even show it as a loyal-ally-in-pink.”</p>
<p>Kodell shrugged. “It’s not officially a loyal ally, but it never
bothers us. It is neutral.”</p>
<p>“All right. See this, then.” Another touch at the controls. The red
sprang out distinctly further. It covered nearly half the Galaxy.
“That,” said Mayor Branno, “was the Mule’s realm at the time of his
death. If you’ll peer in among the red, you’ll find the Sayshell Union,
completely surrounded this time, but still white. It is the only enclave
left free by the Mule.”</p>
<p>“It was neutral then, too.”</p>
<p>“The Mule had no great respect for neutrality.”</p>
<p>“He seems to have had, in this case.”</p>
<p>“Seems to have had. What has Sayshell got?”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “Nothing! Believe me, Mayor, she is ours any time we
want her.”</p>
<p>“Is she? Yet somehow she isn’t ours.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to want her.”</p>
<p>Branno sat back in her chair and, with a sweep of her arm over the
controls, turned the Galaxy dark. “I think we now want her.”</p>
<p>“Pardon, Mayor?”</p>
<p>“Liono, I sent that foolish Councilman into space as a lightning rod.
I felt that the Second Foundation would see him as a greater danger than
he was and see the Foundation itself as the lesser danger. The lightning
would strike him and reveal its origin to us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mayor!”</p>
<p>“My intention was that he go to the decayed ruins of Trantor to
fumble through what—if anything—was left of its Library and search for
the Earth. That’s the world, you remember, that these wearisome mystics
tell us was the site of origin of humanity, as though that matters, even
in the unlikely case it is true. The Second Foundation couldn’t possibly
have believed that was really what he was after and they would have
moved to find out what he was really looking for.”</p>
<p>“But he didn’t go to Trantor.”</p>
<p>“No. Quite unexpectedly, he has gone to Sayshell.</p>
<p>Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But please forgive an old bloodhound whose duty it is
to suspect everything and tell me how you know he and this Pelorat have
gone to Sayshell. I know that Compor reports it, but how far can we
trust Compor?”</p>
<p>“The hyper-relay tells us that Compor’s ship has indeed landed on
Sayshell Planet.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, but how do you know that Trevize and Pelorat have?
Compor may have gone to Sayshell for his own reasons and may not know—or
care—where the others are.”</p>
<p>“The fact is, that our ambassador on Sayshell has informed us of the
arrival of the ship on which we placed Trevize and Pelorat. I am not
ready to believe the ship arrived at Sayshell without them. What is
more, Compor reports having talked to them and, if he cannot be trusted,
we have other reports placing them at Sayshell University, where they
consulted with a historian of no particular note.”</p>
<p>“None of this,” said Kodell mildly, “has reached me.”</p>
<p>Branno sniffed. “Do not feel stepped on. I am dealing with this
personally and the information has now reached you—with not much in the
way of delay, either. The latest news—just received—is from the
ambassador. Our lightning rod is moving on. He stayed on Sayshell Planet
two days, then left. He is heading for another planet system, he says,
some ten parsecs away. He gave the name and the Galactic coordinates of
his destination to the ambassador, who passed them on to us.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything corroborative from Compor?”</p>
<p>“Compor’s message that Trevize and Pelorat have left Sayshell came
even before the ambassador’s message. Compor has not yet determined
where Trevize is going. Presumably he will follow.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “We are missing the why’s of the situation.” He popped a
pastille into his mouth and sucked at it meditatively. “Why did Trevize
go to Sayshell? Why did he leave?”</p>
<p>“The question that intrigues me most is: Where? Where is Trevize
going?”</p>
<p>“You did say, Mayor, did you not, that he gave the name and
coordinates of his destination to the ambassador. Are you implying that
he lied to the ambassador? Or that the ambassador is lying to us?”</p>
<p>“Even assuming everyone told the truth all round and that no one made
any errors, there is a name that interests me. Trevize told the
ambassador he was going to Gaia. That’s G-A-I-A. Trevize was careful to
spell it.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “Gaia? I never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? That’s not strange.” Branno pointed to the spot in the air
where the map had been. “Upon the map in this room, I can set up, at a
moment’s notice, every star—supposedly—around which there circles an
inhabited world and many prominent stars with uninhabited systems. Over
thirty million stars can be marked out—if I handle the controls
properly—in single units, in pairs, in clusters. I can mark them out in
any of five different colors, one at a time, or all together. What I
cannot do is locate Gaia on the map. As far as the map is concerned,
Gaia does not exist.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “For every star the map shows, there are ten thousand it
doesn’t show.”</p>
<p>“Granted, but the stars it doesn’t show lack inhabited planets and
why would Trevize want to go to an uninhabited planet?”</p>
<p>“Have you tried the Central Computer? It has all three hundred
billion Galactic stars listed.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been told it has, but does it? We know very well, you and I,
that there are thousands of inhabited planets that have escaped listing
on any of our maps—not only on the one in this room, but even on the
Central Computer. Gaia is apparently one of them.”</p>
<p>Kodell’s voice remained calm, even coaxing. “Mayor, there may well be
nothing at all to be concerned about. Trevize may be off on a wild goose
chase or he may be lying to us and there is no star called Gaia—and no
star at all at the coordinates he gave us. He is trying to throw us off
his scent, now that he has met Compor and perhaps guesses he is being
traced.”</p>
<p>“How will this throw us off the scent? Compor will still follow. No,
Liono, I have another possibility in mind, one with far greater
potentiality for trouble. Listen to me—”</p>
<p>She paused and said, “This room is shielded, Liono. Understand that.
We cannot be overheard by anyone, so please feel free to speak. And I
will speak freely, as well.</p>
<p>“This Gaia is located, if we accept the information, ten parsecs from
Sayshell Planet and is therefore part of the Sayshell Union. The
Sayshell Union is a well-explored portion of the Galaxy. All its star
systems—inhabited or not inhabited—are recorded and the inhabited ones
are known in detail. Gaia is the one exception. Inhabited or not, none
have heard of it; it is present in no map. Add to this that the Sayshell
Union maintains a peculiar state of independence with respect to the
Foundation Federation, and did so even with respect to the Mule’s former
realm. It has been independent since the fall of the Galactic
Empire.”</p>
<p>“What of all this?” asked Kodell cautiously.</p>
<p>“Surely the two points I have made must be connected. Sayshell
incorporates a planetary system that is totally unknown and Sayshell is
untouchable. The two cannot be independent. Whatever Gaia is, it
protects itself. It sees to it that there is no knowledge of its
existence outside its immediate surroundings and it protects those
surroundings so that outsiders cannot take over.”</p>
<p>“You are telling me, Mayor, that Gaia is the seat of the Second
Foundation?”</p>
<p>“I am telling you that Gaia deserves inspection.”</p>
<p>“May I mention an odd point that might be difficult to explain by
this theory?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>“If Gaia is the Second Foundation and if, for centuries, it has
protected itself physically against intruders, protecting all of the
Sayshell Union as a broad, deep shield for itself, and if it has even
prevented knowledge of itself leaking into the Galaxy—then why has all
that protection suddenly vanished? Trevize and Pelorat leave Terminus
and, even though you had advised them to go to Trantor, they go
immediately and without hesitation to Sayshell and now to Gaia. What is
more, you can think of Gaia and speculate on it. Why are you not somehow
prevented from doing so?”</p>
<p>Mayor Branno did not answer for a long time. Her head was bent and
her gray hair gleamed dully in the light. Then she said, “Because I
think Councilman Trevize has somehow upset things. He has done
something—or is doing something—that is in some way endangering the
Seldon Plan.”</p>
<p>“That surely is impossible, Mayor.”</p>
<p>“I suppose everything and everyone has its flaws. Even Hari Seldon
was not perfect, surely. Somewhere the Plan has a flaw and Trevize has
stumbled upon it, perhaps without even knowing that he has. We must know
what is happening and we must be on the spot.”</p>
<p>Finally Kodell looked grave. “Don’t make decisions on your own,
Mayor. We don’t want to move without adequate consideration.”</p>
<p>“Don’t take me for an idiot, Liono. I’m not going to make war. I’m
not going to land an expeditionary force on Gaia. I just want to be on
the spot—or near it, if you prefer. Liono, find out for me—I hate
talking to a war office that is as ridiculously hidebound as one is sure
to be after one hundred and twenty years of peace, but you don’t seem to
mind—just how many warships are stationed close to Sayshell. Can we make
their movements seem routine and not like a mobilization?”</p>
<p>“In these piping times of peace, there are not many ships in the
vicinity, I am sure. But I will find out.”</p>
<p>“Even two or three will be sufficient, especially if one is of the
Supernova class.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to do with them?”</p>
<p>“I want them to nudge as close to Sayshell as they can—without
creating an incident—and I want them sufficiently close to each other to
offer mutual support.”</p>
<p>“What’s all this intended for?”</p>
<p>“Flexibility. I want to be able to strike if I have to.”</p>
<p>“Against the Second Foundation? If Gaia can keep itself isolated and
untouchable against the Mule, it can surely withstand a few ships
now.”</p>
<p>Branno said, with the gleam of battle in her eyes, “My friend, I told
you that nothing and no one is perfect, not even Hari Seldon. In setting
up his Plan, he could not help being a person of his times. He was a
mathematician of the days of the dying Empire, when technology was
moribund. It followed that he could not have made sufficient allowance
in his Plan for technological advance. Gravitics, for instance, is a
whole new direction of advance he could not possibly have guessed at.
And there are other advances, too.”</p>
<p>“Gaia might also have advanced.”</p>
<p>“In isolation? Come. There are ten quadrillion human beings within
the Foundation Federation, from among whom contributors to technological
advance can step forward. A single isolated world can do nothing in
comparison. Our ships will advance and I will be with them.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Mayor. “What was that?”</p>
<p>“I will be going myself to the ships that will gather at the borders
of Sayshell. I wish to see the situation for myself.”</p>
<p>Kodell’s mouth fell open for a moment. He swallowed and made a
distinct noise as he did so. “Mayor, that is—not wise.” If ever a man
clearly intended a stronger remark, Kodell did.</p>
<p>“Wise or not,” said Branno violently, “I will do it. I am tired of
Terminus and of its endless political battles, its infighting, its
alliances and counteralliances, its betrayals and renewals. I’ve had
seventeen years at the center of it and I want to do something
else—anything else. Out there,” she waved her hand in a direction taken
at random, “the whole history of the Galaxy may be changing and I want
to take part in the process.”</p>
<p>“You know nothing about such things, Mayor.”</p>
<p>“Who does, Liono?” She rose stiffly to her feet. “As soon as you
bring me the information I need on the ships and as soon as I can make
arrangements for carrying on with the foolish business at home, I will
go.—And, Liono, don’t try to maneuver me out of this decision in any way
or I’ll wipe out our long friendship in a stroke and break you. I can
still do that.”</p>
<p>Kodell nodded. “I know you can, Mayor, but before you decide, may I
ask you to reconsider the power of Seldon’s Plan? What you intend may be
suicide.”</p>
<p>“I have no fears on that score, Liono. It was wrong with respect to
the Mule, whom it could not anticipate—and a failure to anticipate at
one time implies the possibility of failure at another.”</p>
<p>Kodell sighed. “Well then, if you are really determined, I will
support you to the best of my ability and with complete loyalty.”</p>
<p>“Good. I warn you once again that you had better mean that remark
with all your heart. And with that in mind, Liono, let us move on to
Gaia. Forward!”</p>
