<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>The Wye Sector had a tradition of opposition to the Entun Dynasty of
Cleon I that had been ruling the Empire for over two centuries. The
opposition dated back to a time when the line of Mayors of Wye had
contributed members who had served as Emperor. The Wyan Dynasty had
neither lasted long nor had it been conspicuously successful, but the
people and rulers of Wye found it difficult to forget that they had once
been—however imperfectly and temporarily—supreme. The brief period when
Rashelle, as the self-appointed Mayor of Wye, had challenged the Empire,
eighteen years earlier, had added both to Wye’s pride and to its
frustration.</p>
<p>All this made it reasonable that the small band of leading
conspirators should feel as safe in Wye as they would feel anywhere on
Trantor.</p>
<p>Five of them sat around a table in a room in a rundown portion of the
sector. The room was poorly furnished but well shielded.</p>
<p>In a chair which, by its marginal superiority in quality to the
others, sat the man who might well be judged to be the leader. He had a
thin face, a sallow complexion, and a wide mouth with lips so pale as to
be nearly invisible. There was a touch of gray in his hair, but his eyes
burned with an inextinguishable anger.</p>
<p>He was staring at the man seated exactly opposite him—distinctly
older and softer, his hair almost white, his plump cheeks tending to
quiver when he spoke.</p>
<p>The leader said sharply, “Well? It is quite apparent that you have
done nothing. Explain that!”</p>
<p>The older man said, “I am an old Joranumite, Namarti. Why do I have
to explain my actions?”</p>
<p>Gambol Deen Namarti, once the right-hand man of Laskin “Jo-Jo”
Joranum, said, “There are many old Joranumites. Some are incompetent,
some are soft, some have forgotten. Being an old Joranumite may mean no
more than that one is an old fool.”</p>
<p>The older man sat back in his chair. “Are you calling me an old fool?
Me? Kaspal Kaspalov? I was with Jo-Jo when you had not yet joined the
party, when you were a ragged nothing in search of a cause.”</p>
<p>“I am not calling you a fool,” said Namarti sharply. “I say simply
that some old Joranumites are fools. You have a chance now to show me
that you are not one of them.”</p>
<p>“My association with Jo-Jo—”</p>
<p>“Forget that. He’s dead!”</p>
<p>“I should think his spirit lives on.”</p>
<p>“If that thought will help us in our fight, then his spirit lives on.
But to others—not to us. We know he made mistakes.”</p>
<p>“I deny that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t insist on making a hero out of a mere man who made mistakes.
He thought he could move the Empire by the strength of oratory alone, by
words—”</p>
<p>“History shows that words have moved mountains in the past.”</p>
<p>“Not Joranum’s words, obviously, because he made mistakes. He hid his
Mycogenian origins far too clumsily. Worse, he let himself be tricked
into accusing First Minister Eto Demerzel of being a robot. I warned him
against that accusation, but he wouldn’t listen—and it destroyed him.
Now let’s start fresh, shall we? Whatever use we make of Joranum’s
memory for outsiders, let us not ourselves be transfixed by it.”</p>
<p>Kaspalov sat silent. The other three transferred their gaze from
Namarti to Kaspalov and back, content to let Namarti carry the weight of
the discussion.</p>
<p>“With Joranum’s exile to Nishaya, the Joranumite movement fell apart
and seemed to vanish,” said Namarti harshly. “It would, indeed, have
vanished—but for me. Bit by bit and rubble by rubble, I rebuilt it into
a network that extends over all of Trantor. You know this, I take
it.”</p>
<p>“I know it, Chief,” mumbled Kaspalov. The use of the title made it
plain that Kaspalov was seeking reconciliation.</p>
<p>Namarti smiled tightly. He did not insist on the title, but he always
enjoyed hearing it used. He said, “You’re part of this network and you
have your duties.”</p>
<p>Kaspalov stirred. He was clearly debating with himself internally and
finally he said slowly, “You tell me, Chief, that you warned Joranum
against accusing the old First Minister of being a robot. You say he
didn’t listen, but at least you had your say. May I have the same
privilege of pointing out what I think is a mistake and have you listen
to me as Joranum listened to you, even if, like him, you don’t take the
advice given you?”</p>
<p>“Of course you can speak your piece, Kaspalov. You are here in order
that you might do so. What is your point?”</p>
<p>“These new tactics of ours, Chief, are a mistake. They create
disruption and do damage.”</p>
<p>“Of course! They are designed to do that.” Namarti stirred in his
seat, controlling his anger with an effort. “Joranum tried persuasion.
It didn’t work. We will bring Trantor down by action.”</p>
<p>“For how long? And at what cost?”</p>
<p>“For as long as it takes—and at very little cost, actually. A power
stoppage here, a water break there, a sewage backup, an air-conditioning
halt. Inconvenience and discomfort—that’s all it means.”</p>
<p>Kaspalov shook his head. “These things are cumulative.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Kaspalov, and we want public dismay and resentment to be
cumulative, too. Listen, Kaspalov. The Empire is decaying. Everyone
knows that. Everyone capable of intelligent thought knows that. The
technology will fail here and there, even if we do nothing. We’re just
helping it along a little.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous, Chief. Trantor’s infrastructure is incredibly
complicated. A careless push may bring it down in ruins. Pull the wrong
string and Trantor may topple like a house of cards.”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t so far.”</p>
<p>“It may in the future. And what if the people find out that we are
behind it? They would tear us apart. There would be no need to call in
the security establishment or the armed forces. Mobs would destroy
us.”</p>
<p>“How would they ever learn enough to blame us? The natural target for
the people’s resentment will be the government—the Emperor’s advisers.
They will never look beyond that.”</p>
<p>“And how do we live with ourselves, knowing what we have done?”</p>
<p>This last was asked in a whisper, the old man clearly moved by strong
emotion. Kaspalov looked pleadingly across the table at his leader, the
man to whom he had sworn allegiance. He had done so in the belief that
Namarti would truly continue to bear the standard of freedom passed on
by Jo-Jo Joranum; now Kaspalov wondered if this is how Jo-Jo would have
wanted his dream to come to pass.</p>
<p>Namarti clucked his tongue, much as a reproving parent does when
confronting an errant child.</p>
<p>“Kaspalov, you can’t seriously be turning sentimental on us, are you?
Once we are in power, we will pick up the pieces and rebuild. We will
gather in the people with all of Joranum’s old talk of popular
participation in government, with greater representation, and when we
are firmly in power we will establish a more efficient and forceful
government. We will then have a better Trantor and a stronger Empire. We
will set up some sort of discussion system whereby representatives of
other worlds can talk themselves into a daze—but we will do the
governing.”</p>
<p>Kaspalov sat there, irresolute.</p>
<p>Namarti smiled joylessly. “You are not certain? We can’t lose. It’s
been working perfectly and it will continue working perfectly. The
Emperor doesn’t know what’s going on. He hasn’t the faintest notion. And
his First Minister is a mathematician. He ruined Joranum, true, but
since then he has done nothing.”</p>
<p>“He has something called—called—”</p>
<p>“Forget it. Joranum attached a great deal of importance to it, but it
was a part of his being Mycogenian, like his robot mania. This
mathematician has nothing—”</p>
<p>“Historical psychoanalysis or something like that. I heard Joranum
once say—”</p>
<p>“Forget it. Just do your part. You handle the ventilation in the
Anemoria Sector, don’t you? Very well, then. Have it misfunction in a
manner of your choosing. It either shuts down so that the humidity rises
or it produces a peculiar odor or something else. None of this will kill
anyone, so don’t get yourself into a fever of virtuous guilt. You will
simply make people uncomfortable and raise the general level of
discomfort and annoyance. Can we depend on you?”</p>
<p>“But what would only be discomfort and annoyance to the young and
healthy may be more than that to infants, the aged, and the sick.…”</p>
<p>“Are you going to insist that no one at all must be hurt?”</p>
<p>Kaspalov mumbled something.</p>
<p>Namarti said, “It’s impossible to do anything with a guarantee that
no one at all will be hurt. You just do your job. Do it in such a way
that you hurt as few as possible—if your conscience insists upon it—but
do it!”</p>
<p>Kaspalov said, “Look! I have one thing more to say, Chief.”</p>
<p>“Then say it,” said Namarti wearily.</p>
<p>“We can spend years poking at the infrastructure. The time must come
when you take advantage of gathering dissatisfaction to seize the
government. How do you intend to do that?”</p>
<p>“You want to know exactly how we’ll do it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The faster we strike, the more limited the damage, the more
efficiently the surgery is performed.”</p>
<p>Namarti said slowly, “I have not yet decided on the nature of this
‘surgical strike.’ But it will come. Until then, will you do your
part?”</p>
<p>Kaspalov nodded his head in resignation. “Yes, Chief.”</p>
<p>“Well then, go,” said Namarti with a sharp gesture of dismissal.</p>
<p>Kaspalov rose, turned, and left. Namarti watched him go. He said to
the man at his right, “Kaspalov is not to be trusted. He has sold out
and it’s only so that he can betray us that he wants to know my plans
for the future. Take care of him.”</p>
<p>The other nodded and all three left, leaving Namarti alone in the
room. He switched off the glowing wall panels, leaving only a lonely
square in the ceiling to provide the light that would keep him from
being entirely in the darkness.</p>
<p>He thought: Every chain has weak links that must be eliminated. We
have had to do this in the past and the result is that we have an
organization that is untouchable.</p>
<p>And in the dimness, he smiled, twisting his face into a kind of feral
joy. After all, the network extended even into the Palace itself—not
quite firmly, not quite reliably, but it was there. And it would be
strengthened.</p>
