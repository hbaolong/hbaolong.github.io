<h4 id="section">11</h4>
<p>In some respects, Wye could be quite puritanical. (This was true of
all the sectors, though the rigidity of one sector might be completely
different from the rigidity of another.) Here, the drinks were not
alcoholic but were synthetically designed to stimulate in other ways.
Raych did not like the taste, finding himself utterly unused to it, but
it meant that he could sip his drink slowly and look around.</p>
<p>He caught the eye of a young woman several tables away and had
difficulty in looking away. She was attractive and it was clear that
Wye’s ways were not puritanical in every fashion.</p>
<p>After a few moments, the young woman smiled slightly and rose. She
drifted toward Raych’s table, while Raych watched her speculatively. He
could scarcely (he thought with marked regret) afford a side adventure
just now.</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment when she reached Raych and then let herself
slide smoothly into an adjacent chair.</p>
<p>“Hello,” she said. “You don’t look like a regular here.”</p>
<p>Raych smiled. “I’m not. Do you know all the regulars?”</p>
<p>“Just about,” she said, unembarrassed. “My name is Manella. What’s
yours?”</p>
<p>Raych was more regretful than ever. She was quite tall, taller than
he himself was without his heels—something he always found
attractive—had a milky complexion, and long, softly wavy hair that had
distinct glints of dark red in it. Her clothing was not too garish and
she might, if she had tried a little harder, have passed as a
respectable woman of the not-too-hardworking class.</p>
<p>Raych said, “My name doesn’t matter. I don’t have many credits.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Too bad.” Manella made a face. “Can’t you get a few?”</p>
<p>“I’d like to. I need a job. Do you know of any?”</p>
<p>“What kind of job?”</p>
<p>Raych shrugged. “I don’t have any experience in anything fancy, but I
ain’t proud.”</p>
<p>Manella looked at him thoughtfully. “I’ll tell you what,
Mr. Nameless. Sometimes it doesn’t take any credits at all.”</p>
<p>Raych froze at once. He had been successful enough with women, but
with his mustache—his mustache. What could she see in his baby face?</p>
<p>He said, “Tell you what. I had a friend living here a couple of weeks
ago and I can’t find him. Since you know all the regulars, maybe you
know him. His name is Kaspalov.” He raised his voice slightly. “Kaspal
Kaspalov.”</p>
<p>Manella stared at him blankly and shook her head. “I don’t know
anybody by that name.”</p>
<p>“Too bad. He was a Joranumite and so am I.” Again, a blank look. “Do
you know what a Joranumite is?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “N-no. I’ve heard the word, but I don’t know what
it means. Is it some kind of job?”</p>
<p>Raych felt disappointed.</p>
<p>He said, “It would take too long to explain.”</p>
<p>It sounded like a dismissal and, after a moment of uncertainty,
Manella rose and drifted away. She did not smile and Raych was a little
surprised that she had remained as long as she did.</p>
<p>(Well, Seldon had always insisted that Raych had the capacity to
inspire affection—but surely not in a businesswoman of this sort. For
them, payment was the thing.)</p>
<p>His eyes followed Manella automatically as she stopped at another
table, where a man was seated by himself. He was of early middle age,
with butter-yellow hair, slicked back. He was very smooth-shaven, but it
seemed to Raych that he could have used a beard, his chin being too
prominent and a bit asymmetric.</p>
<p>Apparently Manella had no better luck with this beardless one. A few
words were exchanged and she moved on. Too bad, but surely it was
impossible for her to fail often. She was unquestionably desirable.</p>
<p>Raych found himself thinking, quite involuntarily, of what the upshot
would be if he, after all, could—And then Raych realized that he had
been joined by someone else. It was a man this time. It was, in fact,
the man to whom Manella had just spoken. He was astonished that his own
preoccupation had allowed him to be thus approached and, in effect,
caught by surprise. He couldn’t very well afford this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The man looked at him with a glint of curiosity in his eyes. “You
were just talking to a friend of mine.”</p>
<p>Raych could not help smiling broadly. “She’s a friendly person.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she is. And a good friend of mine. I couldn’t help overhearing
what you said to her.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t nothing wrong, I think.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, but you called yourself a Joranumite.”</p>
<p>Raych’s heart jumped. His remark to Manella had hit dead-center after
all. It had meant nothing to her, but it seemed to mean something to her
“friend.”</p>
<p>Did that mean he was on the road now? Or merely in trouble?</p>
