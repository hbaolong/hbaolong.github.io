<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>This was the second meeting of the Board that Hardin had attended, if
one were to exclude the informal talks the Board members had had with
the now-departed Lord Dorwin. Yet the mayor had a perfectly definite
idea that at least one other, and possibly two or three, had been held,
to which he had somehow never received an invitation.</p>
<p>Nor, it seemed to him, would he have received notification of this
one had it not been for the ultimatum.</p>
<p>At least, it amounted to an ultimatum, though a superficial reading
of the visigraphed document would lead one to suppose that it was a
friendly interchange of greetings between two potentates.</p>
<p>Hardin fingered it gingerly. It started off floridly with a
salutation from “His Puissant Majesty, the King of Anacreon, to his
friend and brother, Dr. Lewis Pirenne, Chairman of the Board of
Trustees, of the Encyclopedia Foundation Number One,” and it ended even
more lavishly with a gigantic, multicolored seal of the most involved
symbolism.</p>
<p>But it was an ultimatum just the same.</p>
<p>Hardin said: “It turned out that we didn’t have much time after
all—only three months. But little as it was, we threw it away unused.
This thing here gives us a week. What do we do now?”</p>
<p>Pirenne frowned worriedly. “There must be a loophole. It is
absolutely unbelievable that they would push matters to extremities in
the face of what Lord Dorwin has assured us regarding the attitude of
the Emperor and the Empire.”</p>
<p>Hardin perked up. “I see. You have informed the King of Anacreon of
this alleged attitude?”</p>
<p>“I did—after having placed the proposal to the Board for a vote and
having received unanimous consent.”</p>
<p>“And when did this vote take place?”</p>
<p>Pirenne climbed onto his dignity. “I do not believe I am answerable
to you in any way, Mayor Hardin.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’m not that vitally interested. It’s just my opinion
that it was your diplomatic transmission of Lord Dorwin’s valuable
contribution to the situation”—he lifted the corner of his mouth in a
sour half-smile—“that was the direct cause of this friendly little note.
They might have delayed longer otherwise—though I don’t think the
additional time would have helped Terminus any, considering the attitude
of the Board.”</p>
<p>Said Yate Fulham: “And just how do you arrive at that remarkable
conclusion, Mr. Mayor?”</p>
<p>“In a rather simple way. It merely required the use of that
much-neglected commodity—common sense. You see, there is a branch of
human knowledge known as symbolic logic, which can be used to prune away
all sorts of clogging deadwood that clutters up human language.”</p>
<p>“What about it?” said Fulham.</p>
<p>“I applied it. Among other things, I applied it to this document
here. I didn’t really need to for myself because I knew what it was all
about, but I think I can explain it more easily to five physical
scientists by symbols rather than by words.”</p>
<p>Hardin removed a few sheets of paper from the pad under his arm and
spread them out. “I didn’t do this myself, by the way,” he said. “Muller
Holk of the Division of Logic has his name signed to the analyses, as
you can see.”</p>
<p>Pirenne leaned over the table to get a better view and Hardin
continued: “The message from Anacreon was a simple problem, naturally,
for the men who wrote it were men of action rather than men of words. It
boils down easily and straightforwardly to the unqualified statement,
which in symbols is what you see, and which in words, roughly
translated, is, ‘You give us what we want in a week, or we take it by
force.’ ”</p>
<p>There was silence as the five members of the Board ran down the line
of symbols, and then Pirenne sat down and coughed uneasily.</p>
<p>Hardin said, “No loophole, is there, Dr. Pirenne?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t seem to be.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Hardin replaced the sheets. “Before you now you see a
copy of the treaty between the Empire and Anacreon—a treaty,
incidentally, which is signed on the Emperor’s behalf by the same Lord
Dorwin who was here last week—and with it a symbolic analysis.”</p>
<p>The treaty ran through five pages of fine print and the analysis was
scrawled out in just under half a page.</p>
<p>“As you see, gentlemen, something like ninety percent of the treaty
boiled right out of the analysis as being meaningless, and what we end
up with can be described in the following interesting manner:</p>
<p>“Obligations of Anacreon to the Empire: None!”</p>
<p>“Powers of the Empire over Anacreon: None!”</p>
<p>Again the five followed the reasoning anxiously, checking carefully
back to the treaty, and when they were finished, Pirenne said in a
worried fashion, “That seems to be correct.”</p>
<p>“You admit, then, that the treaty is nothing but a declaration of
total independence on the part of Anacreon and a recognition of that
status by the Empire?”</p>
<p>“It seems so.”</p>
<p>“And do you suppose that Anacreon doesn’t realize that, and is not
anxious to emphasize the position of independence—so that it would
naturally tend to resent any appearance of threats from the Empire?
Particularly when it is evident that the Empire is powerless to fulfill
any such threats, or it would never have allowed independence.”</p>
<p>“But then,” interposed Sutt, “how would Mayor Hardin account for Lord
Dorwin’s assurances of Empire support? They seemed—” He shrugged. “Well,
they seemed satisfactory.”</p>
<p>Hardin threw himself back in the chair. “You know, that’s the most
interesting part of the whole business. I’ll admit I had thought his
Lordship a most consummate donkey when I first met him—but it turned out
that he was actually an accomplished diplomat and a most clever man. I
took the liberty of recording all his statements.”</p>
<p>There was a flurry, and Pirenne opened his mouth in horror.</p>
<p>“What of it?” demanded Hardin. “I realize it was a gross breach of
hospitality and a thing no so-called gentleman would do. Also, that if
his lordship had caught on, things might have been unpleasant; but he
didn’t, and I have the record, and that’s that. I took that record, had
it copied out and sent that to Holk for analysis, also.”</p>
<p>Lundin Crast said, “And where is the analysis?”</p>
<p>“That,” replied Hardin, “is the interesting thing. The analysis was
the most difficult of the three by all odds. When Holk, after two days
of steady work, succeeded in eliminating meaningless statements, vague
gibberish, useless qualifications—in short, all the goo and dribble—he
found he had nothing left. Everything canceled out.</p>
<p>“Lord Dorwin, gentlemen, in five days of discussion didn’t say one
damned thing, and said it so you never noticed. There are the assurances
you had from your precious Empire.”</p>
<p>Hardin might have placed an actively working stench bomb on the table
and created no more confusion than existed after his last statement. He
waited, with weary patience, for it to die down.</p>
<p>“So,” he concluded, “when you sent threats—and that’s what they
were—concerning Empire action to Anacreon, you merely irritated a
monarch who knew better. Naturally, his ego would demand immediate
action, and the ultimatum is the result—which brings me to my original
statement. We have one week left and what do we do now?”</p>
<p>“It seems,” said Sutt, “that we have no choice but to allow Anacreon
to establish military bases on Terminus.”</p>
<p>“I agree with you there,” replied Hardin, “but what do we do toward
kicking them off again at the first opportunity?”</p>
<p>Yate Fulham’s mustache twitched. “That sounds as if you have made up
your mind that violence must be used against them.”</p>
<p>“Violence,” came the retort, “is the last refuge of the incompetent.
But I certainly don’t intend to lay down the welcome mat and brush off
the best furniture for their use.”</p>
<p>“I still don’t like the way you put that,” insisted Fulham. “It is a
dangerous attitude; the more dangerous because we have noticed lately
that a sizable section of the populace seems to respond to all your
suggestions just so. I might as well tell you, Mayor Hardin, that the
board is not quite blind to your recent activities.”</p>
<p>He paused and there was general agreement. Hardin shrugged.</p>
<p>Fulham went on: “If you were to inflame the City into an act of
violence, you would achieve elaborate suicide—and we don’t intend to
allow that. Our policy has but one cardinal principle, and that is the
Encyclopedia. Whatever we decide to do or not to do will be so decided
because it will be the measure required to keep that Encyclopedia
safe.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Hardin, “you come to the conclusion that we must
continue our intensive campaign of doing nothing.”</p>
<p>Pirenne said bitterly: “You have yourself demonstrated that the
Empire cannot help us; though how and why it can be so, I don’t
understand. If compromise is necessary—”</p>
<p>Hardin had the nightmarelike sensation of running at top speed and
getting nowhere. “There is no compromise! Don’t you realize that this
bosh about military bases is a particularly inferior grade of drivel?
Haut Rodric told us what Anacreon was after—outright annexation and
imposition of its own feudal system of landed estates and
peasant-aristocracy economy upon us. What is left of our bluff of
nuclear power may force them to move slowly, but they will move
nonetheless.”</p>
<p>He had risen indignantly, and the rest rose with him—except for Jord
Fara.</p>
<p>And then Jord Fara spoke. “Everyone will please sit down. We’ve gone
quite far enough, I think. Come, there’s no use looking so furious,
Mayor Hardin; none of us have been committing treason.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to convince me of that!”</p>
<p>Fara smiled gently. “You know you don’t mean that. Let me speak!”</p>
<p>His little shrewd eyes were half closed, and the perspiration gleamed
on the smooth expanse of his chin. “There seems no point in concealing
that the Board has come to the decision that the real solution to the
Anacreonian problem lies in what is to be revealed to us when the Vault
opens six days from now.”</p>
<p>“Is that your contribution to the matter?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“We are to do nothing, is that right, except to wait in quiet
serenity and utter faith for the deus ex machina to pop out of the
Vault?”</p>
<p>“Stripped of your emotional phraseology, that’s the idea.”</p>
<p>“Such unsubtle escapism! Really, Dr. Fara, such folly smacks of
genius. A lesser mind would be incapable of it.”</p>
<p>Fara smiled indulgently. “Your taste in epigrams is amusing, Hardin,
but out of place. As a matter of fact, I think you remember my line of
argument concerning the Vault about three weeks ago.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember it. I don’t deny that it was anything but a stupid
idea from the standpoint of deductive logic alone. You said—stop me when
I make a mistake—that Hari Seldon was the greatest psychologist in the
System; that, hence, he could foresee the tight and uncomfortable spot
we’re in now; that, hence, he established the Vault as a method of
telling us the way out.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got the essence of the idea.”</p>
<p>“Would it surprise you to hear that I’ve given considerable thought
to the matter these last weeks?”</p>
<p>“Very flattering. With what result?”</p>
<p>“With the result that pure deduction is found wanting. Again what is
needed is a little sprinkling of common sense.”</p>
<p>“For instance?”</p>
<p>“For instance, if he foresaw the Anacreonian mess, why not have
placed us on some other planet nearer the Galactic centers? It’s well
known that Seldon maneuvered the Commissioners on Trantor into ordering
the Foundation established on Terminus. But why should he have done so?
Why put us out here at all if he could see in advance the break in
communication lines, our isolation from the Galaxy, the threat of our
neighbors—and our helplessness because of the lack of metals on
Terminus? That above all! Or if he foresaw all this, why not have warned
the original settlers in advance that they might have had time to
prepare, rather than wait, as he is doing, until one foot is over the
cliff, before doing so?</p>
<p>“And don’t forget this. Even though he could foresee the problem
then, we can see it equally well now. Therefore, if he could foresee the
solution then, we should be able to see it now. After all, Seldon was
not a magician. There are no trick methods of escaping from a dilemma
that he can see and we can’t.”</p>
<p>“But, Hardin,” reminded Fara, “we can’t!”</p>
<p>“But you haven’t tried. You haven’t tried once. First, you refused to
admit that there was a menace at all! Then you reposed an absolutely
blind faith in the Emperor! Now you’ve shifted it to Hari Seldon.
Throughout you have invariably relied on authority or on the past—never
on yourselves.”</p>
<p>His fists balled spasmodically. “It amounts to a diseased attitude—a
conditioned reflex that shunts aside the independence of your minds
whenever it is a question of opposing authority. There seems no doubt
ever in your minds that the Emperor is more powerful than you are, or
Hari Seldon wiser. And that’s wrong, don’t you see?”</p>
<p>For some reason, no one cared to answer him.</p>
<p>Hardin continued: “It isn’t just you. It’s the whole Galaxy. Pirenne
heard Lord Dorwin’s idea of scientific research. Lord Dorwin thought the
way to be a good archaeologist was to read all the books on the
subject—written by men who were dead for centuries. He thought that the
way to solve archaeological puzzles was to weigh the opposing
authorities. And Pirenne listened and made no objections. Don’t you see
that there’s something wrong with that?”</p>
<p>Again the note of near-pleading in his voice.</p>
<p>Again no answer. He went on: “And you men and half of Terminus as
well are just as bad. We sit here, considering the Encyclopedia the
all-in-all. We consider the greatest end of science is the
classification of past data. It is important, but is there no further
work to be done? We’re receding and forgetting, don’t you see? Here in
the Periphery they’ve lost nuclear power. In Gamma Andromeda, a power
plant has undergone meltdown because of poor repairs, and the Chancellor
of the Empire complains that nuclear technicians are scarce. And the
solution? To train new ones? Never! Instead they’re to restrict nuclear
power.”</p>
<p>And for the third time: “Don’t you see? It’s Galaxy-wide. It’s a
worship of the past. It’s a deterioration—a stagnation!”</p>
<p>He stared from one to the other and they gazed fixedly at him.</p>
<p>Fara was the first to recover. “Well, mystical philosophy isn’t going
to help us here. Let us be concrete. Do you deny that Hari Seldon could
easily have worked out historical trends of the future by simple
psychological technique?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not,” cried Hardin. “But we can’t rely on him for a
solution. At best, he might indicate the problem, but if ever there is
to be a solution, we must work it out ourselves. He can’t do it for
us.”</p>
<p>Fulham spoke suddenly. “What do you mean—‘indicate the problem’? We
know the problem.”</p>
<p>Hardin whirled on him. “You think you do? You think Anacreon is all
Hari Seldon is likely to be worried about. I disagree! I tell you,
gentlemen, that as yet none of you has the faintest conception of what
is really going on.”</p>
<p>“And you do?” questioned Pirenne, hostilely.</p>
<p>“I think so!” Hardin jumped up and pushed his chair away. His eyes
were cold and hard. “If there’s one thing that’s definite, it is that
there’s something smelly about the whole situation; something that is
bigger than anything we’ve talked about yet. Just ask yourself this
question: Why was it that among the original population of the
Foundation not one first-class psychologist was included, except Bor
Alurin? And he carefully refrained from training his pupils in more than
the fundamentals.”</p>
<p>A short silence and Fara said: “All right. Why?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps because a psychologist might have caught on to what this was
all about—and too soon to suit Hari Seldon. As it is, we’ve been
stumbling about, getting misty glimpses of the truth and no more. And
that is what Hari Seldon wanted.”</p>
<p>He laughed harshly. “Good day, gentlemen!”</p>
<p>He stalked out of the room.</p>
