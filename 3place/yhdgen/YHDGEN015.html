<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>Mayor Hardin chewed at the end of his cigar. It had gone out but he
was past noticing that. He hadn’t slept the night before and he had a
good idea that he wouldn’t sleep this coming night. His eyes showed
it.</p>
<p>He said wearily, “And that covers it?”</p>
<p>“I think so.” Yohan Lee put a hand to his chin. “How does it
sound?”</p>
<p>“Not too bad. It’s got to be done, you understand, with impudence.
That is, there is to be no hesitation; no time to allow them to grasp
the situation. Once we are in a position to give orders, why, give them
as though you were born to do so, and they’ll obey out of habit. That’s
the essence of a coup.”</p>
<p>“If the Board remains irresolute for even—”</p>
<p>“The Board? Count them out. After tomorrow, their importance as a
factor in Terminus affairs won’t matter a rusty half-credit.”</p>
<p>Lee nodded slowly. “Yet it is strange that they’ve done nothing to
stop us so far. You say they weren’t entirely in the dark.”</p>
<p>“Fara stumbles at the edges of the problem. Sometimes he makes me
nervous. And Pirenne’s been suspicious of me since I was elected. But,
you see, they never had the capacity of really understanding what was
up. Their whole training has been authoritarian. They are sure that the
Emperor, just because he is the Emperor, is all-powerful. And they are
sure that the Board of Trustees, simply because it is the Board of
Trustees acting in the name of the Emperor, cannot be in a position
where it does not give the orders. That incapacity to recognize the
possibility of revolt is our best ally.”</p>
<p>He heaved out of his chair and went to the water cooler. “They’re not
bad fellows, Lee, when they stick to their Encyclopedia—and we’ll see
that that’s where they stick in the future. They’re hopelessly
incompetent when it comes to ruling Terminus. Go away now and start
things rolling. I want to be alone.”</p>
<p>He sat down on the corner of his desk and stared at the cup of
water.</p>
<p>Space! If only he were as confident as he pretended! The Anacreonians
were landing in two days and what had he to go on but a set of notions
and half-guesses as to what Hari Seldon had been driving at these past
fifty years? He wasn’t even a real, honest-to-goodness psychologist—just
a fumbler with a little training trying to outguess the greatest mind of
the age.</p>
<p>If Fara were right; if Anacreon were all the problem Hari Seldon had
foreseen; if the Encyclopedia were all he was interested in
preserving—then what price coup d’état?</p>
<p>He shrugged and drank his water.</p>
