<h4 id="section">23</h4>
<p>“No!” Hari Seldon was almost violent. “I don’t want you out there,
Dors.”</p>
<p>Dors Venabili stared back at him with an expression as firm as his
own. “Then I won’t let you go, either, Hari.”</p>
<p>“I must be there.”</p>
<p>“It is not your place. It is the Gardener First-Class who must greet
these new people.”</p>
<p>“So it is. But Gruber can’t do it. He’s a broken man.”</p>
<p>“He must have an assistant of some sort. Or let the old Chief
Gardener do it. He holds the office till the end of the year.”</p>
<p>“The old Chief Gardener is too ill. Besides”—Seldon hesitated—“there
are ringers among the gardeners. Trantorians. They’re here, for some
reason. I have the names of every one of them.”</p>
<p>“Have them taken into custody, then. Every last one of them. It’s
simple. Why are you making it so complex?”</p>
<p>“Because we don’t know why they’re here. Something’s up. I don’t see
what twelve gardeners can do, but— No, let me rephrase that. I can see a
dozen things they can do, but I don’t know which one of those things
they’ve planned. We will, indeed, take them into custody, but I must
know more about everything before it’s done.</p>
<p>“We have to know enough to winkle out everyone in the conspiracy from
top to bottom and we must know enough of what they’re doing to be able
to make the proper punishment stick. I don’t want to get twelve men and
women on what is essentially a misdemeanor charge. They’ll plead
desperation, the need for a job. They’ll complain that it isn’t fair for
Trantorians to be excluded. They’ll get plenty of sympathy and we’ll be
left looking like fools. We must give them a chance to convict
themselves of more than that. Besides—”</p>
<p>There was a long pause and Dors said wrathfully, “Well, what’s the
new ‘besides’?”</p>
<p>Seldon’s voice lowered. “One of the twelve is Raych, using the alias
Planchet.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Why are you surprised? I sent him to Wye to infiltrate the
Joranumite movement and he’s succeeded in infiltrating something. I have
every faith in him. If he’s there, he knows why he’s there and he must
have some sort of plan to put a spoke in the wheel. But I want to be
there, too. I want to see him. I want to be in a position to help him if
I can.”</p>
<p>“If you want to help him, have fifty guards of the Palace standing
shoulder to shoulder on either side of your gardeners.”</p>
<p>“No. Again, we’ll end up with nothing. The Imperial Guard will be in
place but not in evidence. The gardeners in question must think they
have a clear hand to do whatever it is they plan to do. Before they can
do so, but after they have made it quite plain what they intend—we’ll
have them.”</p>
<p>“That’s risky. It’s risky for Raych.”</p>
<p>“Risks are something we have to take. There’s more riding on this
than individual lives.”</p>
<p>“That is a heartless thing to say.”</p>
<p>“You think I have no heart? Even if it broke, my concern would have
to be with psycho—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it.” She turned away, as if in pain.</p>
<p>“I understand,” said Seldon, “but you mustn’t be there. Your presence
would be so inappropriate that the conspirators will suspect we know too
much and will abort their plan. I don’t want their plan aborted.”</p>
<p>He paused, then said softly, “Dors, you say your job is to protect
me. That comes before protecting Raych and you know that. I wouldn’t
insist on it, but to protect me is to protect psychohistory and the
entire human species. That must come first. What I have of psychohistory
tells me that I, in turn, must protect the center at all costs and that
is what I am trying to do. —Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I understand,” then turned away from him.</p>
<p>Seldon thought: And I hope I’m right.</p>
<p>If he weren’t, she would never forgive him. Far worse, he would never
forgive himself—psychohistory or not.</p>
