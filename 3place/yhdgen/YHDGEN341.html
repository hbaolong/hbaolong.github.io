<h4 id="section">32</h4>
<p>“Professor Seldon, come in,” said chief Librarian Tryma Acarnio in an
icy tone of voice. Hari Seldon, accompanied by Wanda and Palver, entered
the Chief Librarian’s imposing office.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Chief Librarian,” said Seldon as he settled into a chair
and faced Acarnio across the vast desk. “May I introduce my
granddaughter Wanda and my friend Stettin Palver. Wanda is a most
valuable member of the Psychohistory Project, her specialty being in the
field of mathematics. And Stettin, well, Stettin is turning into a
first-rate general psychohistorian—when he’s not performing his duties
as my bodyguard, that is.” Seldon chuckled amiably.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, that’s all well and good, Professor,” said Acarnio,
baffled by Seldon’s good humor. He had expected the professor to come in
groveling, begging for another chance at special Library privileges.</p>
<p>“But I don’t understand what it is you wanted to see me about. I
assume you realize that our position is firm: We cannot allow a Library
association with someone so extremely unpopular with the general
population. We are, after all, a public library and we must keep the
public’s sentiments in mind.” Acarnio settled back—perhaps now the
groveling would begin.</p>
<p>“I realize that I have not been able to sway you. However, I thought
that if you heard from a couple of the Project’s younger members—the
psychohistorians of tomorrow, as it were—that perhaps you’d get a better
feel about what a vital role the Project—and the Encyclopedia, in
particular—will play in our future. Please hear Wanda and Stettin
out.”</p>
<p>Acarnio cast a cold eye toward the two young people flanking Seldon.
“Very well, then,” he said, pointedly eyeing the timestrip on the wall.
“Five minutes and no more. I have a Library to run.”</p>
<p>“Chief Librarian,” began Wanda, “as my grandfather has undoubtedly
explained to you, psychohistory is a most valuable tool to be used for
the preservation of our culture. Yes, preservation,” she repeated, upon
seeing Acarnio’s eyes widen at the word. “Undue emphasis has been placed
on the destruction of the Empire. By doing so, the true value of
psychohistory has been over-looked. For, with psychohistory, as we are
able to predict the inevitable decline of our civilization, so are we
able to take steps toward its preservation. That is what the
Encyclopedia Galactica is all about. And that is why we need your help,
and the help of your great Library.”</p>
<p>Acarnio could not resist smiling. The young lady had an undeniable
charm. She was so earnest, so well spoken. He gazed at her sitting in
front of him, her blond hair pulled back in a rather severe scholarly
style, one which could not hide her attractive features but, rather,
showed them off. What she was saying was starting to make sense. Maybe
Wanda Seldon was right—maybe he had been looking at this problem from
the wrong angle. If it were actually a matter of preservation, rather
than destruction …</p>
<p>“Chief Librarian,” began Stettin Palver, “this great Library has
stood for millennia. It, perhaps even more than the Imperial Palace,
represents the vast power of the Empire. For, the Palace houses only the
Empire’s leader, while the Library is home to the sum total of Imperial
knowledge, culture, and history. Its value is incalculable.</p>
<p>“Does it not make sense to prepare a tribute to this great
repository? The Encyclopedia Galactica will be just that—a giant summary
of all the knowledge contained within these very walls. Think of
it!”</p>
<p>All of a sudden it seemed so very clear to Acarnio. How could he have
let the Board (especially that sourpuss Gennaro Mummery) convince him to
rescind Seldon’s privileges? Las Zenow, a person whose judgment he
greatly esteemed, had been a wholehearted supporter of Seldon’s
Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>He glanced again at the three in front of him, waiting for his
decision. The Board would be hard-pressed to find anything to complain
about with the Project members—if the young people now in his office
were a representative sample of the kind of persons involved with
Seldon.</p>
<p>Acarnio rose and walked across his office, his brow furrowed, as if
framing his thoughts. He picked up a milky crystal sphere from a table
and hefted it in his palm.</p>
<p>“Trantor,” Acarnio began thoughtfully, “seat of the Empire, center of
all the Galaxy. Quite amazing, when you think of it. —We have, perhaps,
been too quick to judge Professor Seldon. Now that your Project, this
Encyclopedia Galactica, has been presented to me in such a light”—he
gave a brief nod to Wanda and Palver—“I realize how important it would
be to allow you to continue your work here. And, of course, to grant
access to a number of your colleagues.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled gratefully and squeezed Wanda’s hand.</p>
<p>“It is not only for the greater glory of the Empire that I am
recommending this,” continued Acarnio, apparently warming to the idea
(and the sound of his own voice). “You are famous, Professor Seldon.
Whether people think of you as a crackpot or a genius, everyone seems to
have an opinion. If an academic of your stature is allied with the
Galactic Library, it can only increase our prestige as a bastion of
intellectual pursuit of the highest order. Why, the luster of your
presence can be used to raise much-needed funds to update our
collections, increase our staff, keep our doors open to the public
longer …</p>
<p>“And the prospect of the Encyclopedia Galactica itself—what a
monumental project! Imagine the reaction when the public learns that the
Galactic Library is involved with such an undertaking designed to
highlight the splendor of our civilization—our glorious history, our
brilliant achievements, our magnificent cultures. And to think that I,
Chief Librarian Tryma Acarnio, is responsible for making sure that this
great Project gets its start—” Acarnio gazed intently into the crystal
sphere, lost in reverie.</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor Seldon,” Acarnio pulled himself back to the here and
now. “You and your colleagues will be granted full insiders’
privileges—and a suite of offices in which to work.” He placed the
crystal sphere back on its table and, with a swish of robes, moved back
to his desk.</p>
<p>“It might take a little doing, of course, to persuade the Board—but I
am confident that I can handle them. Just leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Seldon, Wanda, and Palver looked at each other in triumph, with small
smiles playing at the corner of their mouths. Tryma Acarnio gestured
that they could go and so they did, leaving the Chief Librarian settled
in his chair, dreaming of the glory and honor that would come to the
Library under his aegis.</p>
<p>“Amazing,” said Seldon when the three were safely ensconced in their
ground-car. “If you could have seen him at our last meeting. He said I
was ‘threatening the essential fabric of our Empire’ or some such rot.
And today, after just a few minutes with you two—”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t too hard, Grandpa,” Wanda said as she pressed a contact,
moving the ground-car out into traffic. She sat back as the auto-propel
took over; Wanda had punched their destination coordinates into the
control panel. “He is a man with a strong sense of self-importance. All
we had to do was play up the positive aspects of the Encyclopedia and
his ego took over from there.”</p>
<p>“He was a goner the minute Wanda and I walked in,” Palver said from
the back. “With both of us pushing him, it was a piece of cake.” Palver
reached forward and squeezed Wanda’s shoulder affectionately. She
smiled, reached up, and patted his hand.</p>
<p>“I must alert the Encyclopedists as soon as possible,” Seldon said.
“Although there are only thirty-two left, they are good and dedicated
workers. I’ll get them installed at the Library and then I’ll tackle the
next hurdle—credits. Perhaps this alliance with the Library is what I
need to convince people to give us funding. Let’s see—I’ll call upon
Terep Bindris again and I’ll take you two with me. He was kindly
disposed toward me, at least at first. But how will he be able to resist
us now?”</p>
<p>The ground-car eventually came to a halt outside the Psychohistory
Building at Streeling. The side panels slid open, but Seldon did not
immediately move to disembark. He turned to face Wanda.</p>
<p>“Wanda, you know what you and Stettin were able to accomplish with
Acarnio; I’m sure you both can push some credits out of a few financial
benefactors as well.</p>
<p>“I know how you hate to leave your beloved Prime Radiant, but these
visits will give you two a chance to practice, to hone your skills, to
get an idea of just what you can do.”</p>
<p>“All right, Grandpa, although I’m sure that, now that you have the
Library’s imprimatur, you will find that resistance to your requests has
lessened.”</p>
<p>“There’s another reason I think it’s important for the two of you to
get out and around together. —Stettin, I believe you said that on
certain occasions you’ve ‘felt’ another mind like yours but haven’t been
able to identify it.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Palver, “I’ve had flashes, but each time I was in a
crowd. And, in my twenty-four years, I can remember feeling such a flash
just four or five times.”</p>
<p>“But, Stettin,” said Seldon, his voice low with intensity, “each
flash was, potentially, the mind of another person like you and
Wanda—another mentalic. Wanda’s never felt these flashes because,
frankly, she’s been sheltered all her life. The few times she’s been out
in a crowd there must not have been any other mentalics around.</p>
<p>“That’s one reason—perhaps the most important reason—for you two to
get out—with me or without me. We must find other mentalics. The two of
you alone are strong enough to push a single person. A large group of
you, all pushing together, will have the power to move an Empire!”</p>
<p>With that, Hari Seldon swung his legs around and hoisted himself out
of the ground-car. As Wanda and Palver watched him limp up the pathway
to the Psychohistory Building, they were only dimly aware of the
enormous responsibility Seldon had just placed on their young
shoulders.</p>
