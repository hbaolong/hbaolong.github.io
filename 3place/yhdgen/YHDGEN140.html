<h4 id="section">2</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon did not make an impressive appearance at this time. Like
the Emperor Cleon I, he was thirty-two years old, but he was only 1.73
meters tall. His face was smooth and cheerful, his hair dark brown,
almost black, and his clothing had the unmistakable touch of
provinciality about it.</p>
<p>To anyone in later times who knew of Hari Seldon only as a legendary
demigod, it would seem almost sacrilegious for him not to have white
hair, not to have an old lined face, a quiet smile radiating wisdom, not
to be seated in a wheelchair. Even then, in advanced old age, his eyes
had been cheerful, however. There was that.</p>
<p>And his eyes were particularly cheerful now, for his paper had been
given at the Decennial Convention. It had even aroused some interest in
a distant sort of way and old Osterfith had nodded his head at him and
had said, “Ingenious, young man. Most ingenious.” Which, coming from
Osterfith, was satisfactory. Most satisfactory.</p>
<p>But now there was a new—and quite unexpected—development and Seldon
wasn’t sure whether it should increase his cheer and intensify his
satisfaction or not.</p>
<p>He stared at the tall young man in uniform—the Spaceship-and-Sun
neatly placed on the left side of his tunic.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Alban Wellis,” said the officer of the Emperor’s Guard
before putting away his identification. “Will you come with me now,
sir?”</p>
<p>Wellis was armed, of course. There were two other Guardsmen waiting
outside his door. Seldon knew he had no choice, for all the other’s
careful politeness, but there was no reason he could not seek
information. He said, “To see the Emperor?”</p>
<p>“To be brought to the Palace, sir. That’s the extent of my
instructions.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>“I was not told why, sir. And I have my strict instructions that you
must come with me—one way or another.”</p>
<p>“But this seems as though I am being arrested. I have done nothing to
warrant that.”</p>
<p>“Say, rather, that it seems you are being given an escort of honor—if
you delay me no further.”</p>
<p>Seldon delayed no further. He pressed his lips together, as though to
block off further questions, nodded his head, and stepped forward. Even
if he was going to meet the Emperor and to receive Imperial
commendation, he found no joy in it. He was for the Empire— that is, for
the worlds of humanity in peace and union—but he was not for the
Emperor.</p>
<p>The lieutenant walked ahead, the other two behind. Seldon smiled at
those he passed and managed to look unconcerned. Outside the hotel they
climbed into an official ground-car. (Seldon ran his hand over the
upholstery; he had never been in anything so ornate.)</p>
<p>They were in one of the wealthiest sections of Trantor. The dome was
high enough here to give a sensation of being in the open and one could
swear—even one such as Hari Seldon, who had been born and brought up on
an open world—that they were in sunlight. You could see no sun and no
shadows, but the air was light and fragrant.</p>
<p>And then it passed and the dome curved down and the walls narrowed in
and soon they were moving along an enclosed tunnel, marked periodically
with the Spaceship-and-Sun and so clearly reserved (Seldon thought) for
official vehicles.</p>
<p>A door opened and the ground-car sped through. When the door closed
behind them, they were in the open—the true, the real open. There were
250 square kilometers of the only stretch of open land on Trantor and on
it stood the Imperial Palace. Seldon would have liked a chance to wander
through that open land—not because of the Palace, but because it also
contained the Galactic University and, most intriguing of all, the
Galactic Library.</p>
<p>And yet, in passing from the enclosed world of Trantor into the open
patch of wood and parkland, he had passed into a world in which clouds
dimmed the sky and a chill wind ruffled his shirt. He pressed the
contact that closed the ground-car’s window.</p>
<p>It was a dismal day outside.</p>
