<h4 id="section">40</h4>
<p>The Sisters arrived some six hours later after Seldon and Dors had
slept some more, hoping to readjust their biological clocks.</p>
<p>The Sisters entered the apartment shyly, almost on tiptoe. Their
gowns (which, it turned out, were termed “kirtles” in the Mycogenian
dialect) were soft velvety gray, each uniquely decorated by a subtle
pattern of fine, darker gray webbing. The kirtles were not entirely
unattractive, but they were certainly most efficient at covering up any
human feature.</p>
<p>And, of course, their heads were bald and their faces were devoid of
any ornamentation. They darted speculative glances at the touch of blue
at the corners of Dors’s eyes and at the slight red stain at the corners
of her lips.</p>
<p>For a few moments, Seldon wondered how one could be certain that the
Sisters were truly Sisters.</p>
<p>The answer came at once with the Sisters’ politely formal greetings.
Both twittered and chirped. Seldon, remembering the grave tones of
Sunmaster and the nervous baritone of Graycloud, suspected that women,
in default of obvious sexual identification, were forced to cultivate
distinctive voices and social mannerisms.</p>
<p>“I’m Raindrop Forty-Three,” twittered one, “and this is my younger
sister.”</p>
<p>“Raindrop Forty-Five,” chirped the other. “We’re very strong on
‘Raindrops’ in our cohort.” She giggled.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to meet you both,” said Dors gravely, “but now I must
know how to address you. I can’t just say ‘Raindrop,’ can I?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Raindrop Forty-Three. “You must use the full name if we
are both here.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “How about just Forty-Three and Forty-Five, ladies?”</p>
<p>They both stole a quick glance at him, but said not a word.</p>
<p>Dors said softly, “I’ll deal with them, Hari.”</p>
<p>Seldon stepped back. Presumably, they were single young women and,
very likely, they were not supposed to speak to men. The older one
seemed the graver of the two and was perhaps the more puritanical. It
was hard to tell from a few words and a quick glance, but he had the
feeling and was willing to go by that.</p>
<p>Dors said, “The thing is, Sisters, that we tribespeople don’t know
how to use the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“You mean you can’t cook?” Raindrop Forty-Three looked shocked and
censorious. Raindrop Forty-Five smothered a laugh. (Seldon decided that
his initial estimate of the two was correct.)</p>
<p>Dors said, “I once had a kitchen of my own, but it wasn’t like this
one and I don’t know what the foods are or how to prepare them.”</p>
<p>“It’s really quite simple,” said Raindrop Forty-Five. “We can show
you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll make you a good nourishing lunch,” said Raindrop Forty-Three.
“We’ll make it for … both of you.” She hesitated before adding the final
words. It clearly took an effort to acknowledge the existence of a
man.</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind,” said Dors, “I would like to be in the kitchen
with you and I would appreciate it if you’d explain everything exactly.
After all, Sisters, I can’t expect you to come here three times a day to
cook for us.”</p>
<p>“We will show you everything,” said Raindrop Forty-Three, nodding her
head stiffly. “It may be difficult for a tribeswoman to learn, however.
You wouldn’t have the … feeling for it.”</p>
<p>“I shall try,” said Dors with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>They disappeared into the kitchen. Seldon stared after them and tried
to work out the strategy he intended to use.</p>
<p>MYCOGEN—… The microfarms of Mycogen are legendary, though they
survive today only in such oft-used similes as “rich as the microfarms
of Mycogen” or “tasty as Mycogenian yeast.” Such encomiums tend to
intensify with time, to be sure, but Hari Seldon visited those
microfarms in the course of The Flight and there are references in his
memoirs that would tend to support the popular opinion …</p>
