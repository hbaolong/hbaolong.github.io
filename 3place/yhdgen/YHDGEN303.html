<h4 id="section">21</h4>
<p>The small electro-clarification laboratory was, for some reason,
maintained at a temperature somewhat lower than normal and Dors Venabili
wondered idly why that might be. She sat quietly, waiting for the one
occupant of the lab to finish whatever it was she was doing.</p>
<p>Dors eyed the woman carefully. Slim, with a long face. Not exactly
attractive, with her thin lips and receding jawline, but a look of
intelligence shone in her dark brown eyes. The glowing nameplate on her
desk said: CINDA MONAY.</p>
<p>She turned to Dors at last and said, “My apologies, Dr. Venabili, but
there are some procedures that can’t be interrupted even for the wife of
the director.”</p>
<p>“I would have been disappointed in you if you had neglected the
procedure on my behalf. I have been told some excellent things about
you.”</p>
<p>“That’s always nice to hear. Who’s been praising me?”</p>
<p>“Quite a few,” said Dors. “I gather that you are one of the most
prominent nonmathematicians in the Project.”</p>
<p>Monay winced. “There’s a certain tendency to divide the rest of us
from the aristocracy of mathematics. My own feeling is that, if I’m
prominent, then I’m a prominent member of the Project. It makes no
difference that I’m a nonmathematician.”</p>
<p>“That certainly sounds reasonable to me. —How long have you been with
the Project?”</p>
<p>“Two and a half years. Before that I was a graduate student in
radiational physics at Streeling and, while I was doing that, I served a
couple of years with the Project as an intern.”</p>
<p>“You’ve done well at the Project, I understand.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been promoted twice, Dr. Venabili.”</p>
<p>“Have you encountered any difficulties here, Dr. Monay? —Whatever you
say will be held confidential.”</p>
<p>“The work is difficult, of course, but if you mean, have I run into
any social difficulties, the answer is no. At least not any more than
one would expect in any large and complex project, I imagine.”</p>
<p>“And by that you mean?”</p>
<p>“Occasional spats and quarrels. We’re all human.”</p>
<p>“But nothing serious?”</p>
<p>Monay shook her head. “Nothing serious.”</p>
<p>“My understanding, Dr. Monay,” said Dors, “is that you have been
responsible for the development of a device important to the use of the
Prime Radiant. It makes it possible to cram much more information into
the Prime Radiant.”</p>
<p>Monay broke into a radiant smile. “Do you know about that? —Yes, the
Electro-Clarifier. After that was developed, Professor Seldon
established this small laboratory and put me in charge of other work in
that direction.”</p>
<p>“I’m amazed that such an important advance did not bring you up into
the higher echelons of the Project.”</p>
<p>“Oh well,” said Monay, looking a trifle embarrassed. “I don’t want to
take all the credit. Actually my work was only that of a technician—a
very skilled and creative technician, I like to think—but there you
are.”</p>
<p>“And who worked with you?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know? It was Tamwile Elar. He worked out the theory that
made the device possible and I designed and built the actual
instrument.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean he took the credit, Dr. Monay?”</p>
<p>“No no. You mustn’t think that. Dr. Elar is not that kind of man. He
gave me full credit for my share of the work. In fact, it was his idea
to call the device by our names—both our names—but he couldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s Professor Seldon’s rule, you know. All devices and
equations are to be given functional names and not personal ones—to
avoid resentment. So the device is just the Electro-Clarifier. When
we’re working together, however, he gives the device our names and, I
tell you, Dr. Venabili, it sounds grand. Perhaps someday, all of the
Project personnel will use the personal name. I hope so.”</p>
<p>“I hope so, too,” said Dors politely. “You make Elar sound like a
very decent individual.”</p>
<p>“He is. He is,” said Monay earnestly. “He is a delight to work for.
Right now, I’m working on a new version of the device, which is more
powerful and which I don’t quite understand. —I mean, what it’s to be
used for. However, he’s directing me there.”</p>
<p>“And are you making progress?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. In fact, I’ve given Dr. Elar a prototype, which he plans to
test. If it works out, we can proceed further.”</p>
<p>“It sounds good,” agreed Dors. “What do you think would happen if
Professor Seldon were to resign as director of the Project? If he were
to retire?”</p>
<p>Monay looked surprised. “Is the professor planning to retire?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of. I’m presenting you with a hypothetical case.
Suppose he retires. Who do you think would be a natural successor? I
think from what you have said that you would favor Professor Elar as the
new director.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I would,” responded Monay after a trifling hesitation. “He’s
far and away the most brilliant of the new people and I think he could
run the Project in the best possible way. Still, he’s rather young.
There are a considerable number of old fossils—well, you know what I
mean—who would resent being passed over by a young squirt.”</p>
<p>“Is there any old fossil you’re thinking of in particular? Remember,
this is confidential.”</p>
<p>“Quite a few of them, but there’s Dr. Amaryl. He’s the heir
apparent.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I see what you mean.” Dors rose. “Well, thank you so much for
your help. I’ll let you return to your work now.”</p>
<p>She left, thinking about the Electro-Clarifier. And about Amaryl.</p>
