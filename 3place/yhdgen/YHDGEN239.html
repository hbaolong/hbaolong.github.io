<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>Namarti’s dark eyes remained fixed on Joranum as they sat in their
carefully shielded office in the Streeling Sector. It was not an
elaborate headquarters; they were as yet weak in Streeling, but they
would grow stronger.</p>
<p>It was amazing how the movement was growing. It had started from
nothing three years back and now its tentacles stretched—in some places
more thickly than others, of course—throughout Trantor. The Outer Worlds
were as yet largely untouched. Demerzel had labored mightily to keep
them content, but that was his mistake. It was here on Trantor that
rebellions were dangerous. Elsewhere, they could be controlled. Here,
Demerzel could be toppled. Odd that he should not realize that, but
Joranum had always held to the theory that Demerzel’s reputation was
overblown, that he would prove an empty shell if anyone dared oppose
him, and that the Emperor would destroy him quickly if his own security
seemed at stake.</p>
<p>So far, at least, all of Joranum’s predictions had come to pass. He
had never once lost his way except in minor matters, such as that recent
rally at Streeling University in which this Seldon fellow had
interfered.</p>
<p>That might be why Joranum had insisted on the interview with him.
Even a minor toe stub must be taken care of. Joranum enjoyed the feeling
of infallibility and Namarti had to admit that the vision of a constant
string of successes was the surest way of ensuring the continuation of
success. People tended to avoid the humiliation of failure by joining
the obviously winning side even against their own opinions.</p>
<p>But had the interview with this Seldon been a success or was it a
second stub of the toe to be added to the first? Namarti had not enjoyed
having been brought along in order to be made to humbly apologize and he
didn’t see that it had done any good.</p>
<p>Now Joranum sat there, silent, obviously lost in thought, gnawing at
the edge of one thumb as though trying to draw some sort of mental
nourishment from it.</p>
<p>“Jo-Jo,” said Namarti softly. He was one of the very few people who
could address Joranum by the diminutive that the crowds shouted out
endlessly in public. Joranum solicited the love of the mob in this way,
among others, but he demanded respect from individuals in private,
except for those special friends who had been with him from the
start.</p>
<p>“Jo-Jo,” he said again.</p>
<p>Joranum looked up. “Yes, G.D., what is it?” He sounded a little
testy.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do about this Seldon fellow, Jo-Jo?”</p>
<p>“Do? Nothing right now. He may join us.”</p>
<p>“Why wait? We can put pressure on him. We can pull a few strings at
the University and make life miserable for him.”</p>
<p>“No no. So far, Demerzel has been letting us go our way. The fool is
overconfident. The last thing we want to do, though, is to push him into
action before we are quite ready. And a heavy-handed move against Seldon
may do it. I suspect Demerzel places enormous importance on Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Because of this psychohistory you two talked about?”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“What is it? I have never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“Few people have. It’s a mathematical way of analyzing human society
that ends by predicting the future.”</p>
<p>Namarti frowned and felt his body move slightly away from Joranum.
Was this a joke of Joranum’s? Was this intended to make him laugh?
Namarti had never been able to work out when or why people expected him
to laugh. He had never had an urge to.</p>
<p>He said, “Predict the future? How?”</p>
<p>“Ah! If I knew that, what need would I have of Seldon?”</p>
<p>“Frankly I don’t believe it, Jo-Jo. How can you foretell the future?
It’s fortune-telling.”</p>
<p>“I know, but after this Seldon broke up your little rally, I had him
looked into. All the way. Eight years ago, he came to Trantor and
presented a paper on psychohistory at a convention of mathematicians and
then the whole thing died. It was never referred to again by anyone. Not
even by Seldon.”</p>
<p>“It sounds as though there were nothing to it, then.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, just the reverse. If it had faded slowly, if it had been
subjected to ridicule, I would have said there was nothing to it. But to
be cut off suddenly and completely means that the whole thing has been
placed in the deepest of freezes. That is why Demerzel may have been
doing nothing to stop us. Perhaps he is not being guided by a foolish
overconfidence; perhaps he is being guided by psychohistory, which must
be predicting something that Demerzel plans to take advantage of at the
right time. If so, we might fail unless we can make use of psychohistory
ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Seldon claims it doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you if you were he?”</p>
<p>“I still say we ought to put pressure on him.”</p>
<p>“It would be useless, G.D. Didn’t you ever hear the story of the Ax
of Venn?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You would if you were from Nishaya. It’s a famous folktale back
home. In brief, Venn was a woodcutter who had a magic ax that, with a
single light blow, could chop down any tree. It was enormously valuable,
but he never made any effort to hide it or preserve it—and yet it was
never stolen, because no one could lift or swing the ax but Venn
himself.</p>
<p>“Well, at the present moment, no one can handle psychohistory but
Seldon himself. If he were on our side only because we had forced him,
we could never be certain of his loyalty. Might he not urge a course of
action that would seem to work in our favor but would be so subtly drawn
that, after a while, we found ourselves quite suddenly destroyed. No, he
must come to our side voluntarily and labor for us because he wishes us
to win.”</p>
<p>“But how can we bring him around?”</p>
<p>“There’s Seldon’s son. Raych, I think he’s called. Did you observe
him?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly.”</p>
<p>“G.D., G.D., you miss points if you don’t observe everything. That
young man listened to me with his heart in his eyes. He was impressed. I
could tell. If there’s one thing I can tell, it is just how I impress
others. I know when I have shaken a mind, when I have edged someone
toward conversion.”</p>
<p>Joranum smiled. It was not the pseudowarm ingratiating smile of his
public demeanor. It was a genuine smile this time—cold, somehow, and
menacing.</p>
<p>“We’ll see what we can do with Raych,” he said, “and if, through him,
we can reach Seldon.”</p>
