<h4 id="section">72</h4>
<p>Both Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili had taken rather lingering baths,
making use of the somewhat primitive facilities available to them in the
Tisalver household. They had changed their clothing and were in Seldon’s
room when Jirad Tisalver returned in the evening. His signal at the door
was (or seemed) rather timid. The buzz did not last long.</p>
<p>Seldon opened the door and said pleasantly, “Good evening, Master
Tisalver. And Mistress.”</p>
<p>She was standing right behind her husband, forehead puckered into a
puzzled frown.</p>
<p>Tisalver said tentatively, as though he was unsure of the situation,
“Are you and Mistress Venabili both well?” He nodded his head as though
trying to elicit an affirmative by body language.</p>
<p>“Quite well. In and out of Billibotton without trouble and we’re all
washed and changed. There’s no smell left.” Seldon lifted his chin as he
said it, smiling, tossing the sentence over Tisalver’s shoulder to his
wife.</p>
<p>She sniffed loudly, as though testing the matter.</p>
<p>Still tentatively, Tisalver said, “I understand there was a knife
fight.”</p>
<p>Seldon raised his eyebrows. “Is that the story?”</p>
<p>“You and the Mistress against a hundred thugs, we were told, and you
killed them all. Is that so?” There was the reluctant sound of deep
respect in his voice.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not,” Dors put in with sudden annoyance. “That’s
ridiculous. What do you think we are? Mass murderers? And do you think a
hundred thugs would remain in place, waiting the considerable time it
would take me—us—to kill them all? I mean, think about it.”</p>
<p>“That’s what they’re saying,” said Casilia Tisalver with shrill
firmness. “We can’t have that sort of thing in this house.”</p>
<p>“In the first place,” said Seldon, “it wasn’t in this house. In the
second, it wasn’t a hundred men, it was ten. In the third, no one was
killed. There was some altercation back and forth, after which they left
and made way for us.”</p>
<p>“They just made way. Do you expect me to believe that, Outworlders?”
demanded Mistress Tisalver belligerently.</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. At the slightest stress, human beings seemed to divide
themselves into antagonistic groups. He said, “Well, I grant you one of
them was cut a little. Not seriously.”</p>
<p>“And you weren’t hurt at all?” said Tisalver. The admiration in his
voice was more marked.</p>
<p>“Not a scratch,” said Seldon. “Mistress Venabili handles two knives
excellently well.”</p>
<p>“I dare say,” said Mistress Tisalver, her eyes dropping to Dors’s
belt, “and that’s not what I want to have going on here.”</p>
<p>Dors said sternly, “As long as no one attacks us here, that’s what
you won’t have here.”</p>
<p>“But on account of you,” said Mistress Tisalver, “we have trash from
the street standing at the doorway.”</p>
<p>“My love,” said Tisalver soothingly, “let us not anger—”</p>
<p>“Why?” spat his wife with contempt. “Are you afraid of her knives? I
would like to see her use them here.”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of using them here,” said Dors with a sniff as
loud as any that Mistress Tisalver had produced. “What is this trash
from the street you’re talking about?”</p>
<p>Tisalver said, “What my wife means is that an urchin from
Billibotton—at least, judging by his appearance—wishes to see you and we
are not accustomed to that sort of thing in this neighborhood. It
undermines our standing.” He sounded apologetic.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Well, Master Tisalver, we’ll go outside, find out what
it’s all about, and send him on his business as quickly—”</p>
<p>“No. Wait,” said Dors, annoyed. “These are our rooms. We pay for
them. We decide who visits us and who does not. If there is a young man
outside from Billibotton, he is nonetheless a Dahlite. More important,
he’s a Trantorian. Still more important, he’s a citizen of the Empire
and a human being. Most important, by asking to see us, he becomes our
guest. Therefore, we invite him in to see us.”</p>
<p>Mistress Tisalver didn’t move. Tisalver himself seemed uncertain.</p>
<p>Dors said, “Since you say I killed a hundred bullies in Billibotton,
you surely do not think I am afraid of a boy or, for that matter, of you
two.” Her right hand dropped casually to her belt.</p>
<p>Tisalver said with sudden energy, “Mistress Venabili, we do not
intend to offend you. Of course these rooms are yours and you can
entertain whomever you wish here.” He stepped back, pulling his
indignant wife with him, undergoing a burst of resolution for which he
might conceivably have to pay afterward.</p>
<p>Dors looked after them sternly.</p>
<p>Seldon smiled dryly. “How unlike you, Dors. I thought I was the one
who quixotically got into trouble and that you were the calm and
practical one whose only aim was to prevent trouble.”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “I can’t bear to hear a human being spoken of
with contempt just because of his group identification—even by other
human beings. It’s these respectable people here who create those
hooligans out there.”</p>
<p>“And other respectable people,” said Seldon, “who create these
respectable people. These mutual animosities are as much a part of
humanity—”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll have to deal with it in your psychohistory, won’t
you?”</p>
<p>“Most certainly—if there is ever a psychohistory with which to deal
with anything at all. —Ah, here comes the urchin under discussion. And
it’s Raych, which somehow doesn’t surprise me.”</p>
