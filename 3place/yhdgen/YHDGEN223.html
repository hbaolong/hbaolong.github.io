<h4 id="section">85</h4>
<p>Actually, it took a full day to rest and unstiffen, to wash and get
clean, to obtain new clothes (satiny and rather loose, in the style of
Wye), and to sleep a good deal.</p>
<p>It was during the second evening in Wye that there was the dinner
that Madam Rashelle had promised.</p>
<p>The table was a large one—too large, considering that there were only
four dining: Hari Seldon, Dors Venabili, Raych, and Rashelle. The walls
and ceiling were softly illuminated and the colors changed at a rate
that caught the eye but not so rapidly as in any way to discommode the
mind. The very tablecloth, which was not cloth (Seldon had not made up
his mind what it might be), seemed to sparkle.</p>
<p>The servers were many and silent and when the door opened it seemed
to Seldon that he caught a glimpse of soldiers, armed and at the ready,
outside. The room was a velvet glove, but the iron fist was not far
distant.</p>
<p>Rashelle was gracious and friendly and had clearly taken a particular
liking to Raych, who, she insisted, was to sit next to her.</p>
<p>Raych—scrubbed, polished, and shining, all but unrecognizable in his
new clothes, with his hair clipped, cleaned, and brushed—scarcely dared
to say a word. It was as though he felt his grammar no longer fit his
appearance. He was pitifully ill at ease and he watched Dors carefully
as she switched from utensil to utensil, trying to match her exactly in
every respect.</p>
<p>The food was tasty but spicy—to the point where Seldon could not
recognize the exact nature of the dishes.</p>
<p>Rashelle, her plump face made happy by her gentle smile and her fine
teeth gleaming white, said, “You may think we have Mycogenian additives
in the food, but we do not. It is all homegrown in Wye. There is no
sector on the planet more self-sufficient than Wye. We labor hard to
keep that so.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded gravely and said, “Everything you have given us is
first-rate, Rashelle. We are much obliged to you.”</p>
<p>And yet within himself he thought the food was not quite up to
Mycogenian standards and he felt moreover, as he had earlier muttered to
Dors, that he was celebrating his own defeat. Or Hummin’s defeat, at any
rate, and that seemed to him to be the same thing.</p>
<p>After all, he had been captured by Wye, the very possibility that had
so concerned Hummin at the time of the incident Upperside.</p>
<p>Rashelle said, “Perhaps, in my role as hostess, I may be forgiven if
I ask personal questions. Am I correct in assuming that you three do not
represent a family; that you, Hari, and you, Dors, are not married and
that Raych is not your son?”</p>
<p>“The three of us are not related in any way,” said Seldon. “Raych was
born on Trantor, I on Helicon, Dors on Cinna.”</p>
<p>“And how did you all meet, then?”</p>
<p>Seldon explained briefly and with as little detail as he could
manage. “There’s nothing romantic or significant in the meetings,” he
added.</p>
<p>“Yet I am given to understand that you raised difficulties with my
personal aide, Sergeant Thalus, when he wanted to take only you out of
Dahl.”</p>
<p>Seldon said gravely, “I had grown fond of Dors and Raych and did not
wish to be separated from them.”</p>
<p>Rashelle smiled and said, “You are a sentimental man, I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am. Sentimental. And puzzled too.”</p>
<p>“Puzzled?”</p>
<p>“Why yes. And since you were so kind as to ask personal questions of
us, may I ask one as well?”</p>
<p>“Of course, my dear Hari. Ask anything you please.”</p>
<p>“When we first arrived, you said that Wye has wanted me from the day
I addressed the Decennial Convention. For what reason might that
be?”</p>
<p>“Surely, you are not so simple as not to know. We want you for your
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“That much I do understand. But what makes you think that having me
means you have psychohistory?”</p>
<p>“Surely, you have not been so careless as to lose it.”</p>
<p>“Worse, Rashelle. I have never had it.”</p>
<p>Rashelle’s face dimpled. “But you said you had it in your talk. Not
that I understood your talk. I am not a mathematician. I hate numbers.
But I have in my employ mathematicians who have explained to me what it
is you said.”</p>
<p>“In that case, my dear Rashelle, you must listen more closely. I can
well imagine they have told you that I have proven that psychohistorical
predictions are conceivable, but surely they must also have told you
that they are not practical.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that, Hari. The very next day, you were called into
an audience with that pseudo-Emperor, Cleon.”</p>
<p>“The pseudo-Emperor?” murmured Dors ironically.</p>
<p>“Why yes,” said Rashelle as though she was answering a serious
question. “Pseudo-Emperor. He has no true claim to the throne.”</p>
<p>“Rashelle,” said Seldon, brushing that aside a bit impatiently, “I
told Cleon exactly what I have just told you and he let me go.”</p>
<p>Now Rashelle did not smile. A small edge crept into her voice. “Yes,
he let you go the way the cat in the fable lets a mouse go. He has been
pursuing you ever since—in Streeling, in Mycogen, in Dahl. He would
pursue you here if he dared. But come now—our serious talk is too
serious. Let us enjoy ourselves. Let us have music.”</p>
<p>And at her words, there suddenly sounded a soft but joyous
instrumental melody. She leaned toward Raych and said softly, “My boy,
if you are not at ease with the fork, use your spoon or your fingers. I
won’t mind.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “Yes, mum,” and swallowed hard, but Dors caught his eye
and her lips silently mouthed: “Fork.”</p>
<p>He remained with his fork.</p>
<p>Dors said, “The music is lovely, Madam”—she pointedly rejected the
familiar form of address—“but it must not be allowed to distract us.
There is the thought in my mind that the pursuer in all those places
might have been in the employ of the Wye Sector. Surely, you would not
be so well acquainted with events if Wye were not the prime mover.”</p>
<p>Rashelle laughed aloud. “Wye has its eyes and ears everywhere, of
course, but we were not the pursuers. Had we been, you would have been
picked up without fail—as you were in Dahl finally when, indeed, we were
the pursuers. When, however, there is a pursuit that fails, a grasping
hand that misses, you may be sure that it is Demerzel.”</p>
<p>“Do you think so little of Demerzel?” murmured Dors.</p>
<p>“Yes. Does that surprise you? We have beaten him.”</p>
<p>“You? Or the Wye Sector?”</p>
<p>“The sector, of course, but insofar as Wye is the victor, then I am
the victor.”</p>
<p>“How strange,” said Dors. “There seems to be a prevalent opinion
throughout Trantor that the inhabitants of Wye have nothing to do with
victory, with defeat, or with anything else. It is felt that there is
but one will and one fist in Wye and that is that of the Mayor. Surely,
you—or any other Wyan—weigh nothing in comparison.”</p>
<p>Rashelle smiled broadly. She paused to look at Raych benevolently and
to pinch his cheek, then said, “If you believe that our Mayor is an
autocrat and that there is but one will that sways Wye, then perhaps you
are right. But, even so, I can still use the personal pronoun, for my
will is of account.”</p>
<p>“Why yours?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Rashelle as the servers began clearing the table. “I
am the Mayor of Wye.”</p>
