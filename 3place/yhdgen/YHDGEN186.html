<h4 id="section">48</h4>
<p>Venabili woke up and could tell by her timeband that the night period
was only half over. Not hearing Hari’s snore, she could tell that his
cot was empty. If he had not left the apartment, then he was in the
bathroom.</p>
<p>She tapped lightly on the door and said softly, “Hari?”</p>
<p>He said, “Come in,” in an abstracted way and she did.</p>
<p>The toilet lid was down and Seldon, seated upon it, held the Book
open on his lap. He said, quite unnecessarily, “I’m reading.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I see that. But why?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t sleep. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“But why read in here?”</p>
<p>“If I had turned on the room light, I would have woken you up.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure the Book can’t be illuminated?”</p>
<p>“Pretty sure. When Raindrop Forty-Three described its workings, she
never mentioned illumination. Besides, I suppose that would use up so
much energy that the battery wouldn’t last the life of the Book.” He
sounded dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Dors said, “You can step out, then. I want to use this place, as long
as I’m here.”</p>
<p>When she emerged, she found him sitting cross legged on his cot,
still reading, with the room well lighted.</p>
<p>She said, “You don’t look happy. Does the Book disappoint you?”</p>
<p>He looked up at her, blinking. “Yes, it does. I’ve sampled it here
and there. It’s all I’ve had time to do. The thing is a virtual
encyclopedia and the index is almost entirely a listing of people and
places that are of little use for my purposes. It has nothing to do with
the Galactic Empire or the pre-Imperial Kingdoms either. It deals almost
entirely with a single world and, as nearly as I can make out from what
I have read, it is an endless dissertation on internal politics.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you underestimate its age. It may deal with a period when
there was indeed only one world … one inhabited world.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” said Seldon a little impatiently. “That’s actually
what I want—provided I can be sure it’s history, not legend. I wonder. I
don’t want to believe it just because I want to believe it.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Well, this matter of a single-world origin is much in the
air these days. Human beings are a single species spread all over the
Galaxy, so they must have originated somewhere. At least that’s the
popular view at present. You can’t have independent origins producing
the same species on different worlds.”</p>
<p>“But I’ve never seen the inevitability of that argument,” said
Seldon. “If human beings arose on a number of worlds as a number of
different species, why couldn’t they have interbred into some single
intermediate species?”</p>
<p>“Because species can’t interbreed. That’s what makes them
species.”</p>
<p>Seldon thought about it a moment, then dismissed it with a shrug.
“Well, I’ll leave it to the biologists.”</p>
<p>“They’re precisely the ones who are keenest on the Earth
hypothesis.”</p>
<p>“Earth? Is that what they call the supposed world of origin?”</p>
<p>“That’s a popular name for it, though there’s no way of telling what
it was called, assuming there was one. And no one has any clue to what
its location might be.”</p>
<p>“Earth!” said Seldon, curling his lips. “It sounds like a belch to
me. In any case, if the book deals with the original world, I didn’t
come across it. How do you spell the word?”</p>
<p>She told him and he checked the Book quickly. “There you are. The
name is not listed in the index, either by that spelling or any
reasonable alternative.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“And they do mention other worlds in passing. Names aren’t given and
there seems no interest in those other worlds except insofar as they
directly impinge on the local world they speak of … at least as far as I
can see from what I’ve read. In one place, they talked about ‘The
Fifty.’ I don’t know what they meant. Fifty leaders? Fifty cities? It
seemed to me to be fifty worlds.”</p>
<p>“Did they give a name to their own world, this world that seems to
preoccupy them entirely?” asked Dors. “If they don’t call it Earth, what
do they call it?”</p>
<p>“As you’d expect, they call it ‘the world’ or ‘the planet.’ Sometimes
they call it ‘the Oldest’ or ‘the World of the Dawn,’ which has a poetic
significance, I presume, that isn’t clear to me. I suppose one ought to
read the Book entirely through and some matters will then grow to make
more sense.” He looked down at the Book in his hand with some distaste.
“It would take a very long time, though, and I’m not sure that I’d end
up any the wiser.”</p>
<p>Dors sighed. “I’m sorry, Hari. You sound so disappointed.”</p>
<p>“That’s because I am disappointed. It’s my fault, though. I should
not have allowed myself to expect too much. —At one point, come to think
of it, they referred to their world as ‘Aurora.’”</p>
<p>“Aurora?” said Dors, lifting her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“It sounds like a proper name. It doesn’t make any sense otherwise,
as far as I can see. Does it mean anything to you, Dors?”</p>
<p>“Aurora.” Dors thought about it with a slight frown on her face. “I
can’t say I’ve ever heard of a planet with that name in the course of
the history of the Galactic Empire or during the period of its growth,
for that matter, but I won’t pretend to know the name of every one of
the twenty-five million worlds. We could look it up in the University
library—if we ever get back to Streeling. There’s no use trying to find
a library here in Mycogen. Somehow I have a feeling that all their
knowledge is in the Book. If anything isn’t there, they aren’t
interested.”</p>
<p>Seldon yawned and said, “I think you’re right. In any case, there’s
no use reading any more and I doubt that I can keep my eyes open any
longer. Is it all right if I put out the light?”</p>
<p>“I would welcome it, Hari. And let’s sleep a little later in the
morning.”</p>
<p>Then, in the dark, Seldon said softly, “Of course, some of what they
say is ridiculous. For instance, they refer to a life expectancy on
their world of between three and four centuries.”</p>
<p>“Centuries?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they count their ages by decades rather than by years. It gives
you a queer feeling, because so much of what they say is perfectly
matter-of-fact that when they come out with something that odd, you
almost find yourself trapped into believing it.”</p>
<p>“If you feel yourself beginning to believe that, then you should
realize that many legends of primitive origins assume extended life
spans for early leaders. If they’re pictured as unbelievably heroic, you
see, it seems natural that they have life spans to suit.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” said Seldon, yawning again.</p>
<p>“It is. And the cure for advanced gullibility is to go to sleep and
consider matters again the next day.”</p>
<p>And Seldon, pausing only long enough to think that an extended life
span might well be a simple necessity for anyone trying to understand a
Galaxy of people, slept.</p>
