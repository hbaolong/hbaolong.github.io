<h4 id="section">18</h4>
<p>Raych sat in the anteroom of a public building in Dahl into which he
had never ventured—never could have ventured—as a ragamuffin youth. He
felt, in all truth, a little uneasy about it now, as though he were
trespassing.</p>
<p>He tried to look calm, trustworthy, lovable.</p>
<p>Dad had told him that this was a quality he carried around with him,
but he had never been conscious of it. If it came about naturally, he
would probably spoil it by trying too hard to seem to be what he really
was.</p>
<p>He tried relaxing while keeping an eye on the official who was
manipulating a computer at the desk. The official was not a Dahlite. He
was, in fact, Gambol Deen Namarti, who had been with Joranum at the
meeting with Dad that Raych had attended.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, Namarti would look up from his desk and glance
at Raych with a hostile glare. This Namarti wasn’t buying Raych’s
lovability. Raych could see that.</p>
<p>Raych did not try to meet Namarti’s hostility with a friendly smile.
It would have seemed too artificial. He simply waited. He had gotten
this far. If Joranum arrived, as he was expected to, Raych would have a
chance to speak to him.</p>
<p>Joranum did arrive, sweeping in, smiling his public smile of warmth
and confidence. Namarti’s hand came up and Joranum stopped. They spoke
together in low voices while Raych watched intently and tried in vain to
seem as if he wasn’t. It seemed plain to Raych that Namarti was arguing
against the meeting and Raych bridled a bit at that.</p>
<p>Then Joranum looked at Raych, smiled, and pushed Namarti to one side.
It occurred to Raych that, while Namarti was the brains of the team, it
was Joranum who clearly had the charisma.</p>
<p>Joranum strode toward him and held out a plump, slightly moist hand.
“Well well. Professor Seldon’s young man. How are you?”</p>
<p>“Fine, thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>“You had some trouble getting here, I understand.”</p>
<p>“Not too much, sir.”</p>
<p>“And you’ve come with a message from your father, I trust. I hope he
is reconsidering his decision and has decided to join me in my great
crusade.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, sir.”</p>
<p>Joranum frowned slightly. “Are you here without his knowledge?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. He sent me.”</p>
<p>“I see. —Are you hungry, lad?”</p>
<p>“Not at the moment, sir.”</p>
<p>“Then would you mind if I eat? I don’t get much time for the ordinary
amenities of life,” he said, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>“It’s all right with me, sir.”</p>
<p>Together, they moved to a table and sat down. Joranum unwrapped a
sandwich and took a bite. His voice slightly muffled, he said, “And why
did he send you, son?”</p>
<p>Raych shrugged. “I think he thought I might find out something about
you that he could use against you. He’s heart and soul with First
Minister Demerzel.”</p>
<p>“And you’re not?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. I’m a Dahlite.”</p>
<p>“I know you are, Mr. Seldon, but what does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means I’m oppressed, so I’m on your side and I want to help you.
Of course, I wouldn’t want my father to know.”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason he should know. How do you propose to help me?” He
glanced quickly at Namarti, who was leaning against his desk, listening,
with his arms folded and his expression lowering. “Do you know anything
about psychohistory?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. My father don’t talk to me about that—and if he did, I
wouldn’t get it. I don’t think he’s getting anywhere with that
stuff.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Sure I’m sure. There’s a guy there, Yugo Amaryl, also a Dahlite, who
talks about it sometimes. I’m sure nothing is happening.”</p>
<p>“Ah! And can I see Yugo Amaryl sometime, do you suppose?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. He ain’t much for Demerzel, but he’s all for my
father. He wouldn’t cross him.”</p>
<p>“But you would?”</p>
<p>Raych looked unhappy and he muttered stubbornly, “I’m a Dahlite.”</p>
<p>Joranum cleared his throat. “Then let me ask you again. How do you
propose to help me, young man?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got something to tell you that maybe you won’t believe.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? Try me. If I don’t believe it, I will tell you so.”</p>
<p>“It’s about First Minister Eto Demerzel.” “Well?”</p>
<p>Raych looked around uneasily. “Can anyone hear me?”</p>
<p>“Just Namarti and myself.”</p>
<p>“All right, then listen. This guy Demerzel ain’t a guy. He’s a
robot.”</p>
<p>“What!” exploded Joranum.</p>
<p>Raych felt moved to explain. “A robot is a mechanical man, sir. He
ain’t human. He’s a machine.”</p>
<p>Namarti broke out passionately, “Jo-Jo, don’t believe that. It’s
ridiculous.”</p>
<p>But Joranum held up an admonitory hand. His eyes were gleaming. “Why
do you say that?”</p>
<p>“My father was in Mycogen once. He told me all about it. In Mycogen
they talk about robots a lot.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know. At least, I have heard so.”</p>
<p>“They Mycogenians believe that robots were once very common among
their ancestors, but they were wiped out.”</p>
<p>Namarti’s eyes narrowed. “But what makes you think that Demerzel is a
robot? From what little I have heard of these fantasies, robots are made
out of metal, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” said Raych earnestly. “But what I heard is that there
were a few robots that look just like human beings and they live
forever—”</p>
<p>Namarti shook his head violently. “Legends! Ridiculous legends!
Jo-Jo, why are we listening—”</p>
<p>But Joranum cut him off quickly. “No, G.D. I want to listen. I’ve
heard these legends, too.”</p>
<p>“But it’s nonsense, Jo-Jo.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be in such a rush to say ‘nonsense.’ And even if it were,
people live and die by nonsense. It’s not what is so much as what people
think is. —Tell me, young man, putting legends to one side, what makes
you think Demerzel is a robot? Let’s suppose that robots exist. What is
it, then, about Demerzel that makes you say he is a robot? Did he tell
you so?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” said Raych.</p>
<p>“Did your father tell you so?” asked Joranum.</p>
<p>“No, sir. It’s just my own idea, but I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>“Why? What makes you so sure?”</p>
<p>“It’s just something about him. He doesn’t change. He doesn’t get
older. He doesn’t show emotions. Something about him looks like he’s
made of metal.”</p>
<p>Joranum sat back in his chair and looked at Raych for an extended
time. It was almost possible to hear his thoughts buzzing.</p>
<p>Finally he said, “Suppose he is a robot, young man. Why should you
care? Does it matter to you?”</p>
<p>“Of course it matters to me,” said Raych. “I’m a human being. I don’t
want no robot in charge of running the Empire.”</p>
<p>Joranum turned to Namarti with a gesture of eager approval. “Do you
hear that, G.D.? ‘I’m a human being. I don’t want no robot in charge of
running the Empire.’ Put him on holovision and have him say it. Have him
repeat it over and over till it’s drummed into every person on
Trantor—”</p>
<p>“Hey,” said Raych, finally catching his breath. “I can’t say that on
holovision. I can’t let my father find out—”</p>
<p>“No, of course not,” said Joranum quickly. “We couldn’t allow that.
We’ll just use the words. We’ll find some other Dahlite. Someone from
each of the sectors, each in his own dialect, but always the same
message: ‘I don’t want no robot in charge of running the Empire.’”</p>
<p>Namarti said, “And what happens when Demerzel proves he’s not a
robot?”</p>
<p>“Really,” said Joranum. “How will he do that? It would be impossible
for him to do so. Psychologically impossible. What? The great Demerzel,
the power behind the throne, the man who has twitched the strings
attached to Cleon I all these years and those attached to Cleon’s father
before him? Will he climb down now and whine to the public that he is,
too, a human being? That would be almost as destructive to him as being
a robot. G.D., we have the villain in a no-win situation and we owe it
all to this fine young man here.”</p>
<p>Raych flushed.</p>
<p>Joranum said, “Raych is your name, isn’t it? Once our party is in a
position to do so, we won’t forget. Dahl will be treated well and you
will have a good position with us. You’re going to be Dahl’s sector
leader someday, Raych, and you’re not going to regret you’ve done this.
Are you, now?”</p>
<p>“Not on your life,” said Raych fervently.</p>
<p>“In that case, we’ll see that you get back to your father. You let
him know that we intend him no harm, that we value him greatly. You can
tell him you found that out in any way you please. And if you find
anything else you think we might be able to use—about psychohistory, in
particular, you let us know.”</p>
<p>“You bet. But do you mean it when you say you’ll see to it that Dahl
gets some breaks?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Equality of sectors, my boy. Equality of worlds. We’ll
have a new Empire with all the old villainies of privilege and
inequality wiped out.”</p>
<p>And Raych nodded his head vigorously. “That’s what I want.”</p>
