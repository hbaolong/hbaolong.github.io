<h4 id="section">87</h4>
<p>Breakfast the next morning was served in an alcove near the rooms of
the captured three and it was luxurious indeed. There certainly was a
considerable variety to the food and more than enough of everything.</p>
<p>Seldon sat at the breakfast table with a mound of spicy sausages
before him, totally ignoring Dors Venabili’s gloomy predictions
concerning stomachs and colic.</p>
<p>Raych said, “The dame … the Madam Mayor said when she came to see me
last night—”</p>
<p>“She came to see you?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Yeah. She said she wanted to make sure I was comfortable. She said
when she had a chance she would take me to a zoo.”</p>
<p>“A zoo?” Seldon looked at Dors. “What kind of zoo can they have on
Trantor? Cats and dogs?”</p>
<p>“There are some aboriginal animals,” said Dors, “and I imagine they
import some aboriginals from other worlds and there are also the shared
animals that all the worlds have—other worlds having more than Trantor,
of course. As a matter of fact, Wye has a famous zoo, probably the best
on the planet after the Imperial Zoo itself.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “She’s a nice old lady.”</p>
<p>“Not that old,” said Dors, “but she’s certainly feeding us well.”</p>
<p>“There’s that,” admitted Seldon.</p>
<p>When breakfast was over, Raych left to go exploring.</p>
<p>Once they had retired to Dors’s room, Seldon said with marked
discontent, “I don’t know how long we’ll be left to ourselves. She’s
obviously plotted ways of preoccupying our time.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Actually, we have little to complain of at the moment.
We’re much more comfortable here than we were either in Mycogen or
Dahl.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Dors, you’re not being won over by that woman, are
you?”</p>
<p>“Me? By Rashelle? Of course not. How can you possibly think so?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re comfortable. You’re well-fed. It would be natural to
relax and accept what fortune brings.”</p>
<p>“Yes, very natural. And why not do that?”</p>
<p>“Look, you were telling me last night about what’s going to happen if
she wins out. I may not be much of a historian myself, but I am willing
to take your word for it and, actually, it makes sense—even to a
nonhistorian. The Empire will shatter and its shards will be fighting
each other for … for … indefinitely. She must be stopped.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” said Dors. “She must be. What I fail to see is how we can
manage to do that little thing right at this moment.” She looked at
Seldon narrowly. “Hari, you didn’t sleep last night, did you?”</p>
<p>“Did you?” It was apparent he had not.</p>
<p>Dors stared at him, a troubled look clouding her face. “Have you lain
awake thinking of Galactic destruction because of what I said?”</p>
<p>“That and some other things. Is it possible to reach Chetter Hummin?”
This last was said in a whisper.</p>
<p>Dors said, “I tried to reach him when we first had to flee arrest in
Dahl. He didn’t come. I’m sure he received the message, but he didn’t
come. It may be that, for any of a number of reasons, he just couldn’t
come to us, but when he can he will.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose something has happened to him?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dors patiently. “I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“How can you know?”</p>
<p>“The word would somehow get to me. I’m sure of it. And the word
hasn’t gotten to me.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned and said, “I’m not as confident as you are about all
this. In fact, I’m not confident at all. Even if Hummin came, what can
he do in this case? He can’t fight all of Wye. If they have, as Rashelle
claims, the best-organized army on Trantor, what will he be able to do
against it?”</p>
<p>“There’s no point in discussing that. Do you suppose you can convince
Rashelle—bang it into her head somehow—that you don’t have
psychohistory?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’s aware that I don’t have it and that I’m not going to
get it for many years—if at all. But she’ll say I have psychohistory and
if she does that skillfully enough, people will believe her and
eventually they will act on what she says my predictions and
pronouncements are—even if I don’t say a word.”</p>
<p>“Surely, that will take time. She won’t build you up overnight. Or in
a week. To do it properly, it might take her a year.”</p>
<p>Seldon was pacing the length of the room, turning sharply on his heel
and striding back. “That might be so, but I don’t know. There would be
pressure on her to do things quickly. She doesn’t strike me as the kind
of woman who has cultivated the habit of patience. And her old father,
Mannix IV, would be even more impatient. He must feel the nearness of
death and if he’s worked for this all his life, he would much prefer to
see it done a week before his death rather than a week after. Besides—”
Here he paused and looked around the empty room.</p>
<p>“Besides what?”</p>
<p>“Well, we must have our freedom. You see, I’ve solved the
psychohistory problem.”</p>
<p>Dors’s eyes widened. “You have it! You’ve worked it out.”</p>
<p>“Not worked it out in the full sense. That might take decades …
centuries, for all I know. But I now know it’s practical, not just
theoretical. I know it can be done so I must have the time, the peace,
the facilities to work at it. The Empire must be held together till I—or
possibly my successors—will learn how best to keep it so or how to
minimize the disaster if it does split up despite us. It was the thought
of having a beginning to my task and of not being able to work at it,
that kept me up last night.”</p>
