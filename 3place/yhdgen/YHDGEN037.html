<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>The Commdora was much younger than her husband. Her face was pale and
coldly formed and her black hair was drawn smoothly and tightly
back.</p>
<p>Her voice was tart. “You are quite finished, my gracious and noble
husband? Quite, quite finished? I suppose I may even enter the garden if
I wish, now.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for dramatics, Licia, my dear,” said the Commdor,
mildly. “The young man will attend at dinner tonight, and you can speak
with him all you wish and even amuse yourself by listening to all I say.
Room will have to be arranged for his men somewhere about the place. The
stars grant that they be few in numbers.”</p>
<p>“Most likely they’ll be great hogs of eaters who will eat meat by the
quarter-animal and wine by the hogshead. And you will groan for two
nights when you calculate the expense.”</p>
<p>“Well now, perhaps I won’t. Despite your opinion, the dinner is to be
on the most lavish scale.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.” She stared at him contemptuously. “You are very friendly
with these barbarians. Perhaps that is why I was not to be permitted to
attend your conversation. Perhaps your little weazened soul is plotting
to turn against my father.”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’d be likely to believe you, wouldn’t I? If ever a poor woman
was sacrificed for policy to an unsavory marriage, it was myself. I
could have picked a more proper man from the alleys and mudheaps of my
native world.”</p>
<p>“Well, now, I’ll tell you what, my lady. Perhaps you would enjoy
returning to your native world. Except that, to retain as a souvenir
that portion of you with which I am best acquainted, I could have your
tongue cut out first. And,” he lolled his head, calculatingly, to one
side, “as a final improving touch to your beauty, your ears and the tip
of your nose as well.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t dare, you little pug-dog. My father would pulverize
your toy nation to meteoric dust. In fact, he might do it in any case,
if I told him you were treating with these barbarians.”</p>
<p>“Hm-m-m. Well, there’s no need for threats. You are free to question
the man yourself tonight. Meanwhile, madam, keep your wagging tongue
still.”</p>
<p>“At your orders?”</p>
<p>“Here, take this, then, and keep still.”</p>
<p>The band was about her waist and the necklace around her neck. He
pushed the knob himself and stepped back.</p>
<p>The Commdora drew in her breath and held out her hands stiffly. She
fingered the necklace gingerly, and gasped again.</p>
<p>The Commdor rubbed his hands with satisfaction and said, “You may
wear it tonight—and I’ll get you more. Now keep still.”</p>
<p>The Commdora kept still.</p>
