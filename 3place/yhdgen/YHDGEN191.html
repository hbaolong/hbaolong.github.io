<h4 id="section">53</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon rose as the new Mycogenian approached. He hadn’t the
slightest idea whether that was the appropriate polite behavior, but he
had the distinct feeling it would do no harm. Dors Venabili rose with
him and carefully kept her eyes lowered.</p>
<p>The other stood before them. He too was an old man, but more subtly
aged than Mycelium Seventy-Two. Age seemed to lend distinction to his
still-handsome face. His bald head was beautifully round and his eyes
were a startling blue, contrasting sharply with the bright
all-but-glowing red of his sash.</p>
<p>The newcomer said, “I see you are tribespeople.” His voice was more
high-pitched than Seldon had expected, but he spoke slowly, as though
conscious of the weight of authority in every word he uttered.</p>
<p>“So we are,” said Seldon politely but firmly. He saw no reason not to
defer to the other’s position, but he did not intend to abandon his
own.</p>
<p>“Your names?”</p>
<p>“I am Hari Seldon of Helicon. My companion is Dors Venabili of Cinna.
And yours, man of Mycogen?”</p>
<p>The eyes narrowed in displeasure, but he too could recognize an air
of authority when he felt it.</p>
<p>“I am Skystrip Two,” he said, lifting his head higher, “an Elder of
the Sacratorium. And your position, tribesman?”</p>
<p>“We,” said Seldon, emphasizing the pronoun, “are scholars of
Streeling University. I am a mathematician and my companion is a
historian and we are here to study the ways of Mycogen.”</p>
<p>“By whose authority?”</p>
<p>“By that of Sunmaster Fourteen, who greeted us on our arrival.”</p>
<p>Skystrip Two fell silent for a moment and then a small smile appeared
on his face and he took on an air that was almost benign. He said, “The
High Elder. I know him well.”</p>
<p>“And so you should,” said Seldon blandly. “Is there anything else,
Elder?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” The Elder strove to regain the high ground. “Who was the man
who was with you and who hurried away when I approached?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head, “We never saw him before, Elder, and know
nothing about him. We encountered him purely by accident and asked about
the Sacratorium.”</p>
<p>“What did you ask him?”</p>
<p>“Two questions, Elder. We asked if that building was the Sacratorium
and if tribespeople were allowed to enter it. He answered in the
affirmative to the first question and in the negative to the
second.”</p>
<p>“Quite so. And what is your interest in the Sacratorium?”</p>
<p>“Sir, we are here to study the ways of Mycogen and is not the
Sacratorium the heart and brain of Mycogen?”</p>
<p>“It is entirely ours and reserved for us.”</p>
<p>“Even if an Elder—the High Elder—would arrange for permission in view
of our scholarly function?”</p>
<p>“Have you indeed the High Elder’s permission?”</p>
<p>Seldon hesitated the slightest moment while Dors’s eyes lifted
briefly to look at him sideways. He decided he could not carry off a lie
of this magnitude. “No,” he said, “not yet.”</p>
<p>“Or ever,” said the Elder. “You are here in Mycogen by authority, but
even the highest authority cannot exert total control over the public.
We value our Sacratorium and the populace can easily grow excited over
the presence of a tribesperson anywhere in Mycogen but, most
particularly, in the vicinity of the Sacratorium. It would take one
excitable person to raise a cry of ‘Invasion!’ and a peaceful crowd such
as this one would be turned into one that would be thirsting to tear you
apart. I mean that quite literally. For your own good, even if the High
Elder has shown you kindness, leave. Now!”</p>
<p>“But the Sacratorium—” said Seldon stubbornly, though Dors was
pulling gently at his kirtle.</p>
<p>“What is there in the Sacratorium that can possibly interest you?”
said the Elder. “You see it now. There is nothing for you to see in the
interior.”</p>
<p>“There is the robot,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>The Elder stared at Seldon in shocked surprise and then, bending to
bring his lips close to Seldon’s ear, whispered harshly, “Leave now or I
will raise the cry of ‘Invasion!’ myself. Nor, were it not for the High
Elder, would I give you even this one chance to leave.”</p>
<p>And Dors, with surprising strength, nearly pulled Seldon off his feet
as she stepped hastily away, dragging him along until he caught his
balance and stepped quickly after her.</p>
