<p>SAYSHELL</p>
<ol type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Janov Pelorat watched, for the first time in his life, as the bright
star graduated into an orb after what Trevize had called a “micro-Jump.”
The fourth planet—the habitable one and their immediate destination,
Sayshell—then grew in size and prominence more slowly—over a period of
days.</p>
<p>A map of the planet had been produced by the computer and was
displayed on a portable screening device, which Pelorat held in his
lap.</p>
<p>Trevize—with the aplomb of someone who had, in his time, touched down
upon several dozen worlds—said, “Don’t start watching too hard too soon,
Janov. We have to go through the entry station first and that can be
tedious.”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked up. “Surely that’s just a formality.”</p>
<p>“It is. But it can still be tedious.”</p>
<p>“But it’s peacetime.”</p>
<p>“Of course. That means we’ll be passed through. First, though,
there’s a little matter of the ecological balance. Every planet has its
own and they don’t want it upset. So they make a natural point of
checking the ship for undesirable organisms, or infections. It’s a
reasonable precaution.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have such things, it seems to me.”</p>
<p>“No, we don’t and they’ll find that out. Remember, too, that Sayshell
is not a member of the Foundation Federation, so there’s certain to be
some leaning over backward to demonstrate their independence.”</p>
<p>A small ship came out to inspect them and a Sayshellian Customs
official boarded. Trevize was brisk, not having forgotten his military
days.</p>
<p>“The Far Star, out of Terminus,” he said. “Ship’s papers. Unarmed.
Private vessel. My passport. There is one passenger. His passport. We
are tourists.”</p>
<p>The Customs official wore a garish uniform in which crimson was the
dominating color. Cheeks and upper lip were smooth-shaven, but he wore a
short beard parted in such a way that tufts thrust out to both sides of
his chin. He said, “Foundation ship?”</p>
<p>He pronounced it “Foundaysun sip,” but Trevize was careful neither to
correct him nor to smile. There were as many varieties of dialects to
Galactic Standard as there were planets, and you just spoke your own. As
long as there was cross-comprehension, it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” said Trevize. “Foundation ship. Privately owned.”</p>
<p>“Very nice. —Your lading, if you please.”</p>
<p>“My what?”</p>
<p>“Your lading. What are you carrying?”</p>
<p>“Ah, my cargo. Here is the itemized list. Personal property only. We
are not here to trade. As I told you, we are simply tourists.”</p>
<p>The Customs official looked about curiously. “This is rather an
elaborate vessel for tourists.”</p>
<p>“Not by Foundation standards,” said Trevize with a display of good
humor. “And I’m well off and can afford this.”</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting that I might be richified?” The official looked
at him briefly, then looked away.</p>
<p>Trevize hesitated a moment in order to interpret the meaning of the
word, then another moment to decide his course of action. He said, “No,
it is not my intention to bribe you. I have no reason to bribe you—and
you don’t look like the kind of person who could be bribed, if that were
my intention. You can look over the ship, if you wish.”</p>
<p>“No need,” said the official, putting away his pocket recorder. “You
have already been examined for specific contraband infection and have
passed. The ship has been assigned a radio wavelength that will serve as
an approach beam.”</p>
<p>He left. The whole procedure had taken fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Pelorat said in a low voice. “Could he have made trouble? Did he
really expect a bribe?”</p>
<p>Trevize shrugged. “Tipping the Customs man is as old as the Galaxy
and I would have done it readily if he had made a second try for it. As
it is—well, I presume he prefers not to take a chance with a Foundation
ship, and a fancy one, at that. The old Mayor, bless her cross-grained
hide, said the name of the Foundation would protect us wherever we went
and she wasn’t wrong. —It could have taken a great deal longer.”</p>
<p>“Why? He seemed to find out what he wanted to know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but he was courteous enough to check us by remote
radio-scanning. If he had wished, he could have gone over the ship with
a hand-machine and taken hours. He could have put us both in a field
hospital and kept us days.”</p>
<p>“What? My dear fellow!”</p>
<p>“Don’t get excited. He didn’t do it. I thought he might, but he
didn’t. Which means we’re free to land. I’d like to go down
gravitically—which could take us fifteen minutes—but I don’t know where
the permitted landing sites might be and I don’t want to cause trouble.
That means we’ll have to follow the radio beam—which will take hours—as
we spiral down through the atmosphere.”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked cheerful. “But that’s excellent, Golan. Will we be
going slowly enough to watch the terrain?” He held up his portable
viewscreen with the map spread out on it at low magnification.</p>
<p>“After a fashion. We’d have to get beneath the cloud deck, and we’ll
be moving at a few kilometers per second. It won’t be ballooning through
the atmosphere, but you’ll spot the planetography.”</p>
<p>“Excellent! Excellent!”</p>
<p>Trevize said thoughtfully, “I’m wondering, though, if we’ll be on
Sayshell Planet long enough to make it worth our while to adjust the
ship’s clock to local time.”</p>
<p>“It depends on what we plan to do, I suppose. What do you think we’ll
be doing, Golan?”</p>
<p>“Our job is to find Gaia and I don’t know how long that will
take.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “We can adjust our wrist-strips and leave the ship’s
clock as is.”</p>
<p>“Good enough,” said Trevize. He looked down at the planet spreading
broadly beneath them. “No use waiting any longer. I’ll adjust the
computer to our assigned radio beam and it can use the gravitics to
mimic conventional flight. So! —Let’s go down, Janov, and see what we
can find.”</p>
<p>He stared at the planet thoughtfully as the ship began to move on its
smoothly adjusted gravitational potential-curve.</p>
<p>Trevize had never been in the Sayshell Union, but he knew that over
the last century it had been steadfastly unfriendly to the Foundation.
He was surprised—and a little dismayed—they had gotten through Customs
so quickly.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem reasonable.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The customs official’s name was Jogoroth Sobhaddartha and he had been
serving on the station on and off for half his life.</p>
<p>He didn’t mind the life, for it gave him a chance—one month out of
three—to view his books, to listen to his music, and to be away from his
wife and growing son.</p>
<p>Of course, during the last two years the current Head of Customs had
been a Dreamer, which was irritating. There is no one so insufferable as
a person who gives no other excuse for a peculiar action than saying he
had been directed to it in a dream.</p>
<p>Personally Sobhaddartha decided he believed none of it, though he was
careful not to say so aloud, since most people on Sayshell rather
disapproved of antipsychic doubts. To become known as a materialist
might put his forthcoming pension at risk.</p>
<p>He stroked the two tufts of hair at his chin, one with his right hand
and the other with his left, cleared his throat rather loudly, and then,
with inappropriate casualness, said, “Was that the ship, Head?”</p>
<p>The Head, who bore the equally Sayshellian name of Namarath
Godhisavatta, was concerned with a matter involving some computer-born
data and did not look up. “What ship?” he said.</p>
<p>“The Far Star. The Foundation ship. The one I just sent past. The one
that was holographed from every angle. Was that the one you dreamed
of?”</p>
<p>Godhisavatta looked up now. He was a small man, with eyes that were
almost black and that were surrounded by fine wrinkles that had not been
produced by any penchant for smiling. He said, “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>Sobhaddartha straightened up and allowed his dark and luxuriant
eyebrows to approach each other. “They said they were tourists, but I’ve
never seen a ship like that before and my own opinion is they’re
Foundation agents.”</p>
<p>Godhisavatta sat back in his chair. “See here, my man, try as I might
I cannot recall asking for your opinion.”</p>
<p>“But Head, I consider it my patriotic duty to point out that—”</p>
<p>Godhisavatta crossed his arms over his chest and stared hard at the
underling, who (though much the more impressive in physical stature and
bearing) allowed himself to droop and take on a somehow bedraggled
appearance under the gaze of his superior.</p>
<p>Godhisavatta said, “My man, if you know what is good for you, you
will do your job without comment—or I’ll see to it that there will be no
pension when you retire, which will be soon if I hear any more on a
subject that does not concern you.”</p>
<p>In a low voice, Sobhaddartha said, “Yes, sir.” Then, with a
suspicious degree of subservience in his voice, he added, “Is it within
the range of my duties, sir, to report that a second ship is in range of
our screens?”</p>
<p>“Consider it reported,” Godhisavatta said irritably, returning to his
work.</p>
<p>“With,” said Sobhaddartha even more humbly, “characteristics very
similar to the one I just sent through.”</p>
<p>Godhisavatta placed his hands on the desk and lifted himself to his
feet. “A second one?”</p>
<p>Sobhaddartha smiled inwardly. That sanguinary person born of an
irregular union (he was referring to the Head) had clearly not dreamed
of two ships. He said, “Apparently, sir! I will now return to my post
and await orders and I hope, sir—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Sobhaddartha could not resist, pension-risk notwithstanding. “And I
hope, sir, we didn’t send the wrong one through.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The far star moved rapidly across the face of Sayshell Planet and
Pelorat watched with fascination. The cloud layer was thinner and more
scattered than upon Terminus and, precisely as the map showed, the land
surfaces were more compact and extensive—including broader desert areas,
to judge by the rusty color of much of the continental expanse.</p>
<p>There were no signs of anything living. It seemed a world of sterile
desert, gray plain, of endless wrinkles that might have represented
mountainous areas, and, of course, of ocean.</p>
<p>“It looks lifeless,” muttered Pelorat.</p>
<p>“You don’t expect to see any life-signs at this height,” said
Trevize. “As we get lower, you’ll see the land turn green in patches.
Before that, in fact, you’ll see the twinkling landscape on the
nightside. Human beings have a penchant for lighting their worlds when
darkness falls; I’ve never heard of a world that’s an exception to that
rule. In other words, the first sign of life you’ll see will not only be
human but technological.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said thoughtfully, “Human beings are diurnal in nature, after
all. It seems to me that among the very first tasks of a developing
technology would be the conversion of night to day. In fact, if a world
lacked technology and developed one, you ought to be able to follow the
progress of technological development by the increase in light upon the
darkened surface. How long would it take, do you suppose, to go from
uniform darkness to uniform light?”</p>
<p>Trevize laughed. “You have odd thoughts, but I suppose that comes
from being a mythologist. I don’t think a world would ever achieve a
uniform glow. Night light would follow the pattern of population
density, so that the continents would spark in knots and strings. Even
Trantor at its height, when it was one huge structure, let light escape
that structure only at scattered points.”</p>
<p>The land turned green as Trevize had predicted and, on the last
circling of the globe, he pointed out markings that he said were cities.
“It’s not a very urban world. I’ve never been in the Sayshell Union
before, but according to the information the computer gives me, they
tend to cling to the past. Technology, in the eyes of all the Galaxy,
has been associated with the Foundation, and wherever the Foundation is
unpopular, there is a tendency to cling to the past—except, of course,
as far as weapons of war are concerned. I assure you Sayshell is quite
modern in that respect.”</p>
<p>“Dear me, Golan, this is not going to be unpleasant, is it? We are
Foundationers, after all, and being in enemy territory—”</p>
<p>“It’s not enemy territory, Janov. They’ll be perfectly polite, never
fear. The Foundation just isn’t popular, that’s all. Sayshell is not
part of the Foundation Federation. Therefore, because they’re proud of
their independence and because they don’t like to remember that they are
much weaker than the Foundation and remain independent only because
we’re willing to let them remain so, they indulge in the luxury of
disliking us.”</p>
<p>“I fear it will still be unpleasant, then,” said Pelorat
despondently.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Trevize. “Come on, Janov. I’m talking about the
official attitude of the Sayshellian government. The individual people
on the planet are just people, and if we’re pleasant and don’t act as
though we’re Lords of the Galaxy, they’ll be pleasant, too. We’re not
coming to Sayshell in order to establish Foundation mastery. We’re just
tourists, asking the kind of questions about Sayshell that any tourist
would ask.</p>
<p>“And we can have a little legitimate relaxation, too, if the
situation permits. There’s nothing wrong with staying here a few days
and experiencing what they have to offer. They may have an interesting
culture, interesting scenery, interesting food, and—if all else
fails—interesting women. We have money to spend.”</p>
<p>Pelorat frowned, “Oh, my dear chap.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Trevize. “You’re not that old. Wouldn’t you be
interested?”</p>
<p>“I don’t say there wasn’t a time when I played that role properly,
but surely this isn’t the time for it. We have a mission. We want to
reach Gaia. I have nothing against a good time—I really don’t—but if we
start involving ourselves, it might be difficult to pull free.” He shook
his head and said mildly, “I think you feared that I might have too good
a time at the Galactic Library on Trantor and would be unable to pull
free. Surely, what the Library is to me, an attractive dark-eyed
damsel—or five or six—might be to you.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I’m not a rakehell, Janov, but I have no intention of
being ascetic, either, Very well, I promise you we’ll get on with this
business of Gaia, but if something pleasant comes my way, there’s no
reason in the Galaxy I ought not to respond normally.”</p>
<p>“If you’ll just put Gaia first—”</p>
<p>“I will. Just remember, though, don’t tell anyone we’re from the
Foundation. They’ll know we are, because we’ve got Foundation credits
and we speak with strong Terminus accents, but if we say nothing about
it, they can pretend we are placeless strangers and be friendly. If we
make a point of being Foundationers, they will speak politely enough,
but they will tell us nothing, show us nothing, take us nowhere, and
leave us strictly alone.”</p>
<p>Pelorat sighed. “I will never understand people.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to it. All you have to do is take a close look at
yourself and you will understand everyone else. We’re in no way
different ourselves. How would Seldon have worked out his Plan—and I
don’t care how subtle his mathematics was—if he didn’t understand
people; and how could he have done that if people weren’t easy to
understand? You show me someone who can’t understand people and I’ll
show you someone who has built up a false image of himself—no offense
intended.”</p>
<p>“None taken. I’m willing to admit I’m inexperienced and that I’ve
spent a rather self-centered and constricted life. It may be that I’ve
never really taken a good look at myself, so I’ll let you be my guide
and adviser where people are concerned.”</p>
<p>“Good. Then take my advice now and just watch the scenery. We’ll be
landing soon and I assure you you’ll feel nothing. The computer and I
will take care of everything.”</p>
<p>“Golan, don’t be annoyed. If a young woman should—”</p>
<p>“Forget it! Just let me take care of the landing.”</p>
<p>Pelorat turned to look at the world at the end of the ship’s
contracting spiral. It would be the first foreign world upon which he
would ever stand. This thought somehow filled him with foreboding,
despite the fact that all the millions of inhabited planets in the
Galaxy had been colonized by people who had not been born upon them.</p>
<p>All but one, he thought with a shudder of trepidation / delight.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The Spaceport was not large by foundation standards, but it was well
kept. Trevize watched the Far Star moved into a berth and locked in
place. They were given an elaborate coded receipt.</p>
<p>Pelorat said in a low voice, “Do we just leave it here?”</p>
<p>Trevize nodded and placed his hand on the other’s shoulder in
reassurance. “Don’t worry,” he said in an equally low voice.</p>
<p>They stepped into the ground-car they had rented and Trevize plugged
in the map of the city, whose towers he could see on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Sayshell City,” he said, “the capital of the planet.
City—planet—star—all named Sayshell.”</p>
<p>“I’m worried about the ship,” insisted Pelorat.</p>
<p>“Nothing to worry about,” said Trevize. “We’ll be back tonight,
because it will be our sleeping quarters if we have to stay here more
than a few hours. You have to understand, too, that there’s an
interstellar code of spaceport ethics that—as far as I know—has never
been broken, even in wartime, Spaceships that come in peace are
inviolate. If that were not so, no one would be safe and trade would be
impossible. Any world on which that code was broken would be boycotted
by the space pilots of the Galaxy. I assure you, no world would risk
that. Besides—”</p>
<p>“Besides?”</p>
<p>“Well, besides, I’ve arranged with the computer that anyone who
doesn’t look and sound like one of us will be killed if he—or she—tries
to board the ship. I’ve taken the liberty of explaining that to the Port
Commander. I told him very politely that I would love to turn off that
particular facility out of deference to the reputation that the Sayshell
City Spaceport holds for absolute integrity and security—throughout the
Galaxy, I said—but the ship is a new model and I didn’t know how to turn
it off.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t believe that, surely.”</p>
<p>“Of course not! But he had to pretend he did, as otherwise he would
have had no choice but to be insulted. And since there would be nothing
he could do about that, being insulted would only lead to humiliation.
And since he didn’t want that, the simplest path to follow was to
believe what I said.”</p>
<p>“And that’s another example of how people are?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You’ll get used to this.”</p>
<p>“How do you know this ground-car isn’t bugged?”</p>
<p>“I thought it might be. So when they offered me one, I took another
one at random. If they’re all bugged—well, what have we been saying
that’s so terrible?”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked unhappy. “I don’t know how to say this. It seems
rather impolite to complain, but I don’t like the way it smells. There’s
an—odor.”</p>
<p>“In the ground-car?”</p>
<p>“Well, in the spaceport, to begin with. I suppose that’s the way
spaceports smell, but the ground-car carries the odor with it. Could we
open a window?”</p>
<p>Trevize laughed. “I suppose I could figure out which portion of the
control panel will do that trick, but it won’t help. This planet stinks.
Is it very bad?”</p>
<p>“It’s not very strong, but it’s noticeable—and somewhat repulsive.
Does the whole world smell this way?”</p>
<p>“I keep forgetting you’ve never been on another world. Every
inhabited world has its own odor. It’s the general vegetation, mostly,
though I suppose the animals and even the human beings contribute. And
as far as I know, nobody ever likes the smell of any world when he first
lands on it. But you’ll get used to it, Janov. In a few hours, I promise
you won’t notice.”</p>
<p>“Surely you don’t mean that all worlds smell like this.”</p>
<p>“No. As I said, each has its own. If we really paid attention or if
our noses were a little keener—like those of Anacreonian dogs—we could
probably tell which world we were on with one sniff. When I first
entered the Navy I could never eat the first day on a new world; then I
learned the old spacer trick of sniffing a handkerchief with the
world-scent on it during the landing. By the time you get out into the
open world, you don’t smell it. And after a while, you get hardened to
the whole thing; you just learn to disregard it. —The worst of it is
returning home, in fact.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Do you think Terminus doesn’t smell?”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me it does?”</p>
<p>“Of course it does. Once you get acclimated to the smell of another
world, such as Sayshell, you’ll be surprised at the stench of Terminus.
In the old days, whenever the locks opened on Terminus after a sizable
tour of duty, all the crew would call out, ‘Back home to the crap.’”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked revolted.</p>
<p>The towers of the city were perceptibly closer, but Pelorat kept his
eyes fixed on their immediate surroundings. There were other ground-cars
moving in both directions and an occasional air-car above, but Pelorat
was studying the trees.</p>
<p>He said, “The plant life seems strange. Do you suppose any of it is
indigenous?”</p>
<p>“I doubt it,” said Trevize absently. He was studying the map and
attempting to adjust the programming of the car’s computer. “There’s not
much in the way of indigenous life on any human planet. Settlers always
imported their own plants and animals—either at the time of settling or
not too long afterward.”</p>
<p>“It seems strange, though.”</p>
<p>“You don’t expect the same varieties from world to world, Janov. I
was once told that the Encyclopedia Galactica people put out an atlas of
varieties which ran to eighty-seven fat computer-discs and was
incomplete even so—and outdated anyway, by the time it was
finished.”</p>
<p>The ground-car moved on and the outskirts of the city gaped and
engulfed them. Pelorat shivered slightly, “I don’t think much of their
city architecture.”</p>
<p>“To each his own,” said Trevize with the indifference of the seasoned
space traveler.</p>
<p>“Where are we going, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Trevize with a certain exasperation, “I’m trying to get
the computer to guide this thing to the tourist center. I hope the
computer knows the one-way streets and the traffic regulations, because
I don’t.”</p>
<p>“What do we do there, Golan?”</p>
<p>“To begin with, we’re tourists, so that’s the place where we’d
naturally go, and we want to be as inconspicuous and natural as we can.
And secondly, where would you go to get information on Gaia?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “To a university—or an anthropological society—or a
museum—Certainly not to a tourist center.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re wrong. At the tourist center, we will be intellectual
types who are eager to have a listing of the universities in the city
and the museums and so on. We’ll decide where to go to first and there
we may find the proper people to consult concerning ancient history,
galactography, mythology, anthropology, or anything else you can think
of. —But the whole thing starts at the tourist center.”</p>
<p>Pelorat was silent and the ground-car moved on in a tortuous manner
as it joined and became part of the traffic pattern. They plunged into a
sub-road and drove past signs that might have represented directions and
traffic instructions but were in a style of lettering that made them
all-but-unreadable.</p>
<p>Fortunately the ground-car behaved as though it knew the way, and
when it stopped and drew itself into a parking spot, there was a sign
that said: SAYSHELL OUTWORLD MILIEU in the same difficult printing, and
under it: SAYSHELL TOURIST CENTER in straightforward, easy-to-read
Galactic Standard lettering.</p>
<p>They walked into the building, which was not as large as the façade
had led them to believe. It was certainly not busy inside.</p>
<p>There were a series of waiting booths, one of which was occupied by a
man reading the newsstrips emerging from a small ejector; another
contained two women who seemed to be playing some intricate game with
cards and tiles. Behind a counter too large for him, with winking
computer controls that seemed far too complex for him, was a
bored-looking Sayshellian functionary wearing what looked like a
multicolored checkerboard.</p>
<p>Pelorat stared and whispered, “This is certainly a world of
extroverted garb.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize, “I noticed. Still, fashions change from world to
world and even from region to region within a world sometimes. And they
change with time. Fifty years ago, everyone on Sayshell might have worn
black, for all we know. Take it as it comes, Janov.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I’ll have to,” said Pelorat, “but I prefer our own
fashions. At least, they’re not an assault upon the optic nerve.”</p>
<p>“Because so many of us are gray on gray? That offends some people.
I’ve heard it referred to as ‘dressing in dirt.’ Then too, it’s
Foundation colorlessness that probably keeps these people in their
rainbows—just to emphasize their independence. It’s all what you’re
accustomed to, anyway. —Come on, Janov.”</p>
<p>The two headed toward the counter and, as they did so, the man in the
booth forsook his news items, rose, and came to meet them, smiling as he
did so. His clothing was in shades of gray.</p>
<p>Trevize didn’t look in his direction at first, but when he did he
stopped dead.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, “By the Galaxy— My friend, the traitor!”</p>
