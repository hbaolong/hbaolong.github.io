<p>TWO MEN AND THE MULE</p>
<p>There is much more that the Encyclopedia has to say on the subject of
the Mule and his Empire but almost all of it is not germane to the issue
at immediate hand, and most of it is considerably too dry for our
purposes in any case. Mainly, the article concerns itself at this point
with the economic conditions that led to the rise of the “First Citizen
of the Union”—the Mule’s official title—and with the economic
consequences thereof.</p>
<p>If, at any time, the writer of the article is mildly astonished at
the colossal haste with which the Mule rose from nothing to vast
dominion in five years, he conceals it. If he is further surprised at
the sudden cessation of expansion in favor of a five-year consolidation
of territory, he hides the fact.</p>
<p>We therefore abandon the Encyclopedia and continue on our own path
for our own purposes and take up the history of the Great
Interregnum—between the First and Second Galactic Empires—at the end of
that five years of consolidation.</p>
<p>Politically, the Union is quiet. Economically, it is prosperous. Few
would care to exchange the peace of the Mule’s steady grip for the chaos
that had preceded. On the worlds that five years previously had known
the Foundation, there might be a nostalgic regret, but no more. The
Foundation’s leaders were dead, where useless; and Converted, where
useful.</p>
<p>And of the Converted, the most useful was Han Pritcher, now
lieutenant general.</p>
<p>In the days of the Foundation, Han Pritcher had been a captain and a
member of the underground Democratic Opposition. When the Foundation
fell to the Mule without a fight, Pritcher fought the Mule. Until, that
is, he was Converted.</p>
<p>The Conversion was not the ordinary one brought on by the power of
superior reason. Han Pritcher knew that well enough. He had been changed
because the Mule was a mutant with mental powers quite capable of
adjusting the conditions of ordinary humans to suit himself. But that
satisfied him completely. That was as it should be. The very contentment
with the Conversion was a prime symptom of it, but Han Pritcher was no
longer even curious about the matter.</p>
<p>And now that he was returning from his fifth major expedition into
the boundlessness of the Galaxy outside the Union, it was with something
approaching artless joy that the veteran spaceman and Intelligence agent
considered his approaching audience with the “First Citizen.” His hard
face, gouged out of a dark, grainless wood that did not seem to be
capable of smiling without cracking, didn’t show it—but the outward
indications were unnecessary. The Mule could see the emotions within,
down to the smallest, much as an ordinary man could see the twitch of an
eyebrow.</p>
<p>Pritcher left his air car at the old vice-regal hangars and entered
the palace grounds on foot as was required. He walked one mile along the
arrowed highway—which was empty and silent. Pritcher knew that over the
square miles of palace grounds, there was not one guard, not one
soldier, not one armed man.</p>
<p>The Mule had need of no protection.</p>
<p>The Mule was his own best, all-powerful protector.</p>
<p>Pritcher’s footsteps beat softly in his own ears, as the palace
reared its gleaming, incredibly light and incredibly strong metallic
walls before him in the daring, overblown, near-hectic arches that
characterized the architecture of the Late Empire. It brooded strongly
over the empty grounds, over the crowded city on the horizon.</p>
<p>Within the palace was that one man—by himself—on whose inhuman mental
attributes depended the new aristocracy, and the whole structure of the
Union.</p>
<p>The huge, smooth door swung massively open at the general’s approach,
and he entered. He stepped onto the wide, sweeping ramp that moved
upward under him. He rose swiftly in the noiseless elevator. He stood
before the small plain door of the Mule’s own room in the highest
glitter of the palace spires.</p>
<p>It opened—</p>
<p>Bail Channis was young, and Bail Channis was Unconverted. That is, in
plainer language, his emotional makeup had been unadjusted by the Mule.
It remained exactly as it had been formed by the original shape of its
heredity and the subsequent modifications of his environment. And that
satisfied him, too.</p>
<p>At not quite thirty, he was in marvelously good odor in the capital.
He was handsome and quick-witted—therefore successful in society. He was
intelligent and self-possessed—therefore successful with the Mule. And
he was thoroughly pleased at both successes.</p>
<p>And now, for the first time, the Mule had summoned him to personal
audience.</p>
<p>His legs carried him down the long, glittering highway that led
tautly to the sponge-aluminum spires that had been once the residence of
the viceroy of Kalgan, who ruled under the old emperors; and that had
been later the residence of the independent princes of Kalgan, who ruled
in their own name; and that was now the residence of the First Citizen
of the Union, who ruled over an empire of his own.</p>
<p>Channis hummed softly to himself. He did not doubt what this was all
about. The Second Foundation, naturally! That all-embracing bogey, the
mere consideration of which had thrown the Mule back from his policy of
limitless expansion into static caution. The official term was
“consolidation.”</p>
<p>Now there were rumors—you couldn’t stop rumors. The Mule was to begin
the offensive once more. The Mule had discovered the whereabouts of the
Second Foundation, and would attack. The Mule had come to an agreement
with the Second Foundation and divided the Galaxy. The Mule had decided
the Second Foundation did not exist and would take over all the
Galaxy.</p>
<p>No use listing all the varieties one heard in the anterooms. It was
not even the first time such rumors had circulated. But now they seemed
to have more body in them, and all the free, expansive souls who thrived
on war, military adventure, and political chaos and withered in times of
stability and stagnant peace were joyful.</p>
<p>Bail Channis was one of these. He did not fear the mysterious Second
Foundation. For that matter, he did not fear the Mule, and boasted of
it. Some, perhaps, who disapproved of one at once so young and so
well-off, waited darkly for the reckoning with the gay ladies’ man who
employed his wit openly at the expense of the Mule’s physical appearance
and sequestered life. None dared join him and few dared laugh, but when
nothing happened to him, his reputation rose accordingly.</p>
<p>Channis was improvising words to the tune he was humming. Nonsense
words with the recurrent refrain: “Second Foundation threatens the
Nation and all of Creation.”</p>
<p>He was at the palace.</p>
<p>The huge, smooth door swung massively open at his approach, and he
entered. He stepped onto the wide, sweeping ramp that moved upward under
him. He rose swiftly in the noiseless elevator. He stood before the
small plain door of the Mule’s own room in the highest glitter of the
palace spires.</p>
<p>It opened—</p>
<p>The man who had no name other than the Mule, and no title other than
First Citizen looked out through the one-way transparency of the wall to
the light and lofty city on the horizon.</p>
<p>In the darkening twilight, the stars were emerging, and not one but
owed allegiance to him.</p>
<p>He smiled with fleeting bitterness at the thought. The allegiance
they owed was to a personality few had ever seen.</p>
<p>He was not a man to look at, the Mule—not a man to look at without
derision. Not more than one hundred and twenty pounds was stretched out
into his five-foot-eight length. His limbs were bony stalks that jutted
out of his scrawniness in graceless angularity. And his thin face was
nearly drowned out by the prominence of a fleshy beak that thrust three
inches outward.</p>
<p>Only his eyes played false with the general farce that was the Mule.
In their softness—a strange softness for the Galaxy’s greatest
conqueror—sadness was never entirely subdued.</p>
<p>In the city was to be found all the gaiety of a luxurious capital on
a luxurious world. He might have established his capital on the
Foundation, the strongest of his now-conquered enemies, but it was far
out on the very rim of the Galaxy. Kalgan, more centrally located, with
a long tradition as aristocracy’s playground, suited him
better—strategically.</p>
<p>But in its traditional gaiety, enhanced by unheard-of prosperity, he
found no peace.</p>
<p>They feared him and obeyed him and, perhaps, even respected him—from
a goodly distance. But who could look at him without contempt? Only
those he had Converted. And of what value was their artificial loyalty?
It lacked flavor. He might have adopted titles, and enforced ritual and
invented elaborations, but even that would have changed nothing.
Better—or at least, no worse—to be simply the First Citizen—and to hide
himself.</p>
<p>There was a sudden surge of rebellion within him—strong and brutal.
Not a portion of the Galaxy must be denied him. For five years he had
remained silent and buried here on Kalgan because of the eternal, misty,
space-ridden menace of the unseen, unheard, unknown Second Foundation.
He was thirty-two. Not old—but he felt old. His body, whatever its
mutant mental powers, was physically weak.</p>
<p>Every star! Every star he could see—and every star he couldn’t see.
It must all be his!</p>
<p>Revenge on all. On a humanity of which he wasn’t a part. On a Galaxy
in which he didn’t fit.</p>
<p>The cool, overhead warning light flickered. He could follow the
progress of the man who had entered the palace, and simultaneously, as
though his mutant sense had been enhanced and sensitized in the lonely
twilight, he felt the wash of emotional content touch the fibers of his
brain.</p>
<p>He recognized the identity without an effort. It was Pritcher.</p>
<p>Captain Pritcher of the one-time Foundation. The Captain Pritcher who
had been ignored and passed over by the bureaucrats of that decaying
government. The Captain Pritcher whose job as petty spy he had wiped out
and whom he had lifted from its slime. The Captain Pritcher whom he had
made first colonel and then general; whose scope of activity he had made
Galaxywide.</p>
<p>The now-General Pritcher who was, iron rebel though he began,
completely loyal. And yet with all that, not loyal because of benefits
gained, not loyal out of gratitude, not loyal as a fair return—but loyal
only through the artifice of Conversion.</p>
<p>The Mule was conscious of that strong unalterable surface layer of
loyalty and love that colored every swirl and eddy of the emotionality
of Han Pritcher—the layer he had himself implanted five years before.
Far underneath there were the original traces of stubborn individuality,
impatience of rule, idealism—but even he, himself, could scarcely detect
them any longer.</p>
<p>The door behind him opened, and he turned. The transparency of the
wall faded to opacity, and the purple evening light gave way to the
whitely blazing glow of nuclear power.</p>
<p>Han Pritcher took the seat indicated. There was neither bowing, nor
kneeling, nor the use of honorifics in private audiences with the Mule.
The Mule was merely “First Citizen.” He was addressed as “sir.” You sat
in his presence, and you could turn your back on him if it so happened
that you did.</p>
<p>To Han Pritcher this was all evidence of the sure and confident power
of the man. He was warmly satisfied with it.</p>
<p>The Mule said: “Your final report reached me yesterday. I can’t deny
that I find it somewhat depressing, Pritcher.”</p>
<p>The general’s eyebrows closed upon each other: “Yes, I imagine so—but
I don’t see to what other conclusions I could have come. There just
isn’t any Second Foundation, sir.”</p>
<p>And the Mule considered and then slowly shook his head, as he had
done many a time before: “There’s the evidence of Ebling Mis. There is
always the evidence of Ebling Mis.”</p>
<p>It was not a new story. Pritcher said without qualification: “Mis may
have been the greatest psychologist of the Foundation, but he was a baby
compared to Hari Seldon. At the time he was investigating Seldon’s
works, he was under the artificial stimulation of your own brain
control. You may have pushed him too far. He might have been wrong. Sir,
he must have been wrong.”</p>
<p>The Mule sighed, his lugubrious face thrust forward on its thin stalk
of a neck. “If only he had lived another minute. He was on the point of
telling me where the Second Foundation was. He knew, I’m telling you. I
need not have retreated. I need not have waited and waited. So much time
lost. Five years gone for nothing.”</p>
<p>Pritcher could not have been censorious over the weak longing of his
ruler; his controlled mental makeup forbade that. He was disturbed
instead; vaguely uneasy. He said: “But what alternative explanation can
there possibly be, sir? Five times I’ve gone out. You yourself have
plotted the routes. And I’ve left no asteroid unturned. It was three
hundred years ago—that Hari Seldon of the old Empire supposedly
established two Foundations to act as nuclei of a new Empire to replace
the dying old one. One hundred years after Seldon, the First
Foundation—the one we know so well—was known through all the Periphery.
One hundred fifty years after Seldon—at the time of the last battle with
the old Empire—it was known throughout the Galaxy. And now it’s three
hundred years—and where should this mysterious Second be? In no eddy of
the Galactic stream has it been heard of.”</p>
<p>“Ebling Mis said it kept itself secret. Only secrecy can turn its
weakness to strength.”</p>
<p>“Secrecy as deep as this is past possibility without nonexistence as
well.”</p>
<p>The Mule looked up, large eyes sharp and wary. “No. It does exist.” A
bony finger pointed sharply. “There is going to be a slight change in
tactics.”</p>
<p>Pritcher frowned. “You plan to leave yourself? I would scarcely
advise it.”</p>
<p>“No, of course not. You will have to go out once again—one last time.
But with another in joint command.”</p>
<p>There was a silence, and Pritcher’s voice was hard, “Who, sir?”</p>
<p>“There’s a young man here in Kalgan. Bail Channis.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of him, sir.”</p>
<p>“No, I imagine not. But he’s got an agile mind, he’s ambitious—and
he’s not Converted.”</p>
<p>Pritcher’s long jaw trembled for a bare instant, “I fail to see the
advantage in that.”</p>
<p>“There is one, Pritcher. You’re a resourceful and experienced man.
You have given me good service. But you are Converted. Your motivation
is simply an enforced and helpless loyalty to myself. When you lost your
native motivations, you lost something, some subtle drive, that I cannot
possibly replace.”</p>
<p>“I don’t feel that, sir,” said Pritcher, grimly. “I recall myself
quite well as I was in the days when I was an enemy of yours. I feel
none the inferior.”</p>
<p>“Naturally not,” and the Mule’s mouth twitched into a smile. “Your
judgment in this matter is scarcely objective. This Channis, now, is
ambitious—for himself. He is completely trustworthy—out of no loyalty
but to himself. He knows that it is on my coattails that he rides and he
would do anything to increase my power that the ride might be long and
far and that the destination might be glorious. If he goes with you,
there is just that added push behind his seeking—that push for
himself.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Pritcher, still insistent, “why not remove my own
Conversion, if you think that will improve me. I can scarcely be
mistrusted, now.”</p>
<p>“That never, Pritcher. While you are within arm’s reach, or blaster
reach, of myself, you will remain firmly held in Conversion. If I were
to release you this minute, I would be dead the next.”</p>
<p>The general’s nostrils flared. “I am hurt that you should think
so.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to hurt you, but it is impossible for you to realize
what your feelings would be if free to form themselves along the lines
of your natural motivation. The human mind resents control. The ordinary
human hypnotist cannot hypnotize a person against his will for that
reason. I can, because I’m not a hypnotist, and, believe me, Pritcher,
the resentment that you cannot show and do not even know you possess is
something I wouldn’t want to face.”</p>
<p>Pritcher’s head bowed. Futility wrenched him and left him gray and
haggard inside. He said with an effort: “But how can you trust this man?
I mean, completely—as you can trust me in my Conversion.”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose I can’t entirely. That is why you must go with him.
You see, Pritcher,” and the Mule buried himself in the large armchair
against the soft back of which he looked like an angularly animated
toothpick, “if he should stumble on the Second Foundation—if it should
occur to him that an arrangement with them might be more profitable than
with me—You understand?”</p>
<p>A profoundly satisfied light blazed in Pritcher’s eyes. “That is
better, sir.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. But remember, he must have a free rein as far as
possible.”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“And … uh … Pritcher. The young man is handsome, pleasant, and
extremely charming. Don’t let him fool you. He’s a dangerous and
unscrupulous character. Don’t get in his way unless you’re prepared to
meet him properly. That’s all.”</p>
<p>The Mule was alone again. He let the lights die and the wall before
him kicked to transparency again. The sky was purple now, and the city
was a smudge of light on the horizon.</p>
<p>What was it all for? And if he were the master of all there was—what
then? Would it really stop men like Pritcher from being straight and
tall, self-confident, strong? Would Bail Channis lose his looks? Would
he himself be other than he was?</p>
<p>He cursed his doubts. What was he really after?</p>
<p>The cool, overhead warning light flickered. He could follow the
progress of the man who had entered the palace and, almost against his
will, he felt the soft wash of emotional content touch the fibers of his
brain.</p>
<p>He recognized the identity without an effort. It was Channis. Here
the Mule saw no uniformity, but the primitive diversity of a strong
mind, untouched and unmolded except by the manifold disorganizations of
the universe. It writhed in floods and waves. There was caution on the
surface, a thin, smoothing effect, but with touches of cynical ribaldry
in the hidden eddies of it. And underneath there was the strong flow of
self-interest and self-love, with a gush of cruel humor here and there,
and a deep, still pool of ambition underlying all.</p>
<p>The Mule felt that he could reach out and dam the current, wrench the
pool from its basin and turn it in another course, dry up one flow and
begin another. But what of it? If he could bend Channis’ curly head in
the profoundest adoration, would that change his own grotesquerie that
made him shun the day and love the night, that made him a recluse inside
an empire that was unconditionally his?</p>
<p>The door behind him opened, and he turned. The transparency of the
wall faded to opacity, and the darkness gave way to the whitely blazing
artifice of nuclear power.</p>
<p>Bail Channis sat down lightly and said: “This is a
not-quite-unexpected honor, sir.”</p>
<p>The Mule rubbed his proboscis with all four fingers at once and
sounded a bit irritable in his response. “Why so, young man?”</p>
<p>“A hunch, I suppose. Unless I want to admit that I’ve been listening
to rumors.”</p>
<p>“Rumors? Which one of the several dozen varieties are you referring
to?”</p>
<p>“Those that say a renewal of the Galactic Offensive is being planned.
It is a hope with me that such is true and that I might play an
appropriate part.”</p>
<p>“Then you think there is a Second Foundation?”</p>
<p>“Why not? It would make things so much more interesting.”</p>
<p>“And you find interest in it as well?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. In the very mystery of it! What better subject could you
find for conjecture? The newspaper supplements are full of nothing else
lately—which is probably significant. The Cosmos had one of its feature
writers compose a weirdie about a world consisting of beings of pure
mind—the Second Foundation, you see—who had developed mental force to
energies large enough to compete with any known to physical science.
Spaceships could be blasted light-years away, planets could be turned
out of their orbits—”</p>
<p>“Interesting. Yes. But do you have any notions on the subject? Do you
subscribe to this mind-power notion?”</p>
<p>“Galaxy, no! Do you think creatures like that would stay on their own
planet? No, sir. I think the Second Foundation remains hidden because it
is weaker than we think.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I can explain myself very easily. How would you like
to head an expedition to locate the Second Foundation?”</p>
<p>For a moment Channis seemed caught up by the sudden rush of events at
just a little greater speed than he was prepared for. His tongue had
apparently skidded to a halt in a lengthening silence.</p>
<p>The Mule said dryly: “Well?”</p>
<p>Channis corrugated his forehead. “Certainly. But where am I to go?
Have you any information available?”</p>
<p>“General Pritcher will be with you—”</p>
<p>“Then I’m not to head it?”</p>
<p>“Judge for yourself when I’m done. Listen, you’re not of the
Foundation. You’re a native of Kalgan, aren’t you? Yes. Well, then, your
knowledge of the Seldon plan may be vague. When the first Galactic
Empire was falling, Hari Seldon and a group of psychohistorians,
analyzing the future course of history by mathematical tools no longer
available in these degenerate times, set up two Foundations, one at each
end of the Galaxy, in such a way that the economic and sociological
forces that were slowly evolving would make them serve as foci for the
Second Empire. Hari Seldon planned on a thousand years to accomplish
that—and it would have taken thirty thousand without the Foundations.
But he couldn’t count on me. I am a mutant and I am unpredictable by
psychohistory, which can only deal with the average reactions of
numbers. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly, sir. But how does that involve me?”</p>
<p>“You’ll understand shortly. I intend to unite the Galaxy now—and
reach Seldon’s thousand-year goal in three hundred. One Foundation—the
world of physical scientists—is still flourishing, under me. Under the
prosperity and order of the Union, the nuclear weapons they have
developed are capable of dealing with anything in the Galaxy—except
perhaps the Second Foundation. So I must know more about it. General
Pritcher is of the definite opinion that it does not exist at all. I
know otherwise.”</p>
<p>Channis said delicately: “How do you know, sir?”</p>
<p>And the Mule’s words were suddenly liquid indignation: “Because minds
under my control have been interfered with. Delicately! Subtly! But not
so subtly that I couldn’t notice. And these interferences are
increasing, and hitting valuable men at important times. Do you wonder
now that a certain discretion has kept me motionless these years?</p>
<p>“That is your importance. General Pritcher is the best man left me,
so he is no longer safe. Of course, he does not know that. But you are
Unconverted and therefore not instantly detectable as a Mule’s man. You
may fool the Second Foundation longer than one of my own men
would—perhaps just sufficiently longer. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Um-m-m. Yes. But pardon me, sir, if I question you. How are these
men of yours disturbed, so that I might detect change in General
Pritcher, in case any occurs. Are they Unconverted again? Do they become
disloyal?”</p>
<p>“No. I told you it was subtle. It’s more disturbing than that,
because it’s harder to detect and sometimes I have to wait before
acting, uncertain whether a key man is being normally erratic or has
been tampered with. Their loyalty is left intact, but initiative and
ingenuity are rubbed out. I’m left with a perfectly normal person,
apparently, but one completely useless. In the last year, six have been
so treated. Six of my best.” A corner of his mouth lifted. “They’re in
charge of training bases now—and my most earnest wishes go with them
that no emergencies come up for them to decide upon.”</p>
<p>“Suppose, sir … suppose it were not the Second Foundation. What if it
were another, such as yourself—another mutant?”</p>
<p>“The planning is too careful, too long range. A single man would be
in a greater hurry. No, it is a world, and you are to be my weapon
against it.”</p>
<p>Channis’ eyes shone as he said: “I’m delighted at the chance.”</p>
<p>But the Mule caught the sudden emotional upwelling. He said: “Yes,
apparently it occurs to you, that you will perform a unique service,
worthy of a unique reward—perhaps even that of being my successor. Quite
so. But there are unique punishments, too, you know. My emotional
gymnastics are not confined to the creation of loyalty alone.”</p>
<p>And the little smile on his thin lips was grim, as Channis leaped out
of his seat in horror.</p>
<p>For just an instant, just one, flashing instant, Channis had felt the
pang of an overwhelming grief close over him. It had slammed down with a
physical pain that had blackened his mind unbearably, and then lifted.
Now nothing was left but the strong wash of anger.</p>
<p>The Mule said: “Anger won’t help … yes, you’re covering it up now,
aren’t you? But I can see it. So just remember—that sort of business can
be made more intense and kept up. I’ve killed men by emotional control,
and there’s no death crueler.”</p>
<p>He paused: “That’s all!”</p>
<p>The Mule was alone again. He let the lights die and the wall before
him kicked to transparency again. The sky was black, and the rising body
of the Galactic Lens was spreading its bespanglement across the velvet
depths of space.</p>
<p>All that haze of nebula was a mass of stars so numerous that they
melted one into the other and left nothing but a cloud of light.</p>
<p>And all to be his—</p>
<p>And now but one last arrangement to make, and he could sleep.</p>
<p>FIRST INTERLUDE</p>
<p>The Executive Council of the Second Foundation was in session. To us
they are merely voices. Neither the exact scene of the meeting nor the
identity of those present are essential at this point.</p>
<p>Nor, strictly speaking, can we even consider an exact reproduction of
any part of the session—unless we wish to sacrifice completely even the
minimum comprehensibility we have a right to expect.</p>
<p>We deal here with psychologists—and not merely psychologists. Let us
say, rather, scientists with a psychological orientation. That is, men
whose fundamental conception of scientific philosophy is pointed in an
entirely different direction from all of the orientations we know. The
“psychology” of scientists brought up among the axioms deduced from the
observational habits of physical science has only the vaguest
relationship to PSYCHOLOGY.</p>
<p>Which is about as far as I can go in explaining color to a blind
man—with myself as blind as the audience.</p>
<p>The point being made is that the minds assembled understood
thoroughly the workings of each other, not only by general theory but by
the specific application over a long period of these theories to
particular individuals. Speech as known to us was unnecessary. A
fragment of a sentence amounted almost to long-winded redundancy. A
gesture, a grunt, the curve of a facial line—even a significantly timed
pause yielded informational juice.</p>
<p>The liberty is taken, therefore, of freely translating a small
portion of the conference into the extremely specific word-combinations
necessary to minds oriented from childhood to a physical science
philosophy, even at the risk of losing the more delicate nuances.</p>
<p>There was one “voice” predominant, and that belonged to the
individual known simply as the First Speaker.</p>
<p>He said: “It is apparently quite definite now as to what stopped the
Mule in his first mad rush. I can’t say that the matter reflects credit
upon … well, upon our organization of the situation. Apparently, he
almost located us, by means of the artificially heightened brain-energy
of what they call a ‘psychologist’ on the First Foundation. This
psychologist was killed just before he could communicate his discovery
to the Mule. The events leading to that killing were completely
fortuitous for all calculations below Phase Three. Suppose you take
over.”</p>
<p>It was the Fifth Speaker who was indicated by an inflection of the
voice. He said, in grim nuances: “It is certain that the situation was
mishandled. We are, of course, highly vulnerable under mass attack,
particularly an attack led by such a mental phenomenon as the Mule.
Shortly after he first achieved Galactic eminence with the conquest of
the First Foundation, half a year after to be exact, he was on Trantor.
Within another half year he would have been here and the odds would have
been stupendously against us—96.3 plus or minus 0.05% to be exact. We
have spent considerable time analyzing the forces that stopped him. We
know, of course, what was driving him on so in the first place. The
internal ramifications of his physical deformity and mental uniqueness
are obvious to all of us. However, it was only through penetration to
Phase Three that we could determine—after the fact—the possibility of
his anomalous action in the presence of another human being who had an
honest affection for him.</p>
<p>“And since such an anomalous action would depend upon the presence of
such another human being at the appropriate time, to that extent the
whole affair was fortuitous. Our agents are certain that it was a woman
that killed the Mule’s psychologist—a woman for whom the Mule felt trust
out of sentiment, and whom he, therefore, did not control
mentally—simply because she liked him.</p>
<p>“Since that event—and for those who want the details, a mathematical
treatment of the subject has been drawn up for the Central Library—which
warned us, we have held the Mule off by unorthodox methods with which we
daily risk Seldon’s entire scheme of history. That is all.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker paused an instant to allow the individuals
assembled to absorb the full implications. He said: “The situation is
then highly unstable. With Seldon’s original scheme bent to the fracture
point—and I must emphasize that we have blundered badly in this whole
matter, in our horrible lack of foresight—we are faced with an
irreversible breakdown of the Plan. Time is passing us by. I think there
is only one solution left us—and even that is risky.</p>
<p>“We must allow the Mule to find us—in a sense.”</p>
<p>Another pause, in which he gathered the reactions, then: “I repeat—in
a sense!”</p>
