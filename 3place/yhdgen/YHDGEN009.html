<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>For a long while, they sat silently as the taxi whined through the
hundreds of miles of worm-like tunnels toward the University. And then
Gaal stirred. He said:</p>
<p>“Was what you told the Commissioner true? Would your execution have
really hastened the Fall?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I never lie about psychohistoric findings. Nor would it
have availed me in this case. Chen knew I spoke the truth. He is a very
clever politician and politicians by the very nature of their work must
have an instinctive feeling for the truths of psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“Then need you have accepted exile,” Gaal wondered, but Seldon did
not answer.</p>
<p>When they burst out upon the University grounds, Gaal’s muscles took
action of their own; or rather, inaction. He had to be carried, almost,
out of the taxi.</p>
<p>All the University was a blaze of light. Gaal had almost forgotten
that a sun could exist.</p>
<p>The University structures lacked the hard steel-gray of the rest of
Trantor. They were silvery, rather. The metallic luster was almost ivory
in color.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Soldiers, it seems.”</p>
<p>“What?” Gaal brought his eyes to the prosaic ground and found a
sentinel ahead of them.</p>
<p>They stopped before him, and a soft-spoken captain materialized from
a nearby doorway.</p>
<p>He said, “Dr. Seldon?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“We have been waiting for you. You and your men will be under martial
law henceforth. I have been instructed to inform you that six months
will be allowed you for preparations to leave for Terminus.”</p>
<p>“Six months!” began Gaal, but Seldon’s fingers were upon his elbow
with gentle pressure.</p>
<p>“These are my instructions,” repeated the captain.</p>
<p>He was gone, and Gaal turned to Seldon, “Why, what can be done in six
months? This is but slower murder.”</p>
<p>“Quietly. Quietly. Let us reach my office.”</p>
<p>It was not a large office, but it was quite spy-proof and quite
undetectably so. Spy-beams trained upon it received neither a suspicious
silence nor an even more suspicious static. They received, rather, a
conversation constructed at random out of a vast stock of innocuous
phrases in various tones and voices.</p>
<p>“Now,” said Seldon, at his ease, “six months will be enough.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how.”</p>
<p>“Because, my boy, in a plan such as ours, the actions of others are
bent to our needs. Have I not said to you already that Chen’s
temperamental makeup has been subjected to greater scrutiny than that of
any other single man in history? The trial was not allowed to begin
until the time and circumstances were right for the ending of our own
choosing.”</p>
<p>“But could you have arranged—”</p>
<p>“—to be exiled to Terminus? Why not?” He put his fingers on a certain
spot on his desk and a small section of the wall behind him slid aside.
Only his own fingers could have done so, since only his particular
print-pattern could have activated the scanner beneath.</p>
<p>“You will find several microfilms inside,” said Seldon. “Take the one
marked with the letter T.”</p>
<p>Gaal did so and waited while Seldon fixed it within the projector and
handed the young man a pair of eyepieces. Gaal adjusted them, and
watched the film unroll before his eyes.</p>
<p>He said, “But then—”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “What surprises you?”</p>
<p>“Have you been preparing to leave for two years?”</p>
<p>“Two and a half. Of course, we could not be certain that it would be
Terminus he would choose, but we hoped it might be and we acted upon
that assumption—”</p>
<p>“But why, Dr. Seldon? If you arranged the exile, why? Could not
events be far better controlled here on Trantor?”</p>
<p>“Why, there are some reasons. Working on Terminus, we will have
Imperial support without ever rousing fears that we would endanger
Imperial safety.”</p>
<p>Gaal said, “But you aroused those fears only to force exile. I still
do not understand.”</p>
<p>“Twenty thousand families would not travel to the end of the Galaxy
of their own will perhaps.”</p>
<p>“But why should they be forced there?” Gaal paused. “May I not
know?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Not yet. It is enough for the moment that you know that
a scientific refuge will be established on Terminus. And another will be
established at the other end of the Galaxy, let us say,” and he smiled,
“at Star’s End. And as for the rest, I will die soon, and you will see
more than I. —No, no. Spare me your shock and good wishes. My doctors
tell me that I cannot live longer than a year or two. But then, I have
accomplished in life what I have intended and under what circumstances
may one better die.”</p>
<p>“And after you die, sir?”</p>
<p>“Why, there will be successors—perhaps even yourself. And these
successors will be able to apply the final touch in the scheme and
instigate the revolt on Anacreon at the right time and in the right
manner. Thereafter, events may roll unheeded.”</p>
<p>“I do not understand.”</p>
<p>“You will.” Seldon’s lined face grew peaceful and tired, both at
once. “Most will leave for Terminus, but some will stay. It will be easy
to arrange. —But as for me,” and he concluded in a whisper, so that Gaal
could scarcely hear him, “I am finished.”</p>
<p>TERMINUS— … Its location (see map) was an odd one for the role it was
called upon to play in Galactic history, and yet as many writers have
never tired of pointing out, an inevitable one. Located on the very
fringe of the Galactic spiral, an only planet of an isolated sun, poor
in resources and negligible in economic value, it was never settled in
the five centuries after its discovery, until the landing of the
Encyclopedists.…</p>
<p>It was inevitable that as a new generation grew, Terminus would
become something more than an appendage of the psychohistorians of
Trantor. With the Anacreonian revolt and the rise to power of Salvor
Hardin, first of the great line of.…</p>
