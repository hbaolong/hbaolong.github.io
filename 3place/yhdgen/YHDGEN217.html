<h4 id="section">79</h4>
<p>Raych had not entirely left the neighborhood after he had walked them
back to their apartment house.</p>
<p>He had eaten well while waiting for the interview with Davan to be
done and later had slept a bit after finding a bathroom that more or
less worked. He really had no place to go now that all that was done. He
had a home of sorts and a mother who was not likely to be perturbed if
he stayed away for a while. She never was.</p>
<p>He did not know who his father was and wondered sometimes if he
really had one. He had been told he had to have one and the reasons for
that had been explained to him crudely enough. Sometimes he wondered if
he ought to believe so peculiar a story, but he did find the details
titillating.</p>
<p>He thought of that in connection with the lady. She was an old lady,
of course, but she was pretty and she could fight like a man—better than
a man. It filled him with vague notions.</p>
<p>And she had offered to let him take a bath. He could swim in the
Billibotton pool sometimes when he had some credits he didn’t need for
anything else or when he could sneak in. Those were the only times he
got wet all over, but it was chilly and he had to wait to get dry.</p>
<p>Taking a bath was different. There would be hot water, soap, towels,
and warm air. He wasn’t sure what it would feel like, except that it
would be nice if she was there.</p>
<p>He was walkway-wise enough to know of places where he could park
himself in an alley off a walkway that would be near a bathroom and
still be near enough to where she was, yet where he probably wouldn’t be
found and made to run away.</p>
<p>He spent the night thinking strange thoughts. What if he did learn to
read and write? Could he do something with that? He wasn’t sure what,
but maybe she could tell him. He had vague ideas of being paid money to
do things he didn’t know how to do now, but he didn’t know what those
things might be. He would have to be told, but how do you get told?</p>
<p>If he stayed with the man and the lady, they might help. But why
should they want him to stay with them?</p>
<p>He drowsed off, coming to later, not because the light was
brightening, but because his sharp ears caught the heightening and
deepening of sounds from the walkway as the activities of the day
began.</p>
<p>He had learned to identify almost every variety of sound, because in
the underground maze of Billibotton, if you wanted to survive with even
a minimum of comfort, you had to be aware of things before you saw them.
And there was something about the sound of a ground-car motor that he
now heard that signaled danger to him. It had an official sound, a
hostile sound—</p>
<p>He shook himself awake and stole quietly toward the walkway. He
scarcely needed to see the Spaceship-and-Sun on the ground-car. Its
lines were enough. He knew they had to be coming for the man and the
lady because they had seen Davan. He did not pause to question his
thoughts or to analyze them. He was off on a run, beating his way
through the gathering life of the day.</p>
<p>He was back in less than fifteen minutes. The ground-car was still
there and there were curious and cautious onlookers gazing at it from
all sides and from a respectful distance. There would soon be more. He
pounded his way up the stairs, trying to remember which door he should
bang on. No time for the elevator.</p>
<p>He found the door—at least he thought he did—and he banged, shouting
in a squeak, “Lady! Lady!”</p>
<p>He was too excited to remember her name, but he remembered part of
the man’s. “Hari!” he shouted. “Let me in.”</p>
<p>The door opened and he rushed in—tried to rush in. The rough hand of
an officer seized his arm. “Hold it, kid. Where do you think you’re
going?”</p>
<p>“Leggo! I ain’t done nothin’.” He looked about. “Hey, lady, what’re
they doin’?”</p>
<p>“Arresting us,” said Dors grimly.</p>
<p>“What for?” said Raych, panting and struggling. “Hey, leggo, you
Sunbadger. Don’t go with him, lady. You don’t have to go with him.”</p>
<p>“You get out,” said Russ, shaking the boy vehemently.</p>
<p>“No, I ain’t. You ain’t either, Sunbadger. My whole gang is coming.
You ain’t gettin’ out, less’n you let these guys go.”</p>
<p>“What whole gang?” said Russ, frowning.</p>
<p>“They’re right outside now. Prob’ly takin’ your ground-car apart. And
they’ll take you apart.”</p>
<p>Russ turned toward his partner, “Call headquarters. Have them send
out a couple of trucks with Macros.”</p>
<p>“No!” shrieked Raych, breaking loose and rushing at Astinwald. “Don’t
call!”</p>
<p>Russ leveled his neuronic whip and fired.</p>
<p>Raych shrieked, grasped at his right shoulder, and fell down,
wriggling madly.</p>
<p>Russ had not yet turned back to Seldon, when the latter, seizing him
by the wrist, pushed the neuronic whip up in the air and then around and
behind, while stamping on his foot to keep him relatively motionless.
Hari could feel the shoulder dislocate, even while Russ emitted a
hoarse, agonized yell.</p>
<p>Astinwald raised his blaster quickly, but Dors’s left arm was around
his shoulder and the knife in her right hand was at his throat.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!” she said. “Move a millimeter, any part of you, and I
cut you through your neck to the spine. —Drop the blaster. Drop it! And
the neuronic whip.”</p>
<p>Seldon picked up Raych, still moaning, and held him tightly. He
turned to Tisalver and said, “There are people out there. Angry people.
I’ll have them in here and they’ll break up everything you’ve got.
They’ll smash the walls. If you don’t want that to happen, pick up those
weapons and throw them into the next room. Take the weapons from the
security officer on the floor and do the same. Quickly! Get your wife to
help. She’ll think twice next time before sending in complaints against
innocent people. —Dors, this one on the floor won’t do anything for a
while. Put the other one out of action, but don’t kill him.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Dors. Reversing her knife, she struck him hard on the
skull with the haft. He went to his knees.</p>
<p>She made a face. “I hate doing that.”</p>
<p>“They fired at Raych,” said Seldon, trying to mask his own sick
feeling at what had happened.</p>
<p>They left the apartment hurriedly and, once out on the walkway, found
it choked with people, almost all men, who raised a shout when they saw
them emerge. They pushed in close and the smell of poorly washed
humanity was overpowering.</p>
<p>Someone shouted, “Where are the Sunbadgers?”</p>
<p>“Inside,” called out Dors piercingly. “Leave them alone. They’ll be
helpless for a while, but they’ll get reinforcements, so get out of here
fast.”</p>
<p>“What about you?” came from a dozen throats.</p>
<p>“We’re getting out too. We won’t be back.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of them,” shrilled Raych, struggling out of Seldon’s
arms and standing on his feet. He was rubbing his right shoulder madly.
“I can walk. Lemme past.”</p>
<p>The crowd opened for him and he said, “Mister, lady, come with me.
—Fast!”</p>
<p>They were accompanied down the walkway by several dozen men and then
Raych suddenly gestured at an opening and muttered, “In here, folks.
I’ll take ya to a place no one will ever find ya. Even Davan prob’ly
don’t know it. Only thing is, we got to go through the sewer levels. No
one will see us there, but it’s sort of stinky … know what I mean?”</p>
<p>“I imagine we’ll survive,” muttered Seldon.</p>
<p>And down they went along a narrow spiraling ramp and up rose the
mephitic odors to greet them.</p>
