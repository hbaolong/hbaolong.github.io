<h4 id="section">24</h4>
<p>CONVERT</p>
<p>The thin life of Trantor trickled to nothing when they entered among
the wide-spaced buildings of the University Grounds. There was a solemn
and lonely silence over it.</p>
<p>The strangers of the Foundation knew nothing of the swirling days and
nights of the bloody Sack that had left the University untouched. They
knew nothing of the time after the collapse of the Imperial power, when
the students, with their borrowed weapons, and their pale-faced
inexperienced bravery, formed a protective volunteer army to protect the
central shrine of the science of the Galaxy. They knew nothing of the
Seven Days Fight, and the armistice that kept the University free, when
even the Imperial palace clanged with the boots of Gilmer and his
soldiers, during the short interval of their rule.</p>
<p>Those of the Foundation, approaching for the first time, realized
only that in a world of transition from a gutted old to a strenuous new
this area was a quiet, graceful museum piece of ancient greatness.</p>
<p>They were intruders in a sense. The brooding emptiness rejected them.
The academic atmosphere seemed still to live and to stir angrily at the
disturbance.</p>
<p>The library was a deceptively small building which broadened out
vastly underground into a mammoth volume of silence and reverie. Ebling
Mis paused before the elaborate murals of the reception room.</p>
<p>He whispered—one had to whisper here: “I think we passed the catalog
rooms back a way. I’ll stop there.”</p>
<p>His forehead was flushed, his hand trembling, “I mustn’t be
disturbed, Toran. Will you bring my meals down to me?”</p>
<p>“Anything you say. We’ll do all we can to help. Do you want us to
work under you—”</p>
<p>“No, I must be alone—”</p>
<p>“You think you will get what you want.”</p>
<p>And Ebling Mis replied with a soft certainty, “I know I will!”</p>
<p>Toran and Bayta came closer to “setting up housekeeping” in normal
fashion than at any time in their year of married life. It was a strange
sort of “housekeeping.” They lived in the middle of grandeur with an
inappropriate simplicity. Their food was drawn largely from Lee Senter’s
farm and was paid for in the little nuclear gadgets that may be found on
any Trader’s ship.</p>
<p>Magnifico taught himself how to use the projectors in the library
reading room, and sat over adventure novels and romances to the point
where he was almost as forgetful of meals and sleep as was Ebling
Mis.</p>
<p>Ebling himself was completely buried. He had insisted on a hammock
being slung up for him in the Psychology Reference Room. His face grew
thin and white. His vigor of speech was lost and his favorite curses had
died a mild death. There were times when the recognition of either Toran
or Bayta seemed a struggle.</p>
<p>He was more himself with Magnifico, who brought him his meals and
often sat watching him for hours at a time, with a queer, fascinated
absorption, as the aging psychologist transcribed endless equations,
cross-referred to endless book-films, scurried endlessly about in a wild
mental effort toward an end he alone saw.</p>
<p>Toran came upon her in the darkened room, and said sharply,
“Bayta!”</p>
<p>Bayta started guiltily. “Yes? You want me, Torie?”</p>
<p>“Sure I want you. What in Space are you sitting there for? You’ve
been acting all wrong since we got to Trantor. What’s the matter with
you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Torie, stop,” she said, wearily.</p>
<p>And “Oh, Torie, stop!” he mimicked impatiently. Then, with sudden
softness, “Won’t you tell me what’s wrong, Bay? Something’s bothering
you.”</p>
<p>“No! Nothing is, Torie. If you keep on just nagging and nagging,
you’ll have me mad. I’m just—thinking.”</p>
<p>“Thinking about what?”</p>
<p>“About nothing. Well, about the Mule, and Haven, and the Foundation,
and everything. About Ebling Mis and whether he’ll find anything about
the Second Foundation, and whether it will help us when he does find
it—and a million other things. Are you satisfied?” Her voice was
agitated.</p>
<p>“If you’re just brooding, do you mind stopping? It isn’t pleasant and
it doesn’t help the situation.”</p>
<p>Bayta got to her feet and smiled weakly. “All right. I’m happy. See,
I’m smiling and jolly.”</p>
<p>Magnifico’s voice was an agitated cry outside. “My lady—”</p>
<p>“What is it? Come—”</p>
<p>Bayta’s voice choked off sharply when the opening door framed the
large, hard-faced—</p>
<p>“Pritcher,” cried Toran.</p>
<p>Bayta gasped, “Captain! How did you find us?”</p>
<p>Han Pritcher stepped inside. His voice was clear and level, and
utterly dead of feeling, “My rank is colonel now—under the Mule.”</p>
<p>“Under the … Mule!” Toran’s voice trailed off. They formed a tableau
there, the three.</p>
<p>Magnifico stared wildly and shrank behind Toran. Nobody stopped to
notice him.</p>
<p>Bayta said, her hands trembling in each other’s tight grasp, “You are
arresting us? You have really gone over to them?”</p>
<p>The colonel replied quickly, “I have not come to arrest you. My
instructions make no mention of you. With regard to you, I am free, and
I choose to exercise our old friendship, if you will let me.”</p>
<p>Toran’s face was a twisted suppression of fury, “How did you find us?
You were in the Filian ship, then? You followed us?”</p>
<p>The wooden lack of expression on Pritcher’s face might have flickered
in embarrassment. “I was on the Filian ship! I met you in the first
place … well … by chance.”</p>
<p>“It is a chance that is mathematically impossible.”</p>
<p>“No. Simply rather improbable, so my statement will have to stand. In
any case, you admitted to the Filians—there is, of course, no such
nation as Filia actually—that you were heading for the Trantor sector,
and since the Mule already had his contacts upon Neotrantor, it was easy
to have you detained there. Unfortunately, you got away before I
arrived, but not long before. I had time to have the farms on Trantor
ordered to report your arrival. It was done and I am here. May I sit
down? I come in friendliness, believe me.”</p>
<p>He sat. Toran bent his head and thought futilely. With a numbed lack
of emotion, Bayta prepared tea.</p>
<p>Toran looked up harshly. “Well, what are you waiting for—colonel?
What’s your friendship? If it’s not arrest, what is it then? Protective
custody? Call in your men and give your orders.”</p>
<p>Patiently, Pritcher shook his head. “No, Toran. I come of my own will
to speak to you, to persuade you of the uselessness of what you are
doing. If I fail I shall leave. That is all.”</p>
<p>“That is all? Well, then, peddle your propaganda, give us your
speech, and leave. I don’t want any tea, Bayta.”</p>
<p>Pritcher accepted a cup with a grave word of thanks. He looked at
Toran with a clear strength as he sipped lightly. Then he said, “The
Mule is a mutant. He cannot be beaten in the very nature of the
mutation—”</p>
<p>“Why? What is the mutation?” asked Toran, with sour humor. “I suppose
you’ll tell us now, eh?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will. Your knowledge won’t hurt him. You see—he is capable of
adjusting the emotional balance of human beings. It sounds like a little
trick, but it’s quite unbeatable.”</p>
<p>Bayta broke in, “The emotional balance?” She frowned, “Won’t you
explain that? I don’t quite understand.”</p>
<p>“I mean that it is an easy matter for him to instill into a capable
general, say, the emotion of utter loyalty to the Mule and complete
belief in the Mule’s victory. His generals are emotionally controlled.
They cannot betray him; they cannot weaken—and the control is permanent.
His most capable enemies become his most faithful subordinates. The
warlord of Kalgan surrenders his planet and becomes his viceroy for the
Foundation.”</p>
<p>“And you,” added Bayta, bitterly, “betray your cause and become the
Mule’s envoy to Trantor. I see!”</p>
<p>“I haven’t finished. The Mule’s gift works in reverse even more
effectively. Despair is an emotion! At the crucial moment, key men on
the Foundation—key men on Haven—despaired. Their worlds fell without too
much struggle.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say,” demanded Bayta, tensely, “that the feeling I
had in the Time Vault was the Mule juggling my emotional control?”</p>
<p>“Mine, too. Everyone’s. How was it on Haven towards the end?”</p>
<p>Bayta turned away.</p>
<p>Colonel Pritcher continued earnestly, “As it works for worlds, so it
works for individuals. Can you fight a force which can make you
surrender willingly when it so desires; can make you a faithful servant
when it so desires?”</p>
<p>Toran said slowly, “How do I know this is the truth?”</p>
<p>“Can you explain the fall of the Foundation and of Haven otherwise?
Can you explain—my conversion otherwise? Think, man! What have you—or
I—or the whole Galaxy accomplished against the Mule in all this time?
What one little thing?”</p>
<p>Toran felt the challenge, “By the Galaxy, I can!” With a sudden touch
of fierce satisfaction, he shouted, “Your wonderful Mule had contacts
with Neotrantor that you say were to have detained us, eh? Those
contacts are dead or worse. We killed the crown prince and left the
other a whimpering idiot. The Mule did not stop us there, and that much
has been undone.”</p>
<p>“Why, no, not at all. Those weren’t our men. The crown prince was a
wine-soaked mediocrity. The other man, Commason, is phenomenally stupid.
He was a power on his world but that didn’t prevent him from being
vicious, evil, and completely incompetent. We had nothing really to do
with them. They were, in a sense, merely feints—”</p>
<p>“It was they who detained us, or tried.”</p>
<p>“Again, no. Commason had a personal slave—a man called Inchney.
Detention was his policy. He is old, but will serve our temporary
purpose. You would not have killed him, you see.”</p>
<p>Bayta whirled on him. She had not touched her own tea. “But, by your
very statement, your own emotions have been tampered with. You’ve got
faith and belief in the Mule, an unnatural, a diseased faith in the
Mule. Of what value are your opinions? You’ve lost all power of
objective thought.”</p>
<p>“You are wrong.” Slowly, the colonel shook his head. “Only my
emotions are fixed. My reason is as it always was. It may be influenced
in a certain direction by my conditioned emotions, but it is not forced.
And there are some things I can see more clearly now that I am freed of
my earlier emotional trend.</p>
<p>“I can see that the Mule’s program is an intelligent and worthy one.
In the time since I have been—converted, I have followed his career from
its start seven years ago. With his mutant mental power, he began by
winning over a condottiere and his band. With that—and his power—he won
a planet. With that—and his power—he extended his grip until he could
tackle the warlord of Kalgan. Each step followed the other logically.
With Kalgan in his pocket, he had a first-class fleet, and with that—and
his power—he could attack the Foundation.</p>
<p>“The Foundation is the key. It is the greatest area of industrial
concentration in the Galaxy, and now that the nuclear techniques of the
Foundation are in his hands, he is the actual master of the Galaxy. With
those techniques—and his power—he can force the remnants of the Empire
to acknowledge his rule, and eventually—with the death of the old
emperor, who is mad and not long for this world—to crown him emperor. He
will then have the name as well as the fact. With that—and his
power—where is the world in the Galaxy that can oppose him?</p>
<p>“In these last seven years, he has established a new Empire. In seven
years, in other words, he will have accomplished what all Seldon’s
psychohistory could not have done in less than an additional seven
hundred. The Galaxy will have peace and order at last.</p>
<p>“And you could not stop it—any more than you could stop a planet’s
rush with your shoulders.”</p>
<p>A long silence followed Pritcher’s speech. What remained of his tea
had grown cold. He emptied his cup, filled it again, and drained it
slowly. Toran bit viciously at a thumbnail. Bayta’s face was cold, and
distant, and white.</p>
<p>Then Bayta said in a thin voice, “We are not convinced. If the Mule
wishes us to be, let him come here and condition us himself. You fought
him until the last moment of your conversion, I imagine, didn’t
you?”</p>
<p>“I did,” said Colonel Pritcher, solemnly.</p>
<p>“Then allow us the same privilege.”</p>
<p>Colonel Pritcher arose. With a crisp air of finality, he said, “Then
I leave. As I said earlier, my mission at present concerns you in no
way. Therefore, I don’t think it will be necessary to report your
presence here. That is not too great a kindness. If the Mule wishes you
stopped, he no doubt has other men assigned to the job, and you will be
stopped. But, for what it is worth, I shall not contribute more than my
requirement.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Bayta faintly.</p>
<p>“As for Magnifico. Where is he? Come out, Magnifico. I won’t hurt
you—”</p>
<p>“What about him?” demanded Bayta, with sudden animation.</p>
<p>“Nothing. My instructions make no mention of him, either. I have
heard that he is searched for, but the Mule will find him when the time
suits him. I shall say nothing. Will you shake hands?”</p>
<p>Bayta shook her head. Toran glared his frustrated contempt.</p>
<p>There was the slightest lowering of the colonel’s iron shoulders. He
strode to the door, turned, and said:</p>
<p>“One last thing. Don’t think I am not aware of the source of your
stubbornness. It is known that you search for the Second Foundation. The
Mule, in his time, will take his measures. Nothing will help you—But I
knew you in other times; perhaps there is something in my conscience
that urged me to this; at any rate, I tried to help you and remove you
from the final danger before it was too late. Good-bye.”</p>
<p>He saluted sharply—and was gone.</p>
<p>Bayta turned to a silent Toran, and whispered, “They even know about
the Second Foundation.”</p>
<p>In the recesses of the library, Ebling Mis, unaware of all, crouched
under the one spark of light amid the murky spaces and mumbled
triumphantly to himself.</p>
