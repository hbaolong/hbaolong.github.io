<h4 id="section">12</h4>
<p>Raych did his best to size up his new companion, without allowing his
own face to lose its smooth naïveté. The man had sharp greenish eyes and
his right hand clenched almost threateningly into a fist as it rested on
the table.</p>
<p>Raych looked owlishly at the other and waited.</p>
<p>Again, the man said, “I understand you call yourself a
Joranumite.”</p>
<p>Raych did his best to look uneasy. It was not difficult. He said,
“Why do you ask, mister?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t think you’re old enough.”</p>
<p>“I’m old enough. I used to watch Jo-Jo Joranum’s speeches on
holovision.”</p>
<p>“Can you quote them?”</p>
<p>Raych shrugged. “No, but I got the idea.”</p>
<p>“You’re a brave young man to talk openly about being a Joranumite.
Some people don’t like that.”</p>
<p>“I’m told there are lots of Joranumites in Wye.”</p>
<p>“That may be. Is that why you came here?”</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a job. Maybe another Joranumite would help me.”</p>
<p>“There are Joranumites in Dahl, too. Where are you from?”</p>
<p>There was no question that he recognized Raych’s accent. That could
not be disguised.</p>
<p>He said, “I was born in Millimaru, but I lived mostly in Dahl when I
was growing up.”</p>
<p>“Doing what?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much. Going to school some.”</p>
<p>“And why are you a Joranumite?”</p>
<p>Raych let himself heat up a bit. He couldn’t have lived in
downtrodden, discriminated-against Dahl without having obvious reasons
for being a Joranumite. He said, “Because I think there should be more
representative government in the Empire, more participation by the
people, and more equality among the sectors and the worlds. Doesn’t
anyone with brains and a heart think that?”</p>
<p>“And you want to see the Emperorship abolished?”</p>
<p>Raych paused. One could get away with a great deal in the way of
subversive statements, but anything overtly anti-Emperor was stepping
outside the bounds. He said, “I ain’t saying that. I believe in the
Emperor, but ruling a whole Empire is too much for one man.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t one man. There’s a whole Imperial bureaucracy. What do you
think of Hari Seldon, the First Minister?”</p>
<p>“Don’t think nothing about him. Don’t know about him.”</p>
<p>“All you know is that people should be more represented in the
affairs of government. Is that right?”</p>
<p>Raych allowed himself to look confused. “That’s what Jo-Jo Joranum
used to say. I don’t know what you call it. I heard someone once call it
‘democracy,’ but I don’t know what that means.”</p>
<p>“Democracy is something that some worlds have tried. Some still do. I
don’t know that those worlds are run better than other worlds. So you’re
a democrat?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you call it?” Raych let his head sink, as if in deep
thought. “I feel more at home as a Joranumite.”</p>
<p>“Of course, as a Dahlite—”</p>
<p>“I just lived there awhile.”</p>
<p>“—you’re all for people’s equalities and such things. The Dahlites,
being an oppressed group, would naturally think in that fashion.”</p>
<p>“I hear that Wye is pretty strong in Joranumite thinking. They’re not
oppressed.”</p>
<p>“Different reason. The old Wye Mayors always wanted to be Emperors.
Did you know that?”</p>
<p>Raych shook his head.</p>
<p>“Eighteen years ago,” said the man, “Mayor Rashelle nearly carried
through a coup in that direction. So the Wyans are rebels, not so much
Joranumite as anti-Cleon.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “I don’t know nothing about that. I ain’t against the
Emperor.”</p>
<p>“But you are for popular representation, aren’t you? Do you think
that some sort of elected assembly could run the Galactic Empire without
bogging down in politics and partisan bickering? Without paralysis?”</p>
<p>Raych said, “Huh? I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Do you think a great many people could come to some decision quickly
in times of emergency? Or would they just sit around and argue?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but it doesn’t seem right that just a few people
should have all the say over all the worlds.”</p>
<p>“Are you willing to fight for your beliefs? Or do you just like to
talk about them?”</p>
<p>“No one asked me to do any fighting,” said Raych.</p>
<p>“Suppose someone did. How important do you think your beliefs about
democracy—or Joranumite philosophy—are?”</p>
<p>“I’d fight for them—if I thought it would do any good.”</p>
<p>“There’s a brave lad. So you came to Wye to fight for your
beliefs.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Raych uncomfortably, “I can’t say I did. I came to look
for a job, sir. It ain’t easy to find no jobs these days—and I ain’t got
no credits. A guy’s gotta live.”</p>
<p>“I agree. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>The question shot out without warning, but Raych was ready for it.
“Planchet, sir.”</p>
<p>“First or last name?”</p>
<p>“Only name, as far as I know.”</p>
<p>“You have no credits and, I gather, very little education.”</p>
<p>“Afraid so.”</p>
<p>“And no experience at any specialized job?”</p>
<p>“I ain’t worked much, but I’m willing.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll tell you what, Planchet.” He took a small white
triangle out of his pocket and pressed it in such a way as to produce a
printed message on it. Then he rubbed his thumb across it, freezing it.
“I’ll tell you where to go. You take this with you and it may get you a
job.”</p>
<p>Raych took the card and glanced at it. The signals seemed to
fluoresce, but Raych could not read them. He looked at the other man
warily. “What if they think I stole it?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be stolen. It has my sign on it and now it has your
name.”</p>
<p>“What if they ask me who you are?”</p>
<p>“They won’t. —You say you want a job. There’s your chance. I don’t
guarantee it, but there’s your chance.” He gave him another card. “This
is where to go.” Raych could read this one.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>The man made little dismissing gestures with his hand.</p>
<p>Raych rose and left—and wondered what he was getting into.</p>
