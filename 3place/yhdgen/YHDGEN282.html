<h4 id="section">25</h4>
<p>A blaster, despite its name, does not “blast” in the proper sense of
the term. It vaporizes and blows out an interior and—if anything—causes
an implosion. There is a soft sighing sound, leaving what appears to be
a “blasted” object.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon did not expect to hear that sound. He expected only
death. It was, therefore, with surprise that he heard the distinctive
soft sighing sound and he blinked rapidly as he looked down at himself,
slack-jawed.</p>
<p>He was alive? (He thought it as a question, not a statement.)</p>
<p>Raych was still standing there, his blaster pointing forward, his
eyes glazed. He was absolutely motionless, as though some motive power
had ceased.</p>
<p>Behind him was the crumpled body of Andorin, fallen in a pool of
blood, and standing next to him, blaster in hand, was a gardener. The
hood had slipped away; the gardener was clearly a woman with freshly
clipped hair.</p>
<p>She allowed herself a glance at Seldon and said, “Your son knows me
as Manella Dubanqua. I’m a security officer. Do you want my reference
number, First Minister?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon faintly. Imperial Guard had converged on the scene.
“My son! What’s wrong with my son?”</p>
<p>“Desperance, I think,” said Manella. “That can be washed out
eventually.” She reached forward to take the blaster out of Raych’s
hand. “I’m sorry I didn’t act sooner. I had to wait for an overt move
and, when it came, it almost caught me napping.”</p>
<p>“I had the same trouble. We must take Raych to the Palace
hospital.”</p>
<p>A confused noise suddenly emanated from the Small Palace. It occurred
to Seldon that the Emperor was, indeed, watching the proceedings and, if
so, he must be grandly furious, indeed.</p>
<p>“Take care of my son, Miss Dubanqua,” said Seldon. “I must see the
Emperor.”</p>
<p>He set off at an undignified run through the chaos on the Great Lawns
and dashed into the Small Palace without ceremony. Cleon could scarcely
grow any angrier over that.</p>
<p>And there, with an appalled group watching in stupor—there, on the
semicircular stairway—was the body of His Imperial Majesty, Cleon I,
smashed all but beyond recognition. His rich Imperial robes now served
as a shroud. Cowering against the wall, staring stupidly at the
horrified faces surrounding him, was Mandell Gruber.</p>
<p>Seldon felt he could take no more. He took in the blaster lying at
Gruber’s feet. It had been Andorin’s, he was sure. He asked softly,
“Gruber, what have you done?”</p>
<p>Gruber, staring at him, babbled, “Everyone screaming and yelling. I
thought, Who would know? They would think someone else had killed the
Emperor. But then I couldn’t run.”</p>
<p>“But, Gruber. Why?”</p>
<p>“So I wouldn’t have to be Chief Gardener.” And he collapsed.</p>
<p>Seldon stared in shock at the unconscious Gruber.</p>
<p>Everything had worked out by the narrowest of margins. He himself was
alive. Raych was alive. Andorin was dead and the Joranumite Conspiracy
would now be hunted down to the last person.</p>
<p>The center would have held, just as psychohistory had dictated.</p>
<p>And then one man, for a reason so trivial as to defy analysis, had
killed the Emperor.</p>
<p>And now, thought Seldon in despair, what do we do? What happens
next?</p>
<p>VENABILI, DORS— The life of Hari Seldon is well encrusted with legend
and uncertainty, so that little hope remains of ever obtaining a
biography that can be thoroughly factual. Perhaps the most puzzling
aspect of his life deals with his consort, Dors Venabili. There is no
information whatever concerning Dors Venabili, except for her birth on
the world of Cinna, prior to her arrival at Streeling University to
become a member of the history faculty. Shortly after that, she met
Seldon and remained his consort for twenty-eight years. If anything, her
life is more interlarded with legend than Seldon’s is. There are quite
unbelievable tales of her strength and speed and she was widely spoken
of, or perhaps whispered of, as “The Tiger Woman.” Still more puzzling
than her coming, however, is her going, for after a certain time, we
hear of her no more and there is no indication as to what happened.</p>
<p>Her role as a historian is evidenced by her works on— ENCYCLOPEDIA
GALACTICA</p>
