<p>LEAVING COMPORELLON</p>
<ol start="26" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Luncheon consisted of a heap of soft, crusty balls that came in
different shades and that contained a variety of fillings.</p>
<p>Deniador picked up a small object which unfolded into a pair of thin,
transparent gloves, and put them on. His guests followed suit.</p>
<p>Bliss said, “What is inside these objects, please?”</p>
<p>Deniador said, “The pink ones are filled with spicy chopped fish, a
great Comporellian delicacy. These yellow ones contain a cheese filling
that is very mild. The green ones contain a vegetable mixture. Do eat
them while they are quite warm. Later we will have hot almond pie and
the usual beverages. I might recommend the hot cider. In a cold climate,
we have a tendency to heat our foods, even desserts.”</p>
<p>“You do yourself well,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>“Not really,” said Deniador. “I’m being hospitable to guests. For
myself, I get along on very little. I don’t have much body mass to
support, as you have probably noticed.”</p>
<p>Trevize bit into one of the pink ones and found it very fishy indeed,
with an overlay of spices that was pleasant to the taste but which, he
thought, along with the fish itself, would remain with him for the rest
of the day and, perhaps, into the night.</p>
<p>When he withdrew the object with the bite taken out of it, he found
that the crust had closed in over the contents. There was no squirt, no
leakage, and, for a moment, he wondered at the purpose of the gloves.
There seemed no chance of getting his hands moist and sticky if he
didn’t use them, so he decided it was a matter of hygiene. The gloves
substituted for a washing of the hands if that were inconvenient and
custom, probably, now dictated their use even if the hands were washed.
(Lizalor hadn’t used gloves when he had eaten with her the day before.
—Perhaps that was because she was a mountain woman.)</p>
<p>He said, “Would it be unmannerly to talk business over lunch?”</p>
<p>“By Comporellian standards, Councilman, it would be, but you are my
guests, and we will go by your standards. If you wish to speak
seriously, and do not think—or care—that that might diminish your
pleasure in the food, please do so, and I will join you.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Thank you. Minister Lizalor implied—no, she stated
quite bluntly—that Skeptics were unpopular on this world. Is that
so?”</p>
<p>Deniador’s good humor seemed to intensify. “Certainly. How hurt we’d
be if we weren’t. Comporellon, you see, is a frustrated world. Without
any knowledge of the details, there is the general mythic belief, that
once, many millennia ago, when the inhabited Galaxy was small,
Comporellon was the leading world. We never forget that, and the fact
that in known history we have not been leaders irks us, fills us—the
population in general, that is—with a feeling of injustice.</p>
<p>“Yet what can we do? The government was forced to be a loyal vassal
of the Emperor once, and is a loyal Associate of the Foundation now. And
the more we are made aware of our subordinate position, the stronger the
belief in the great, mysterious days of the past become.</p>
<p>“What, then, can Comporellon do? They could never defy the Empire in
older times and they can’t openly defy the Foundation now. They take
refuge, therefore, in attacking and hating us, since we don’t believe
the legends and laugh at the superstitions.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, we are safe from the grosser effects of persecution.
We control the technology, and we fill the faculties of the
Universities. Some of us, who are particularly outspoken, have
difficulty in teaching classes openly. I have that difficulty, for
instance, though I have my students and hold meetings quietly offcampus.
Nevertheless, if we were really driven out of public life, the
technology would fail and the Universities would lose accreditation with
the Galaxy generally. Presumably, such is the folly of human beings, the
prospects of intellectual suicide might not stop them from indulging
their hatred, but the Foundation supports us. Therefore, we are
constantly scolded and sneered at and denounced—and never touched.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Is it popular opposition that keeps you from telling
us where Earth is? Do you fear that, despite everything, the
anti-Skeptic feeling might turn ugly if you go too far?”</p>
<p>Deniador shook his head. “No. Earth’s location is unknown. I am not
hiding anything from you out of fear—or for any other reason.”</p>
<p>“But look,” said Trevize urgently. “There are a limited number of
planets in this sector of the Galaxy that possess the physical
characteristics associated with habitability, and almost all of them
must be not only inhabitable, but inhabited, and therefore well known to
you. How difficult would it be to explore the sector for a planet that
would be habitable were it not for the fact that it was radioactive?
Besides that, you would look for such a planet with a large satellite in
attendance. Between radioactivity and a large satellite, Earth would be
absolutely unmistakable and could not be missed even with only a casual
search. It might take some time but that would be the only
difficulty.”</p>
<p>Deniador said, “The Skeptic’s view is, of course, that Earth’s
radioactivity and its large satellite are both simply legends. If we
look for them, we look for sparrow-milk and rabbit-feathers.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but that shouldn’t stop Comporellon from at least taking on
the search. If they find a radioactive world of the proper size for
habitability, with a large satellite, what an appearance of credibility
it would lend to Comporellian legendry in general.”</p>
<p>Deniador laughed. “It may be that Comporellon doesn’t search for that
very reason. If we fail, or if we find an Earth obviously different from
the legends, the reverse would take place. Comporellian legendry in
general would be blasted and made into a laughingstock. Comporellon
wouldn’t risk that.”</p>
<p>Trevize paused, then went on, very earnestly, “Besides, even if we
discount those two uniquities—if there is such a word in Galactic—of
radioactivity and a large satellite, there is a third that, by
definition, must exist, without any reference to legends. Earth must
have upon it either a flourishing life of incredible diversity, or the
remnants of one, or, at the very least, the fossil record of such a
one.”</p>
<p>Deniador said, “Councilman, while Comporellon has sent out no
organized search party for Earth, we do have occasion to travel through
space, and we occasionally have reports from ships that have strayed
from their intended routes for one reason or another. Jumps are not
always perfect, as perhaps you know. Nevertheless, there have been no
reports of any planets with properties resembling those of the legendary
Earth, or any planet that is bursting with life. Nor is any ship likely
to land on what seems an uninhabited planet in order that the crew might
go fossil-hunting. If, then, in thousands of years nothing of the sort
has been reported, I am perfectly willing to believe that locating Earth
is impossible, because Earth is not there to be located.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, in frustration, “But Earth must be somewhere. Somewhere
there is a planet on which humanity and all the familiar forms of life
associated with humanity evolved. If Earth is not in this section of the
Galaxy, it must be elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Deniador cold-bloodedly, “but in all this time, it
hasn’t turned up anywhere.”</p>
<p>“People haven’t really looked for it.”</p>
<p>“Well, apparently you are. I wish you luck, but I would never bet on
your success.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Have there been attempts to determine the possible
position of Earth by indirect means, by some means other than a direct
search?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said two voices at once. Deniador, who was the owner of one of
the voices, said to Pelorat, “Are you thinking of Yariff’s project?”</p>
<p>“I am,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>“Then would you explain it to the Councilman? I think he would more
readily believe you than me.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “You see, Golan, in the last days of the Empire, there
was a time when the Search for Origins, as they called it, was a popular
pastime, perhaps to get away from the unpleasantness of the surrounding
reality. The Empire was in a process of disintegration at that time, you
know.</p>
<p>“It occurred to a Livian historian, Humbal Yariff, that whatever the
planet of origin, it would have settled worlds near itself sooner than
it would settle planets farther away. In general, the farther a world
from the point of origin the later it would have been settled.</p>
<p>“Suppose, then, one recorded the date of settlement of all habitable
planets in the Galaxy, and made networks of all that were a given number
of millennia old. There could be a network drawn through all planets ten
thousand years old; another through those twelve thousand years old,
still another through those fifteen thousand years old. Each network
would, in theory, be roughly spherical and they should be roughly
concentric. The older networks would form spheres smaller in radius than
the younger ones, and if one worked out all the centers they should fall
within a comparatively small volume of space that would include the
planet of origin—Earth.”</p>
<p>Pelorat’s face was very earnest as he kept drawing spherical surfaces
with his cupped hands. “Do you see my point, Golan?”</p>
<p>Trevize nodded. “Yes. But I take it that it didn’t work.”</p>
<p>“Theoretically, it should have, old fellow. One trouble was that
times of origin were totally inaccurate. Every world exaggerated its own
age to one degree or another and there was no easy way of determining
age independently of legend.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Carbon-14 decay in ancient timber.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, dear,” said Pelorat, “but you would have had to get
co-operation from the worlds in question, and that was never given. No
world wanted its own exaggerated claim of age to be destroyed and the
Empire was then in no position to override local objections in a matter
so unimportant. It had other things on its mind.</p>
<p>“All that Yariff could do was to make use of worlds that were only
two thousand years old at most, and whose founding had been meticulously
recorded under reliable circumstances. There were few of those, and
while they were distributed in roughly spherical symmetry, the center
was relatively close to Trantor, the Imperial capital, because that was
where the colonizing expeditions had originated for those relatively few
worlds.</p>
<p>“That, of course, was another problem. Earth was not the only point
of origin of settlement for other worlds. As time went on, the older
worlds sent out settlement expeditions of their own, and at the time of
the height of Empire, Trantor was a rather copious source of those.
Yariff was, rather unfairly, laughed at and ridiculed and his
professional reputation was destroyed.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I get the story, Janov. —Dr. Deniador, is there then
nothing at all you could give me that represents the faintest
possibility of hope? Is there any other world where it is conceivable
there may be some information concerning Earth?”</p>
<p>Deniador sank into doubtful thought for a while. “We-e-ell,” he said
at last, drawing out the word hesitantly, “as a Skeptic I must tell you
that I’m not sure that Earth exists, or has ever existed. However—” He
fell silent again.</p>
<p>Finally, Bliss said, “I think you’ve thought of something that might
be important, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“Important? I doubt it,” said Deniador faintly. “Perhaps amusing,
however. Earth is not the only planet whose position is a mystery. There
are the worlds of the first group of Settlers; the Spacers, as they are
called in our legends. Some call the planets they inhabited the ‘Spacer
worlds’; others call them the ‘Forbidden Worlds.’ The latter name is now
the usual one.</p>
<p>“In their pride and prime, the legend goes, the Spacers had lifetimes
stretching out for centuries, and refused to allow our own short-lived
ancestors to land on their worlds. After we had defeated them, the
situation was reversed. We scorned to deal with them and left them to
themselves, forbidding our own ships and Traders to deal with them.
Hence those planets became the Forbidden Worlds. We were certain, so the
legend states, that He Who Punishes would destroy them without our
intervention, and, apparently, He did. At least, no Spacer has appeared
in the Galaxy to our knowledge in many millennia.”</p>
<p>“Do you think that the Spacers would know about Earth?” said
Trevize.</p>
<p>“Conceivably, since their worlds were older than any of ours. That
is, if any Spacers exist, which is extremely unlikely.”</p>
<p>“Even if they don’t exist, their worlds do and may contain
records.”</p>
<p>“If you can find the worlds.”</p>
<p>Trevize looked exasperated. “Do you mean to say that the key to
Earth, the location of which is unknown, may be found on Spacer worlds,
the location of which is also unknown?”</p>
<p>Deniador shrugged. “We have had no dealings with them for twenty
thousand years. No thought of them. They, too, like Earth, have receded
into the mists.”</p>
<p>“How many worlds did the Spacers live on?”</p>
<p>“The legends speak of fifty such worlds—a suspiciously round number.
There were probably far fewer.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t know the location of a single one of the fifty?”</p>
<p>“Well, now, I wonder—”</p>
<p>“What do you wonder?”</p>
<p>Deniador said, “Since primeval history is my hobby, as it is
Dr. Pelorat’s, I have occasionally explored old documents in search of
anything that might refer to early time; something more than legends.
Last year, I came upon the records of an old ship, records that were
almost indecipherable. It dated back to the very old days when our world
was not yet known as Comporellon. The name ‘Baleyworld’ was used, which,
it seems to me, may be an even earlier form of the ‘Benbally world’ of
our legends.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, excitedly, “Have you published?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Deniador. “I do not wish to dive until I am sure there is
water in the swimming pool, as the old saying has it. You see, the
record says that the captain of the ship had visited a Spacer world and
taken off with him a Spacer woman.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “But you said that the Spacers did not allow
visitors.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, and that is the reason I don’t publish the material. It
sounds incredible. There are vague tales that could be interpreted as
referring to the Spacers and to their conflict with the Settlers—our own
ancestors. —Such tales exist not only on Comporellon but on many worlds
in many variations, but all are in absolute accord in one respect. The
two groups, Spacers and Settlers, did not mingle. There was no social
contact, let alone sexual contact, and yet apparently the Settler
captain and the Spacer woman were held together by bonds of love. This
is so incredible that I see no chance of the story being accepted as
anything but, at best, a piece of romantic historical fiction.”</p>
<p>Trevize looked disappointed. “Is that all?”</p>
<p>“No, Councilman, there is one more matter. I came across some figures
in what was left of the log of the ship that might—or might
not—represent spatial coordinates. If they were—and I repeat, since my
Skeptic’s honor compels me to, that they might not be—then internal
evidence made me conclude they were the spatial coordinates of three of
the Spacer worlds. One of them might be the Spacer world where the
captain landed and from which he withdrew his Spacer love.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Might it not be that even if the tale is fiction, the
coordinates are real?”</p>
<p>“It might be,” said Deniador. “I will give you the figures, and you
are free to use them, but you might get nowhere. —And yet I have an
amusing notion.” His quick smile made its appearance.</p>
<p>“What is that?” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“What if one of those sets of coordinates represented Earth?”</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Comporellon’s sun, distinctly orange, was larger in appearance than
the sun of Terminus, but it was low in the sky and gave out little heat.
The wind, fortunately light, touched Trevize’s cheek with icy
fingers.</p>
<p>He shivered inside the electrified coat he had been given by Mitza
Lizalor, who now stood next to him. He said, “It must warm up sometime,
Mitza.”</p>
<p>She glanced up at the sun briefly, and stood there in the emptiness
of the spaceport, showing no signs of discomfort—tall, large, wearing a
lighter coat than Trevize had on, and if not impervious to the cold, at
least scornful of it.</p>
<p>She said, “We have a beautiful summer. It is not a long one but our
food crops are adapted to it. The strains are carefully chosen so that
they grow quickly in the sun and do not frostbite easily. Our domestic
animals are well furred, and Comporellian wool is the best in the Galaxy
by general admission. Then, too, we have farm settlements in orbit about
Comporellon that grow tropical fruit. We actually export canned
pineapples of superior flavor. Most people who know us as a cold world
don’t know that.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I thank you for coming to see us off, Mitza, and for
being willing to co-operate with us on this mission of ours. For my own
peace of mind, however, I must ask whether you will find yourself in
serious trouble over this.”</p>
<p>“No!” She shook her head proudly. “No trouble. In the first place, I
will not be questioned. I am in control of transportation, which means I
alone set the rules for this spaceport and others, for the entry
stations, for the ships that come and go. The Prime Minister depends on
me for all that and is only too delighted to remain ignorant of its
details. —And even if I were questioned, I have but to tell the truth.
The government would applaud me for not turning the ship over to the
Foundation. So would the people if it were safe to let them know. And
the Foundation itself would not know of it.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “The government might be willing to keep the ship from
the Foundation, but would they be willing to approve your letting us
take it away?”</p>
<p>Lizalor smiled. “You are a decent human being, Trevize. You have
fought tenaciously to keep your ship and now that you have it you take
the trouble to concern yourself with my welfare.” She reached toward him
tentatively as though tempted to give some sign of affection and then,
with obvious difficulty, controlled the impulse.</p>
<p>She said, with a renewed brusqueness, “Even if they question my
decision, I have but to tell them that you have been, and still are,
searching for the Oldest, and they will say I did well to get rid of you
as quickly as I did, ship and all. And they will perform the rites of
atonement that you were ever allowed to land in the first place, though
there was no way we might have guessed what you were doing.”</p>
<p>“Do you truly fear misfortune to yourself and the world because of my
presence?”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Lizalor stolidly. Then she said, more softly, “You
have brought misfortune to me, already, for now that I have known you,
Comporellian men will seem more sapless still. I will be left with an
unappeasable longing. He Who Punishes has already seen to that.”</p>
<p>Trevize hesitated, then said, “I do not wish you to change your mind
on this matter, but I do not wish you to suffer needless apprehension,
either. You must know that this matter of my bringing misfortune on you
is simply superstition.”</p>
<p>“The Skeptic told you that, I presume.”</p>
<p>“I know it without his telling me.”</p>
<p>Lizalor brushed her face, for a thin rime was gathering on her
prominent eyebrows and said, “I know there are some who think it
superstition. That the Oldest brings misfortune is, however, a fact. It
has been demonstrated many times and all the clever Skeptical arguments
can’t legislate the truth out of existence.”</p>
<p>She thrust out her hand suddenly. “Good-bye, Golan. Get on the ship
and join your companions before your soft Terminian body freezes in our
cold, but kindly wind.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Mitza, and I hope to see you when I return.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you have promised to return and I have tried to believe that
you would. I have even told myself that I would come out and meet you at
your ship in space so that misfortune would fall only on me and not upon
my world—but you will not return.”</p>
<p>“Not so! I will! I would not give you up that easily, having had
pleasure of you.” And at that moment, Trevize was firmly convinced that
he meant it.</p>
<p>“I do not doubt your romantic impulses, my sweet Foundationer, but
those who venture outward on a search for the Oldest will never come
back—anywhere. I know that in my heart.”</p>
<p>Trevize tried to keep his teeth from chattering. It was from cold and
he didn’t want her to think it was from fear. He said, “That, too, is
superstition.”</p>
<p>“And yet,” she said, “that, too, is true.”</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">

</ol>
<p>It was good to be back in the pilot-room of the Far Star. It might be
cramped for room. It might be a bubble of imprisonment in infinite
space. Nevertheless, it was familiar, friendly, and warm.</p>
<p>Bliss said, “I’m glad you finally came aboard. I was wondering how
long you would remain with the Minister.”</p>
<p>“Not long,” said Trevize. “It was cold.”</p>
<p>“It seemed to me,” said Bliss, “that you were considering remaining
with her and postponing the search for Earth. I do not like to probe
your mind even lightly, but I was concerned for you and that temptation
under which you labored seemed to leap out at me.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “You’re quite right. Momentarily at least, I felt the
temptation. The Minister is a remarkable woman and I’ve never met anyone
quite like her. —Did you strengthen my resistance, Bliss?”</p>
<p>She said, “I’ve told you many times I must not and will not tamper
with your mind in any way, Trevize. You beat down the temptation, I
imagine, through your strong sense of duty.”</p>
<p>“No, I rather think not.” He smiled wryly. “Nothing so dramatic and
noble. My resistance was strengthened, for one thing, by the fact that
is was cold, and for another, by the sad thought that it wouldn’t take
many sessions with her to kill me. I could never keep up the pace.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Well, anyway, you are safely aboard. What are we going
to do next?”</p>
<p>“In the immediate future, we are going to move outward through the
planetary system at a brisk pace until we are far enough from
Comporellon’s sun to make a Jump.”</p>
<p>“Do you think we will be stopped or followed?”</p>
<p>“No, I really think that the Minister is anxious only that we go away
as rapidly as possible and stay away, in order that the vengeance of He
Who Punishes not fall upon the planet. In fact—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“She believes the vengeance will surely fall on us. She is under the
firm conviction that we will never return. This, I hasten to add, is not
an estimate of my probable level of infidelity, which she has had no
occasion to measure. She meant that Earth is so terrible a bearer of
misfortune that anyone who seeks it must die in the process.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “How many have left Comporellon in search of Earth that
she can make such a statement?”</p>
<p>“I doubt that any Comporellian has ever left on such a search. I told
her that her fears were mere superstition.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you believe that, or have you let her shake you?”</p>
<p>“I know her fears are the purest superstition in the form she
expresses them, but they may be well founded just the same.”</p>
<p>“You mean, radioactivity will kill us if we try to land on it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that Earth is radioactive. What I do believe is that
Earth protects itself. Remember that all reference to Earth in the
Library on Trantor has been removed. Remember that Gaia’s marvelous
memory, in which all the planet takes part down to the rock strata of
the surface and the molten metal at the core, stops short of penetrating
far enough back to tell us anything of Earth.</p>
<p>“Clearly, if Earth is powerful enough to do that, it might also be
capable of adjusting minds in order to force belief in its
radioactivity, and thus preventing any search for it. Perhaps because
Comporellon is so close that it represents a particular danger to Earth,
there is the further reinforcement of a curious blankness. Deniador, who
is a Skeptic and a scientist, is utterly convinced that there is no use
searching for Earth. He says it cannot be found. —And that is why the
Minister’s superstition may be well founded. If Earth is so intent on
concealing itself, might it not kill us, or distort us, rather than
allow us to find it?”</p>
<p>Bliss frowned and said, “Gaia—”</p>
<p>Trevize said quickly, “Don’t say Gaia will protect us. Since Earth
was able to remove Gaia’s earliest memories, it is clear that in any
conflict between the two Earth will win.”</p>
<p>Bliss said coldly, “How do you know that the memories were removed?
It might be that it simply took time for Gaia to develop a planetary
memory and that we can now probe backward only to the time of the
completion of that development. And if the memory was removed, how can
you be sure that it was Earth that did it?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I don’t know. I merely advance my speculations.”</p>
<p>Pelorat put in, rather timidly, “If Earth is so powerful, and so
intent on preserving its privacy, so to speak, of what use is our
search? You seem to think Earth won’t allow us to succeed and will kill
us if that will be what it takes to keep us from succeeding. In that
case, is there any sense in not abandoning this whole thing?”</p>
<p>“It might seem we ought to give up, I admit, but I have this powerful
conviction that Earth exists, and I must and will find it. And Gaia
tells me that when I have powerful convictions of this sort, I am always
right.”</p>
<p>“But how can we survive the discovery, old chap?”</p>
<p>“It may be,” said Trevize, with an effort at lightness, “that Earth,
too, will recognize the value of my extraordinary rightness and will
leave me to myself. But—and this is what I am finally getting at—I
cannot be certain that you two will survive and that is of concern to
me. It always has been, but it is increasing now and it seems to me that
I ought to take you two back to Gaia and then proceed on my own. It is
I, not you, who first decided I must search for Earth; it is I, not you,
who see value in it; it is I, not you, who am driven. Let it be I, then,
not you, who take the risk. Let me go on alone. —Janov?”</p>
<p>Pelorat’s long face seemed to grow longer as he buried his chin in
his neck. “I won’t deny I feel nervous, Golan, but I’d be ashamed to
abandon you. I would disown myself if I did so.”</p>
<p>“Bliss?”</p>
<p>“Gaia will not abandon you, Trevize, whatever you do. If Earth should
prove dangerous, Gaia will protect you as far as it can. And in any
case, in my role as Bliss, I will not abandon Pel, and if he clings to
you, then I certainly cling to him.”</p>
<p>Trevize said grimly, “Very well, then. I’ve given you your chance. We
go on together.”</p>
<p>“Together,” said Bliss.</p>
<p>Pelorat smiled slightly, and gripped Trevize’s shoulder. “Together.
Always.”</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Bliss said, “Look at that, Pel.”</p>
<p>She had been making use of the ship’s telescope by hand, almost
aimlessly, as a change from Pelorat’s library of Earth-legendry.</p>
<p>Pelorat approached, placed an arm about her shoulders and looked at
the viewscreen. One of the gas giants of the Comporellian planetary
system was in sight, magnified till it seemed the large body it really
was.</p>
<p>In color it was a soft orange streaked with paler stripes. Viewed
from the planetary plane, and more distant from the sun than the ship
itself was, it was almost a complete circle of light.</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>“The central streak extends beyond the planet, Pel.”</p>
<p>Pelorat furrowed his brow and said, “You know, Bliss, I believe it
does.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose it’s an optical illusion?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I’m not sure, Bliss. I’m as much a space-novice as you
are. —Golan!”</p>
<p>Trevize answered the call with a rather feeble “What is it?” and
entered the pilot-room, looking a bit rumpled, as though he had just
been napping on his bed with his clothes on—which was exactly what he
had been doing.</p>
<p>He said, in a rather peevish way, “Please! Don’t be handling the
instruments.”</p>
<p>“It’s just the telescope,” said Pelorat. “Look at that.”</p>
<p>Trevize did. “It’s a gas giant, the one they call Gallia, according
to the information I was given.”</p>
<p>“How can you tell it’s that one, just looking?”</p>
<p>“For one thing,” said Trevize, “at our distance from the sun, and
because of the planetary sizes and orbital positions, which I’ve been
studying in plotting our course, that’s the only one you could magnify
to that extent at this time. For another thing, there’s the ring.”</p>
<p>“Ring?” said Bliss, mystified.</p>
<p>“All you can see is a thin, pale marking, because we’re viewing it
almost edge-on. We can zoom up out of the planetary plane and give you a
better view. Would you like that?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I don’t want to make you have to recalculate positions
and courses, Golan.”</p>
<p>“Oh well, the computer will do it for me with little trouble.” He sat
down at the computer as he spoke and placed his hands on the markings
that received them. The computer, finely attuned to his mind, did the
rest.</p>
<p>The Far Star, free of fuel problems or of inertial sensations,
accelerated rapidly, and once again, Trevize felt a surge of love for a
computer-and-ship that responded in such a way to him—as though it was
his thought that powered and directed it, as though it were a powerful
and obedient extension of his will.</p>
<p>It was no wonder the Foundation wanted it back; no wonder Comporellon
had wanted it for itself. The only surprise was that the force of
superstition had been strong enough to cause Comporellon to be willing
to give it up.</p>
<p>Properly armed, it could outrun or outfight any ship in the Galaxy,
or any combination of ships—provided only that it did not encounter
another ship like itself.</p>
<p>Of course, it was not properly armed. Mayor Branno, in assigning him
the ship, had at least been cautious enough to leave it unarmed.</p>
<p>Pelorat and Bliss watched intently as the planet, Gallia, slowly,
slowly, tipped toward them. The upper pole (whichever it was) became
visible, with turbulence in a large circular region around it, while the
lower pole retired behind the bulge of the sphere.</p>
<p>At the upper end, the dark side of the planet invaded the sphere of
orange light, and the beautiful circle became increasingly lopsided.</p>
<p>What seemed more exciting was that the central pale streak was no
longer straight but had come to be curved, as were the other streaks to
the north and south, but more noticeably so.</p>
<p>Now the central streak extended beyond the edges of the planet very
distinctly and did so in a narrow loop on either side. There was no
question of illusion; its nature was apparent. It was a ring of matter,
looping about the planet, and hidden on the far side.</p>
<p>“That’s enough to give you the idea, I think,” said Trevize. “If we
were to move over the planet, you would see the ring in its circular
form, concentric about the planet, touching it nowhere. You’ll probably
see that it’s not one ring either but several concentric rings.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have thought it possible,” said Pelorat blankly. “What
keeps it in space?”</p>
<p>“The same thing that keeps a satellite in space,” said Trevize. “The
rings consist of tiny particles, every one of which is orbiting the
planet. The rings are so close to the planet that tidal effects prevent
it from coalescing into a single body.”</p>
<p>Pelorat shook his head. “It’s horrifying when I think of it, old man.
How is it possible that I can have spent my whole life as a scholar and
yet know so little about astronomy?”</p>
<p>“And I know nothing at all about the myths of humanity. No one can
encompass all of knowledge. —The point is that these planetary rings
aren’t unusual. Almost every single gas giant has them, even if it’s
only a thin curve of dust. As it happens, the sun of Terminus has no
true gas giant in its planetary family, so unless a Terminian is a space
traveler, or has taken University instruction in astronomy, he’s likely
to know nothing about planetary rings. What is unusual is a ring that is
sufficiently broad to be bright and noticeable, like that one. It’s
beautiful. It must be a couple of hundred kilometers wide, at
least.”</p>
<p>At this point, Pelorat snapped his fingers. “That’s what it
meant.”</p>
<p>Bliss looked startled. “What is it, Pel?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I came across a scrap of poetry once, very ancient,
and in an archaic version of Galactic that was hard to make out but that
was good evidence of great age. —Though I shouldn’t complain of the
archaism, old chap. My work has made me an expert on various varieties
of Old Galactic, which is quite gratifying even if it is of no use to me
whatever outside my work. —What was I talking about?”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “An old scrap of poetry, Pel dear.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Bliss,” he said. And to Trevize, “She keeps close track
of what I say in order to pull me back whenever I get off-course, which
is most of the time.”</p>
<p>“It’s part of your charm, Pel,” said Bliss, smiling.</p>
<p>“Anyway, this scrap of poetry purported to describe the planetary
system of which Earth was part. Why it should do so, I don’t know, for
the poem as a whole does not survive; at least, I was never able to
locate it. Only this one portion survived, perhaps because of its
astronomical content. In any case, it spoke of the brilliant triple ring
of the sixth planet ‘both brade and large, sae the woruld shronk in
comparisoun.’ I can still quote it, you see. I didn’t understand what a
planet’s ring could be. I remember thinking of three circles on one side
of the planet, all in a row. It seemed so nonsensical, I didn’t bother
to include it in my library. I’m sorry now I didn’t inquire.” He shook
his head. “Being a mythologist in today’s Galaxy is so solitary a job,
one forgets the good of inquiring.”</p>
<p>Trevize said consolingly, “You were probably right to ignore it,
Janov. It’s a mistake to take poetic chatter literally.”</p>
<p>“But that’s what was meant,” said Pelorat, pointing at the screen.
“That’s what the poem was speaking of. Three wide rings, concentric,
wider than the planet itself.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I never heard of such a thing. I don’t think rings can
be that wide. Compared to the planet they circle, they are always very
narrow.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “We never heard of a habitable planet with a giant
satellite, either. Or one with a radioactive crust. This is uniqueness
number three. If we find a radioactive planet that might be otherwise
habitable, with a giant satellite, and with another planet in the system
that has a huge ring, there would be no doubt at all that we had
encountered Earth.”</p>
<p>Trevize smiled. “I agree, Janov. If we find all three, we will
certainly have found Earth.”</p>
<p>“If!” said Bliss, with a sigh.</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>They were beyond the main worlds of the planetary system, plunging
outward between the positions of the two outermost planets so that there
was now no significant mass within 1.5 billion kilometers. Ahead lay
only the vast cometary cloud which, gravitationally, was
insignificant.</p>
<p>The Far Star had accelerated to a speed of 0.1 c, one tenth the speed
of light. Trevize knew well that, in theory, the ship could be
accelerated to nearly the speed of light, but he also knew that, in
practice, 0.1 c was the reasonable limit.</p>
<p>At that speed, any object with appreciable mass could be avoided, but
there was no way of dodging the innumerable dust particles in space,
and, to a far greater extent even, individual atoms and molecules. At
very fast speeds, even such small objects could do damage, scouring and
scraping the ship’s hull. At speeds near the speed of light, each atom
smashing into the hull had the properties of a cosmic ray particle.
Under that penetrating cosmic radiation, anyone on board ship would not
long survive.</p>
<p>The distant stars showed no perceptible motion in the viewscreen, and
even though the ship was moving at thirty thousand kilometers per
second, there was every appearance of its standing still.</p>
<p>The computer scanned space to great distances for any oncoming object
of small but significant size that might be on a collision course, and
the ship veered gently to avoid it, in the extremely unlikely case that
that would be necessary. Between the small size of any possible oncoming
object, the speed with which it was passed, and the lack of inertial
effect as the result of the course change, there was no way of telling
whether anything ever took place in the nature of what might be termed a
“close call.”</p>
<p>Trevize, therefore, did not worry about such things, or even give it
the most casual thought. He kept his full attention on the three sets of
coordinates he had been given by Deniador, and, particularly, on the set
which indicated the object closest to themselves.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with the figures?” asked Pelorat
anxiously.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell yet,” said Trevize. “Coordinates in themselves aren’t
useful, unless you know the zero point and the conventions used in
setting them up—the direction in which to mark off the distance, so to
speak, what the equivalent of a prime meridian is, and so on.”</p>
<p>“How do you find out such things?” said Pelorat blankly.</p>
<p>“I obtained the coordinates of Terminus and a few other known points,
relative to Comporellon. If I put them into the computer, it will
calculate what the conventions must be for such coordinates if Terminus
and the other points are to be correctly located. I’m only trying to
organize things in my mind so that I can properly program the computer
for this. Once the conventions are determined, the figures we have for
the Forbidden Worlds might possibly have meaning.”</p>
<p>“Only possibly?” said Bliss.</p>
<p>“Only possibly, I’m afraid,” said Trevize. “These are old figures
after all—presumably Comporellian, but not definitely. What if they are
based on other conventions?”</p>
<p>“In that case?”</p>
<p>“In that case, we have only meaningless figures. But—we just have to
find out.”</p>
<p>His hands flickered over the softly glowing keys of the computer,
feeding it the necessary information. He then placed his hands on the
handmarks on the desk. He waited while the computer worked out the
conventions of the known coordinates, paused a moment, then interpreted
the coordinates of the nearest Forbidden World by the same conventions,
and finally located those coordinates on the Galactic map in its
memory.</p>
<p>A starfield appeared on the screen and moved rapidly as it adjusted
itself. When it reached stasis, it expanded with stars bleeding off the
edges in all directions until they were almost all gone. At no point
could the eye follow the rapid change; it was all a speckled blur. Until
finally, a space one tenth of a parsec on each side (according to the
index figures below the screen) was all that remained. There was no
further change, and only half a dozen dim sparks relieved the darkness
of the screen.</p>
<p>“Which one is the Forbidden World?” asked Pelorat softly.</p>
<p>“None of them,” said Trevize. “Four of them are red dwarfs, one a
near-red dwarf, and the last a white dwarf. None of them can possibly
have a habitable world in orbit about them.”</p>
<p>“How do you know they’re red dwarfs just by looking at them?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “We’re not looking at real stars; we’re looking at a
section of the Galactic map stored in the computer’s memory. Each one is
labeled. You can’t see it and ordinarily I couldn’t see it either, but
as long as my hands are making contact, as they are, I am aware of a
considerable amount of data on any star on which my eyes
concentrate.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said in a woebegone tone, “Then the coordinates are
useless.”</p>
<p>Trevize looked up at him, “No, Janov. I’m not finished. There’s still
the matter of time. The coordinates for the Forbidden World are those of
twenty thousand years ago. In that time, both it and Comporellon have
been revolving about the Galactic Center, and they may well be revolving
at different speeds and in orbits of different inclinations and
eccentricities. With time, therefore, the two worlds may be drifting
closer together or farther apart and, in twenty thousand years, the
Forbidden World may have drifted anywhere from one-half to five parsecs
off the mark. It certainly wouldn’t be included in that tenth-parsec
square.”</p>
<p>“What do we do, then?”</p>
<p>“We have the computer move the Galaxy twenty thousand years back in
time relative to Comporellon.”</p>
<p>“Can it do that?” asked Bliss, sounding rather awestruck.</p>
<p>“Well, it can’t move the Galaxy itself back in time, but it can move
the map in its memory banks back in time.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Will we see anything happen?”</p>
<p>“Watch,” said Trevize.</p>
<p>Very slowly, the half-dozen stars crawled over the face of the
screen. A new star, not hitherto on the screen, drifted in from the left
hand edge, and Pelorat pointed in excitement. “There! There!”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Sorry. Another red dwarf. They’re very common. At
least three fourths of all the stars in the Galaxy are red dwarfs.”</p>
<p>The screen settled down and stopped moving.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Bliss.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “That’s it. That’s the view of that portion of the
Galaxy as it would have been twenty thousand years ago. At the very
center of the screen is a point where the Forbidden World ought to be if
it had been drifting at some average velocity.”</p>
<p>“Ought to be, but isn’t,” said Bliss sharply.</p>
<p>“It isn’t,” agreed Trevize, with remarkably little emotion.</p>
<p>Pelorat released his breath in a long sigh. “Oh, too bad, Golan.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Wait, don’t despair. I wasn’t expecting to see the
star there.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t?” said Pelorat, astonished.</p>
<p>“No. I told you that this isn’t the Galaxy itself, but the computer’s
map of the Galaxy. If a real star is not included in the map, we don’t
see it. If the planet is called ‘Forbidden’ and has been called so for
twenty thousand years, the chances are it wouldn’t be included in the
map. And it isn’t, for we don’t see it.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “We might not see it because it doesn’t exist. The
Comporellian legends may be false, or the coordinates may be wrong.”</p>
<p>“Very true. The computer, however, can now make an estimate as to
what the coordinates ought to be at this time, now that it has located
the spot where it may have been twenty thousand years ago. Using the
coordinates corrected for time, a correction I could only have made
through use of the star map, we can now switch to the real starfield of
the Galaxy itself.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “But you only assumed an average velocity for the
Forbidden World. What if its velocity was not average? You would not now
have the correct coordinates.”</p>
<p>“True enough, but a correction, assuming average velocity, is almost
certain to be closer to its real position, than if we had made no time
correction at all.”</p>
<p>“You hope!” said Bliss doubtfully.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what I do,” said Trevize. “I hope. —And now let’s
look at the real Galaxy.”</p>
<p>The two onlookers watched tensely, while Trevize (perhaps to reduce
his own tensions and delay the zero moment) spoke softly, almost as
though he were lecturing.</p>
<p>“It’s more difficult to observe the real Galaxy,” he said. “The map
in the computer is an artificial construction, with irrelevancies
capable of being eliminated. If there is a nebula obscuring the view, I
can remove it. If the angle of view is inconvenient for what I have in
mind, I can change the angle, and so on. The real Galaxy, however, I
must take as I find it, and if I want a change I must move physically
through space, which will take far more time than it would take to
adjust a map.”</p>
<p>And as he spoke, the screen showed a star cloud so rich in individual
stars as to seem an irregular heap of powder.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “That’s a large angle view of a section of the Milky
Way, and I want the foreground, of course. If I expand the foreground,
the background will tend to fade in comparison. The coordinate spot is
close enough to Comporellon so that I should be able to expand it to
about the situation I had on the view of the map. Just let me put in the
necessary instructions, if I can hold on to my sanity long enough.
Now.”</p>
<p>The starfield expanded with a rush so that thousands of stars pushed
off every edge, giving the watchers so real a sensation of moving toward
the screen that all three automatically leaned backward as though in
response to a forward rush.</p>
<p>The old view returned, not quite as dark as it had been on the map,
but with the half-dozen stars shown as they had been in the original
view. And there; close to the center, was another star, shining far more
brightly than the others.</p>
<p>“There it is,” said Pelorat, in an awed whisper.</p>
<p>“It may be. I’ll have the computer take its spectrum and analyze it.”
There was a moderately long pause, then Trevize said, “Spectral class,
G-4, which makes it a trifle dimmer and smaller than Terminus’s sun, but
rather brighter than Comporellon’s sun. And no G-class star should be
omitted from the computer’s Galactic map. Since this one is, that is a
strong indication that it may be the sun about which the Forbidden World
revolves.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Is there any chance of its turning out that there is no
habitable planet revolving about this star after all?”</p>
<p>“There’s a chance, I suppose. In that case, we’ll try to find the
other two Forbidden Worlds.”</p>
<p>Bliss persevered. “And if the other two are false alarms, too?”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll try something else.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“I wish I knew,” said Trevize grimly.</p>
