<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>Seldon had had an evening, a night, and part of a morning to get over
his meeting with the Emperor. At least, the changing quality of light
within the walkways, moving corridors, squares, and parks of the
Imperial Sector of Trantor made it seem that an evening, a night, and
part of a morning had passed.</p>
<p>He sat now in a small park on a small plastic seat that molded itself
neatly to his body and he was comfortable. Judging from the light, it
seemed to be midmorning and the air was just cool enough to seem fresh
without possessing even the smallest bite.</p>
<p>Was it like this all the time? He thought of the gray day outside
when he went to see the Emperor. And he thought of all the gray days and
cold days and hot days and rainy days and snowy days on Helicon, his
home, and he wondered if one could miss them. Was it possible to sit in
a park on Trantor, having ideal weather day after day, so that it felt
as though you were surrounded by nothing at all—and coming to miss a
howling wind or a biting cold or a breathless humidity?</p>
<p>Perhaps. But not on the first day or the second or the seventh. He
would have only this one day and he would leave tomorrow. He meant to
enjoy it while he could. He might, after all, never return to
Trantor.</p>
<p>Still, he continued to feel uneasy at having spoken as independently
as he had to a man who could, at will, order one’s imprisonment or
execution—or, at the very least, the economic and social death of loss
of position and status.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, Seldon had looked up Cleon I in the encyclopedic
portion of his hotel room computer. The Emperor had been highly praised
as, no doubt, had all Emperors in their own lifetime, regardless of
their deeds. Seldon had dismissed that, but he was interested in the
fact that Cleon had been born in the Palace and had never left its
grounds. He had never been in Trantor itself, in any part of the
multi-domed world. It was a matter of security, perhaps, but what it
meant was that the Emperor was in prison, whether he admitted the matter
to himself or not. It might be the most luxurious prison in the Galaxy,
but it was a prison just the same.</p>
<p>And though the Emperor had seemed mild-mannered and had shown no sign
of being a bloody-minded autocrat as so many of his predecessors had
been, it was not good to have attracted his attention. Seldon welcomed
the thought of leaving tomorrow for Helicon, even though it would be
winter (and a rather nasty one, so far) back home.</p>
<p>He looked up at the bright diffuse light. Although it could never
rain in here, the atmosphere was far from dry. A fountain played not far
from him; the plants were green and had probably never felt drought.
Occasionally, the shrubbery rustled as though a small animal or two was
hidden there. He heard the hum of bees.</p>
<p>Really, though Trantor was spoken of throughout the Galaxy as an
artificial world of metal and ceramic, in this small patch it felt
positively rustic.</p>
<p>There were a few other persons taking advantage of the park all
wearing light hats, some quite small. There was one rather pretty young
woman not far away, but she was bent over a viewer and he could not see
her face clearly. A man walked past, looked at him briefly and
incuriously, then sat down in a seat facing him and buried himself in a
sheaf of teleprints, crossing one leg, in its tight pink trouser leg,
over the other.</p>
<p>There was a tendency to pastel shades among the men, oddly enough,
while the women mostly wore white. Being a clean environment, it made
sense to wear light colors. He looked down in amusement at his own
Heliconian costume, which was predominantly dull brown. If he were to
stay on Trantor—as he was not—he would need to purchase suitable
clothing or he would become an object of curiosity or laughter or
repulsion. The man with the teleprints had, for instance, looked up at
him more curiously this time—no doubt intrigued by his Outworldish
clothing.</p>
<p>Seldon was relieved that he did not smile. He could be philosophical
over being a figure of fun, but, surely, he could not be expected to
enjoy it.</p>
<p>Seldon watched the man rather unobtrusively, for he seemed to be
engaged in some sort of internal debate. At the moment he looked as if
he was about to speak, then seemed to think better of it, then seemed to
wish to speak again. Seldon wondered what the outcome would be.</p>
<p>He studied the man. He was tall, with broad shoulders and no sign of
a paunch, darkish hair with a glint of blond, smooth-shaven, a grave
expression, an air of strength though there were no bulging muscles, a
face that was a touch rugged—pleasant, but with nothing “pretty” about
it.</p>
<p>By the time the man had lost the internal fight with himself (or won,
perhaps) and leaned toward him, Seldon had decided he liked him.</p>
<p>The man said, “Pardon me, weren’t you at the Decennial Convention?
Mathematics?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was,” said Seldon agreeably.</p>
<p>“Ah, I thought I saw you there. It was—excuse me—that moment of
recognition that led me to sit here. If I am intruding on your
privacy—”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I’m just enjoying an idle moment.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see how close I can get. You’re Professor Seldom.”</p>
<p>“Seldon. Hari Seldon. Quite close. And you?”</p>
<p>“Chetter Hummin.” The man seemed slightly embarrassed. “Rather a
homespun name, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never come across any Chetters before,” said Seldon. “Or
Hummins. So that makes you somewhat unique, I should think. It might be
viewed as being better than being mixed up with all the countless Haris
there are. Or Seldons, for that matter.”</p>
<p>Seldon moved his chair closer to Hummin, scraping it against the
slightly elastic ceramoid tiles.</p>
<p>“Talk about homespun,” he said. “What about this Outworldish clothing
I’m wearing? It never occurred to me that I ought to get Trantorian
garb.”</p>
<p>“You could buy some,” said Hummin, eyeing Seldon with suppressed
disapproval.</p>
<p>“I’ll be leaving tomorrow and, besides, I couldn’t afford it.
Mathematicians deal with large numbers sometimes, but never in their
income. —I presume you’re a mathematician, Hummin.”</p>
<p>“No. Zero talent there.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Seldon was disappointed. “You said you saw me at the Decennial
Convention.”</p>
<p>“I was there as an onlooker. I’m a journalist.” He waved his
teleprints, seemed suddenly aware that he was holding them and shoved
them into his jacket pouch. “I supply the material for the news
holocasts.” Then, thoughtfully, “Actually, I’m rather tired of it.”</p>
<p>“The job?”</p>
<p>Hummin nodded. “I’m sick of gathering together all the nonsense from
every world. I hate the downward spiral.”</p>
<p>He glanced speculatively at Seldon. “Sometimes something interesting
turns up, though. I’ve heard you were seen in the company of an Imperial
Guard and making for the Palace gate. You weren’t by any chance seen by
the Emperor, were you?”</p>
<p>The smile vanished from Seldon’s face. He said slowly, “If I was, it
would scarcely be something I could talk about for publication.”</p>
<p>“No no, not for publication. If you don’t know this, Seldon, let me
be the first to tell you— The first rule of the news game is that
nothing is ever said about the Emperor or his personal entourage except
what is officially given out. It’s a mistake, of course, because rumors
fly that are much worse than the truth, but that’s the way it is.”</p>
<p>“But if you can’t report it, friend, why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Private curiosity. Believe me, in my job I know a great deal more
than ever gets on the air. —Let me guess. I didn’t follow your paper,
but I gathered that you were talking about the possibility of predicting
the future.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head and muttered, “It was a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Well, prediction—accurate prediction—would interest the Emperor, or
any man in government, so I’m guessing that Cleon, First of that Name,
asked you about it and wouldn’t you please give him a few
predictions.”</p>
<p>Seldon said stiffly, “I don’t intend to discuss the matter.”</p>
<p>Hummin shrugged slightly. “Eto Demerzel was there, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“You’ve never heard of Eto Demerzel?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“Cleon’s alter ego—Cleon’s brain—Cleon’s evil spirit. He’s been
called all those things—if we confine ourselves to the nonvituperative.
He must have been there.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked confused and Hummin said, “Well, you may not have seen
him, but he was there. And if he thinks you can predict the future—”</p>
<p>“I can’t predict the future,” said Seldon, shaking his head
vigorously. “If you listened to my paper, you’ll know that I only spoke
of a theoretical possibility.”</p>
<p>“Just the same, if he thinks you can predict the future, he will not
let you go.”</p>
<p>“He must have. Here I am.”</p>
<p>“That means nothing. He knows where you are and he’ll continue to
know. And when he wants you, he’ll get you, wherever you are. And if he
decides you’re useful, he’ll squeeze the use out of you. And if he
decides you’re dangerous, he’ll squeeze the life out of you.”</p>
<p>Seldon stared. “What are you trying to do. Frighten me?”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to warn you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe what you’re saying.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you? A while ago you said something was a mistake. Were you
thinking that presenting the paper was a mistake and that it was getting
you into the kind of trouble you don’t want to be in?”</p>
<p>Seldon bit his lower lip uneasily. That was a guess that came
entirely too close to the truth—and it was at this moment that Seldon
felt the presence of intruders.</p>
<p>They did not cast a shadow, for the light was too soft and
widespread. It was simply a movement that caught the corner of his
eye—and then it stopped.</p>
<p>TRANTOR— … The capital of the First Galactic Empire … Under Cleon I,
it had its “twilight glow.” To all appearances, it was then at its peak.
Its land surface of 200 million square kilometers was entirely domed
(except for the Imperial Palace area) and underlaid with an endless city
that extended beneath the continental shelves. The population was 40
billion and although the signs were plentiful (and clearly visible in
hindsight) that there were gathering problems, those who lived on
Trantor undoubtedly found it still the Eternal World of legend and did
not expect it would ever …</p>
