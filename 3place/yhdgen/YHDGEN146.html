<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon looked at the holograph of himself cast by Hummin’s
projector. It was more dramatic and useful than a mirror would have
been. In fact, it seemed as though there were two of him in the
room.</p>
<p>Seldon studied the sleeve of his new tunic. His Heliconian attitudes
made him wish the colors were less vibrant, but he was thankful that, as
it was, Hummin had chosen softer colors than were customary here on this
world. (Seldon thought of the clothing worn by their two assailants and
shuddered inwardly.) He said, “And I suppose I must wear this hat.”</p>
<p>“In the Imperial Sector, yes. To go bareheaded here is a sign of low
breeding. Elsewhere, the rules are different.”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. The round hat was made of soft material and molded
itself to his head when he put it on. The brim was evenly wide all
around, but it was narrower than on the hats his attackers had worn.
Seldon consoled himself by noticing that when he wore the hat the brim
curved rather gracefully.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have a strap under the chin.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. That’s advanced fashion for young lanks.”</p>
<p>“For young what?”</p>
<p>“A lank is someone who wears things for their shock value. I’m sure
you have such people on Helicon.”</p>
<p>Seldon snorted. “There are those who wear their hair shoulder-length
on one side and shave the other.” He laughed at the memory.</p>
<p>Hummin’s mouth twisted slightly. “I imagine it looks uncommonly
ugly.”</p>
<p>“Worse. There are lefties and righties, apparently, and each finds
the other version highly offensive. The two groups often engage in
street brawls.”</p>
<p>“Then I think you can stand the hat, especially without the
strap.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’ll get used to it.”</p>
<p>“It will attract some attention. It’s subdued for one thing and makes
you look as if you’re in mourning. And it doesn’t quite fit. Then, too,
you wear it with obvious discomfort. However, we won’t be in the
Imperial Sector long. —Seen enough?” And the holograph flickered
out.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “How much did this cost you?”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>“It bothers me to be in your debt.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. This is my choice. But we’ve been here long
enough. I will have been described, I’m quite certain. They’ll track me
down and they’ll come here.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Seldon, “the credits you’re spending are a minor
matter. You’re putting yourself into personal danger on my account.
Personal danger!”</p>
<p>“I know that. But it’s my free choice and I can take care of
myself.”</p>
<p>“But why—”</p>
<p>“We’ll discuss the philosophy of it later. —I’ve atomized your
clothes, by the way, and I don’t think I was seen. There was an energy
surge, of course, and that would be recorded. Someone might guess what
happened from that—it’s hard to obscure any action when probing eyes and
mind are sharp enough. However, let us hope we’ll be safely away before
they put it all together.”</p>
