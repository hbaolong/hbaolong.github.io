<h4 id="section">89</h4>
<p>It was their tenth day in Wye and in the morning Hari Seldon’s door
signal sounded and Raych’s high-pitched voice outside was crying out,
“Mister! Mister Seldon! It’s war!”</p>
<p>Seldon took a moment to snap from sleep to wakefulness and scrambled
out of bed. He was shivering slightly (the Wyans liked their domiciles
on the chilly side, he had discovered quite early in his stay there)
when he threw the door open.</p>
<p>Raych bounced in, excited and wide-eyed. “Mister Seldon, they have
Mannix, the old Mayor! They have—”</p>
<p>“Who have, Raych?”</p>
<p>“The Imperials. Their jets came in last night all over. The news
holocasts are telling all about it. It’s on in Missus’s room. She said
to let ya sleep, but I figured ya would wanna know.”</p>
<p>“And you were quite right.” Seldon, pausing only long enough to throw
on a bathrobe, burst into Dors’s room. She was fully dressed and was
watching the holo-set in the alcove.</p>
<p>Behind the clear, small image of a desk sat a man, with the
Spaceship-and-Sun sharply defined on the left-front of his tunic. On
either side, two soldiers, also wearing the Spaceship-and-Sun, stood
armed. The officer at the desk was saying, “—is under the peaceful
control of His Imperial Majesty. Mayor Mannix is safe and well and is in
full possession of his Mayoral powers under the guidance of friendly
Imperial troops. He will be before you soon to urge calm on all Wyans
and to ask any Wyan soldiers still in arms to lay them down.”</p>
<p>There were other news holocasts by various newsmen with unemotional
voices, all wearing Imperial armbands. The news was all the same:
surrender by this or that unit of the Wyan security forces after firing
a few shots for the record—and sometimes after no resistance at all.
This town center and that town center were occupied—and there were
repeated views of Wyan crowds somberly watching Imperial forces marching
down the streets.</p>
<p>Dors said, “It was perfectly executed, Hari. Surprise was complete.
There was no chance of resistance and none of consequence was
offered.”</p>
<p>Then Mayor Mannix IV appeared, as had been promised. He was standing
upright and, perhaps for the sake of appearances, there were no
Imperials in sight, though Seldon was reasonably certain that an
adequate number were present just out of camera range.</p>
<p>Mannix was old, but his strength, though worn, was still apparent.
His eyes did not meet the holo-camera and his words were spoken as
though forced upon him—but, as had been promised, they counseled Wyans
to remain calm, to offer no resistance, to keep Wye from harm, and to
cooperate with the Emperor who, it was hoped, would survive long on the
throne.</p>
<p>“No mention of Rashelle,” said Seldon. “It’s as though his daughter
doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>“No one has mentioned her,” said Dors, “and this place, which is,
after all, her residence—or one of them—hasn’t been attacked. Even if
she manages to slip away and take refuge in some neighboring sector, I
doubt she will be safe anywhere on Trantor for long.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not,” came a voice, “but I’ll be safe here for a little
while.”</p>
<p>Rashelle entered. She was properly dressed, properly calm. She was
even smiling, but it was no smile of joy; it was, rather, a cold baring
of teeth.</p>
<p>The three stared at her in surprise for a moment and Seldon wondered
if she had any of her servants with her or if they had promptly deserted
her at the first sign of adversity.</p>
<p>Dors said a little coldly, “I see, Madam Mayor, that your hopes for a
coup cannot be maintained. Apparently, you have been forestalled.”</p>
<p>“I have not been forestalled. I have been betrayed. My officers have
been tampered with and—against all history and rationality—they have
refused to fight for a woman but only for their old master. And,
traitors that they are, they then let their old master be seized so that
he cannot lead them in resistance.”</p>
<p>She looked about for a chair and sat down. “And now the Empire must
continue to decay and die when I was prepared to offer it new life.”</p>
<p>“I think,” said Dors, “the Empire has avoided an indefinite period of
useless fighting and destruction. Console yourself with that, Madam
Mayor.”</p>
<p>It was as though Rashelle did not hear her. “So many years of
preparation destroyed in a night.” She sat there beaten, defeated, and
seemed to have aged twenty years.</p>
<p>Dors said, “It could scarcely have been done in a night. The
suborning of your officers—if that took place—must have taken time.”</p>
<p>“At that, Demerzel is a master and quite obviously I underestimated
him. How he did it, I don’t know—threats, bribes, smooth and specious
argument. He is a master at the art of stealth and betrayal—I should
have known.”</p>
<p>She went on after a pause. “If this was outright force on his part, I
would have had no trouble destroying anything he sent against us. Who
would think that Wye would be betrayed, that an oath of allegiance would
be so lightly thrown aside?”</p>
<p>Seldon said with automatic rationality, “But I imagine the oath was
made not to you, but to your father.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Rashelle vigorously. “When my father gave me the
Mayoral office, as he was legally entitled to do, he automatically
passed on to me any oaths of allegiance made to him. There is ample
precedence for this. It is customary to have the oath repeated to the
new ruler, but that is a ceremony only and not a legal requirement. My
officers know that, though they choose to forget. They use my womanhood
as an excuse because they quake in fear of Imperial vengeance that would
never have come had they been staunch or tremble with greed for promised
rewards they will surely never get—if I know Demerzel.”</p>
<p>She turned sharply toward Seldon. “He wants you, you know. Demerzel
struck at us for you.”</p>
<p>Seldon started. “Why me?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a fool. For the same reason I wanted you … to use you as a
tool, of course.” She sighed. “At least I am not utterly betrayed. There
are still loyal soldiers to be found. —Sergeant!”</p>
<p>Sergeant Emmer Thalus entered with a soft cautious step that seemed
incongruous, considering his size. His uniform was spruce, his long
blond mustache fiercely curled.</p>
<p>“Madam Mayor,” he said, drawing himself to attention with a snap.</p>
<p>He was still, in appearance, the side of beef that Hari had named
him—a man still following orders blindly, totally oblivious to the new
and changed state of affairs.</p>
<p>Rashelle smiled sadly at Raych. “And how are you, little Raych? I had
meant to make something of you. It seems now I won’t be able to.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Missus … Madam,” said Raych awkwardly.</p>
<p>“And to have made something of you too, Dr. Seldon,” said Rashelle,
“and there also I must crave pardon. I cannot.”</p>
<p>“For me, Madam, you need have no regrets.”</p>
<p>“But I do. I cannot very well let Demerzel have you. That would be
one victory too many for him and at least I can stop that.”</p>
<p>“I would not work for him, Madam, I assure you, any more than I would
have worked for you.”</p>
<p>“It is not a matter of work. It is a matter of being used. Farewell,
Dr. Seldon. —Sergeant, blast him.”</p>
<p>The sergeant drew his blaster at once and Dors, with a loud cry,
lunged forward—but Seldon reached out for her and caught her by the
elbow. He hung on desperately.</p>
<p>“Stay back, Dors,” he shouted, “or he’ll kill you. He won’t kill me.
You too, Raych. Stand back. Don’t move.”</p>
<p>Seldon faced the sergeant. “You hesitate, Sergeant, because you know
you cannot shoot. I might have killed you ten days ago, but I did not.
And you gave me your word of honor at that time that you would protect
me.”</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for?” snapped Rashelle. “I said shoot him down,
Sergeant.”</p>
<p>Seldon said nothing more. He stood there while the sergeant, eyes
bulging, held his blaster steady and pointed at Seldon’s head.</p>
<p>“You have your order!” shrieked Rashelle.</p>
<p>“I have your word,” said Seldon quietly.</p>
<p>And Sergeant Thalus said in a choked tone, “Dishonored either way.”
His hand fell and his blaster clanged to the floor.</p>
<p>Rashelle cried out, “Then you too betray me!”</p>
<p>Before Seldon could move or Dors free herself from his grip, Rashelle
seized the blaster, turned it on the sergeant, and closed contact.</p>
<p>Seldon had never seen anyone blasted before. Somehow, from the name
of the weapon perhaps, he had expected a loud noise, an explosion of
flesh and blood. This Wyan blaster, at least, did nothing of the sort.
What mangling it did to the organs inside the sergeant’s chest Seldon
could not tell but, without a change in expression, without a wince of
pain, the sergeant crumbled and fell, dead beyond any doubt or any
hope.</p>
<p>And Rashelle turned the blaster on Seldon with a firmness that put to
rest any hope for his own life beyond the next second.</p>
<p>It was Raych, however, who jumped into action the moment the sergeant
fell. Racing between Seldon and Rashelle, he waved his hands wildly.</p>
<p>“Missus, Missus,” he called. “Don’t shoot.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Rashelle looked confused. “Out of the way, Raych. I
don’t want to hurt you.”</p>
<p>That moment of hesitation was all Dors needed. Breaking loose
violently, she plunged toward Rashelle with a long low dive. Rashelle
went down with a cry and the blaster hit the ground a second time.</p>
<p>Raych retrieved it.</p>
<p>Seldon, with a deep and shuddering breath, said, “Raych, give that to
me.”</p>
<p>But Raych backed away. “Ya ain’t gonna kill her, are ya, Mister
Seldon? She was nice to me.”</p>
<p>“I won’t kill anyone, Raych,” said Seldon. “She killed the sergeant
and would have killed me, but she didn’t shoot rather than hurt you and
we’ll let her live for that.”</p>
<p>It was Seldon who now sat down, the blaster held loosely in his hand,
while Dors removed the neuronic whip from the dead sergeant’s other
holster.</p>
<p>A new voice rang out. “I’ll take care of her now, Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up and in sudden joy said, “Hummin! Finally!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry it took so long, Seldon. I had a lot to do. How are you,
Dr. Venabili? I take it this is Mannix’s daughter, Rashelle. But who is
the boy?”</p>
<p>“Raych is a young Dahlite friend of ours,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>Soldiers were entering and, at a small gesture from Hummin, they
lifted Rashelle respectfully.</p>
<p>Dors, able to suspend her intent surveillance of the other woman,
brushed at her clothes with her hands and smoothed her blouse. Seldon
suddenly realized that he was still in his bathrobe.</p>
<p>Rashelle, shaking herself loose from the soldiers with contempt,
pointed to Hummin and said to Seldon, “Who is this?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “It is Chetter Hummin, a friend of mine and my protector
on this planet.”</p>
<p>“Your protector?” Rashelle laughed madly. “You fool! You idiot! That
man is Demerzel and if you look at your Venabili woman, you will see
from her face that she is perfectly aware of that. You have been trapped
all along, far worse than ever you were with me!”</p>
