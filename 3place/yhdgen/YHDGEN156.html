<h4 id="section">18</h4>
<p>Dors was right. Breakfast was by no means bad. There was something
that was unmistakably eggy and the meat was pleasantly smoked. The
chocolate drink (Trantor was strong on chocolate and Seldon did not mind
that) was probably synthetic, but it was tasty and the breakfast rolls
were good.</p>
<p>He felt it only right to say as much. “This has been a very pleasant
breakfast. Food. Surroundings. Everything.”</p>
<p>“I’m delighted you think so,” said Dors.</p>
<p>Seldon looked about. There were a bank of windows in one wall and
while actual sunlight did not enter (he wondered if, after a while, he
would learn to be satisfied with diffuse daylight and would cease to
look for patches of sunlight in a room), the place was light enough. In
fact, it was quite bright, for the local weather computer had apparently
decided it was time for a sharp, clear day.</p>
<p>The tables were arranged for four apiece and most were occupied by
the full number, but Dors and Seldon remained alone at theirs. Dors had
called over some of the men and women and had introduced them. All had
been polite, but none had joined them. Undoubtedly, Dors intended that
to be so, but Seldon did not see how she managed to arrange it.</p>
<p>He said, “You haven’t introduced me to any mathematicians, Dors.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen any that I know. Most mathematicians start the day
early and have classes by eight. My own feeling is that any student so
foolhardy as to take mathematics wants to get that part of the course
over with as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“I take it you’re not a mathematician yourself.”</p>
<p>“Anything but,” said Dors with a short laugh. “Anything. History is
my field. I’ve already published some studies on the rise of Trantor—I
mean the primitive kingdom, not this world. I suppose that will end up
as my field of specialization—Royal Trantor.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Wonderful?” Dors looked at him quizzically. “Are you interested in
Royal Trantor too?”</p>
<p>“In a way, yes. That and other things like that. I’ve never really
studied history and I should have.”</p>
<p>“Should you? If you had studied history, you’d scarcely have had time
to study mathematics and mathematicians are very much needed—especially
at this University. We’re full to here with historians,” she said,
raising her hand to her eyebrows, “and economists and political
scientists, but we’re short on science and mathematics. Chetter Hummin
pointed that out to me once. He called it the decline of science and
seemed to think it was a general phenomenon.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Of course, when I say I should have studied history, I
don’t mean that I should have made it a life work. I meant I should have
studied enough to help me in my mathematics. My field of specialization
is the mathematical analysis of social structure.”</p>
<p>“Sounds horrible.”</p>
<p>“In a way, it is. It’s very complicated and without my knowing a
great deal more about how societies evolved it’s hopeless. My picture is
too static, you see.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see because I know nothing about it. Chetter told me you
were developing something called psychohistory and that it was
important. Have I got it right? Psychohistory?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I should have called it ‘psychosociology,’ but it
seemed to me that was too ugly a word. Or perhaps I knew instinctively
that a knowledge of history was necessary and then didn’t pay sufficient
attention to my thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory does sound better, but I don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>“I scarcely do myself.” He brooded a few minutes, looking at the
woman on the other side of the table and feeling that she might make
this exile of his seem a little less like an exile. He thought of the
other woman he had known a few years ago, but blocked it off with a
determined effort. If he ever found another companion, it would have to
be one who understood scholarship and what it demanded of a person.</p>
<p>To get his mind onto a new track, he said, “Chetter Hummin told me
that the University is in no way troubled by the government.”</p>
<p>“He’s right.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “That seems rather unbelievably forbearing of
the Imperial government. The educational institutions on Helicon are by
no means so independent of governmental pressures.”</p>
<p>“Nor on Cinna. Nor on any Outworld, except perhaps for one or two of
the largest. Trantor is another matter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but why?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s the center of the Empire. The universities here have
enormous prestige. Professionals are turned out by any university
anywhere, but the administrators of the Empire—the high officials, the
countless millions of people who represent the tentacles of Empire
reaching into every corner of the Galaxy—are educated right here on
Trantor.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen the statistics—” began Seldon.</p>
<p>“Take my word for it. It is important that the officials of the
Empire have some common ground, some special feeling for the Empire. And
they can’t all be native Trantorians or else the Outworlds would grow
restless. For that reason, Trantor must attract millions of Outworlders
for education here. It doesn’t matter where they come from or what their
home accent or culture may be, as long as they pick up the Trantorian
patina and identify themselves with a Trantorian educational background.
That’s what holds the Empire together. The Outworlds are also less
restive when a noticeable portion of the administrators who represent
the Imperial government are their own people by birth and
upbringing.”</p>
<p>Seldon felt embarrassed again. This was something he had never given
any thought to. He wondered if anyone could be a truly great
mathematician if mathematics was all he knew. He said, “Is this common
knowledge?”</p>
<p>“I suppose it isn’t,” said Dors after some thought. “There’s so much
knowledge to be had that specialists cling to their specialties as a
shield against having to know anything about anything else. They avoid
being drowned.”</p>
<p>“Yet you know it.”</p>
<p>“But that’s my specialty. I’m a historian who deals with the rise of
Royal Trantor and this administrative technique was one of the ways in
which Trantor spread its influence and managed the transition from Royal
Trantor to Imperial Trantor.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, almost as though muttering to himself, “How harmful
overspecialization is. It cuts knowledge at a million points and leaves
it bleeding.”</p>
<p>Dors shrugged. “What can one do? —But you see, if Trantor is going to
attract Outworlders to Trantorian universities, it has to give them
something in return for uprooting themselves and going to a strange
world with an incredibly artificial structure and unusual ways. I’ve
been here two years and I’m still not used to it. I may never get used
to it. But then, of course, I don’t intend to be an administrator, so
I’m not forcing myself to be a Trantorian.</p>
<p>“And what Trantor offers in exchange is not only the promise of a
position with high status, considerable power, and money, of course, but
also freedom. While students are having their education, they are free
to denounce the government, demonstrate against it peace fully, work out
their own theories and points of view. They enjoy that and many come
here so that they can experience the sensation of liberty.”</p>
<p>“I imagine,” said Seldon, “that it helps relieve pressure as well.
They work off all their resentments, enjoy all the smug
self-satisfaction a young revolutionary would have, and by the time they
take their place in the Imperial hierarchy, they are ready to settle
down into conformity and obedience.”</p>
<p>Dors nodded. “You may be right. In any case, the government, for all
these reasons, carefully preserves the freedom of the universities. It’s
not a matter of their being forbearing at all—only clever.”</p>
<p>“And if you’re not going to be an administrator, Dors, what are you
going to be?”</p>
<p>“A historian. I’ll teach, put book-films of my own into the
programming.”</p>
<p>“Not much status, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Not much money, Hari, which is more important. As for status, that’s
the sort of push and pull I’d just as soon avoid. I’ve seen many people
with status, but I’m still looking for a happy one. Status won’t sit
still under you; you have to continually fight to keep from sinking.
Even Emperors manage to come to bad ends most of the time. Someday I may
just go back to Cinna and be a professor.”</p>
<p>“And a Trantorian education will give you status.”</p>
<p>Dors laughed. “I suppose so, but on Cinna who would care? It’s a dull
world, full of farms and with lots of cattle, both four-legged and
two-legged.”</p>
<p>“Won’t you find it dull after Trantor?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I’m counting on. And if it gets too dull, I can
always wangle a grant to go here or there to do a little historical
research. That’s the advantage of my field.”</p>
<p>“A mathematician, on the other hand,” said Seldon with a trace of
bitterness at something that had never before bothered him, “is expected
to sit at his computer and think. And speaking of computers—” He
hesitated. Breakfast was done and it seemed to him more than likely she
had some duties of her own to attend to.</p>
<p>But she did not seem to be in any great hurry to leave. “Yes?
Speaking of computers?”</p>
<p>“Would I be able to get permission to use the history library?”</p>
<p>Now it was she who hesitated. “I think that can be arranged. If you
work on mathematics programming, you’ll probably be viewed as a
quasi-member of the faculty and I could ask for you to be given
permission. Only—”</p>
<p>“Only?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but you’re a mathematician and
you say you know nothing about history. Would you know how to make use
of a history library?”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “I suppose you use computers very much like those in a
mathematics library.”</p>
<p>“We do, but the programming for each specialty has quirks of its own.
You don’t know the standard reference book-films, the quick methods of
winnowing and skipping. You may be able to find a hyperbolic interval in
the dark …”</p>
<p>“You mean hyperbolic integral,” interrupted Seldon softly.</p>
<p>Dors ignored him. “But you probably won’t know how to get the terms
of the Treaty of Poldark in less than a day and a half.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I could learn.”</p>
<p>“If … if …” She looked a little troubled. “If you want to, I can make
a suggestion. I give a week’s course—one hour each day, no credit—on
library use. It’s for undergraduates. Would you feel it beneath your
dignity to sit in on such a course—with undergraduates, I mean? It
starts in three weeks.”</p>
<p>“You could give me private lessons.” Seldon felt a little surprised
at the suggestive tone that had entered his voice.</p>
<p>She did not miss it. “I dare say I could, but I think you’d be better
off with more formal instruction. We’ll be using the library, you
understand, and at the end of the week you will be asked to locate
information on particular items of historical interest. You will be
competing with the other students all through and that will help you
learn. Private tutoring will be far less efficient, I assure you.
However, I understand the difficulty of competing with undergraduates.
If you don’t do as well as they, you may feel humiliated. You must
remember, though, that they have already studied elementary history and
you, perhaps, may not have.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t. No ‘may’ about it. But I won’t be afraid to compete and I
won’t mind any humiliation that may come along—if I manage to learn the
tricks of the historical reference trade.”</p>
<p>It was clear to Seldon that he was beginning to like this young woman
and that he was gladly seizing on the chance to be educated by her. He
was also aware of the fact that he had reached a turning point in his
mind.</p>
<p>He had promised Hummin to attempt to work out a practical
psychohistory, but that had been a promise of the mind and not the
emotions. Now he was determined to seize psychohistory by the throat—if
he had to—in order to make it practical. That, perhaps, was the
influence of Dors Venabili.</p>
<p>Or had Hummin counted on that? Hummin, Seldon decided, might well be
a most formidable person.</p>
