<p>TABLE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Two days had passed and Gendibal found himself not so much
heavy-hearted as enraged. There was no reason why there could not have
been an immediate hearing. Had he been unprepared—had he needed
time—they would have forced an immediate hearing on him, he was
sure.</p>
<p>But since there was nothing more facing the Second Foundation than
the greatest crisis since the Mule, they wasted time—and to no purpose
but to irritate him.</p>
<p>They did irritate him and, by Seldon, that would make his
counterstroke the heavier. He was determined on that.</p>
<p>He looked about him. The anteroom was empty. It had been like that
for two days now. He was a marked man, a Speaker whom all knew would—by
means of an action unprecedented in the five-century history of the
Second Foundation—soon lose his position. He would be demoted to the
ranks, demoted to the position of a Second Foundationer, plain and
simple.</p>
<p>It was one thing, however—and a very honored thing—to be a Second
Foundationer of the ranks, particularly if one held a respectable title,
as Gendibal might even after the impeachment. It would be quite another
thing to have once been a Speaker and to have been demoted.</p>
<p>It won’t happen though, thought Gendibal savagely, even though for
two days he had been avoided. Only Sura Novi treated him as before, but
she was too naïve to understand the situation. To her, Gendibal was
still “Master.”</p>
<p>It irritated Gendibal that he found a certain comfort in this. He
felt ashamed when he began to notice that his spirits rose when he
noticed her gazing at him worshipfully. Was he becoming grateful for
gifts that small?</p>
<p>A clerk emerged from the Chamber to tell him that the Table was ready
for him and Gendibal stalked in. The clerk was one Gendibal knew well;
he was one who knew—to the tiniest fraction—the precise gradation of
civility that each Speaker deserved. At the moment, that accorded
Gendibal was appallingly low. Even the clerk thought him as good as
convicted.</p>
<p>They were all sitting about the Table gravely, wearing the black
robes of judgment. First Speaker Shandess looked a bit uncomfortable,
but he did not allow his face to crease into the smallest touch of
friendliness. Delarmi—one of the three Speakers who were women—did not
even look at him.</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “Speaker Stor Gendibal, you have been
impeached for behaving in a manner unbecoming a Speaker. You have,
before us all, accused the Table—vaguely and without evidence—of treason
and attempted murder. You have implied that all Second
Foundationers—including the Speakers and the First Speaker—require a
thorough mental analysis to ascertain who among them are no longer to be
trusted. Such behaviour breaks the bonds of community, without which the
Second Foundation cannot control an intricate and potentially hostile
Galaxy and without which they cannot build, with surety, a viable Second
Empire.</p>
<p>“Since we have all witnessed those offenses, we will forego the
presentation of a formal case for the prosecution. We will therefore
move directly to the next stage. Speaker Stor Gendibal, do you have a
defense?”</p>
<p>Now Delarmi—still not looking at him—allowed herself a small catlike
smile.</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “If truth be considered a defense, I have one. There
are grounds for suspecting a breach of security. That breach may involve
the mental control of one or more Second Foundationers—not excluding
members here present—and this has created a deadly crisis for the Second
Foundation. If, indeed, you hasten this trial because you cannot waste
time, you may all perhaps dimly recognize the seriousness of the crisis,
but in that case, why have you wasted two days after I had formally
requested an immediate trial? I submit that it is this deadly crisis
that has forced me to say what I have said. I would have behaved in a
manner unbecoming a Speaker—had I not done so.”</p>
<p>“He but repeats the offense, First Speaker,” said Delarmi softly.</p>
<p>Gendibal’s seat was further removed from the Table than that of the
others—a clear demotion already. He pushed it farther back, as though he
cared nothing for that, and rose.</p>
<p>He said, “Will you convict me now, out of hand, in defiance of law—or
may I present my defense in detail?”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “This is not a lawless assemblage, Speaker.
Without much in the way of precedent to guide us, we will lean in your
direction, recognizing that if our too-human abilities should cause us
to deviate from absolute justice, it is better to allow the guilty to go
free than to convict the innocent. Therefore, although the case before
us is so grave that we may not lightly allow the guilty to go free, we
will permit you to present your case in such manner as you wish and for
as long as you require, until it is decided by unanimous vote, including
my own” (and he raised his voice at that phrase) “that enough has been
heard.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Let me begin, then, by saying that Golan Trevize—the
First Foundationer who has been driven from Terminus and whom the First
Speaker and I believe to be the knife-edge of the gathering crisis—has
moved off in an unexpected direction.”</p>
<p>“Point of information,” said Delarmi softly. “How does the speaker”
(the intonation clearly indicated that the word was not capitalized)
“know this?”</p>
<p>“I was informed of this by the First Speaker,” said Gendibal, “but I
confirm it of my own knowledge. Under the circumstances, however,
considering my suspicions concerning the level of the security of the
Chamber, I must be allowed to keep my sources of information
secret.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “I will suspend judgment on that. Let us
proceed without that item of information but if, in the judgment of the
Table, the information must be obtained, Speaker Gendibal will have to
yield it.”</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “If the speaker does not yield the information now, it
is only fair to say that I assume he has an agent serving him—an agent
who is privately employed by him and who is not responsible to the Table
generally. We cannot be sure that such an agent is obeying the rules of
behavior governing Second Foundation personnel.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said with some displeasure, “I see all the
implications, Speaker Delarmi. There is no need to spell them out for
me.”</p>
<p>“I merely mention it for the record, First Speaker, since this
aggravates the offense and it is not an item mentioned in the bill of
impeachment, which, I would like to say, has not been read in full and
to which I move this item be added.”</p>
<p>“The clerk is directed to add the item,” said the First Speaker, “and
the precise wording will be adjusted at the appropriate time. —Speaker
Gendibal” (he, at least, capitalized) “your defense is indeed a step
backward. Continue.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Not only has this Trevize moved in an unexpected
direction, but at an unprecedented speed. My information, which the
First Speaker does not yet have, is that he has traveled nearly ten
thousand parsecs in well under an hour.”</p>
<p>“In a single Jump?” said one of the Speakers incredulously.</p>
<p>“In over two dozen Jumps, one after the other, with virtually no time
intervening,” said Gendibal, “something that is even more difficult to
imagine than a single Jump. Even if he is now located, it will take time
to follow him and, if he detects us and really means to flee us, we will
not be able to overtake him. —And you spend your time in games of
impeachment and allow two days to pass so that you might savor them the
more.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker managed to mask his anguish. “Please tell us,
Speaker Gendibal, what you think the significance of this might be.”</p>
<p>“It is an indication, First Speaker, of the technological advances
that are being made by the First Foundation, who are far more powerful
now than they were in the time of Preem Palver. We could not stand up
against them if they found us and were free to act.”</p>
<p>Speaker Delarmi rose to her feet. She said, “First Speaker, our time
is being wasted with irrelevancies. We are not children to be frightened
with tales by Grandmother Spacewarp. It does not matter how impressive
the machinery of the First Foundation is when, in any crisis, their
minds will be in our control.”</p>
<p>“What do you have to say to that, Speaker Gendibal?” asked the First
Speaker.</p>
<p>“Merely that we will come to the matter of minds in due course. For
the moment, I merely wish to stress the superior—and
increasing—technological might of the First Foundation.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “Pass on to the next point, Speaker Gendibal.
Your first point, I must tell you, does not impress me as very pertinent
to the matter contained in the bill of impeachment.”</p>
<p>There was a clear gesture of agreement from the Table generally.</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “I pass on. Trevize has a companion in his present
journey” (he paused momentarily to consider pronunciation) “one Janov
Pelorat, a rather ineffectual scholar who has devoted his life to
tracking down myths and legends concerning Earth.”</p>
<p>“You know all this about him? Your hidden source, I presume?” said
Delarmi, who had settled into her role of prosecutor with a clear
feeling of comfort.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know all this about him,” said Gendibal stolidly. “A few
months ago, the Mayor of Terminus, an energetic and capable woman, grew
interested in this scholar for no clear reason, and so I grew
interested, too, as a matter of course. Nor have I kept this to myself.
All the information I have gained has been made available to the First
Speaker.”</p>
<p>“I bear witness to that,” said the First Speaker in a low voice.</p>
<p>An elderly Speaker said, “What is this Earth? Is it the world of
origin we keep coming across in fables? The one they made a fuss about
in old Imperial times?”</p>
<p>Gendibal nodded. “In the tales of Grandmother Spacewarp, as Speaker
Delarmi would say. —I suspect it was Pelorat’s dream to come to Trantor
to consult the Galactic Library, in order to find information concerning
Earth that he could not obtain in the interstellar library service
available on Terminus.</p>
<p>“When he left Terminus with Trevize, he must have been under the
impression that that dream was to be fulfilled. Certainly we were
expecting the two and counted on having the opportunity to examine
them—to our own profit. As it turns out—and as you all know by now—they
are not coming. They have turned off to some destination that is not yet
clear and for some reason that is not yet known.”</p>
<p>Delarmi’s round face looked positively cherubic as she said, “And why
is this disturbing? We are no worse off for their absence, surely.
Indeed, since they dismiss us so easily, we can deduce that the First
Foundation does not know the true nature of Trantor and we can applaud
the handiwork of Preem Palver.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “If we thought no further, we might indeed come to
such a comforting solution. Could it be, though, that the turnoff was
not the result of any failure to see the importance of Trantor? Could it
be that the turnoff resulted from anxiety lest Trantor, by examining
these two men, see the importance of Earth?”</p>
<p>There was a stir about the Table.</p>
<p>“Anyone,” said Delarmi coldly, “can invent formidable-sounding
propositions and couch them in balanced sentences. But do they make
sense when you do invent them? Why should anyone care what we of the
Second Foundation think of Earth? Whether it is the true planet of
origin, or whether it is a myth, or whether there is no one place of
origin to begin with, is surely something that should interest only
historians, anthropologists, and folk-tale collectors, such as this
Pelorat of yours. Why us?”</p>
<p>“Why indeed?” said Gendibal. “How is it, then, that there are no
references to Earth in the Library?”</p>
<p>For the first time, something in the atmosphere that was other than
hostility made itself felt about the Table.</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “Aren’t there?”</p>
<p>Gendibal said quite calmly, “When word first reached me that Trevize
and Pelorat might be coming here in search of information concerning
Earth, I, as a matter of course, had our Library computer make a listing
of documents containing such information. I was mildly interested when
it turned up nothing. Not minor quantities. Not very little.
—Nothing!</p>
<p>“But then you insisted I wait for two days before this hearing could
take place, and at the same time, my curiosity was further piqued by the
news that the First Foundationers were not coming here after all. I had
to amuse myself somehow. While the rest of you therefore were, as the
saying goes, sipping wine while the house was falling, I went through
some history books in my own possession. I came across passages that
specifically mentioned some of the investigations on the ‘Origin
Question’ in late-Imperial times. Particular documents—both printed and
filmed—were referred to and quoted from. I returned to the Library and
made a personal check for those documents. I assure you there was
nothing.”</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “Even if this is so, it need not be surprising. If
Earth is indeed a myth—”</p>
<p>“Then I would find it in mythological references. If it were a story
of Grandmother Spacewarp, I would find it in the collected tales of
Grandmother Spacewarp. If it were a figment of the diseased mind, I
would find it under psychopathology. The fact is that something about
Earth exists or you would not all have heard of it and, indeed,
immediately recognized it as the name of the putative planet of origin
of the human species. Why, then, is there no reference to it in the
Library, anywhere?”</p>
<p>Delarmi was silent for a moment and another Speaker interposed. He
was Leonis Cheng, a rather small man with an encyclopedic knowledge of
the minutiae of the Seldon Plan and a rather myopic attitude toward the
actual Galaxy. His eyes tended to blink rapidly when he spoke.</p>
<p>He said, “It is well known that the Empire in its final days
attempted to create an Imperial mystique by soft-pedaling all interest
in pre-Imperial times.”</p>
<p>Gendibal nodded. “Soft-pedaled is the precise term, Speaker Cheng.
That is not equivalent to destroying evidence. As you should know better
than anyone, another characteristic of Imperial decay was a sudden
interest in earlier—and presumably better—times. I have just referred to
the interest in the ‘Origin Question’ in Hari Seldon’s time.”</p>
<p>Cheng interrupted with a formidable clearing of the throat. “I know
this very well, young man, and know far more of these social problems of
Imperial decay than you seem to think I do. The process of
‘Imperialization’ overtook these dilettantish games concerning Earth.
Under Cleon II, during the Empire’s last resurgence, two centuries after
Seldon, Imperialization reached its peak and all speculation on the
question of Earth came to an end. There was even a directive in Cleon’s
time concerning this, referring to the interest in such things as (and I
think I quote it correctly) ‘stale and unproductive speculation that
tends to undermine the people’s love of the Imperial throne.’”</p>
<p>Gendibal smiled. “Then it was in the time of Cleon II, Speaker Cheng,
that you would place the destruction of all reference to Earth?”</p>
<p>“I draw no conclusions. I have simply stated what I have stated.”</p>
<p>“It is shrewd of you to draw no conclusions. By Cleon’s time, the
Empire may have been resurgent, but the University and Library, at
least, were in our hands or, at any rate, in those of our predecessors.
It would have been impossible for any material to be removed from the
Library without the Speakers of the Second Foundation knowing it. In
fact, it would have been the Speakers to whom the task would have had to
be entrusted, though the dying Empire would not have known that.”</p>
<p>Gendibal paused, but Cheng, saying nothing, looked over the other’s
head.</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “It follows that the Library could not have been
emptied of material on Earth during Seldon’s time, since the ‘Origin
Question’ was then an active preoccupation. It could not have been
emptied afterward because the Second Foundation was in charge. Yet the
Library is empty of it now. How can this be?”</p>
<p>Delarmi broke in impatiently, “You may stop weaving the dilemma,
Gendibal. We see it. What is it that you suggest as a solution? That you
have removed the documents yourself?”</p>
<p>“As usual, Delarmi, you penetrate to the heart.” And Gendibal bent
his head to her in sardonic respect (at which she allowed herself a
slight lifting of the lip). “One solution is that the cleansing was done
by a Speaker of the Second Foundation, someone who would know how to use
curators without leaving a memory behind—and computers without leaving a
record behind.”</p>
<p>First Speaker Shandess turned red. “Ridiculous, Speaker Gendibal. I
cannot imagine a Speaker doing this. What would the motivation be? Even
if, for some reason, the material on Earth were removed, why keep it
from the rest of the Table? Why risk a complete destruction of one’s
career by tampering with the Library when the chances of its being
discovered are so great? Besides, I don’t think that even the most
skillful Speaker could perform the task without leaving a trace.”</p>
<p>“Then it must be, First Speaker, that you disagree with Speaker
Delarmi in her suggestion that I did it.”</p>
<p>“I certainly do,” said the First Speaker. “Sometimes I doubt your
judgment, but I have yet to consider you downright insane.”</p>
<p>“Then it must never have happened, First Speaker. The material on
Earth must still be in the Library, for we now seem to have eliminated
all the possible ways in which it could have been removed—and yet the
material is not there.”</p>
<p>Delarmi said with an affectation of weariness, “Well well, let us
finish. Again, what is it you suggest as a solution? I am sure you think
you have one.”</p>
<p>“If you are sure, Speaker, we may all be sure as well. My suggestion
is that the Library was cleansed by someone of the Second Foundation who
was under the control of a subtle force from outside the Second
Foundation. The cleansing went unnoticed because that same force saw to
it that it was not noticed.”</p>
<p>Delarmi laughed. “Until you found out. You—the uncontrolled and
uncontrollable. If this mysterious force existed, how did you find out
about the absence of material from the Library? Why weren’t you
controlled?”</p>
<p>Gendibal said gravely, “It’s not a laughing matter, Speaker. They may
feel, as we feel, that all tampering should be held to a minimum. When
my life was in danger a few days ago, I was more concerned with
refraining from fiddling with a Hamish mind than with protecting myself.
So it might be with these others—as soon as they felt it was safe they
ceased tampering. That is the danger, the deadly danger. The fact that I
could find out what has happened may mean they no longer care that I do.
The fact that they no longer care may mean that they feel they have
already won. And we continue to play our games here!”</p>
<p>“But what aim do they have in all this? What conceivable aim?”
demanded Delarmi, shuffling her feet and biting her lips. She felt her
power fading as the Table grew more interested—concerned—</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Consider—The First Foundation, with its enormous
arsenal of physical power, is searching for Earth. They pretend to send
out two exiles, hoping we will think that is all they are, but would
they equip them with ships of unbelievable power—ships that can move ten
thousand parsecs in less than an hour—if that was all that they
were?</p>
<p>“As for the Second Foundation, we have not been searching for Earth
and, clearly, steps have been taken without our knowledge to keep any
information of Earth away from us. The First Foundation is now so close
to finding Earth and we are so far from doing so, that—”</p>
<p>Gendibal paused and Delarmi said, “That what? Finish your childish
tale. Do you know anything or don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know everything, Speaker. I have not penetrated the total
depth of the web that is encircling us, but I know the web is there. I
don’t know what the significance of finding Earth might be, but I am
certain the Second Foundation is in enormous danger and, with it, the
Seldon Plan and the future of all humanity.”</p>
<p>Delarmi rose to her feet. She was not smiling and she spoke in a
tense but tightly controlled voice. “Trash! First Speaker, put an end to
this! What is at issue is the accused’s behavior. What he tells us is
not only childish but irrelevant. He cannot extenuate his behavior by
building a cobwebbery of theories that makes sense only in his own mind.
I call for a vote on the matter now—a unanimous vote for
conviction.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” said Gendibal sharply. “I have been told I would have an
opportunity to defend myself, and there remains one more item—one more.
Let me present that, and you may proceed to a vote with no further
objection from me.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker rubbed his eyes wearily. “You may continue, Speaker
Gendibal. Let me point out to the Table that the conviction of an
impeached Speaker is so weighty and, indeed, unprecedented an action
that we dare not give the appearance of not allowing a full defense.
Remember, too, that even if the verdict satisfies us, it may not satisfy
those who come after us, and I cannot believe that a Second Foundationer
of any level—let alone the Speakers of the Table—would not have a full
appreciation of the importance of historical perspective. Let us so act
that we can be certain of the approval of the Speakers who will follow
us in the coming centuries.”</p>
<p>Delarmi said bitterly, “We run the risk, First Speaker, of having
posterity laugh at us for belaboring the obvious. To continue the
defense is your decision.”</p>
<p>Gendibal drew a deep breath. “In line with your decision, then, First
Speaker, I wish to call a witness—a young woman I met three days ago and
without whom I might not have reached the Table meeting at all, instead
of merely being late.”</p>
<p>“Is the woman you speak of known to the Table?” asked the First
Speaker.</p>
<p>“No, First Speaker. She is native to this planet.”</p>
<p>Delarmi’s eyes opened wide. “A Hamishwoman?”</p>
<p>“Indeed! Just so!”</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “What have we to do with one of those? Nothing they say
can be of any importance. They don’t exist!”</p>
<p>Gendibal’s lips drew back tightly over his teeth in something that
could not possibly have been mistaken for a smile. He said sharply,
“Physically all the Hamish exist. They are human beings and play their
part in Seldon’s Plan. In their indirect protection of the Second
Foundation, they play a crucial part. I wish to dissociate myself from
Speaker Delarmi’s inhumanity and hope that her remark will be retained
in the record and be considered hereafter as evidence for her possible
unfitness for the position of Speaker. —Will the rest of the Table agree
with the Speaker’s incredible remark and deprive me of my witness?”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “Call your witness, Speaker.”</p>
<p>Gendibal’s lips relaxed into the normal expressionless features of a
Speaker under pressure. His mind was guarded and fenced in, but behind
this protective barrier, he felt that the danger point had passed and
that he had won.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sura Novi looked strained. her eyes were wide and her lower lip was
faintly trembling. Her hands were slowly clenching and unclenching and
her chest was heaving slightly. Her hair had been pulled back and
braided into a bun; her sun-darkened face twitched now and then. Her
hands fumbled at the pleats of her long skirt. She looked hastily around
the Table—from Speaker to Speaker—her wide eyes filled with awe.</p>
<p>They glanced back at her with varying degrees of contempt and
discomfort. Delarmi kept her eyes well above the top of Novi’s head,
oblivious to her presence.</p>
<p>Carefully Gendibal touched the skin of her mind, soothing and
relaxing it. He might have done the same by patting her hand or stroking
her cheek, but here, under these circumstances, that was impossible, of
course.</p>
<p>He said, “First Speaker, I am numbing this woman’s conscious
awareness so that her testimony will not be distorted by fear. Will you
please observe—will the rest of you, if you wish, join me and observe
that I will, in no way, modify her mind?”</p>
<p>Novi had started back in terror at Gendibal’s voice, and Gendibal was
not surprised at that. He realized that she had never heard Second
Foundationers of high rank speak among themselves. She had never
experienced that odd swift combination of sound, tone, expression and
thought. The terror, however, faded as quickly as it came, as he gentled
her mind.</p>
<p>A look of placidity crossed her face.</p>
<p>“There is a chair behind you, Novi,” Gendibal said. “Please sit
down.”</p>
<p>Novi curtsied in a small and clumsy manner and sat down, holding
herself stiffly.</p>
<p>She talked quite clearly, but Gendibal made her repeat when her
Hamish accent became too thick. And because he kept his own speech
formal in deference to the Table, he occasionally had to repeat his own
questions to her.</p>
<p>The tale of the fight between himself and Rufirant was described
quietly and well.</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Did you see all this yourself, Novi?”</p>
<p>“Nay, Master, or I would have sooner-stopped it. Rufirant be good
fellow, but not quick in head.”</p>
<p>“But you described it all. How is that possible if you did not see it
all?”</p>
<p>“Rufirant be telling me thereof, on questioning. He be ashamed.”</p>
<p>“Ashamed? Have you ever known him to behave in this manner in earlier
times?”</p>
<p>“Rufirant? Nay, Master. He be gentle, though he be large. He be no
fighter and he be afeared of scowlers. He say often they are mighty and
possessed of power.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he feel this way when he met me?”</p>
<p>“It be strange. It be not understood.” She shook her head. “He be not
his ain self. I said to him, ‘Thou blubber-head. Be it your place to
assault scowler?’ And he said, ‘I know not how it happened. It be like I
am to one side, standing and watching not-I.’”</p>
<p>Speaker Cheng interrupted. “First Speaker, of what value is it to
have this woman report what a man has told her? Is not the man available
for questioning?”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “He is. If, on completion of this woman’s testimony,
the Table wishes to hear more evidence, I will be ready to call Karoll
Rufirant—my recent antagonist—to the stand. If not, the Table can move
directly to judgment when I am done with this witness.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said the First Speaker. “Proceed with your witness.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “And you, Novi? Was it like you to interfere in a
fight in this manner?”</p>
<p>Novi did not say anything for a moment. A small frown appeared
between her thick eyebrows and then disappeared. She said, “I know not.
I wish no harm to scowlers. I be driven, and without thought I
in-middled myself.” A pause, then, “I be do it over if need arise.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Novi, you will sleep now. You will think of nothing.
You will rest and you will not even dream.”</p>
<p>Novi mumbled for a moment. Her eyes closed and her head fell back
against the headrest of her chair.</p>
<p>Gendibal waited a moment, then said, “First Speaker, with respect,
follow me into this woman’s mind. You will find it remarkably simple and
symmetrical, which is fortunate, for what you will see might not have
been visible otherwise. —Here—here! Do you observe? —If the rest of you
will enter—it will be easier if it is done one at a time.”</p>
<p>There was a rising buzz about the Table.</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Is there any doubt among you?”</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “I doubt it, for—” She paused on the brink of what
was—even for her—unsayable.</p>
<p>Gendibal said it for her. “You think I deliberately tampered with
this mind in order to present false evidence? You think, therefore, that
I am capable of bringing about so delicate an adjustment—one mental
fiber clearly out of shape with nothing about it or its surroundings
that is in the least disturbed? If I could do that, what need would I
have to deal with any of you in this manner? Why subject myself to the
indignity of a trial? Why labor to convince you? If I could do what is
visible in this woman’s mind, you would all be helpless before me unless
you were well prepared. —The blunt fact is that none of you could
manipulate a mind as this woman’s has been manipulated. Neither can I.
Yet it has been done.”</p>
<p>He paused, looking at all the Speakers in turn, then fixing his gaze
on Delarmi. He spoke slowly. “Now, if anything more is required, I will
call in the Hamish farmer, Karoll Rufirant, whom I have examined and
whose mind has also been tampered with in this manner.”</p>
<p>“That will not be necessary,” said the First Speaker, who was wearing
an appalled expression. “What we have seen is mindshaking.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Gendibal, “may I rouse this Hamishwoman and
dismiss her? I have arranged for there to be those outside who will see
to her recovery.”</p>
<p>When Novi had left, directed by Gendibal’s gentle hold on her elbow,
he said, “Let me quickly summarize. Minds can be—and have been—altered
in ways that are beyond our power. In this way, the curators themselves
could have been influenced to remove Earth material from the
Library—without our knowledge or their own. We see how it was arranged
that I should be delayed in arriving at a meeting of the Table. I was
threatened; I was rescued. The result was that I was impeached. The
result of this apparently natural concatenation of events is that I may
be removed from a position of power—and the course of action which I
champion and which threatens these people, whoever they are, may be
negated.”</p>
<p>Delarmi leaned forward. She was clearly shaken. “If this secret
organization is so clever, how were you able to discover all this?”</p>
<p>Gendibal felt free to smile, now. “No credit to me,” he said. “I lay
no claim to expertise superior to that of other Speakers; certainly not
to the First Speaker. However, neither are these Anti-Mules—as the First
Speaker has rather engagingly called them—infinitely wise or infinitely
immune to circumstance. Perhaps they chose this particular Hamishwoman
as their instrument precisely because she needed very little adjustment.
She was, of her own character, sympathetic to what she calls ‘scholars,’
and admired them intensely.</p>
<p>“But then, once this was over, her momentary contact with me
strengthened her fantasy of becoming a ‘scholar’ herself. She came to me
the next day with that purpose in mind. Curious at this peculiar
ambition of hers, I studied her mind—which I certainly would not
otherwise have done—and, more by accident than anything else, stumbled
upon the adjustment and noted its significance. Had another woman been
chosen—one with a less natural proscholar bias—the Anti-Mules might have
had to labor more at the adjustment, but the consequences might well not
have followed and I would have remained ignorant of all this. The
Anti-Mules miscalculated—or could not sufficiently allow for the
unforeseen. That they can stumble so is heartening.”</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “The First Speaker and you call this—organization—the
‘Anti-Mules,’ I presume, because they seem to labor to keep the Galaxy
in the path of the Seldon Plan, rather than to disrupt it as the Mule
himself did. If the Anti-Mules do this, why are they dangerous?”</p>
<p>“Why should they labor, if not for some purpose? We don’t know what
that purpose is. A cynic might say that they intend to step in at some
future time and turn the current in another direction, one that may
please them far more than it would please us. That is my own feeling,
even though I do not major in cynicism. Is Speaker Delarmi prepared to
maintain, out of the love and trust that we all know form so great a
part of her character, that these are cosmic altruists, doing our work
for us, without dream of reward?”</p>
<p>There was a gentle susurration of laughter about the Table at this
and Gendibal knew that he had won. And Delarmi knew that she had lost,
for there was a wash of rage that showed through her harsh mentalic
control like a momentary ray of ruddy sunlight through a thick canopy of
leaves.</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “When I first experienced the incident with the Hamish
farmer, I leaped to the conclusion that another Speaker was behind it.
When I noted the adjustment of the Hamishwoman’s mind, I knew that I was
right as to the plot but wrong as to the plotter. I apologize for the
misinterpretation and I plead the circumstances as an extenuation.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “I believe this may be construed as an
apology—”</p>
<p>Delarmi interrupted. She was quite placid again—her face was
friendly, her voice downright saccharine. “With total respect, First
Speaker, if I may interrupt— Let us drop this matter of impeachment. At
this moment, I would not vote for conviction and I imagine no one will.
I would even suggest the impeachment be stricken from the Speaker’s
unblemished record. Speaker Gendibal has exonerated himself ably. I
congratulate him on that—and for uncovering a crisis that the rest of us
might well have allowed to smolder on indefinitely, with incalculable
results. I offer the Speaker my wholehearted apologies for my earlier
hostility.”</p>
<p>She virtually beamed at Gendibal, who felt a reluctant admiration for
the manner in which she shifted direction instantly in order to cut her
losses. He also felt that all this was but preliminary to an attack from
a new direction.</p>
<p>He was certain that what was coming would not be pleasant.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>When she exerted herself to be charming, Speaker Delora Delarmi had a
way of dominating the Speaker’s Table. Her voice grew soft, her smile
indulgent, her eyes sparkling, all of her sweet. No one cared to
interrupt her and everyone waited for the blow to fall.</p>
<p>She said, “Thanks to Speaker Gendibal, I think we all now understand
what we must do. We do not see the Anti-Mules; we know nothing about
them, except for their fugitive touches on the minds of people right
here in the stronghold of the Second Foundation itself. We do not know
what the power center of the First Foundation is planning. We may face
an alliance of the Anti-Mules and the First Foundation. We don’t
know.</p>
<p>“We do know that this Golan Trevize and his companion, whose name
escapes me at the moment, are going we know not where—and that the First
Speaker and Gendibal feel that Trevize holds the key to the outcome of
this great crisis. What, then, are we to do? Clearly we must find out
everything we can about Trevize; where he is going, what he is thinking,
what his purpose may be; or, indeed, whether he has any destination, any
thought, any purpose; whether he might not, in fact, be a mere tool of a
force greater than he.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “He is under observation.”</p>
<p>Delarmi pursed her lips in an indulgent smile. “By whom? By one of
our outworld agents? Are such agents to be expected to stand against
those with the powers we have seen demonstrated here? Surely not. In the
Mule’s time, and later on, too, the Second Foundation did not hesitate
to send out—and even to sacrifice—volunteers from among the best we had,
since nothing less would do. When it was necessary to restore the Seldon
Plan, Preem Palver himself scoured the Galaxy as a Trantorian trader in
order to bring back that girl, Arkady. We cannot sit here and wait, now,
when the crisis may be greater than in either previous case. We cannot
rely on minor functionaries—watchers and messenger boys.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Surely you are not suggesting that the First Speaker
leave Trantor at this time?”</p>
<p>Delarmi said, “Certainly not. We need him badly here. On the other
hand, there is you, Speaker Gendibal. It is you who have correctly
sensed and weighed the crisis. It is you who detected the subtle outside
interference with the Library and with Hamish minds. It is you who have
maintained your views against the united opposition of the Table—and
won. No one here has seen as clearly as you have and no one can be
trusted, as you can, to continue to see clearly. It is you who must, in
my opinion, go out to confront the enemy. May I have the sense of the
Table?”</p>
<p>There was no formal vote needed to reveal that sense. Each Speaker
felt the minds of the others and it was clear to a suddenly appalled
Gendibal that, at the moment of his victory and Delarmi’s defeat, this
formidable woman was managing to send him irrevocably into exile on a
task that might occupy him for some indefinite period, while she
remained behind to control the Table and, therefore, the Second
Foundation and, therefore, the Galaxy—sending all alike, perhaps, to
their doom.</p>
<p>And if Gendibal-in-exile should, somehow, manage to gather the
information that would enable the Second Foundation to avert the
gathering crisis, it would be Delarmi who would have the credit for
having arranged it, and his success would but confirm her power. The
quicker Gendibal would be, the more efficiently he succeeded, the more
surely he would confirm her power.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful maneuver, an unbelievable recovery.</p>
<p>And so clearly was she dominating the Table even now that she was
virtually usurping the First Speaker’s role. Gendibal’s thought to that
effect was overtaken by the rage he sensed from the First Speaker.</p>
<p>He turned. The First Speaker was making no effort to hide his
anger—and it soon was clear that another internal crisis was building to
replace the one that had been resolved.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Quindor Shandess, the twenty-fifth first Speaker, had no
extraordinary illusions about himself.</p>
<p>He knew he was not one of those few dynamic First Speakers who had
illuminated the five-century-long history of the Second Foundation—but
then, he didn’t have to be. He controlled the Table in a quiet period of
Galactic prosperity and it was not a time for dynamism. It had seemed to
be a time to play a holding game and he had been the man for this role.
His predecessor had chosen him for that reason.</p>
<p>“You are not an adventurer, you are a scholar,” the twenty-fourth
First Speaker had said. “You will preserve the Plan, where an adventurer
might ruin it. Preserve! Let that be the key word for your Table.”</p>
<p>He had tried, but it had meant a passive First Speakership and this
had been, on occasion, interpreted as weakness. There had been recurrent
rumors that he meant to resign and there had been open intrigue to
assure the succession in one direction or another.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in Shandess’s mind that Delarmi had been a leader
in the fight. She was the strongest personality at the Table and even
Gendibal, with all the fire and folly of youth, retreated before her as
he was doing right now.</p>
<p>But, by Seldon, passive he might be, or even weak, but there was one
prerogative of the First Speaker that not one in the line had ever given
up, and neither would he do so.</p>
<p>He rose to speak and at once there was a hush about the Table. When
the First Speaker rose to speak, there could be no interruptions. Even
Delarmi or Gendibal would not dare to interrupt.</p>
<p>He said, “Speakers! I agree that we face a dangerous crisis and that
we must take strong measures. It is I who should go out to meet the
enemy. Speaker Delarmi, with the gentleness that characterizes her,
excuses me from the task by stating that I am needed here. The truth,
however, is that I am needed neither here nor there. I grow old; I grow
weary. There has long been expectation I would someday resign and
perhaps I ought to. When this crisis is successfully surmounted, I shall
resign.</p>
<p>“But, of course, it is the privilege of the First Speaker to choose
his successor. I am going to do so now. There is one Speaker who has
long dominated the proceedings of the Table; one Speaker who, by force
of personality, has often supplied the leadership that I could not. You
all know I am speaking of Speaker Delarmi.”</p>
<p>He paused, then said, “You alone, Speaker Gendibal, are registering
disapproval. May I ask why?” He sat down, so that Gendibal might have
the right to answer.</p>
<p>“I do not disapprove, First Speaker,” said Gendibal in a low voice.
“It is your prerogative to choose your successor.”</p>
<p>“And so I will. When you return—having succeeded in initiating the
process that will put an end to this crisis—it will be time for my
resignation. My successor will then be directly in charge of conducting
whatever policies may be required to carry on and complete that process.
—Do you have anything to say, Speaker Gendibal?”</p>
<p>Gendibal said quietly, “When you make Speaker Delarmi your successor,
First Speaker, I hope you will see fit to advise her to—”</p>
<p>The First Speaker interrupted him roughly. “I have spoken of Speaker
Delarmi, but I have not named her as my successor. Now what do you have
to say?”</p>
<p>“My apologies, First Speaker. I should have said, assuming you make
Speaker Delarmi your successor upon my return from this mission, would
you see fit to advise her to—”</p>
<p>“Nor will I make her my successor in the future, under any
conditions. Now what do you have to say?” The First Speaker was unable
to make this announcement without a stab of satisfaction at the blow he
was delivering to Delarmi. He could not have done it in a more
humiliating fashion.</p>
<p>“Well, Speaker Gendibal,” he said, “what do you have to say?”</p>
<p>“That I am confused.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker rose again. He said, “Speaker Delarmi has dominated
and led, but that is not all that is needed for the post of First
Speaker. Speaker Gendibal has seen what we have not seen. He has faced
the united hostility of the Table, and forced it to rethink matters, and
has dragged it into agreement with him. I have my suspicions as to the
motivation of Speaker Delarmi in placing the responsibility of the
pursuit of Golan Trevize on the shoulders of Speaker Gendibal, but that
is where the burden belongs. I know he will succeed—I trust my intuition
in this—and when he returns, Speaker Gendibal will become the
twenty-sixth First Speaker.”</p>
<p>He sat down abruptly and each Speaker began to make clear his opinion
in a bedlam of sound, tone, thought, and expression. The First Speaker
paid no attention to the cacophony but stared indifferently before him.
Now that it was done, he realized—with some surprise—the great comfort
there was in laying down the mantle of responsibility. He should have
done it before this—but he couldn’t have.</p>
<p>It was not till now that he had found his obvious successor.</p>
<p>And then, somehow, his mind caught that of Delarmi and he looked up
at her.</p>
<p>By Seldon! She was calm and smiling. Her desperate disappointment did
not show—she had not given up. He wondered if he had played into her
hands. What was there left for her to do?</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Delora Delarmi would Freely have shown her desperation and
disappointment, if that would have proven of any use whatever.</p>
<p>It would have given her a great deal of satisfaction to strike out at
that senile fool who controlled the Table or at that juvenile idiot with
whom Fortune had conspired—but satisfaction wasn’t what she wanted. She
wanted something more.</p>
<p>She wanted to be First Speaker.</p>
<p>And while there was a card left to play, she would play it.</p>
<p>She smiled gently, and managed to lift her hand as though she were
about to speak, and then held the pose just long enough to insure that
when she did speak, all would be not merely normal, but radiantly
quiet.</p>
<p>She said, “First Speaker, as Speaker Gendibal said earlier, I do not
disapprove. It is your prerogative to choose your successor. If I speak
now, it is in order that I may contribute—I hope—to the success of what
has now become Speaker Gendibal’s mission. May I explain my thoughts,
First Speaker?”</p>
<p>“Do so,” said the First Speaker curtly. She was entirely too smooth,
too pliant, it seemed to him.</p>
<p>Delarmi bent her head gravely. She no longer smiled. She said, “We
have ships. They are not as technologically magnificent as those of the
First Foundation, but they will carry Speaker Gendibal. He knows how to
pilot one, I believe, as do we all. We have our representatives on every
major planet in the Galaxy, and he will be welcomed everywhere.
Moreover, he can defend himself against even these Anti-Mules, now that
he is thoroughly aware of the danger. Even when we were unaware, I
suspect they have preferred to work through the lower classes and even
the Hamish farmers. We will, of course, thoroughly inspect the minds of
all the Second Foundationers, including the Speakers, but I am sure they
have remained inviolate. The Anti-Mules did not dare interfere with
us.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, there is no reason why Speaker Gendibal should risk
more than he must. He is not intending to engage in derring-do and it
will be best if his mission is to some extent disguised—if he takes them
unaware. It will be useful if he goes in the role of a Hamish trader.
Preem Palver, we all know, went off into the Galaxy as a supposed
trader.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “Preem Palver had a specific purpose in doing
so; Speaker Gendibal has not. If it appears a disguise of some sort is
necessary, I am sure he will be ingenious enough to adopt one.”</p>
<p>“With respect, First Speaker, I wish to point out a subtle disguise.
Preem Palver, you will remember, took with him his wife and companion of
many years. Nothing so thoroughly established the rustic nature of his
character as the fact that he was traveling with his wife. It allayed
all suspicion.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “I have no wife. I have had companions, but none who
would now volunteer to assume the marital role.”</p>
<p>“This is well known, Speaker Gendibal,” said Delarmi, “but then
people will take the role for granted if any woman is with you. Surely
some volunteer can be found. And if you feel the need to be able to
present documentary evidence, that can be provided. I think a woman
should come with you.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Gendibal was breathless. Surely she did not mean—</p>
<p>Could it be a ploy to achieve a share in the success? Could she be
playing for a joint—or rotating—occupation of the First Speakership?</p>
<p>Gendibal said grimly, “I am flattered that Speaker Delarmi should
feel that she—”</p>
<p>And Delarmi broke into an open laugh and looked at Gendibal with what
was almost true affection. He had fallen into the trap and looked
foolish for having done so. The Table would not forget that.</p>
<p>She said, “Speaker Gendibal, I would not have the impertinence to
attempt to share in this task. It is yours and yours alone, as the post
of First Speaker will be yours and yours alone. I would not have thought
you wanted me with you. Really, Speaker, at my age, I no longer think of
myself as a charmer—”</p>
<p>There were smiles around the Table and even the First Speaker tried
to hide one.</p>
<p>Gendibal felt the stroke and labored not to compound the loss by
failing to match her lightness. It was labor lost.</p>
<p>He said, as unsavagely as he could, “Then what is it you would
suggest? It was not in my thoughts, I assure you, that you would wish to
accompany me. You are at your best at the Table and not in the
hurly-burly of Galactic affairs, I know.”</p>
<p>“I agree, Speaker Gendibal, I agree,” said Delarmi. “My suggestion,
however, refers back to your role as Hamish trader. To make it
indisputably authentic, what better companion need you ask but a
Hamishwoman?”</p>
<p>“A Hamishwoman?” For a second time in rapid succession, Gendibal was
caught by surprise and the Table enjoyed it.</p>
<p>“The Hamishwoman,” Delarmi went on. “The one who saved you from a
beating. The one who gazes at you worshipfully. The one whose mind you
probed and who then, quite unwittingly, saved you a second time from
considerably more than a beating. I suggest you take her.”</p>
<p>Gendibal’s impulse was to refuse, but he knew that she expected that.
It would mean more enjoyment for the Table. It was clear now that the
First Speaker, anxious to strike out at Delarmi, had made a mistake by
naming Gendibal his successor—or, at the very least, that Delarmi had
quickly converted it into one.</p>
<p>Gendibal was the youngest of the Speakers. He had angered the Table
and had then avoided conviction by them. In a very real way, he had
humiliated them. None could see him as the heir apparent without
resentment.</p>
<p>That would have been hard enough to overcome, but now they would
remember how easily Delarmi had twitched him into ridicule and how much
they had enjoyed it. She would use that to convince them, all too
easily, that he lacked the age and experience for the role of First
Speaker. Their united pressure would force the First Speaker into
changing his decision while Gendibal was off on his mission. Or, if the
First Speaker held fast, Gendibal would eventually find himself with an
office that would be forever helpless in the face of united
opposition.</p>
<p>He saw it all in an instant and was able to answer as though without
hesitation.</p>
<p>He said, “Speaker Delarmi, I admire your insight. I had thought to
surprise you all. It was indeed my intention to take the Hamishwoman,
though not quite for the very good reason you suggest. It was for her
mind that I wished to take her with me. You have all examined that mind.
You saw it for what it was: surprisingly intelligent but, more than
that, clear, simple, utterly without guile. No touch upon it by others
would go unnoticed, as I’m sure you all concluded.</p>
<p>“I wonder if it occurred to you, then, Speaker Delarmi, that she
would serve as an excellent early-warning system. I would detect the
first symptomatic presence of mentalism by way of her mind, earlier, I
think, than by way of mine.”</p>
<p>There was a kind of astonished silence at that, and he said, lightly,
“Ah, none of you saw that. Well well, not important! And I will take my
leave now. There’s no time to lose.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” said Delarmi, her initiative lost a third time. “What do you
intend to do?”</p>
<p>Gendibal said with a small shrug, “Why go into details? The less the
Table knows, the less the Anti-Mules are likely to attempt to disturb
it.”</p>
<p>He said it as though the safety of the Table was his prime concern.
He filled his mind with that, and let it show.</p>
<p>It would flatter them. More than that, the satisfaction it would
bring might keep them from wondering whether, in fact, Gendibal knew
exactly what it was he intended to do.</p>

<p>The first Speaker spoke to Gendibal alone that evening.</p>
<p>“You were right,” he said. “I could not help brushing below the
surface of your mind. I saw you considered the announcement a mistake
and it was. It was my eagerness to wipe that eternal smile off her face
and to strike back at the casual way in which she so frequently usurps
my role.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said gently, “It might have been better if you had told me
privately and had then waited for my return to go further.”</p>
<p>“That would not have allowed me to strike out at her. —Poor
motivation for a First Speaker, I know.”</p>
<p>“This won’t stop her, First Speaker. She will still intrigue for the
post and perhaps with good reason. I’m sure there are some who would
argue that I should have refused your nomination. It would not be hard
to argue that Speaker Delarmi has the best mind at the Table and would
make the best First Speaker.”</p>
<p>“The best mind at the Table, not away from it,” grumbled Shandess.
“She recognizes no real enemies, except for other Speakers. She ought
never to have been made a Speaker in the first place. —See here, shall I
forbid you to take the Hamishwoman? She maneuvered you into that, I
know.”</p>
<p>“No no, the reason I advanced for taking her is a true one. She will
be an early-warning system and I am grateful to Speaker Delarmi for
pushing me into realizing that. The woman will prove very useful, I’m
convinced.”</p>
<p>“Good, then. By the way, I wasn’t lying, either. I am truly certain
that you will accomplish whatever is needed to end this crisis—if you
can trust my intuition.”</p>
<p>“I think I can trust it, for I agree with you. I promise you that
whatever happens, I will return better than I receive. I will come back
to be First Speaker, whatever the Anti-Mules—or Speaker Delarmi—can
do.”</p>
<p>Gendibal studied his own satisfaction even as he spoke. Why was he so
pleased, so insistent, on this one-ship venture into space? Ambition, of
course. Preem Palver had once done just this sort of thing—and he was
going to show that Stor Gendibal could do it, too. No one could withhold
the First Speakership from him after that. And yet was there more than
ambition? The lure of combat? The generalized desire for excitement in
one who had been confined to a hidden patch on a backward planet all his
adult life? —He didn’t entirely know, but he knew he was desperately
intent on going.</p>
