<h4 id="section">14</h4>
<p>Billibotton was Billibotton—dirty, sprawling, dark, sinuous
Billibotton—exuding decay and yet full of a vitality that Raych was
convinced was to be found nowhere else on Trantor. Perhaps it was to be
found nowhere else in the Empire, though Raych knew nothing, firsthand,
of any world but Trantor.</p>
<p>He had last seen Billibotton when he was not much more than twelve,
but even the people seemed to be the same; still a mixture of the
hangdog and the irreverent; filled with a synthetic pride and a
grumbling resentment; the men marked by their dark rich mustaches and
the women by their sacklike dresses that now looked tremendously
slatternly to Raych’s older and more worldly wise eyes.</p>
<p>How could women with dresses like that attract men? —But it was a
foolish question. Even when he was twelve, he had had a pretty clear
idea of how easily and quickly they could be removed.</p>
<p>So he stood there, lost in thought and memory, passing along a street
of store windows and trying to convince himself that he remembered this
particular place or that and wondering if, among them all, there were
people he did remember who were now eight years older. Those, perhaps,
who had been his boyhood friends—and he thought uneasily of the fact
that, while he remembered some of the nicknames they had pinned on each
other, he could not remember any real names.</p>
<p>In fact, the gaps in his memory were enormous. It was not that eight
years was such a long time, but it was two-fifths of the lifetime of a
twenty-year-old and his life since leaving Billibotton had been so
different that all before it had faded like a misty dream.</p>
<p>But the smells were there. He stopped outside a bakery, low and
dingy, and smelled the coconut icing that reeked through the air—that he
had never quite smelled elsewhere. Even when he had stopped to buy tarts
with coconut icing, even when they were advertised as “Dahl-style,” they
had been faint imitations—no more.</p>
<p>He felt strongly tempted. Well, why not? He had the credits and Dors
was not there to wrinkle her nose and wonder aloud how clean—or, more
likely, not clean—the place might be. Who worried about clean in the old
days?</p>
<p>The shop was dim and it took a while for Raych’s eyes to acclimate.
There were a few low tables in the place, with a couple of rather
insubstantial chairs at each, undoubtedly where people might have a
light repast, the equivalent of moka and tarts. A young man sat at one
of the tables, an empty cup before him, wearing a once-white T-shirt
that probably would have looked even dirtier in a better light.</p>
<p>The baker or, in any case, a server stepped out from a room in the
rear and said in a rather surly fashion, “What’ll ya have?”</p>
<p>“A coke-icer,” said Raych in just as surly a fashion (he would not be
a Billibottoner if he displayed courtesy), using the slang term he
remembered well from the old days.</p>
<p>The term was still current, for the server handed him the correct
item, using his bare fingers. The boy, Raych, would have taken that for
granted, but now the man, Raych, felt taken slightly aback.</p>
<p>“You want a bag?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Raych, “I’ll eat it here.” He paid the server and took the
coke-icer from the other’s hand and bit into its richness, his eyes
half-closing as he did so. It had been a rare treat in his
boyhood—sometimes when he had scrounged the necessary credit to buy one
with, sometimes when he had received a bite from a temporarily wealthy
friend, most often when he had lifted one when nobody was watching. Now
he could buy as many as he wished.</p>
<p>“Hey,” said a voice.</p>
<p>Raych opened his eyes. It was the man at the table, scowling at
him.</p>
<p>Raych said gently, “Are you speaking to me, bub?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. What’chuh doin’?”</p>
<p>“Eatin’ a coke-icer. What’s it to ya?” Automatically he had assumed
the Billibotton way of talking. It was no strain at all.</p>
<p>“What’chuh doin’ in Billibotton?”</p>
<p>“Born here. Raised here. In a bed. Not in a street, like you.” The
insult came easily, as though he had never left home.</p>
<p>“That so? You dress pretty good for a Billibottoner. Pretty
fancy-dancy. Got a perfume stink about ya.” And he held up a little
finger to imply effeminacy.</p>
<p>“I won’t talk about your stink. I went up in the world.”</p>
<p>“Up in the world? La-dee-da.” Two other men stepped into the bakery.
Raych frowned slightly, for he wasn’t sure whether they had been
summoned or not. The man at the table said to the newcomers, “This guy’s
gone up in the world. Says he’s a Billibottoner.”</p>
<p>One of the two newcomers shambled a mock salute and grinned with no
appearance of amiability. His teeth were discolored. “Ain’t that nice?
It’s always good to see a Billibottoner go up in the world. Gives ’em a
chance to help their poor unfor’chnit sector people. Like, credits. You
can always spare a credit or two for the poor, hey?”</p>
<p>“How many you got, mister?” said the other, the grin
disappearing.</p>
<p>“Hey,” said the man behind the counter. “All you guys get out of my
store. I don’t want no trouble in here.”</p>
<p>“There’ll be no trouble,” said Raych. “I’m leaving.”</p>
<p>He made to go, but the seated man put a leg in his way. “Don’t go,
pal. We’d miss yer company.”</p>
<p>(The man behind the counter, clearly fearing the worst, disappeared
into the rear.)</p>
<p>Raych smiled. He said, “One time when I was in Billibotton, guys, I
was with my old man and old lady and there were ten guys who stopped us.
Ten. I counted them. We had to take care of them.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” said the one who had been speaking. “Yer old man took care of
ten?”</p>
<p>“My old man? Nah. He wouldn’t waste his time. My old lady did. And I
can do it better than she can. And there are only three of you. So, if
you don’t mind, out of the way.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Just leave all your credits. Some of your clothes, too.”</p>
<p>The man at the table rose to his feet. There was a knife in his
hand.</p>
<p>“There you are,” said Raych. “Now you’re going to waste my time.” He
had finished his coke-icer and he half-turned. Then, as quickly as
thought, he anchored himself to the table, while his right leg shot out
and the point of his toe landed unerringly in the groin of the man with
the knife.</p>
<p>Down he went with a loud cry. Up went the table, driving the second
man toward the wall and keeping him there, while Raych’s right arm
flashed out, with the edge of the palm striking hard against the larynx
of the third, who coughed and went down.</p>
<p>It had taken two seconds and Raych now stood there with a knife in
each hand and said, “Now which one of you wants to move?”</p>
<p>They glared at him but remained frozen in place and Raych said, “In
that case, I will now leave.”</p>
<p>But the server, who had retreated to the back room, must have
summoned help, for three more men had now entered the store, while the
server screeched, “Troublemakers! Nothing but troublemakers!”</p>
<p>The newcomers were dressed alike in what was obviously a uniform—but
one that Raych had never seen. Trousers were tucked into boots, loose
green T-shirts were belted, and odd semispherical hats that looked
vaguely comic were perched on top of their heads. On the front of the
left shoulder of each T-shirt were the letters JG.</p>
<p>They had the Dahlite look about them but not quite the Dahlite
mustache. The mustaches were black and thick, but they were carefully
trimmed at lip level and were kept from luxuriating too widely. Raych
allowed himself an internal sneer. They lacked the vigor of his own wild
mustache, but he had to admit they looked neat and clean.</p>
<p>The leader of these three men said, “I’m Corporal Quinber. What’s
been going on here?”</p>
<p>The defeated Billibottoners were scrambling to their feet, clearly
the worse for wear. One was still doubled over, one was rubbing his
throat, and the third acted as though one of his shoulders had been
wrenched.</p>
<p>The corporal stared at them with a philosophic eye, while his two men
blocked the door. He turned to Raych—the one man who seemed untouched.
“Are you a Billibottoner, boy?”</p>
<p>“Born and bred, but I’ve lived elsewhere for eight years.” He let the
Billibotton accent recede, but it was still there, at least to the
extent that it existed in the corporal’s speech as well. There were
other parts of Dahl aside from Billibotton and some parts with
considerable aspirations to gentility.</p>
<p>Raych said, “Are you security officers? I don’t seem to recall the
uniform you’re—”</p>
<p>“We’re not security officers. You won’t find security officers in
Billibotton much. We’re the Joranum Guard and we keep the peace here. We
know these three and they’ve been warned. We’ll take care of them.
You’re our problem, buster. Name. Reference number.”</p>
<p>Raych told them.</p>
<p>“And what happened here?”</p>
<p>Raych told them.</p>
<p>“And your business here?”</p>
<p>Raych said, “Look here. Do you have the right to question me? If
you’re not security officers—”</p>
<p>“Listen,” said the corporal in a hard voice, “don’t you question
rights. We’re all there is in Billibotton and we have the right because
we take the right. You say you beat up these three men and I believe
you. But you won’t beat us up. We’re not allowed to carry blasters—” And
with that, the corporal slowly pulled out a blaster.</p>
<p>“Now tell me your business here.”</p>
<p>Raych sighed. If he had gone directly to a sector hall, as he should
have done—if he had not stopped to drown himself in nostalgia for
Billibotton and coke-icers—</p>
<p>He said, “I have come on important business to see Mr. Joranum, and
since you seem to be part of his organi—”</p>
<p>“To see the leader?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Corporal.”</p>
<p>“With two knives on you?”</p>
<p>“For self-defense. I wasn’t going to have them on me when I saw
Mr. Joranum.”</p>
<p>“So you say. We’re taking you into custody, mister. We’ll get to the
bottom of this. It may take time, but we will.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t have the right. You’re not the legally const—”</p>
<p>“Well, find someone to complain to. Till then, you’re ours.”</p>
<p>And the knives were confiscated and Raych was taken into custody.</p>
