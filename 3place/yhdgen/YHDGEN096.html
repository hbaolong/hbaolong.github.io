<p>THE ANSWER THAT SATISFIED</p>
<p>Turbor laughed suddenly—laughed in huge, windy gusts that bounced
ringingly off the walls and died in gasps. He shook his head, weakly,
and said, “Great Galaxy, this goes on all night. One after another, we
put up our straw men to be knocked down. We have fun, but we don’t get
anywhere. Space! Maybe all planets are the Second Foundation. Maybe they
have no planet, just key men spread on all the planets. And what does it
matter, since Darell says we have the perfect defense?”</p>
<p>Darell smiled without humor. “The perfect defense is not enough,
Turbor. My Mental Static device is far from perfect, and even if it
were, it is only something that keeps us in the same place. We cannot
remain forever with our fists doubled, frantically staring in all
directions for the unknown enemy. We must know not only how to win, but
whom to defeat. And there is a specific world on which the enemy
exists.”</p>
<p>“Get to the point,” said Anthor, wearily. “What’s your
information?”</p>
<p>“Arcadia,” said Darell, “sent me a message, and until I got it, I
never saw the obvious. I probably would never have seen the obvious. Yet
it was a simple message that went: ‘A circle has no end.’ Do you
see?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Anthor, stubbornly, and he spoke, quite obviously, for the
others.</p>
<p>“A circle has no end,” repeated Munn, thoughtfully, and his forehead
furrowed.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Darell, impatiently, “it was clear to me—What is the one
absolute fact we know about the Second Foundation, eh? I’ll tell you! We
know that Hari Seldon located it at the opposite end of the Galaxy.
Homir Munn theorized that Seldon lied about the existence of the
Foundation. Pelleas Anthor theorized that Seldon had told the truth that
far, but lied about the location of the Foundation. But I tell you that
Hari Seldon lied in no particular; that he told the absolute truth.</p>
<p>“But, what is the other end? The Galaxy is a flat, lens-shaped
object. A cross section along the flatness of it is a circle, and a
circle has no end—as Arcadia realized. We—we, the First Foundation—are
located on Terminus at the rim of that circle. We are at an end of the
Galaxy, by definition. Now follow the rim of that circle and find the
other end. Follow it, follow it, follow it, and you will find no other
end. You will merely come back to your starting point—</p>
<p>“And there you will find the Second Foundation.”</p>
<p>“There?” repeated Anthor. “Do you mean here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I mean here!” cried Darell, energetically. “Why, where else
could it possibly be? You said yourself that if the Second Foundationers
were the guardians of the Seldon Plan, it was unlikely that they could
be located at the so-called other end of the Galaxy, where they would be
as isolated as they could conceivably be. You thought that Kalgan’s
distance was more sensible. I tell you that that is also too far. No
distance at all is most sensible. And where would they be safest? Who
would look for them here? It’s the old principle of the most obvious
place being the least suspicious.</p>
<p>“Why was poor Ebling Mis so surprised and unmanned by his discovery
of the location of the Second Foundation? There he was, looking for it
desperately in order to warn it of the coming of the Mule, only to find
that the Mule had already captured both Foundations at a stroke. And why
did the Mule himself fail in his search? Why not? If one is searching
for an unconquerable meance, one would scarcely look among the enemies
already conquered. So the Mind-masters, in their own leisurely time,
could lay their plans to stop the Mule, and succeeded in stopping
him.</p>
<p>“Oh, it is maddeningly simple. For here we are with our plots and our
schemes, thinking that we are keeping our secrecy—when all the time we
are in the very heart and core of our enemy’s stronghold. It’s
humorous.”</p>
<p>Anthor did not remove the skepticism from his face, “You honestly
believe this theory, Dr. Darell?”</p>
<p>“I honestly believe it.”</p>
<p>“Then any of our neighbors, any man we pass in the street, might be a
Second Foundation superman, with his mind watching yours and feeling the
pulse of its thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“And we have been permitted to proceed all this time, without
molestation?”</p>
<p>“Without molestation? Who told you we were not molested? You,
yourself, showed that Munn has been tampered with. What makes you think
that we sent him to Kalgan in the first place entirely of our own
volition—or that Arcadia overheard us and followed him on her own
volition? Hah! We have been molested without pause, probably. And after
all, why should they do more than they have? It is far more to their
benefit to mislead us, than merely to stop us.”</p>
<p>Anthor buried himself in meditation and emerged therefrom with a
dissatisfied expression. “Well, then, I don’t like it. Your Mental
Static isn’t worth a thought. We can’t stay in the house forever and as
soon as we leave, we’re lost, with what we now think we know. Unless you
can build a little machine for every inhabitant in the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but we’re not quite helpless, Anthor. These men of the Second
Foundation have a special sense which we lack. It is their strength and
also their weakness. For instance, is there any weapon of attack that
will be effective against a normal, sighted man which is useless against
a blind man?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Munn, promptly. “A light in the eyes.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Darell. “A good, strong blinding light.”</p>
<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Turbor.</p>
<p>“But the analogy is clear. I have a Mind Static device. It sets up an
artificial electromagnetic pattern, which to the mind of a man of the
Second Foundation would be like a beam of light to us. But the Mind
Static device is kaleidoscopic. It shifts quickly and continuously,
faster than the receiving mind can follow. All right, then, consider it
a flickering light; the kind that would give you a headache, if
continued long enough. Now intensify that light or that electromagnetic
field until it is blinding—and it will become a pain, an unendurable
pain. But only to those with the proper sense; not to the unsensed.”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Anthor, with the beginnings of enthusiasm. “Have you
tried this?”</p>
<p>“On whom? Of course, I haven’t tried it. But it will work.”</p>
<p>“Well, where do you have the controls for the field that surrounds
the house? I’d like to see this thing.”</p>
<p>“Here.” Darell reached into his jacket pocket. It was a small thing,
scarcely bulging his pocket. He tossed the black, knob-studded cylinder
to the other.</p>
<p>Anthor inspected it carefully and shrugged his shoulders. “It doesn’t
make me any smarter to look at it. Look, Darell, what mustn’t I touch? I
don’t want to turn off the house defense by accident, you know.”</p>
<p>“You won’t,” said Darell, indifferently. “That control is locked in
place.” He flicked at a toggle switch that didn’t move.</p>
<p>“And what’s this knob?”</p>
<p>“That one varies rate of shift of pattern. Here—this one varies the
intensity. It’s that which I’ve been referring to.”</p>
<p>“May I—” asked Anthor, with his finger on the intensity knob. The
others were crowding close.</p>
<p>“Why not?” shrugged Darell. “It won’t affect us.”</p>
<p>Slowly, almost wincingly, Anthor turned the knob, first in one
direction, then in another. Turbor was gritting his teeth, while Munn
blinked his eyes rapidly. It was as though they were keening their
inadequate sensory equipment to locate this impulse which could not
affect them.</p>
<p>Finally, Anthor shrugged and tossed the control box back into
Darell’s lap. “Well, I suppose we can take your word for it. But it’s
certainly hard to imagine that anything was happening when I turned the
knob.”</p>
<p>“But naturally, Pelleas Anthor,” said Darell, with a tight smile.
“The one I gave you was a dummy. You see, I have another.” He tossed his
jacket aside and seized a duplicate of the control box that Anthor had
been investigating, which swung from his belt.</p>
<p>“You see,” said Darell, and in one gesture turned the intensity knob
to maximum.</p>
<p>And with an unearthly shriek, Pelleas Anthor sank to the floor. He
rolled in his agony; whitened, gripping fingers clutching and tearing
futilely at his hair.</p>
<p>Munn lifted his feet hastily to prevent contact with the squirming
body, and his eyes were twin depths of horror. Semic and Turbor were a
pair of plaster casts; stiff and white.</p>
<p>Darell, somber, turned the knob back once more. And Anthor twitched
feebly once or twice and lay still. He was alive, his breath racking his
body.</p>
<p>“Lift him onto the couch,” said Darell, grasping the young man’s
head. “Help me here.”</p>
<p>Turbor reached for the feet. They might have been lifting a sack of
flour. Then, after long minutes, the breathing grew quieter, and
Anthor’s eyelids fluttered and lifted. His face was a horrid yellow; his
hair and body were soaked in perspiration, and his voice, when he spoke,
were cracked and unrecognizable.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” he muttered, “don’t! Don’t do that again! You don’t know—
You don’t know— Oh-h-h.” It was a long, trembling moan.</p>
<p>“We won’t do it again,” said Darell, “if you will tell us the truth.
You are a member of the Second Foundation?”</p>
<p>“Let me have some water,” pleaded Anthor.</p>
<p>“Get some, Turbor,” said Darell, “and bring the whiskey bottle.”</p>
<p>He repeated the question after pouring a jigger of whiskey and two
glasses of water into Anthor. Something seemed to relax in the young
man—</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, wearily. “I am a member of the Second
Foundation.”</p>
<p>“Which,” continued Darell, “is located on Terminus—here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. You are right in every particular, Dr. Darell.”</p>
<p>“Good! Now explain what’s been happening this past half year. Tell
us!”</p>
<p>“I would like to sleep,” whispered Anthor.</p>
<p>“Later! Speak now!”</p>
<p>A tremulous sigh. Then words, low and hurried. The others bent over
him to catch the sound. “The situation was growing dangerous. We knew
that Terminus and its physical scientists were becoming interested in
brainwave patterns and that the times were ripe for the development of
something like the Mind Static device. And there was growing enmity
toward the Second Foundation. We had to stop it without ruining Seldon’s
Plan.</p>
<p>“We … we tried to control the movement. We tried to join it. It would
turn suspicion and efforts away from us. We saw to it that Kalgan
declared war as a further distraction. That’s why I sent Munn to Kalgan.
Stettin’s supposed mistress was one of us. She saw to it that Munn made
the proper moves—”</p>
<p>“Callia is—” cried Munn, but Darell waved him silent.</p>
<p>Anthor continued, unaware of any interruption, “Arcadia followed. We
hadn’t counted on that—can’t foresee everything—so Callia maneuvered her
to Trantor to prevent interference. That’s all. Except that we
lost.”</p>
<p>“You tried to get me to go to Trantor, didn’t you?” asked Darell.</p>
<p>Anthor nodded, “Had to get you out of the way. The growing triumph in
your mind was clear enough. You were solving the problems of the Mind
Static device.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you put me under control?”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t … couldn’t. Had my orders. We were working according to a
Plan. If I improvised, I would have thrown everything off. Plan only
predicts probabilities … you know that … like Seldon’s Plan.” He was
talking in anguished pants, and almost incoherently. His head twisted
from side to side in a restless fever. “We worked with individuals … not
groups … very low probabilities involved … lost out. Besides … if
control you … someone else invent device … no use … had to control times
… more subtle … First Speaker’s own plan … don’t know all angles …
except … didn’t work a-a-a” He ran down.</p>
<p>Darell shook him roughly, “You can’t sleep yet. How many of you are
there?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Whatjasay … oh … not many … be surprised … fifty … don’t need
more.”</p>
<p>“All here on Terminus?”</p>
<p>“Five … six out in space … like Callia … got to sleep.”</p>
<p>He stirred himself suddenly as though to one giant effort, and his
expressions gained in clarity. It was a last attempt at
self-justification, at moderating his defeat.</p>
<p>“Almost got you at the end. Would have turned off defenses and seized
you. Would have seen who was master. But you gave me dummy controls …
suspected me all along—”</p>
<p>And finally he was asleep.</p>
<p>Turbor said, in awed tones, “How long did you suspect him,
Darell?”</p>
<p>“Ever since he first came here,” was the quiet response. “He came
from Kleise, he said. But I knew Kleise; and I knew on what terms we
parted. He was a fanatic on the subject of the Second Foundation and I
had deserted him. My own purposes were reasonable, since I thought it
best and safest to pursue my own notions by myself. But I couldn’t tell
Kleise that; and he wouldn’t have listened if I had. To him, I was a
coward and a traitor, perhaps even an agent of the Second Foundation. He
was an unforgiving man and from that time almost to the day of his death
he had no dealings with me. Then, suddenly, in his last few weeks of
life, he writes me—as an old friend—to greet his best and most promising
pupil as a co-worker and begin again the old investigation.</p>
<p>“It was out of character. How could he possibly do such a thing
without being under outside influence, and I began to wonder if the only
purpose might not be to introduce into my confidence a real agent of the
Second Foundation. Well, it was so—”</p>
<p>He sighed and closed his own eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>Semic put in hesitantly, “What will we do with all of them … these
Second Foundation fellas?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Darell, sadly. “We could exile them, I suppose.
There’s Zoranel, for instance. They can be placed there and the planet
saturated with Mind Static. The sexes can be separated, or, better
still, they can be sterilized—and in fifty years, the Second Foundation
will be a thing of the past. Or perhaps a quiet death for all of them
would be kinder.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose,” said Turbor, “we could learn the use of this sense
of theirs? Or are they born with it, like the Mule?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I think it is developed through long training, since
there are indications from encephalography that the potentialities of it
are latent in the human mind. But what do you want that sense for? It
hasn’t helped them.”</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>Though he said nothing, his thoughts were shouting.</p>
<p>It had been too easy—too easy. They had fallen, these invincibles,
fallen like book-villains, and he didn’t like it.</p>
<p>Galaxy! When can a man know he is not a puppet? How can a man know he
is not a puppet?</p>
<p>Arcadia was coming home, and his thoughts shuddered away from that
which he must face in the end.</p>
<p>She was home for a week, then two, and he could not loose the tight
check upon those thoughts. How could he? She had changed from child to
young woman in her absence, by some strange alchemy. She was his link to
life; his link to a bittersweet marriage that scarcely outlasted his
honeymoon.</p>
<p>And then, late one evening, he said as casually as he could,
“Arcadia, what made you decide that Terminus contained both
Foundations?”</p>
<p>They had been to the theater; in the best seats with private
trimensional viewers for each; her dress was new for the occasion, and
she was happy.</p>
<p>She stared at him for a moment, then tossed it off. “Oh. I don’t
know, Father. It just came to me.”</p>
<p>A layer of ice thickened about Dr. Darell’s heart.</p>
<p>“Think,” he said, intensely. “This is important. What made you decide
both Foundations were on Terminus?”</p>
<p>She frowned slightly. “Well, there was Lady Callia. I knew she was a
Second Foundationer. Anthor said so, too.”</p>
<p>“But she was on Kalgan,” insisted Darell. “What made you decide on
Terminus?”</p>
<p>And now Arcadia waited for several minutes before she answered. What
had made her decide? What had made her decide? She had the horrible
sensation of something slipping just beyond her grasp.</p>
<p>She said, “She knew about things—Lady Callia did—and must have had
her information from Terminus: Doesn’t that sound right, Father?”</p>
<p>But he just shook his head at her.</p>
<p>“Father,” she cried, “I knew. The more I thought, the surer I was. It
just made sense.”</p>
<p>There was that lost look in her father’s eyes, “It’s no good,
Arcadia. It’s no good. Intuition is suspicious when concerned with the
Second Foundation. You see that, don’t you? It might have been
intuition—and it might have been Control!”</p>
<p>“Control! You mean they changed me? Oh, no. No, they couldn’t.” She
was backing away from him. “But didn’t Anthor say I was right? He
admitted it. He admitted everything. And you’ve found the whole bunch
right here on Trantor. Didn’t you? Didn’t you?” She was breathing
quickly.</p>
<p>“I know, but—Arcadia, will you let me make an encephalographic
analysis of your brain?”</p>
<p>She shook her head violently, “No, no! I’m too scared.”</p>
<p>“Of me, Arcadia? There’s nothing to be afraid of. But we must know.
You see that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>She interrupted him only once, after that. She clutched at his arm
just before the last switch was thrown. “What if I am different, Father?
What will you have to do?”</p>
<p>“I won’t have to do anything, Arcadia. If you’re different, we’ll
leave. We’ll go back to Trantor, you and I, and … and we won’t care
about anything else in the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>Never in Darell’s life had an analysis proceeded so slowly, cost him
so much, and when it was over, Arcadia huddled down and dared not look.
Then she heard him laugh and that was information enough. She jumped up
and threw herself into his opened arms.</p>
<p>He was babbling wildly as they squeezed one another, “The house is
under maximum Mind Static and your brainwaves are normal. We really have
trapped them, Arcadia, and we can go back to living.”</p>
<p>“Father,” she gasped, “can we let them give us medals now?”</p>
<p>“How did you know I’d asked to be left out of it?” He held her at
arm’s length for a moment, then laughed again. “Never mind; you know
everything. All right, you can have your medal on a platform, with
speeches.”</p>
<p>“And Father?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Can you call me Arkady from now on?”</p>
<p>“But— Very well, Arkady.”</p>
<p>Slowly the magnitude of the victory was soaking into him and
saturating him. The Foundation—the First Foundation—now the only
Foundation—was absolute master of the Galaxy. No further barrier stood
between themselves and the Second Empire—the final fulfillment of
Seldon’s Plan.</p>
<p>They had only to reach for it—</p>
<p>Thanks to—</p>
