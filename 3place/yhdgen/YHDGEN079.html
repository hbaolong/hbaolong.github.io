<p>TWO MEN AND THE ELDERS</p>
<p>The Elders of this particular region of Rossem were not exactly what
one might have expected. They were not a mere extrapolation of the
peasantry; older, more authoritative, less friendly.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>The dignity that had marked them at first meeting had grown in
impression till it had reached the mark of being their predominant
characteristic.</p>
<p>They sat about their oval table like so many grave and slow-moving
thinkers. Most were a trifle past their physical prime, though the few
who possessed beards wore them short and neatly arranged. Still, enough
appeared younger than forty to make it quite obvious that “Elders” was a
term of respect rather than entirely a literal description of age.</p>
<p>The two from outer space were at the head of the table and in the
solemn silence that accompanied a rather frugal meal that seemed
ceremonious rather than nourishing, absorbed the new, contrasting
atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the meal and after one or two respectful remarks—too short and
simple to be called speeches—had been made by those of the Elders
apparently held most in esteem, an informality forced itself upon the
assembly.</p>
<p>It was as if the dignity of greeting foreign personages had finally
given way to the amiable rustic qualities of curiosity and
friendliness.</p>
<p>They crowded around the two strangers and the flood of questions
came.</p>
<p>They asked if it were difficult to handle a spaceship, how many men
were required for the job, if better motors could be made for their
ground-cars, if it was true that it rarely snowed on other worlds as was
said to be the case with Tazenda, how many people lived on their world,
if it was as large as Tazenda, if it was far away, how their clothes
were woven and what gave them the metallic shimmer, why they did not
wear furs, if they shaved every day, what sort of stone that was in
Pritcher’s ring— The list stretched out.</p>
<p>And almost always the questions were addressed to Pritcher as though,
as the elder, they automatically invested him with the greater
authority. Pritcher found himself forced to answer at greater and
greater length. It was like an immersion in a crowd of children. Their
questions were those of utter and disarming wonder. Their eagerness to
know was completely irresistible and would not be denied.</p>
<p>Pritcher explained that spaceships were not difficult to handle and
that crews varied with the size, from one to many, that the motors of
their ground-cars were unknown in detail to him but could doubtless be
improved, that the climates of worlds varied almost infinitely, that
many hundreds of millions lived on his world but that it was far smaller
and more insignificant than the great empire of Tazenda, that their
clothes were woven of silicone plastics in which metallic luster was
artificially produced by proper orientation of the surface molecules,
and that they could be artificially heated so that furs were
unnecessary, that they shaved every day, that the stone in his ring was
an amethyst. The list stretched out. He found himself thawing to these
naive provincials against his will.</p>
<p>And always as he answered there was a rapid chatter among the Elders,
as though they debated the information gained. It was difficult to
follow these inner discussions of theirs for they lapsed into their own
accented version of the universal Galactic language that, through long
separation from the currents of living speech, had become archaic.</p>
<p>Almost, one might say, their curt comments among themselves hovered
on the edge of understanding, but just managed to elude the clutching
tendrils of comprehension.</p>
<p>Until finally Channis interrupted to say, “Good sirs, you must answer
us for a while, for we are strangers and would be very much interested
to know all we can of Tazenda.”</p>
<p>And what happened then was that a great silence fell and each of the
hitherto voluble Elders grew silent. Their hands, which had been moving
in such rapid and delicate accompaniment to their words as though to
give them greater scope and varied shades of meaning, fell suddenly
limp. They stared furtively at one another, apparently quite willing
each to let the other have all the floor.</p>
<p>Pritcher interposed quickly, “My companion asks this in friendliness,
for the fame of Tazenda fills the Galaxy and we, of course, shall inform
the governor of the loyalty and love of the Elders of Rossem.”</p>
<p>No sigh of relief was heard but faces brightened. An Elder stroked
his beard with thumb and forefinger, straightening its slight curl with
a gentle pressure, and said: “We are faithful servants of the Lords of
Tazenda.”</p>
<p>Pritcher’s annoyance at Channis’ bald question subsided. It was
apparent, at least, that the age that he had felt creeping over him of
late had not yet deprived him of his own capacity for making smooth the
blunders of others.</p>
<p>He continued: “We do not know, in our far part of the universe, much
of the past history of the Lords of Tazenda. We presume they have ruled
benevolently here for a long time.”</p>
<p>The same Elder who spoke before answered. In a soft, automatic way he
had become spokesman. He said: “Not the grandfather of the oldest can
recall a time in which the Lords were absent.”</p>
<p>“It has been a time of peace?”</p>
<p>“It has been a time of peace!” He hesitated. “The governor is a
strong and powerful Lord who would not hesitate to punish traitors. None
of us are traitors, of course.”</p>
<p>“He has punished some in the past, I imagine, as they deserve.”</p>
<p>Again hesitation, “None here have ever been traitors, or our fathers
or our fathers’ fathers. But on other worlds, there have been such, and
death followed for them quickly. It is not good to think of for we are
humble men who are poor farmers and not concerned with matters of
politics.”</p>
<p>The anxiety in his voice, the universal concern in the eyes of all of
them was obvious.</p>
<p>Pritcher said smoothly: “Could you inform us as to how we can arrange
an audience with your governor.”</p>
<p>And instantly an element of sudden bewilderment entered the
situation.</p>
<p>For after a long moment, the Elder said: “Why, did you not know? The
governor will be here tomorrow. He has expected you. It has been a great
honor for us. We … we hope earnestly that you will report to him
satisfactorily as to our loyalty to him.”</p>
<p>Pritcher’s smile scarcely twitched. “Expected us?”</p>
<p>The Elder looked wonderingly from one to the other. “Why … it is now
a week since we have been waiting for you.”</p>
<p>Their quarters were undoubtedly luxurious for the world. Pritcher had
lived in worse. Channis showed nothing but indifference to
externals.</p>
<p>But there was an element of tension between them of a different
nature than hitherto. Pritcher felt the time approaching for a definite
decision and yet there was still the desirability of additional waiting.
To see the governor first would be to increase the gamble to dangerous
dimensions and yet to win that gamble might multi-double the winnings.
He felt a surge of anger at the slight crease between Channis’ eyebrows,
the delicate uncertainty with which the young man’s lower lip presented
itself to an upper tooth. He detested the useless play-acting and
yearned for an end to it.</p>
<p>He said: “We seem to be anticipated.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Channis, simply.</p>
<p>“Just that? You have no contribution of greater pith to make. We come
here and find that the governor expects us. Presumably we shall find
from the governor that Tazenda itself expects us. Of what value then is
our entire mission?”</p>
<p>Channis looked up, without endeavoring to conceal the weary note in
his voice: “To expect us is one thing; to know who we are and what we
came for, is another.”</p>
<p>“Do you expect to conceal these things from men of the Second
Foundation?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. Why not? Are you ready to throw your hand in? Suppose our
ship was detected in space. Is it unusual for a realm to maintain
frontier observation posts? Even if we were ordinary strangers, we would
be of interest.”</p>
<p>“Sufficient interest for a governor to come to us rather than the
reverse?”</p>
<p>Channis shrugged: “We’ll have to meet that problem later. Let us see
what this governor is like.”</p>
<p>Pritcher bared his teeth in a bloodless kind of scowl. The situation
was becoming ridiculous.</p>
<p>Channis proceeded with an artificial animation: “At least we know one
thing. Tazenda is the Second Foundation or a million shreds of evidence
are unanimously pointing the wrong way. How do you interpret the obvious
terror in which these natives hold Tazenda? I see no signs of political
domination. Their groups of Elders apparently meet freely and without
interference of any sort. The taxation they speak of doesn’t seem at all
extensive to me or efficiently carried through. The natives speak much
of poverty but seem sturdy and well-fed. The houses are uncouth and
their villages rude, but are obviously adequate for the purpose.</p>
<p>“In fact, the world fascinates me. I have never seen a more
forbidding one, yet I am convinced there is no suffering among the
population and that their uncomplicated lives manage to contain a
well-balanced happiness lacking in the sophisticated populations of the
advanced centers.”</p>
<p>“Are you an admirer of peasant virtues, then?”</p>
<p>“The stars forbid.” Channis seemed amused at the idea. “I merely
point out the significance of all this. Apparently, Tazenda is an
efficient administrator—efficient in a sense far different from the
efficiency of the old Empire or of the First Foundation, or even of our
own Union. All these have brought mechanical efficiency to their
subjects at the cost of more intangible values. Tazenda brings happiness
and sufficiency. Don’t you see that the whole orientation of their
domination is different? It is not physical, but psychological.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Pritcher allowed himself irony. “And the terror with which
the Elders spoke of the punishment of treason by these kind-hearted
psychologist administrators? How does that suit your thesis?”</p>
<p>“Were they the objects of the punishment? They speak of punishment
only of others. It is as if knowledge of punishment has been so well
implanted in them that punishment itself need never be used. The proper
mental attitudes are so inserted into their minds that I am certain that
not a Tazendian soldier exists on the planet. Don’t you see all
this?”</p>
<p>“I’ll see perhaps,” said Pritcher, coldly, “when I see the governor.
And what, by the way, if our mentalities are handled?”</p>
<p>Channis replied with brutal contempt: “You should be accustomed to
that.”</p>
<p>Pritcher whitened perceptibly, and, with an effort, turned away. They
spoke to one another no more that day.</p>
<p>It was in the silent windlessness of the frigid night, as he listened
to the soft, sleeping motions of the other, that Pritcher silently
adjusted his wrist-transmitter to the ultrawave region for which
Channis’ was unadjustable and, with noiseless touches of his fingernail,
contacted the ship.</p>
<p>The answer came in little periods of noiseless vibration that barely
lifted themselves above the sensory threshold.</p>
<p>Twice Pritcher asked: “Any communications at all yet?”</p>
<p>Twice the answer came: “None. We wait always.”</p>
<p>He got out of bed. It was cold in the room and he pulled the furry
blanket around him as he sat in the chair and stared out at the crowding
stars so different in the brightness and complexity of their arrangement
from the even fog of the Galactic Lens that dominated the night sky of
his native Periphery.</p>
<p>Somewhere there between the stars was the answer to the complications
that overwhelmed him, and he felt the yearning for that solution to
arrive and end things.</p>
<p>For a moment he wondered again if the Mule were right—if Conversion
had robbed him of the firm sharp edge of self-reliance. Or was it simply
age and the fluctuations of these last years?</p>
<p>He didn’t really care.</p>
<p>He was tired.</p>
<p>The governor of Rossem arrived with minor ostentation. His only
companion was the uniformed man at the controls of the ground-car.</p>
<p>The ground-car itself was of lush design but to Pritcher it appeared
inefficient. It turned clumsily; more than once it apparently balked at
what might have been a too-rapid change of gears. It was obvious at once
from its design that it ran on chemical, and not on nuclear, fuel.</p>
<p>The Tazendian governor stepped softly onto the thin layer of snow and
advanced between two lines of respectful Elders. He did not look at them
but entered quickly. They followed after him.</p>
<p>From the quarters assigned to them, the two men of the Mule’s Union
watched. He—the governor—was thickset, rather stocky, short,
unimpressive.</p>
<p>But what of that?</p>
<p>Pritcher cursed himself for a failure of nerve. His face, to be sure,
remained icily calm. There was no humiliation before Channis—but he knew
very well that his blood pressure had heightened and his throat had
become dry.</p>
<p>It was not a case of physical fear. He was not one of those
dull-witted, unimaginative men of nerveless meat who were too stupid
ever to be afraid—but physical fear he could account for and
discount.</p>
<p>But this was different. It was the other fear.</p>
<p>He glanced quickly at Channis. The young man glanced idly at the
nails of one hand and poked leisurely at some trifling unevenness.</p>
<p>Something inside Pritcher became vastly indignant. What had Channis
to fear of mental handling?</p>
<p>Pritcher caught a mental breath and tried to think back. How had he
been before the Mule had Converted him from the diehard democrat that he
had been? It was hard to remember. He could not place himself mentally.
He could not break the clinging wires that bound him emotionally to the
Mule. Intellectually, he could remember that he had once tried to
assassinate the Mule but not for all the straining he could endure,
could he remember his emotions at the time. That might be the
self-defense of his own mind, however, for at the intuitive thought of
what those emotions might have been—not realizing the details, but
merely comprehending the drift of it—his stomach grew queasy.</p>
<p>What if the governor tampered with his mind?</p>
<p>What if the insubstantial mental tendrils of a Second Foundationer
insinuated themselves down the emotional crevices of his makeup and
pulled them apart and rejoined them—</p>
<p>There had been no sensation the first time. There had been no pain,
no mental jar—not even a feeling of discontinuity. He had always loved
the Mule. If there had ever been a time long before—as long before as
five short years—when he had thought he hadn’t loved him, that he had
hated him—that was just a horrid illusion. The thought of that illusion
embarrassed him.</p>
<p>But there had been no pain.</p>
<p>Would meeting the governor duplicate that? Would all that had gone
before—all his service for the Mule—all his life’s orientation—join the
hazy, otherlife dream that held the word, democracy? The Mule also a
dream, and only to Tazenda, his loyalty—</p>
<p>Sharply, he turned away.</p>
<p>There was that strong desire to retch.</p>
<p>And then Channis’ voice clashed on his ear: “I think this is it,
general.”</p>
<p>Pritcher turned again. An Elder had opened the door silently and
stood with a dignified and calm respect upon the threshold.</p>
<p>He said, “His Excellency, Governor of Rossem, in the name of the
Lords of Tazenda, is pleased to present his permission for an audience
and request your appearance before him.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” and Channis tightened his belt with a jerk and adjusted
a Rossemian hood over his head.</p>
<p>Pritcher’s jaw set. This was the beginning of the real gamble.</p>
<p>The governor of Rossem was not of formidable appearance. For one
thing, he was bareheaded, and his thinning hair, light brown, tending to
gray, lent him mildness. His bony eye-ridges lowered at them, and his
eyes, set in a fine network of surrounding wrinkles, seemed calculating,
but his fresh-cropped chin was soft and small and, by the universal
convention of followers of the pseudoscience of reading character by
facial bony structure, seemed “weak.”</p>
<p>Pritcher avoided the eyes and watched the chin. He didn’t know
whether that would be effective—if anything would be.</p>
<p>The governor’s voice was high-pitched, indifferent: “Welcome to
Tazenda. We greet you in peace. You have eaten?”</p>
<p>FOURTH INTERLUDE</p>
<p>The two Speakers passed each other on the road and one stopped the
other.</p>
<p>“I have word from the First Speaker.”</p>
<p>There was a half-apprehensive flicker in the other’s eyes.
“Intersection point?”</p>
<p>“Yes! May we live to see the dawn!”</p>
