<h4 id="section">59</h4>
<p>It was Dors who identified the newcomer first, perhaps because it was
she who expected him.</p>
<p>“Hummin,” she said, “thank goodness you found us. I got in touch with
you the moment I realized I was not going to deflect Hari from”—she held
up her hands in a wide gesture—“this.”</p>
<p>Hummin’s smile was a small one that did not alter the natural gravity
of his face. There was a subtle weariness about him.</p>
<p>“My dear,” he said, “I was engaged in other things. I cannot always
pull away at a moment’s notice. And when I got here, I had, like you
two, to supply myself with a kirtle and sash, to say nothing of a
skincap, and make my way out here. Had I been here earlier, I might have
stopped this, but I believe I’m not too late.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen had recovered from what had seemed to be a painful
shock. He said in a voice that lacked its customary severe depth, “How
did you get in here, Tribesman Hummin?”</p>
<p>“It was not easy, High Elder, but as Tribeswoman Venabili likes to
say, I am a very persuasive person. Some of the citizens here remembered
who I was and what I have done for Mycogen in the past, that I am even
an honorary Brother. Have you forgotten, Sunmaster Fourteen?”</p>
<p>The Elder replied, “I have not forgotten, but even the most favorable
memory cannot survive certain actions. A tribesman here and a
tribeswoman. There is no greater crime. All you have done is not great
enough to balance that. My people are not unmindful. We will make it up
to you some other way. But these two must die or be handed over to the
Emperor.”</p>
<p>“I am also here,” said Hummin calmly. “Is that not a crime as
well?”</p>
<p>“For you,” said Sunmaster Fourteen, “for you personally, as a kind of
honorary Brother, I can … overlook it … once. Not these two.”</p>
<p>“Because you expect a reward from the Emperor? Some favor? Some
concession? Have you already been in touch with him or with his Chief of
Staff, Eto Demerzel, more likely?”</p>
<p>“That is not a subject for discussion.”</p>
<p>“Which is itself an admission. Come on, I don’t ask what the Emperor
promised, but it cannot be much. He does not have much to give in these
degenerate days. Let me make you an offer. Have these two told you they
are scholars?”</p>
<p>“They have.”</p>
<p>“And they are. They are not lying. The tribeswoman is a historian and
the tribesman is a mathematician. The two together are trying to combine
their talents to make a mathematics of history and they call the
combined subject ‘psychohistory.’”</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, “I know nothing about this psychohistory,
nor do I care to know. Neither it nor any other facet of your tribal
learning interests me.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” said Hummin, “I suggest that you listen to me.”</p>
<p>It took Hummin some fifteen minutes, speaking concisely, to describe
the possibility of organizing the natural laws of society (something he
always mentioned with audible quotation marks in the tone of his voice)
in such a way as to make it possible to anticipate the future with a
substantial degree of probability.</p>
<p>And when he was done, Sunmaster Fourteen, who had listened
expressionlessly, said, “A highly unlikely piece of speculation, I
should say.”</p>
<p>Seldon, with a rueful expression, seemed about to speak, undoubtedly
to agree, but Hummin’s hand, resting lightly on the other’s knee,
tightened unmistakably.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Possibly, High Elder, but the Emperor doesn’t think so.
And by the Emperor, who is himself an amiable enough personage, I really
mean Demerzel, concerning whose ambitions you need no instruction. They
would like very much to have these two scholars, which is why I’ve
brought them here for safekeeping. I had little expectation that you
would do Demerzel’s work for him by delivering the scholars to him.”</p>
<p>“They have committed a crime that—”</p>
<p>“Yes, we know, High Elder, but it is only a crime because you choose
to call it so. No real harm has been done.”</p>
<p>“It has been done to our belief, to our deepest felt—”</p>
<p>“But imagine what harm will be done if psychohistory falls into the
hands of Demerzel. Yes, I grant that nothing may come of it, but suppose
for a moment that something does and that the Imperial government has
the use of it—can foretell what is to come—can take measures with that
foreknowledge which no one else would have—can take measures, in fact,
designed to bring about an alternate future more to the Imperial
liking.”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“Is there any doubt, High Elder, that the alternate future more to
the Imperial liking would be one of tightened centralization? For
centuries now, as you very well know, the Empire has been undergoing a
steady decentralization. Many worlds now acknowledge only lip service to
the Emperor and virtually rule themselves. Even here on Trantor, there
is decentralization. Mycogen, as only one example, is free of Imperial
interference for the most part. You rule as High Elder and there is no
Imperial officer at your side overseeing your actions and decisions. How
long do you think that will last with men like Demerzel adjusting the
future to their liking?”</p>
<p>“Still the flimsiest of speculation,” said Sunmaster Fourteen, “but a
disturbing one, I admit.”</p>
<p>“On the other hand, if these scholars can complete their task, an
unlikely if, you might say, but an if—then they are sure to remember
that you spared them when you might have chosen not to. And it would
then be conceivable that they would learn to arrange a future, for
instance, that would allow Mycogen to be given a world of its own, a
world that could be terraformed into a close replica of the Lost World.
And even if these two forget your kindness, I will be here to remind
them.”</p>
<p>“Well—” said Sunmaster Fourteen.</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Hummin, “it is not hard to decide what must be going
through your mind. Of all tribespeople, you must trust Demerzel the
least. And though the chance of psychohistory might be small (if I was
not being honest with you, I would not admit that) it is not zero; and
if it will bring about a restoration of the Lost World, what can you
want more than that? What would you not risk for even a tiny chance of
that? Come now—I promise you and my promises are not lightly given.
Release these two and choose a tiny chance of your heart’s desire over
no chance at all.”</p>
<p>There was silence and then Sunmaster Fourteen sighed. “I don’t know
how it is, Tribesman Hummin, but on every occasion that we meet, you
persuade me into something I do not really want to do.”</p>
<p>“Have I ever misled you, High Elder?”</p>
<p>“You have never offered me so small a chance.”</p>
<p>“And so high a possible reward. The one balances the other.”</p>
<p>And Sunmaster Fourteen nodded his head. “You are right. Take these
two and take them out of Mycogen and never let me see them again unless
there comes a time when—But surely it will not be in my lifetime.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not, High Elder. But your people have been waiting patiently
for nearly twenty thousand years. Would you then object to waiting
another—perhaps—two hundred?”</p>
<p>“I would not willingly wait one moment, but my people will wait as
long as they must.”</p>
<p>And standing up, he said, “I will clear the path. Take them and
go!”</p>
