<h4 id="section">83</h4>
<p>“Have you ever been in an air-jet before, Raych?” asked Hari
Seldon.</p>
<p>Raych shook his head speechlessly. He was looking down at Upperside
rushing beneath them with a mixture of fright and awe.</p>
<p>It struck Seldon again how much Trantor was a world of Expressways
and tunnels. Even long trips were made underground by the general
population. Air travel, however common it might be on the Outworlds, was
a luxury on Trantor and an air-jet like this— How had Hummin managed it?
Seldon wondered.</p>
<p>He looked out the window at the rise and fall of the domes, at the
general green in this area of the planet, the occasional patches of what
were little less than jungles, the arms of the sea they occasionally
passed over, with its leaden waters taking on a sudden all-too-brief
sparkle when the sun peeped out momentarily from the heavy cloud
layer.</p>
<p>An hour or so into the flight, Dors, who was viewing a new historical
novel without much in the way of apparent enjoyment, clicked it off and
said, “I wish I knew where we were going.”</p>
<p>“If you can’t tell,” said Seldon, “then I certainly can’t. You’ve
been on Trantor longer than I have.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but only on the inside,” said Dors. “Out here, with only
Upperside below me, I’m as lost as an unborn infant would be.”</p>
<p>“Oh well. —Presumably, Hummin knows what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he does,” replied Dors rather tartly, “but that may have
nothing to do with the present situation.</p>
<p>Why do you continue to assume any of this represents his
initiative?”</p>
<p>Seldon’s eyebrows lifted. “Now that you ask, I don’t know. I just
assumed it. Why shouldn’t this be his?”</p>
<p>“Because whoever arranged it didn’t specify that I be taken along
with you. I simply don’t see Hummin forgetting my existence. And because
he didn’t come himself, as he did at Streeling and at Mycogen.”</p>
<p>“You can’t always expect him to, Dors. He might well be occupied. The
astonishing thing is not that he didn’t come on this occasion but that
he did come on the previous ones.”</p>
<p>“Assuming he didn’t come himself, would he send a conspicuous and
lavish flying palace like this?” She gestured around her at the large
luxurious jet.</p>
<p>“It might simply have been available. And he might have reasoned that
no one would expect something as noticeable as this to be carrying
fugitives who were desperately trying to avoid detection. The well-known
double-double-cross.”</p>
<p>“Too well-known, in my opinion. And would he send an idiot like
Sergeant Thalus in his place?”</p>
<p>“The sergeant is no idiot. He’s simply been trained to complete
obedience. With proper instructions, he could be utterly reliable.”</p>
<p>“There you are, Hari. We come back to that. Why didn’t he get proper
instructions? It’s inconceivable to me that Chetter Hummin would tell
him to carry you out of Dahl and not say a word about me.
Inconceivable.”</p>
<p>And to that Seldon had no answer and his spirits sank.</p>
<p>Another hour passed and Dors said, “It looks as if it’s getting
colder outside. The green of Upperside is turning brown and I believe
the heaters have turned on.”</p>
<p>“What does that signify?”</p>
<p>“Dahl is in the tropic zone so obviously we’re going either north or
south—and a considerable distance too.</p>
<p>If I had some notion in which direction the nightline was I could
tell which.”</p>
<p>Eventually, they passed over a section of shoreline where there was a
rim of ice hugging the domes where they were rimmed by the sea.</p>
<p>And then, quite unexpectedly, the air-jet angled downward.</p>
<p>Raych screamed, “We’re goin’ to hit! We’re goin’ to smash up!”</p>
<p>Seldon’s abdominal muscles tightened and he clutched the arms of his
seat.</p>
<p>Dors seemed unaffected. She said, “The pilots up front don’t seem
alarmed. We’ll be tunneling.”</p>
<p>And, as she said so, the jet’s wings swept backward and under it and,
like a bullet, the air-jet entered a tunnel. Blackness swept back over
them in an instant and a moment later the lighting system in the tunnel
turned on. The walls of the tunnel snaked past the jet on either
side.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose I’ll ever be sure they know the tunnel isn’t already
occupied,” muttered Seldon.</p>
<p>“I’m sure they had reassurance of a clear tunnel some dozens of
kilometers earlier,” said Dors. “At any rate, I presume this is the last
stage of the journey and soon we’ll know where we are.”</p>
<p>She paused and then added, “And I further presume we won’t like the
knowledge when we have it.”</p>
