<h4 id="section">58</h4>
<p>Seldon pushed Dors to one side, perhaps a shade more roughly than he
intended. “I don’t need protection. This is our old friend Sunmaster
Fourteen.”</p>
<p>The man who faced them, wearing a double sash that was perhaps his
right as High Elder, said, “And you are Tribesman Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“And this, despite her masculine dress, is Tribeswoman Venabili.”</p>
<p>Dors said nothing.</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, “You are right, of course, tribesman. You
are in no danger of physical harm from me. Please sit down. Both of you.
Since you are not a Sister, tribeswoman, you need not retire. There is a
seat for you which, if you value such a distinction, you will be the
first woman ever to have used.”</p>
<p>“I do not value such a distinction,” said Dors, spacing her words for
emphasis.</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen nodded. “That is as you wish. I too will sit down,
for I must ask you questions and I do not care to do it standing.”</p>
<p>They were sitting now in a corner of the room. Seldon’s eyes wandered
to the metal robot.</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, “It is a robot.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Seldon briefly.</p>
<p>“I know you do,” said Sunmaster Fourteen with similar curtness. “But
now that we have settled that matter, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Seldon gazed steadily at Sunmaster Fourteen and said, “To see the
robot.”</p>
<p>“Do you know that no one but an Elder is allowed in the aerie?”</p>
<p>“I did not know that, but I suspected it.”</p>
<p>“Do you know that no tribesperson is allowed in the Sacratorium?”</p>
<p>“I was told that.”</p>
<p>“And you ignored the fact, is that it?”</p>
<p>“As I said, we wanted to see the robot.”</p>
<p>“Do you know that no woman, even a Sister, is allowed in the
Sacratorium except at certain stated—and rare—occasions?”</p>
<p>“I was told that.”</p>
<p>“And do you know that no woman is at any time—or for any
reason—allowed to dress in masculine garb? That holds, within the
borders of Mycogen, for tribeswomen as well as for Sisters.”</p>
<p>“I was not told that, but I am not surprised.”</p>
<p>“Good. I want you to understand all this. Now, why did you want to
see the robot?”</p>
<p>Seldon said with a shrug, “Curiosity. I had never seen a robot or
even known that such a thing existed.”</p>
<p>“And how did you come to know that it did exist and, specifically,
that it existed here?”</p>
<p>Seldon was silent, then said, “I do not wish to answer that
question.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you were brought to Mycogen by Tribesman Hummin? To
investigate robots?”</p>
<p>“No. Tribesman Hummin brought us here that we might be secure.
However, we are scholars, Dr. Venabili and I. Knowledge is our province
and to gain knowledge is our purpose. Mycogen is little understood
outside its borders and we wish to know more about your ways and your
methods of thought. It is a natural desire and, it seems to us, a
harmless—even praiseworthy—one.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but we do not wish the outer tribes and worlds to know about us.
That is our natural desire and we are the judge of what is harmless to
us and what harmful. So I ask you again, tribesman: How did you know
that a robot existed in Mycogen and that it existed in this room?”</p>
<p>“General rumor,” said Seldon at length.</p>
<p>“Do you insist on that?”</p>
<p>“General rumor. I insist on it.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen’s keen blue eyes seemed to sharpen and he said
without raising his voice, “Tribesman Seldon, we have long cooperated
with Tribesman Hummin. For a tribesman, he has seemed a decent and
trustworthy individual. For a tribesman! When he brought you two to us
and commended you to our protection, we granted it. But Tribesman
Hummin, whatever his virtues, is still a tribesman and we had
misgivings. We were not at all sure what your—or his—real purpose might
be.”</p>
<p>“Our purpose was knowledge,” said Seldon. “Academic knowledge.
Tribeswoman Venabili is a historian and I too have an interest in
history. Why should we not be interested in Mycogenian history?”</p>
<p>“For one thing, because we do not wish you to be. —In any case, two
of our trusted Sisters were sent to you. They were to cooperate with
you, try to find out what it was you wanted, and—what is the expression
you tribesmen use?—play along with you. Yet not in such a way that you
would be too aware as to what was happening.” Sunmaster Fourteen smiled,
but it was a grim smile.</p>
<p>“Raindrop Forty-Five,” Sunmaster Fourteen went on, “went shopping
with Tribeswoman Venabili, but there seemed nothing out of the way in
what happened on those trips. Naturally, we had a full report. Raindrop
Forty-Three showed you, Tribesman Seldon, our microfarms. You might have
been suspicious of her willingness to accompany you alone, something
that is utterly out of the question for us, but you reasoned that what
applied to Brothers did not apply to tribesmen and you flattered
yourself that that flimsy bit of reasoning won her over. She complied
with your desire, though at considerable cost to her peace of mind. And,
eventually, you asked for the Book. To have handed it over too easily
might have roused your suspicion, so she pretended to a perverse desire
only you could satisfy. Her self-sacrifice will not be forgotten. —I
take it, tribesman, you still have the Book and I suspect you have it
with you now. May I have it?”</p>
<p>Seldon sat in bitter silence.</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen’s wrinkled hand remained obtrusively outstretched
and he said, “How much better it would be than to wrest it from you by
force.”</p>
<p>And Seldon handed it over. Sunmaster Fourteen leafed through its
pages briefly, as though to reassure himself it was unharmed.</p>
<p>He said with a small sigh, “It will have to be carefully destroyed in
the approved manner. Sad! —But once you had this Book, we were, of
course, not surprised when you made your way out to the Sacratorium. You
were watched at all times, for you cannot think that any Brother or
Sister, not totally absorbed, would not recognize you for tribespeople
at a glance. We know a skincap when we see one and there are less than
seventy of them in Mycogen … almost all belonging to tribesmen on
official business who remain entirely in secular governmental buildings
during the time they are here. So you were not only seen but
unmistakably identified, over and over.</p>
<p>“The elderly Brother who met you was careful to tell you about the
library as well as about the Sacratorium, but he was also careful to
tell you what you were forbidden to do, for we did not wish to entrap
you. Skystrip Two also warned you … and quite forcibly. Nevertheless,
you did not turn away.</p>
<p>“The shop at which you bought the white kirtle and the two sashes
informed us at once and from that we knew well what you intended. The
library was kept empty, the librarian was warned to keep his eyes to
himself, the Sacratorium was kept under-utilized. The one Brother who
inadvertently spoke to you almost gave it away, but hastened off when he
realized with whom he was dealing. And then you came up here.</p>
<p>“You see, then, that it was your intention to come up here and that
we in no way lured you here. You came as a result of your own action,
your own desire, and what I want to ask you—yet once again—is: Why?”</p>
<p>It was Dors who answered this time, her voice firm, her eyes hard.
“We will tell you yet once again, Mycogenian. We are scholars, who
consider knowledge sacred and it is only knowledge that we seek. You did
not lure us here, but you did not stop us either, as you might have done
before ever we approached this building. You smoothed our way and made
it easy for us and even that might be considered a lure. And what harm
have we done? We have in no way disturbed the building, or this room, or
you, or that.”</p>
<p>She pointed to the robot. “It is a dead lump of metal that you hide
here and we now know that it is dead and that is all the knowledge we
sought. We thought it would be more significant and we are disappointed,
but now that we know it is merely what it is, we will leave—and, if you
wish, we will leave Mycogen as well.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen listened with no trace of expression on his face,
but when she was done, he addressed Seldon, saying, “This robot, as you
see it, is a symbol, a symbol of all we have lost and of all we no
longer have, of all that, through thousands of years, we have not
forgotten and what we intend someday to return to. Because it is all
that remains to us that is both material and authentic, it is dear to
us—yet to your woman it is only ‘a dead lump of metal.’ Do you associate
yourself with that judgment, Tribesman Seldon?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “We are members of societies that do not tie ourselves
to a past that is thousands of years old, making no contact at all with
what has existed between that past and ourselves. We live in the
present, which we recognize as the product of all the past and not of
one long-gone moment of time that we hug to our chests. We realize,
intellectually, what the robot may mean to you and we are willing to let
it continue to mean that to you. But we can only see it with our own
eyes, as you can only see it with yours. To us, it is a dead lump of
metal.”</p>
<p>“And now,” said Dors, “we will leave.”</p>
<p>“You will not,” said Sunmaster Fourteen. “By coming here, you have
committed a crime. It is a crime only in our eyes, as you will hasten to
point out” his lips curved in a wintry smile—“but this is our territory
and, within it, we make the definitions. And this crime, as we define
it, is punishable by death.”</p>
<p>“And you are going to shoot us down?” said Dors haughtily.</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen’s expression was one of contempt and he continued
to speak only to Seldon. “What do you think we are, Tribesman Seldon?
Our culture is as old as yours, as complex, as civilized, as humane. I
am not armed. You will be tried and, since you are manifestly guilty,
executed according to law, quickly and painlessly.</p>
<p>“If you were to try to leave now, I would not stop you, but there are
many Brothers below, many more than there appeared to be when you
entered the Sacratorium and, in their rage at your action, they may lay
rough and forceful hands on you. It has happened in our history that
tribespeople have even died so and it is not a pleasant death—certainly
not a painless one.”</p>
<p>“We were warned of this,” said Dors, “by Skystrip Two. So much for
your complex, civilized, and humane culture.”</p>
<p>“People can be moved to violence at moments of emotion, Tribesman
Seldon,” said Sunmaster Fourteen calmly, “whatever their humanity in
moments of calm. This is true in every culture, as your woman, who is
said to be a historian, must surely know.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Let us remain reasonable, Sunmaster Fourteen. You may
be the law in Mycogen over local affairs, but you are not the law over
us and you know it. We are both non-Mycogenian citizens of the Empire
and it is the Emperor and his designated legal officers who must remain
in charge of any capital offense.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, “That may be so in statutes and on papers
and on holovision screens, but we are not talking theory now. The High
Elder has long had the power to punish crimes of sacrilege without
interference from the Imperial throne.”</p>
<p>“If the criminals are your own people,” said Seldon. “It would be
quite different if they were outsiders.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it in this case. Tribesman Hummin brought you here as
fugitives and we are not so yeast-headed in Mycogen that we don’t
strongly suspect that you are fugitives from the Emperor’s laws. Why
should he object if we do his work for him?”</p>
<p>“Because,” said Seldon, “he would. Even if we were fugitives from the
Imperial authorities and even if he wanted us only to punish us, he
would still want us. To allow you to kill, by whatever means and for
whatever reason, non-Mycogenians without due Imperial process would be
to defy his authority and no Emperor could allow such a precedent. No
matter how eager he might be to see that the microfood trade not be
interrupted, he would still feel it necessary to re-establish the
Imperial prerogative. Do you wish, in your eagerness to kill us, to have
a division of Imperial soldiery loot your farms and your dwellings,
desecrate your Sacratorium, and take liberties with the Sisters?
Consider.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen smiled once again, but displayed no softness.
“Actually, I have considered and there is an alternative. After we
condemn you, we could delay your execution to allow you to appeal to the
Emperor for a review of your case. The Emperor might be grateful at this
evidence of our ready submission to his authority and grateful too to
lay his hands on you two—for some reason of his own—and Mycogen might
profit. Is that what you want, then? To appeal to the Emperor in due
course and to be delivered to him?”</p>
<p>Seldon and Dors looked at each other briefly and were silent.</p>
<p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, “I feel you would rather be delivered to the
Emperor than die, but why do I get the impression that the preference is
only by a slight margin?”</p>
<p>“Actually,” said a new voice, “I think neither alternative is
acceptable and that we must search for a third.”</p>
