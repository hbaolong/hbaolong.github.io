<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon walked into Dr. Endelecki’s office, a nervous smile on
his face.</p>
<p>He said, “You said a couple of weeks, Doctor. It’s been over a month
now.”</p>
<p>Dr. Endelecki nodded. “I’m sorry, Professor Seldon, but you wanted
everything exact and that is what I have tried to do.”</p>
<p>“Well?” The look of anxiety on Seldon’s face did not disappear. “What
did you find?”</p>
<p>“A hundred or so defective genes.”</p>
<p>“What! Defective genes. Are you serious, Doctor?”</p>
<p>“Quite serious. Why not? There are no genomes without at least a
hundred defective genes; usually there are considerably more. It’s not
as bad as it sounds, you know.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t know. You’re the expert, Doctor, not I.”</p>
<p>Dr. Endelecki sighed and stirred in her chair. “You don’t know
anything about genetics, do you, Professor?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. A man can’t know everything.”</p>
<p>“You’re perfectly right. I know nothing about this—what do you call
it?—this psychohistory of yours.”</p>
<p>Dr. Endelecki shrugged, then continued. “If you wanted to explain
anything about it, you would be forced to start from the beginning and I
would probably not understand it even so. “Now, as to genetics—”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“An imperfect gene usually means nothing. There are imperfect
genes—so imperfect and so crucial that they produce terrible disorders.
These are very rare, though. Most imperfect genes simply don’t work with
absolute accuracy. They’re like wheels that are slightly out of balance.
A vehicle will move along, trembling a bit, but it will move along.”</p>
<p>“Is that what Wanda has?”</p>
<p>“Yes. More or less. After all, if all genes were perfect, we would
all look precisely the same, we would all behave precisely the same.
It’s the difference in genes that makes for different people.”</p>
<p>“But won’t it get worse as we grow older?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We all get worse as we grow older. I noticed you limping when
you came in. Why is that?”</p>
<p>“A touch of sciatica,” muttered Seldon.</p>
<p>“Did you have it all your life?”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>“Well, some of your genes have gotten worse with time and now you
limp.”</p>
<p>“And what will happen to Wanda with time?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I can’t predict the future, Professor; I believe that
is your province. However, if I were to hazard a guess, I would say that
nothing unusual will happen to Wanda—at least, genetically—except the
gathering of old age.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“You have to take my word for it. You wanted to find out about
Wanda’s genome and you ran the risk of discovering things perhaps it is
better not to know. But I tell you that, in my opinion, I can see
nothing terrible happening to her.”</p>
<p>“The imperfect genes—should we fix them? Can we fix them?”</p>
<p>“No. In the first place, it would be very expensive. Secondly, the
chances are that they would not stay fixed. And finally, people are
against it.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>“Because they’re against science in general. You should know this as
well as anyone, Professor. I’m afraid the situation is such, especially
since Cleon’s death, that mysticism has been gaining ground. People
don’t believe in fixing genes scientifically. They would rather cure
things by the laying on of hands or by mumbo-jumbo of some sort or
other. Frankly it is extremely difficult for me to continue with my job.
Very little funding is coming in.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “Actually I understand this situation all too well.
Psychohistory explains it, but I honestly didn’t think the situation was
growing so bad so rapidly. I’ve been too involved in my own work to see
the difficulties all around me.” He sighed. “I’ve been watching the
Galactic Empire slowly fall apart for over thirty years now—and now that
it’s beginning to collapse much more rapidly, I don’t see how we can
stop it in time.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to?” Dr. Endelecki seemed amused.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Lots of luck. —About your sciatica. You know, fifty years ago it
could have been cured. Not now, though.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Well, the devices used for it are gone; the people who could have
handled them are working on other things. Medicine is declining.”</p>
<p>“Along with everything else,” mused Seldon. “—But let’s get back to
Wanda. I feel she is a most unusual young woman with a brain that is
different from most. What do her genes tell you about her brain?”</p>
<p>Dr. Endelecki leaned back in her chair. “Professor Seldon, do you
know just how many genes are involved in brain function?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I’ll remind you that, of all the aspects of the human body, the
brain function is the most intricate. In fact, as far as we know, there
is nothing in the Universe as intricate as the human brain. So you won’t
be surprised when I tell you that there are thousands of genes that each
play a role in brain function.”</p>
<p>“Thousands?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. And it is impossible to go through those genes and see
anything specifically unusual. I will take your word for it, as far as
Wanda is concerned. She is an unusual girl with an unusual brain, but I
see nothing in her genes that can tell me anything about that
brain—except, of course, that it is normal.”</p>
<p>“Could you find other people whose genes for mental functioning are
like Wanda’s, that have the same brain pattern?”</p>
<p>“I doubt it very much. Even if another brain were much like hers,
there would still be enormous differences in the genes. No use looking
for similarities. —Tell me, Professor, just what is it about Wanda that
makes you think her brain is so unusual?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “I’m sorry. It’s not something I can
discuss.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I am certain that I can find out nothing for you. How
did you discover that there was something unusual about her brain—this
thing you can’t discuss?”</p>
<p>“Accident,” muttered Seldon. “Sheer accident.”</p>
<p>“In that case, you’re going to have to find other brains like
hers—also by accident. Nothing else can be done.”</p>
<p>Silence settled over both of them. Finally Seldon said, “Is there
anything else you can tell me?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not. Except that I’ll send you my bill.”</p>
<p>Seldon rose with an effort. His sciatica hurt him badly. “Well then,
thank you, Doctor. Send the bill and I’ll pay it.”</p>
<p>Hari Seldon left the doctor’s office, wondering just what he would do
next.</p>
