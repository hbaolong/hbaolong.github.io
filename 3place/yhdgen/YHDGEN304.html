<p>Yugo Amaryl said, “Here you are again, Dors.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Yugo. I’m bothering you twice this week. Actually you don’t
see anyone very often, do you?”</p>
<p>Amaryl said, “I don’t encourage people to visit me, no. They tend to
interrupt me and break my line of thought. —Not you, Dors. You’re
altogether special, you and Hari. There’s never a day I don’t remember
what you two have done for me.”</p>
<p>Dors waved her hand. “Forget it, Yugo. You’ve worked hard for Hari
and any trifling kindness we did for you has long been overpaid. How is
the Project going? Hari never talks about it—not to me, anyway.”</p>
<p>Amaryl’s face lightened and his whole body seemed to take on an
infusion of life. “Very well. Very well. It’s difficult to talk about it
without mathematics, but the progress we’ve made in the last two years
is amazing—more than in all the time before that. It’s as though, after
we’ve been hammering away and hammering away, things have finally begun
to break loose.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been hearing that the new equations worked out by Dr. Elar have
helped the situation.”</p>
<p>“The achaotic equations? Yes. Enormously.”</p>
<p>“And the Electro-Clarifier has been helpful, too. I spoke to the
woman who designed it.”</p>
<p>“Cinda Monay?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s the one.”</p>
<p>“A very clever woman. We’re fortunate to have her.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, Yugo— You work at the Prime Radiant virtually all the time,
don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’m more or less constantly studying it. Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you study it with the Electro-Clarifier.”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you ever think of taking a vacation, Yugo?”</p>
<p>Amaryl looked at her owlishly, blinking slowly. “A vacation?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Surely you’ve heard the word. You know what a vacation is.”</p>
<p>“Why should I take a vacation?”</p>
<p>“Because you seem dreadfully tired to me.”</p>
<p>“A little, now and then. But I don’t want to leave the work.”</p>
<p>“Do you feel more tired now than you used to?”</p>
<p>“A little. I’m getting older, Dors.” “You’re only forty-nine.”</p>
<p>“That’s still older than I’ve ever been before.”</p>
<p>“Well, let it go. Tell me, Yugo—just to change the subject. How is
Hari doing at his work? You’ve been with him so long that no one could
possibly know him better than you do. Not even I. At least, as far as
his work is concerned.”</p>
<p>“He’s doing very well, Dors. I see no change in him. He still has the
quickest and brightest brain in the place. Age is having no effect on
him—at least, not so far.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. I’m afraid that his own opinion of himself is
not as high as yours is. He’s not taking his age well. We had a
difficult time getting him to celebrate his recent birthday. Were you at
the festivities, by the way? I didn’t see you.”</p>
<p>“I attended part of the time. But, you know, parties of that kind are
not the sort of thing I feel at home with.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Hari is wearing out? I’m not referring to his mental
brilliance. I’m referring to his physical capacities. In your opinion,
is he growing tired—too tired to bear up under his
responsibilities?”</p>
<p>Amaryl looked astonished. “I never gave it any thought. I can’t
imagine him growing tired.”</p>
<p>“He may be, just the same. I think he has the impulse, now and then,
to give up his post and hand the task over to some younger man.”</p>
<p>Amaryl sat back in his chair and put down the graphic stylus he had
been fiddling with ever since Dors had entered. “What! That’s
ridiculous! Impossible!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. He certainly wouldn’t consider such a thing without
discussing it with me. And he hasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Be reasonable, Yugo. Hari is exhausted. He tries not to show it, but
he is. What if he does decide to retire? What would become of the
Project? What would become of psychohistory?”</p>
<p>Amaryl’s eyes narrowed. “Are you joking, Dors?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m just trying to look into the future.”</p>
<p>“Surely, if Hari retires, I succeed to the post. He and I ran the
Project for years before anyone else joined us. He and I. No one else.
Except for him, no one knows the Project as I do. I’m amazed you don’t
take my succession for granted, Dors.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “There’s no question in my mind or in anyone else’s that
you are the logical successor, but do you want to be? You may know
everything about psychohistory, but do you want to throw yourself into
the politics and complexities of a large Project and abandon much of
your work in order to do so? Actually it’s trying to keep everything
moving smoothly that’s been wearing Hari down. Can you take on that part
of the job?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can and it’s not something I intend to discuss. —Look here,
Dors. Did you come here to break the news that Hari intends to ease me
out?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Certainly not! How could you think that of Hari! Have you
ever known him to turn on a friend?”</p>
<p>“Very well, then. Let’s drop the subject. Really, Dors, if you don’t
mind, there are things I must do.” Abruptly he turned away from her and
bent over his work once more.</p>
<p>“Of course. I didn’t mean to take up this much of your time.”</p>
<p>Dors left, frowning.</p>
