<h4 id="section">18</h4>
<p>FALL OF THE FOUNDATION</p>
<p>There was an atmosphere about the Time Vault that just missed
definition in several directions at once. It was not one of decay, for
it was well lit and well conditioned, with the color scheme of the walls
lively, and the rows of fixed chairs comfortable and apparently designed
for eternal use. It was not even ancient, for three centuries had left
no obvious mark. There was certainly no effort at the creation of awe or
reverence, for the appointments were simple and everyday—next door to
bareness, in fact.</p>
<p>Yet after all the negatives were added and the sum disposed of,
something was left—and that something centered about the glass cubicle
that dominated half the room with its clear emptiness. Four times in
three centuries, the living simulacrum of Hari Seldon himself had sat
there and spoken. Twice he had spoken to no audience.</p>
<p>Through three centuries and nine generations, the old man who had
seen the great days of universal empire projected himself—and still he
understood more of the Galaxy of his great-ultra-great-grandchildren
than did those grandchildren themselves.</p>
<p>Patiently that empty cubicle waited.</p>
<p>The first to arrive was Mayor Indbur III, driving his ceremonial
ground car through the hushed and anxious streets. Arriving with him was
his own chair, higher than those that belonged there, and wider. It was
placed before all the others, and Indbur dominated all but the empty
glassiness before him.</p>
<p>The solemn official at his left bowed a reverent head. “Excellence,
arrangements are completed for the widest possible sub-etheric spread
for the official announcement by your excellence tonight.”</p>
<p>“Good. Meanwhile, special interplanetary programs concerning the Time
Vault are to continue. There will, of course, be no predictions or
speculations of any sort on the subject. Does popular reaction continue
satisfactory?”</p>
<p>“Excellence, very much so. The vicious rumors prevailing of late have
decreased further. Confidence is widespread.”</p>
<p>“Good!” He gestured the man away and adjusted his elaborate neckpiece
to a nicety.</p>
<p>It was twenty minutes of noon!</p>
<p>A select group of the great props of the mayoralty—the leaders of the
great Trading organizations—appeared in ones and twos with the degree of
pomp appropriate to their financial status and place in mayoral favor.
Each presented himself to the mayor, received a gracious word or two,
took an assigned seat.</p>
<p>Somewhere, incongruous among the stilted ceremony of all this, Randu
of Haven made his appearance and wormed his way unannounced to the
mayor’s seat.</p>
<p>“Excellence!” he muttered, and bowed.</p>
<p>Indbur frowned. “You have not been granted an audience.”</p>
<p>“Excellence, I have requested one for a week.”</p>
<p>“I regret that the matters of State involved in the appearance of
Seldon have—”</p>
<p>“Excellence, I regret them, too, but I must ask you to rescind your
order that the ships of the Independent Traders be distributed among the
fleets of the Foundation.”</p>
<p>Indbur had flushed red at the interruption. “This is not the time for
discussion.”</p>
<p>“Excellence, it is the only time,” Randu whispered urgently. “As
representative of the Independent Trading Worlds, I tell you such a move
cannot be obeyed. It must be rescinded before Seldon solves our problem
for us. Once the emergency is passed, it will be too late to conciliate
and our alliance will melt away.”</p>
<p>Indbur stared at Randu coldly. “You realize that I am head of the
Foundation armed forces? Have I the right to determine military policy
or have I not?”</p>
<p>“Excellence, you have, but some things are inexpedient.”</p>
<p>“I recognize no inexpediency. It is dangerous to allow your people
separate fleets in this emergency. Divided action plays into the hands
of the enemy. We must unite, ambassador, militarily as well as
politically.”</p>
<p>Randu felt his throat muscles tighten. He omitted the courtesy of the
opening title. “You feel safe now that Seldon will speak, and you move
against us. A month ago you were soft and yielding, when our ships
defeated the Mule at Terel. I might remind you, sir, that it is the
Foundation Fleet that has been defeated in open battle five times, and
that the ships of the Independent Trading Worlds have won your victories
for you.”</p>
<p>Indbur frowned dangerously, “You are no longer welcome upon Terminus,
ambassador. Your return will be requested this evening. Furthermore,
your connection with subversive democratic forces on Terminus will
be—and has been—investigated.”</p>
<p>Randu replied, “When I leave, our ships will go with me. I know
nothing of your democrats. I know only that your Foundation’s ships have
surrendered to the Mule by the treason of their high officers, not their
sailors, democratic or otherwise. I tell you that twenty ships of the
Foundation surrendered at Horleggor at the orders of their rear admiral,
when they were unharmed and unbeaten. The rear admiral was your own
close associate—he presided at the trial of my nephew when he first
arrived from Kalgan. It is not the only case we know of and our ships
and men will not be risked under potential traitors.”</p>
<p>Indbur said, “You will be placed under guard upon leaving here.”</p>
<p>Randu walked away under the silent stares of the contemptuous coterie
of the rulers of Terminus.</p>
<p>It was ten minutes of twelve!</p>
<p>Bayta and Toran had already arrived. They rose in their back seats
and beckoned to Randu as he passed.</p>
<p>Randu smiled gently, “You are here after all. How did you work
it?”</p>
<p>“Magnifico was our politician,” grinned Toran. “Indbur insists upon
his Visi-Sonor composition based on the Time Vault, with himself, no
doubt, as hero. Magnifico refused to attend without us, and there was no
arguing him out of it. Ebling Mis is with us, or was. He’s wandering
about somewhere.” Then, with a sudden access of anxious gravity, “Why,
what’s wrong, uncle? You don’t look well.”</p>
<p>Randu nodded, “I suppose not. We’re in for bad times, Toran. When the
Mule is disposed of, our turn will come, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>A straight solemn figure in white approached, and greeted them with a
stiff bow.</p>
<p>Bayta’s dark eyes smiled, as she held out her hand, “Captain
Pritcher! Are you on space duty then?”</p>
<p>The captain took the hand and bowed lower, “Nothing like it. Dr. Mis,
I understand, has been instrumental in bringing me here, but it’s only
temporary. Back to home guard tomorrow. What time is it?”</p>
<p>It was three minutes of twelve!</p>
<p>Magnifico was the picture of misery and heart-sick depression. His
body curled up, in his eternal effort at self-effacement. His long nose
was pinched at the nostrils and his large, down-slanted eyes darted
uneasily about.</p>
<p>He clutched at Bayta’s hand, and when she bent down, he whispered,
“Do you suppose, my lady, that all these great ones were in the
audience, perhaps, when I … when I played the Visi-Sonor?”</p>
<p>“Everyone, I’m sure,” Bayta assured him, and shook him gently. “And
I’m sure they all think you’re the most wonderful player in the Galaxy
and that your concert was the greatest ever seen, so you just straighten
yourself and sit correctly. We must have dignity.”</p>
<p>He smiled feebly at her mock-frown and unfolded his long-boned limbs
slowly.</p>
<p>It was noon—</p>
<p>—and the glass cubicle was no longer empty.</p>
<p>It was doubtful that anyone had witnessed the appearance. It was a
clean break; one moment not there and the next moment there.</p>
<p>In the cubicle was a figure in a wheelchair, old and shrunken, from
whose wrinkled face bright eyes shone, and whose voice, as it turned
out, was the livest thing about him. A book lay face downward in his
lap, and the voice came softly.</p>
<p>“I am Hari Seldon!”</p>
<p>He spoke through a silence, thunderous in its intensity.</p>
<p>“I am Hari Seldon! I do not know if anyone is here at all by mere
sense-perception but that is unimportant. I have few fears as yet of a
breakdown in the Plan. For the first three centuries the percentage
probability of nondeviation is nine-four point two.”</p>
<p>He paused to smile, and then said genially, “By the way, if any of
you are standing, you may sit. If any would like to smoke, please do. I
am not here in the flesh. I require no ceremony.</p>
<p>“Let us take up the problem of the moment, then. For the first time,
the Foundation has been faced, or perhaps, is in the last stages of
facing, civil war. Till now, the attacks from without have been
adequately beaten off, and inevitably so, according to the strict laws
of psychohistory. The attack at present is that of a too-undisciplined
outer group of the Foundation against the too-authoritarian central
government. The procedure was necessary, the result obvious.”</p>
<p>The dignity of the high-born audience was beginning to break. Indbur
was half out of his chair.</p>
<p>Bayta leaned forward with troubled eyes. What was the great Seldon
talking about? She had missed a few of the words—</p>
<p>“—that the compromise worked out is necessary in two respects. The
revolt of the Independent Traders introduces an element of new
uncertainty in a government perhaps grown over-confident. The element of
striving is restored. Although beaten, a healthy increase of
democracy—”</p>
<p>There were raised voices now. Whispers had ascended the scale of
loudness, and the edge of panic was in them.</p>
<p>Bayta said in Toran’s ear, “Why doesn’t he talk about the Mule? The
Traders never revolted.”</p>
<p>Toran shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>The seated figure spoke cheerfully across and through the increasing
disorganization:</p>
<p>“—a new and firmer coalition government was the necessary and
beneficial outcome of the logical civil war forced upon the Foundation.
And now only the remnants of the old Empire stand in the way of further
expansion, and in them, for the next few years, at any rate, is no
problem. Of course, I cannot reveal the nature of the next prob—”</p>
<p>In the complete uproar, Seldon’s lips moved soundlessly.</p>
<p>Ebling Mis was next to Randu, face ruddy. He was shouting. “Seldon is
off his rocker. He’s got the wrong crisis. Were your Traders ever
planning civil war?”</p>
<p>Randu said thinly, “We planned one, yes. We called it off in the face
of the Mule.”</p>
<p>“Then the Mule is an added feature, unprepared for in Seldon’s
psychohistory. Now what’s happened?”</p>
<p>In the sudden, frozen silence, Bayta found the cubicle once again
empty. The nuclear glow of the walls was dead, the soft current of
conditioned air absent.</p>
<p>Somewhere the sound of a shrill siren was rising and falling in the
scale and Randu formed the words with his lips, “Space raid!”</p>
<p>And Ebling Mis held his wristwatch to his ears and shouted suddenly,
“Stopped, by the Ga-LAX-y! Is there a watch in the room that is going?”
His voice was a roar.</p>
<p>Twenty wrists went to twenty ears. And in far less than twenty
seconds, it was quite certain that none were.</p>
<p>“Then,” said Mis, with a grim and horrible finality, “something has
stopped all nuclear power in the Time Vault—and the Mule is
attacking.”</p>
<p>Indbur’s wail rose high above the noise, “Take your seats! The Mule
is fifty parsecs distant.”</p>
<p>“He was,” shouted back Mis, “a week ago. Right now, Terminus is being
bombarded.”</p>
<p>Bayta felt a deep depression settle softly upon her. She felt its
folds tighten close and thick, until her breath forced its way only with
pain past her tightened throat.</p>
<p>The outer noise of a gathering crowd was evident. The doors were
thrown open and a harried figure entered, and spoke rapidly to Indbur,
who had rushed to him.</p>
<p>“Excellence,” he whispered, “not a vehicle is running in the city,
not a communication line to the outside is open. The Tenth Fleet is
reported defeated and the Mule’s ships are outside the atmosphere. The
general staff—”</p>
<p>Indbur crumpled, and was a collapsed figure of impotence upon the
floor. In all that hall, not a voice was raised now. Even the growing
crowd without was fearful, but silent, and the horror of cold panic
hovered dangerously.</p>
<p>Indbur was raised. Wine was held to his lips. His lips moved before
his eyes opened, and the word they formed was, “Surrender!”</p>
<p>Bayta found herself near to crying—not for sorrow or humiliation, but
simply and plainly out of a vast frightened despair. Ebling Mis plucked
at her sleeve. “Come, young lady—”</p>
<p>She was pulled out of her chair, bodily.</p>
<p>“We’re leaving,” he said, “and take your musician with you.” The
plump scientist’s lips were trembling and colorless.</p>
<p>“Magnifico,” said Bayta, faintly. The clown shrank in horror. His
eyes were glassy.</p>
<p>“The Mule,” he shrieked. “The Mule is coming for me.”</p>
<p>He thrashed wildly at her touch. Toran leaned over and brought his
fist up sharply. Magnifico slumped into unconsciousness and Toran
carried him out potato-sack fashion.</p>
<p>The next day, the ugly, battle-black ships of the Mule poured down
upon the landing fields of the planet Terminus. The attacking general
sped down the empty main street of Terminus City in a foreign-made
ground car that ran where a whole city of atomic cars still stood
useless.</p>
<p>The proclamation of occupation was made twenty-four hours to the
minute after Seldon had appeared before the former mighty of the
Foundation.</p>
<p>Of all the Foundation planets, only the Independent Traders still
stood, and against them the power of the Mule—conqueror of the
Foundation—now turned itself.</p>
