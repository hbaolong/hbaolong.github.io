<h4 id="section">57</h4>
<p>A large room, all the larger because it was empty of anything
resembling furniture. No chairs, no benches, no seats of any kind. No
stage, no drapery, no decorations.</p>
<p>No lights, merely a uniform illumination of mild, unfocused light.
The walls were not entirely blank. Periodically, arranged in spaced
fashion at various heights and in no easy repetitive order, there were
small, primitive, two-dimensional television screens, all of which were
operating. From where Dors and Seldon stood, there was not even the
illusion of a third dimension, not a breath of true holovision.</p>
<p>There were people present. Not many and nowhere together. They stood
singly and, like the television monitors, in no easy repetitive order.
All were white-kirtled, all sashed.</p>
<p>For the most part, there was silence. No one talked in the usual
sense. Some moved their lips, murmuring softly. Those who walked did so
stealthily, eyes downcast.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was absolutely funereal.</p>
<p>Seldon leaned toward Dors, who instantly put a finger to her lips,
then pointed to one of the television monitors. The screen showed an
idyllic garden bursting with blooms, the camera panning over it
slowly.</p>
<p>They walked toward the monitor in a fashion that imitated the
others—slow steps, putting each foot down softly.</p>
<p>When they were within half a meter of the screen, a soft insinuating
voice made itself heard: “The garden of Antennin, as reproduced from
ancient guidebooks and photographs, located in the outskirts of Eos.
Note the—”</p>
<p>Dors said in a whisper Seldon had trouble catching over the sound of
the set, “It turns on when someone is close and it will turn off if we
step away. If we’re close enough, we can talk under cover, but don’t
look at me and stop speaking if anyone approaches.”</p>
<p>Seldon, his head bent, his hands clasped before him (he had noted
that this was a preferred posture), said, “Any moment I expect someone
to start wailing.”</p>
<p>“Someone might. They’re mourning their Lost World,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“I hope they change the films every once in a while. It would be
deadly to always see the same ones.”</p>
<p>“They’re all different,” said Dors, her eyes sliding this way and
that. “They may change periodically. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Wait!” said Seldon just a hair’s breadth too loud. He lowered his
voice and said, “Come this way.”</p>
<p>Dors frowned, failing to make out the words, but Seldon gestured
slightly with his head. Again the stealthy walk, but Seldon’s footsteps
increased in length as he felt the need for greater speed and Dors,
catching up, pulled sharply—if very briefly—at his kirtle. He
slowed.</p>
<p>“Robots here,” he said under the cover of the sound as it came
on.</p>
<p>The picture showed the corner of a dwelling place with a rolling lawn
and a line of hedges in the foreground and three of what could only be
described as robots. They were metallic, apparently, and vaguely human
in shape.</p>
<p>The recording said, “This is a view, recently constructed, of the
establishment of the famous Wendome estate of the third century. The
robot you see near the center was, according to tradition, named Bendar
and served twenty-two years, according to the ancient records, before
being replaced.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “ ‘Recently constructed,’ so they must change views.”</p>
<p>“Unless they’ve been saying ‘recently constructed’ for the last
thousand years.”</p>
<p>Another Mycogenian stepped into the sound pattern of the scene and
said in a low voice, though not as low as the whisperings of Seldon and
Dors, “Greetings, Brothers.”</p>
<p>He did not look at Seldon and Dors as he spoke and after one
involuntary and startled glance, Seldon kept his head averted. Dors had
ignored it all.</p>
<p>Seldon hesitated. Mycelium Seventy-Two had said that there was no
talking in the Sacratorium. Perhaps he had exaggerated. Then too he had
not been in the Sacratorium since he was a child.</p>
<p>Desperately, Seldon decided he must speak. He said in a whisper, “And
to you, Brother, greetings.”</p>
<p>He had no idea whether that was the correct formula of reply or if
there was a formula, but the Mycogenian seemed to find nothing amiss in
it.</p>
<p>“To you in Aurora,” he said.</p>
<p>“And to you,” said Seldon and because it seemed to him that the other
expected more, he added, “in Aurora,” and there was an impalpable
release of tension. Seldon felt his forehead growing moist.</p>
<p>The Mycogenian said, “Beautiful! I haven’t seen this before.”</p>
<p>“Skillfully done,” said Seldon. Then, in a burst of daring, he added,
“A loss never to be forgotten.”</p>
<p>The other seemed startled, then said, “Indeed, indeed,” and moved
away.</p>
<p>Dors hissed, “Take no chances. Don’t say what you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“It seemed natural. Anyway, this is recent. But those are
disappointing robots. They are what I would expect automata to be. I
want to see the organic ones—the humanoids.”</p>
<p>“If they existed,” said Dors with some hesitation, “it seems to me
they wouldn’t be used for gardening jobs.”</p>
<p>“True,” said Seldon. “We must find the Elders’ aerie.”</p>
<p>“If that exists. It seems to me there is nothing in this hollow cave
but a hollow cave.”</p>
<p>“Let’s look.”</p>
<p>They paced along the wall, passing from screen to screen, trying to
wait at each for irregular intervals until Dors clutched Seldon’s arms.
Between two screens were lines marking out a faint rectangle.</p>
<p>“A door,” Dors said. Then she weakened the assertion by adding, “Do
you think?”</p>
<p>Seldon looked about surreptitiously. It was in the highest degree
convenient that, in keeping with the mourning atmosphere, every face,
when not fixed on a television monitor, was bent in sad concentration on
the floor.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “How do you suppose it would open?”</p>
<p>“An entrance patch.”</p>
<p>“I can’t make out any.”</p>
<p>“It’s just not marked out, but there’s a slight discoloration there.
Do you see it? How many palms? How many times?”</p>
<p>“I’ll try. Keep an eye out and kick me if anyone looks in this
direction.”</p>
<p>He held his breath casually, touched the discolored spot to no avail,
and then placed his palm full upon it and pressed.</p>
<p>The door opened silently—not a creak, not a scrape. Seldon stepped
through as rapidly as he could and Dors followed him. The door closed
behind them.</p>
<p>“The question is,” said Dors, “did anyone see us?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Elders must go through this door frequently.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but will anyone think we are Elders?”</p>
<p>Seldon waited, then said, “If we were observed and if anyone thought
something was wrong, this door would have been flung open again within
fifteen seconds of our entering.”</p>
<p>“Possibly,” said Dors dryly, “or possibly there is nothing to be seen
or done on this side of the door and no one cares if we enter.”</p>
<p>“That remains to be seen,” muttered Seldon.</p>
<p>The rather narrow room they had entered was somewhat dark, but as
they stepped farther into it, the light brightened.</p>
<p>There were chairs, wide and comfortable, small tables, several
davenports, a deep and tall refrigerator, cupboards.</p>
<p>“If this is the Elders’ aerie,” said Seldon, “the Elders seem to do
themselves comfortably, despite the austerity of the Sacratorium
itself.”</p>
<p>“As would be expected,” said Dors. “Asceticism among a ruling
class—except for public show—is very rare. Put that down in your
notebook for psychohistorical aphorisms.” She looked about. “And there
is no robot.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “An aerie is a high position, remember, and this ceiling
is not. There must be upper storeys and that must be the way.” He
pointed to a well-carpeted stairway.</p>
<p>He did not advance toward it, however, but looked about vaguely.</p>
<p>Dors guessed what he was seeking. She said, “Forget about elevators.
There’s a cult of primitivism in Mycogen. Surely, you haven’t forgotten
that, have you? There would be no elevators and, what’s more, if we
place our weight at the foot of the stairs, I am quite certain it will
not begin moving upward. We’re going to have to climb it. Several
flights, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Climb it?”</p>
<p>“It must, in the nature of things, lead to the aerie—if it leads
anywhere. Do you want to see the aerie or don’t you?”</p>
<p>Together they stepped toward the staircase and began the climb.</p>
<p>They went up three flights and, as they did, the light level
decreased perceptibly and in steady increments. Seldon took a deep
breath and whispered, “I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but
I hate this.”</p>
<p>“You’re not used to this precise type of physical exertion.” She
showed no signs of physical distress whatever.</p>
<p>At the top of the third flight the stairs ended and before them was
another door.</p>
<p>“And if it’s locked?” said Seldon, more to himself than to Dors. “Do
we try to break it down?”</p>
<p>But Dors said, “Why should it be locked when the lower door was not?
If this is the Elders’ aerie, I imagine there’s a taboo on anyone but
Elders coming here and a taboo is much stronger than any lock.”</p>
<p>“As far as those who accept the taboo are concerned,” said Seldon,
but he made no move toward the door.</p>
<p>“There’s still time to turn back, since you hesitate,” said Dors. “In
fact, I would advise you to turn back.”</p>
<p>“I only hesitate because I don’t know what we’ll find inside. If it’s
empty—”</p>
<p>And then he added in a rather louder voice, “Then it’s empty,” and he
strode forward and pushed against the entry panel.</p>
<p>The door retracted with silent speed and Seldon took a step back at
the surprising flood of light from within.</p>
<p>And there, facing him, eyes alive with light, arms half-upraised, one
foot slightly advanced before the other, gleaming with a faintly yellow
metallic shine, was a human figure. For a few moments, it seemed to be
wearing a tight-fitting tunic, but on closer inspection it became
apparent that the tunic was part of the structure of the object.</p>
<p>“It’s the robot,” said Seldon in awe, “but it’s metallic.”</p>
<p>“Worse than that,” said Dors, who had stepped quickly to one side and
then to the other. “Its eyes don’t follow me. Its arms don’t as much as
tremble. It’s not alive—if one can speak of robots as being alive.”</p>
<p>And a man—unmistakably a man—stepped out from behind the robot and
said, “Perhaps not. But I am alive.”</p>
<p>And almost automatically, Dors stepped forward and took her place
between Seldon and the man who had suddenly appeared.</p>
