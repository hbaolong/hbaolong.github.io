<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon was fighting off melancholy. He was lectured in turn by
Dors, by Raych, by Yugo, and by Manella. All united to tell him that
sixty was not old.</p>
<p>They simply did not understand. He had been thirty when the first
hint of psychohistory had come to him, thirty-two when he delivered his
famous lecture at the Decennial Convention, following which everything
seemed to happen to him at once. After his brief interview with Cleon,
he had fled across Trantor and met Demerzel, Dors, Yugo, and Raych, to
say nothing of the people of Mycogen, of Dahl, and of Wye.</p>
<p>He was forty when he became First Minister and fifty when he had
relinquished the post. Now he was sixty.</p>
<p>He had spent thirty years on psychohistory. How many more years would
he require? How many more years would he live? Would he die with the
Psychohistory Project unfinished after all?</p>
<p>It was not the dying that bothered him, he told himself. It was the
matter of leaving the Psychohistory Project unfinished.</p>
<p>He went to see Yugo Amaryl. In recent years they had somehow drifted
apart, as the Psychohistory Project had steadily increased in size. In
the first years at Streeling, it had merely been Seldon and Amaryl
working together—no one else. Now—</p>
<p>Amaryl was nearly fifty—not exactly a young man—and he had somehow
lost his spark. In all these years, he had developed no interest in
anything but psychohistory: no woman, no companion, no hobby, no
subsidiary activity.</p>
<p>Amaryl blinked at Seldon, who couldn’t help but note the changes in
the man’s appearance. Part of it may have been because Yugo had had to
have his eyes reconstructed. He saw perfectly well, but there was an
unnatural look about them and he tended to blink slowly. It made him
appear sleepy.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Yugo?” said Seldon. “Is there any light at the
end of the tunnel?”</p>
<p>“Light? Yes, as a matter of fact,” said Amaryl. “There’s this new
fellow, Tamwile Elar. You know him, of course.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. I’m the one who hired him. Very vigorous and aggressive.
How’s he doing?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I’m really comfortable with him, Hari. His loud laughter
gets on my nerves. But he’s brilliant. The new system of equations fits
right into the Prime Radiant and they seem to make it possible to get
around the problem of chaos.”</p>
<p>“Seem? Or will?”</p>
<p>“Too early to say, but I’m very hopeful. I have tried a number of
things that would have broken them down if they were worthless and the
new equations survived them all. I’m beginning to think of them as ‘the
achaotic equations.’”</p>
<p>“I don’t imagine,” said Seldon, “we have anything like a rigorous
demonstration concerning these equations?”</p>
<p>“No, we don’t, though I’ve put half a dozen people on it, including
Elar, of course.” Amaryl turned on his Prime Radiant—which was every bit
as advanced as Seldon’s was—and he watched as the curving lines of
luminous equations curled in midair—too small, too fine to be read
without amplification. “Add the new equations and we may be able to
begin to predict.”</p>
<p>“Each time I study the Prime Radiant now,” said Seldon thoughtfully,
“I wonder at the Electro-Clarifier and how tightly it squeezes material
into the lines and curves of the future. Wasn’t that Elar’s idea,
too?”</p>
<p>“Yes. With the help of Cinda Monay, who designed it.”</p>
<p>“It’s good to have new and brilliant men and women in the Project.
Somehow it reconciles me to the future.”</p>
<p>“You think someone like Elar may be heading the Project someday?”
asked Amaryl, still studying the Prime Radiant.</p>
<p>“Maybe. After you and I have retired—or died.”</p>
<p>Amaryl seemed to relax and turned off the device. “I would like to
complete the task before we retire or die.”</p>
<p>“So would I, Yugo. So would I.”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory has guided us pretty well in the last ten years.”</p>
<p>That was true enough, but Seldon knew that one couldn’t attach too
much triumph to that. Things had gone smoothly and without major
surprises.</p>
<p>Psychohistory had predicted that the center would hold after Cleon’s
death—predicted it in a very dim and uncertain way—and it did hold.
Trantor was reasonably quiet. Even with an assassination and the end of
a dynasty, the center had held.</p>
<p>It did so under the stress of military rule—Dors was quite right in
speaking of the junta as “those military rascals.” She might have even
gone farther in her accusations without being wrong. Nevertheless, they
were holding the Empire together and would continue to do so for a time.
Long enough, perhaps, to allow psychohistory to play an active role in
the events that were to transpire.</p>
<p>Lately Yugo had been speaking about the possible establishment of
Foundations—separate, isolated, independent of the Empire itself—serving
as seeds for developments through the forthcoming dark ages and into a
new and better Empire. Seldon himself had been working on the
consequences of such an arrangement.</p>
<p>But he lacked the time and, he felt (with a certain misery), he
lacked the youth as well. His mind, however firm and steady, did not
have the resiliency and creativity that it had had when he was thirty
and with each passing year, he knew he would have less.</p>
<p>Perhaps he ought to put the young and brilliant Elar on the task,
taking him off everything else. Seldon had to admit to himself,
shamefacedly, that the possibility did not excite him. He did not want
to have invented psychohistory so that some stripling could come in and
reap the final fruits of fame. In fact, to put it at its most
disgraceful, Seldon felt jealous of Elar and realized it just
sufficiently to feel ashamed of the emotion.</p>
<p>Yet, regardless of his less rational feelings, he would have to
depend on other younger men—whatever his discomfort over it.
Psychohistory was no longer the private preserve of himself and Amaryl.
The decade of his being First Minister had converted it into a large
government-sanctioned and -budgeted undertaking and, quite to his
surprise, after resigning from his post as First Minister and returning
to Streeling University, it had grown still larger. Hari grimaced at its
ponderous—and pompous—official name: the Seldon Psychohistory Project at
Streeling University. But most people simply referred to it as the
Project.</p>
<p>The military junta apparently saw the Project as a possible political
weapon and while that was so, funding was no problem. Credits poured in.
In return, it was necessary to prepare annual reports, which, however,
were quite opaque. Only fringe matters were reported on and even then
the mathematics was not likely to be within the purview of any of the
members of the junta.</p>
<p>It was clear as he left his old assistant that Amaryl, at least, was
more than satisfied with the way psychohistory was going and yet Seldon
felt the blanket of depression settle over him once more.</p>
<p>He decided it was the forthcoming birthday celebration that was
bothering him. It was meant as a celebration of joy, but to Hari it was
not even a gesture of consolation—it merely emphasized his age.</p>
<p>Besides, it was upsetting his routine and Hari was a creature of
habit. His office and a number of those adjoining had been cleared out
and it had been days since he had been able to work normally. His proper
offices would be converted into halls of glory, he supposed, and it
would be many days before he could get back to work. Only Amaryl
absolutely refused to budge and was able to maintain his office.</p>
<p>Seldon had wondered, peevishly, who had thought of doing all this. It
wasn’t Dors, of course. She knew him entirely too well. Not Amaryl or
Raych, who never even remembered their own birthdays. He had suspected
Manella and had even confronted her on the matter.</p>
<p>She admitted that she was all for it and had given orders for the
arrangements to take place, but she said that the idea for the birthday
party had been suggested to her by Tamwile Elar.</p>
<p>The brilliant one, thought Seldon. Brilliant in everything.</p>
<p>He sighed. If only the birthday were all over.</p>
