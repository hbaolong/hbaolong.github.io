<h4 id="section">2</h4>
<p>But Seldon, while he did not forget Amaryl’s warning, did not think
of it with any great degree of concentration. His fortieth birthday came
and went—with the usual psychological blow.</p>
<p>Forty! He was not young any longer. Life no longer stretched before
him as a vast uncharted field, its horizon lost in the distance. He had
been on Trantor for eight years and the time had passed quickly. Another
eight years and he would be nearly fifty. Old age would be looming.</p>
<p>And he had not even made a decent beginning in psychohistory! Yugo
Amaryl spoke brightly of laws and worked out his equations by making
daring assumptions based on intuition. But how could one possibly test
those assumptions? Psychohistory was not yet an experimental science.
The complete study of psychohistory would require experiments that would
involve worlds of people, centuries of time—and a total lack of ethical
responsibility.</p>
<p>It posed an impossible problem and he resented having to spend any
time whatever on departmental tasks, so he walked home at the end of the
day in a morose mood.</p>
<p>Ordinarily he could always count on a walk through the campus to
rouse his spirits. Streeling University was high-domed and the campus
gave the feeling of being out in the open without the necessity of
enduring the kind of weather he had experienced on his one (and only)
visit to the Imperial Palace. There were trees, lawns, walks, almost as
though he were on the campus of his old college on his home world of
Helicon.</p>
<p>The illusion of cloudiness had been arranged for the day with the
sunlight (no sun, of course, just sunlight) appearing and disappearing
at odd intervals. And it was a little cool, just a little.</p>
<p>It seemed to Seldon that the cool days came a little more frequently
than they used to. Was Trantor saving energy? Was it increasing
inefficiency? Or (and he scowled inwardly as he thought it) was he
getting old and was his blood getting thin? He placed his hands in his
jacket pockets and hunched up his shoulders.</p>
<p>Usually he did not bother guiding himself consciously. His body knew
the way perfectly from his offices to his computer room and from there
to his apartment and back. Generally he negotiated the path with his
thoughts elsewhere, but today a sound penetrated his consciousness. A
sound without meaning.</p>
<p>“Jo … Jo … Jo … Jo …”</p>
<p>It was rather soft and distant, but it brought back a memory. Yes,
Amaryl’s warning. The demagogue. Was he here on campus?</p>
<p>His legs swerved without Seldon’s making a conscious decision and
brought him over the low rise to the University Field, which was used
for calisthenics, sports, and student oratory.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Field was a moderate-sized crowd of students who
were chanting enthusiastically. On a platform was someone he didn’t
recognize, someone with a loud voice and a swaying rhythm.</p>
<p>It wasn’t this man, Joranum, however. He had seen Joranum on
holovision a number of times. Since Amaryl’s warning, Seldon had paid
close attention. Joranum was large and smiled with a kind of vicious
camaraderie. He had thick sandy hair and light blue eyes.</p>
<p>This speaker was small, if anything—thin, wide-mouthed, dark-haired,
and loud. Seldon wasn’t listening to the words, though he did hear the
phrase “power from the one to the many” and the many-voiced shout in
response.</p>
<p>Fine, thought Seldon, but just how does he intend to bring this
about—and is he serious?</p>
<p>He was at the outskirts of the crowd now and looked around for
someone he knew. He spotted Finangelos, a pret-math undergraduate. Not a
bad young man, dark and woolly-haired.</p>
<p>“Finangelos,” he called out.</p>
<p>“Professor Seldon,” said Finangelos after a moment of staring as
though unable to recognize Seldon without a keyboard at his fingertips.
He trotted over. “Did you come to listen to this guy?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t come for any purpose but to find out what the noise was.
Who is he?”</p>
<p>“His name is Namarti, Professor. He’s speaking for Jo-Jo.”</p>
<p>“I hear that,” said Seldon as he listened to the chant again. It
began each time the speaker made a telling point, apparently. “But who
is this Namarti? I don’t recognize the name. What department is he
in?”</p>
<p>“He’s not a member of the University, Professor. He’s one of Jo-Jo’s
men.”</p>
<p>“If he’s not a member of the University, he has no right to speak
here without a permit. Does he have one, do you suppose?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know, Professor.”</p>
<p>“Well then, let’s find out.”</p>
<p>Seldon started into the crowd, but Finangelos caught his sleeve.
“Don’t start anything, Professor. He’s got goons with him.”</p>
<p>There were six young men behind the speaker, spaced rather widely,
legs apart, arms folded, scowling.</p>
<p>“Goons?”</p>
<p>“For rough stuff, in case anyone tries anything funny.”</p>
<p>“Then he’s certainly not a member of the University and even a permit
wouldn’t cover what you call his ‘goons.’—Finangelos, signal through to
the University security officers. They should have been here by now
without a signal.”</p>
<p>“I guess they don’t want trouble,” muttered Finangelos. “Please,
Professor, don’t try anything. If you want me to get the security
officers, I will, but you just wait till they come.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I can break this up before they come.”</p>
<p>He began pushing his way through. It wasn’t difficult. Some of those
present recognized him and all could see the professorial shoulder
patch. He reached the platform, placed his hands on it, and vaulted up
the three feet with a small grunt. He thought, with chagrin, that he
could have done it with one hand ten years before and without the
grunt.</p>
<p>He straightened up. The speaker had stopped talking and was looking
at him with wary and ice-hard eyes.</p>
<p>Seldon said calmly, “Your permit to address the students, sir.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” said the speaker. He said it loudly, his voice
carrying.</p>
<p>“I’m a member of the faculty of this University,” said Seldon,
equally loudly. “Your permit, sir?”</p>
<p>“I deny your right to question me on the matter.” The young men
behind the speaker had gathered closer.</p>
<p>“If you have none, I would advise you to leave the University grounds
immediately.”</p>
<p>“And if I don’t?”</p>
<p>“Well, for one thing, the University security officers are on their
way.” He turned to the crowd. “Students,” he called out, “we have the
right of free speech and freedom of assembly on this campus, but it can
be taken away from us if we allow outsiders, without permits, to make
unauthorized—”</p>
<p>A heavy hand fell on his shoulder and he winced. He turned around and
found it was one of the men Finangelos had referred to as “goons.”</p>
<p>The man said, with a heavy accent whose provenance Seldon could not
immediately identify, “Get out of here—fast.”</p>
<p>“What good will that do?” said Seldon. “The security officers will be
here any minute.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Namarti with a feral grin, “there’ll be a riot.
That doesn’t scare us.”</p>
<p>“Of course it wouldn’t,” said Seldon. “You’d like it, but there won’t
be a riot. You’ll all go quietly.” He turned again to the students and
shrugged off the hand on his shoulder. “We’ll see to that, won’t
we?”</p>
<p>Someone in the crowd shouted, “That’s Professor Seldon! He’s all
right! Don’t pound him!”</p>
<p>Seldon sensed ambivalence in the crowd. There would be some, he knew,
who would welcome a dustup with the University security officers, just
on general principles. On the other hand, there had to be some who liked
him personally and still others who did not know him but who would not
want to see violence against a member of the faculty.</p>
<p>A woman’s voice rang out. “Watch out, Professor!”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed and regarded the large young men he faced. He didn’t
know if he could do it, if his reflexes were quick enough, his muscles
sturdy enough, even given his prowess at Twisting.</p>
<p>One goon was approaching him, overconfidently of course. Not quickly,
which gave Seldon a little of the time his aging body would need. The
goon held out his arm confrontationally, which made it easier.</p>
<p>Seldon seized the arm, whirled, and bent, arm up, and then down (with
a grunt—why did he have to grunt?), and the goon went flying through the
air, propelled partly by his own momentum. He landed with a thump on the
outer edge of the platform, his right shoulder dislocated.</p>
<p>There was a wild cry from the audience at this totally unexpected
development. Instantly an institutional pride erupted.</p>
<p>“Take them, Prof!” a lone voice shouted. Others took up the cry.</p>
<p>Seldon smoothed back his hair, trying not to puff. With his foot he
shoved the groaning fallen goon off the platform.</p>
<p>“Anyone else?” he asked pleasantly. “Or will you leave quietly?”</p>
<p>He faced Namarti and his five henchmen and as they paused
irresolutely, Seldon said, “I warn you. The crowd is on my side now. If
you try to rush me, they’ll take you apart. —Okay, who’s next? Let’s go.
One at a time.”</p>
<p>He had raised his voice with the last sentence and made small
come-hither motions with his fingers. The crowd yelled its pleasure.</p>
<p>Namarti stood there stolidly. Seldon leaped past him and caught his
neck in the crook of his arm. Students were climbing onto the platform
now, shouting “One at a time! One at a time!” and getting between the
bodyguards and Seldon.</p>
<p>Seldon increased the pressure on the other’s windpipe and whispered
in his ear, “There’s a way to do this, Namarti, and I know how. I’ve
practiced it for years. If you make a move and try to break away, I’ll
ruin your larynx so that you’ll never talk above a whisper again. If you
value your voice, do as I say. When I let up, you tell your bunch of
bullies to leave. If you say anything else, they’ll be the last words
you’ll say normally. And if you ever come back to this campus again, no
more Mr. Nice Guy. I’ll finish the job.”</p>
<p>He released the pressure momentarily. Namarti said huskily, “All of
you. Get out.” They retreated rapidly, helping their stricken
comrade.</p>
<p>When the University security officers arrived a few moments later,
Seldon said, “Sorry, gentlemen. False alarm.”</p>
<p>He left the Field and resumed his walk home with more than a little
chagrin. He had revealed a side of himself he did not want to reveal. He
was Hari Seldon; mathematician, not Hari Seldon, sadistic Twister.</p>
<p>Besides, he thought gloomily, Dors would hear of this. In fact, he’d
better tell her himself, lest she hear a version that made the incident
seem worse than it really was.</p>
<p>She would not be pleased.</p>
