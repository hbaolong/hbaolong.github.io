<h4 id="section">16</h4>
<p>The room that Hari Seldon found himself in was larger than Hummin’s
room in the Imperial Sector. It was a bedroom with one corner serving as
a washroom and with no sign of any cooking or dining facilities. There
was no window, though set in the ceiling was a grilled ventilator that
made a steady sighing noise.</p>
<p>Seldon looked about a bit ruefully.</p>
<p>Hummin interpreted that look with his usual assured manner and said,
“It’s only for tonight, Seldon. Tomorrow morning someone will come to
install you at the University and you will be more comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Hummin, but how do you know that?”</p>
<p>“I will make arrangements. I know one or two people here”—he smiled
briefly without humor—“and I have a favor or two I can ask repayment
for. Now let’s go into some details.”</p>
<p>He gazed steadily at Seldon and said, “Whatever you have left in your
hotel room is lost. Does that include anything irreplaceable?”</p>
<p>“Nothing really irreplaceable. I have some personal items I value for
their association with my past life, but if they are gone, they are
gone. There are, of course, some notes on my paper. Some calculations.
The paper itself.”</p>
<p>“Which is now public knowledge until such time as it is removed from
circulation as dangerous—which it probably will be. Still, I’ll be able
to get my hands on a copy, I’m sure. In any case, you can reconstruct
it, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“I can. That’s why I said there was nothing really irreplaceable.
Also, I’ve lost nearly a thousand credits, some books, clothing, my
tickets back to Helicon, things like that.”</p>
<p>“All replaceable. —Now I will arrange for you to have a credit tile
in my name, charged to me. That will take care of ordinary
expenses.”</p>
<p>“That’s unusually generous of you. I can’t accept it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not generous at all, since I’m hoping to save the Empire in
that fashion. You must accept it.”</p>
<p>“But how much can you afford, Hummin? I’ll be using it, at best, with
an uneasy conscience.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you need for survival or reasonable comfort I can afford,
Seldon. Naturally, I wouldn’t want you to try to buy the University
gymnasium or hand out a million credits in largess.”</p>
<p>“You needn’t worry, but with my name on record—”</p>
<p>“It might as well be. It is absolutely forbidden for the Imperial
government to exercise any security control over the University or its
members. There is complete freedom. Anything can be discussed here,
anything can be said here.”</p>
<p>“What about violent crime?”</p>
<p>“Then the University authorities themselves handle it, with reason
and care—and there are virtually no crimes of violence. The students and
faculty appreciate their freedom and understand its terms. Too much
rowdiness, the beginning of riot and bloodshed, and the government may
feel it has a right to break the unwritten agreement and send in the
troops. No one wants that, not even the government, so a delicate
balance is maintained. In other words, Demerzel himself cannot have you
plucked out of the University without a great deal more cause than
anyone in the University has given the government in at least a century
and a half. On the other hand, if you are lured off the grounds by a
student-agent—”</p>
<p>“Are there student-agents?”</p>
<p>“How can I say? There may be. Any ordinary individual can be
threatened or maneuvered or simply bought—and may remain thereafter in
the service of Demerzel or of someone else, for that matter. So I must
emphasize this: You are safe in any reasonable sense, but no one is
absolutely safe. You will have to be careful. But though I give you that
warning, I don’t want you to cower through life. On the whole, you will
be far more secure here than you would have been if you had returned to
Helicon or gone to any world of the Galaxy outside Trantor.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” said Seldon drearily.</p>
<p>“I know so,” said Hummin, “or I would not feel it wise to leave
you.”</p>
<p>“Leave me?” Seldon looked up sharply. “You can’t do that. You know
this world. I don’t.”</p>
<p>“You will be with others who know this world, who know this part of
it, in fact, even better than I do. As for myself, I must go. I have
been with you all this day and I dare not abandon my own life any
longer. I must not attract too much attention to myself. Remember that I
have my own insecurities, just as you have yours.”</p>
<p>Seldon blushed. “You’re right. I can’t expect you to endanger
yourself indefinitely on my behalf. I hope you are not already
ruined.”</p>
<p>Hummin said coolly, “Who can tell? We live in dangerous times. Just
remember that if anyone can make the times safe—if not for ourselves,
then for those who follow after us—it is you. Let that thought be your
driving force, Seldon.”</p>
