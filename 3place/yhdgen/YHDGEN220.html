<h4 id="section">82</h4>
<p>The man who entered was tall and muscular. He had a long blond
mustache that curled up at the tips and a fringe of hair that went down
the sides of his face and under his chin, leaving the point of his chin
and his lower lip smoothly bare and seeming a little moist. His head was
so closely cropped and his hair was so light that, for one unpleasant
moment, Seldon was reminded of Mycogen.</p>
<p>The newcomer wore what was unmistakably a uniform. It was red and
white and about his waist was a wide belt decorated with silver
studs.</p>
<p>His voice, when he spoke, was a rolling bass and its accent was not
like any that Seldon had heard before. Most unfamiliar accents sounded
uncouth in Seldon’s experience, but this one seemed almost musical,
perhaps because of the richness of the low tones.</p>
<p>“I am Sergeant Emmer Thalus,” he rumbled in a slow succession of
syllables. “I have come seeking Dr. Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I am he.” In an aside to Dors, he muttered, “If Hummin
couldn’t come himself, he certainly sent a magnificent side of beef to
represent him.”</p>
<p>The sergeant favored Seldon with a stolid and slightly prolonged
look. Then he said, “Yes. You have been described to me. Please come
with me, Dr. Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Lead the way.”</p>
<p>The sergeant stepped backward. Seldon and Dors Venabili stepped
forward.</p>
<p>The sergeant stopped and raised a large hand, palm toward Dors. “I
have been instructed to take Dr. Hari Seldon with me. I have not been
instructed to take anyone else.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Seldon looked at him uncomprehendingly. Then his look
of surprise gave way to anger. “It’s quite impossible that you have been
told that, Sergeant. Dr. Dors Venabili is my associate and my companion.
She must come with me.”</p>
<p>“That is not in accordance with my instructions, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about your instructions in any way, Sergeant Thalus. I
do not budge without her.”</p>
<p>“What’s more,” said Dors with clear irritation, “my instructions are
to protect Dr. Seldon at all times. I cannot do that unless I am with
him. Therefore, where he goes, I go.”</p>
<p>The sergeant looked puzzled. “My instructions are strict that I see
to it that no harm comes to you, Dr. Seldon. If you will not come
voluntarily, I must carry you to my vehicle. I will try to do so
gently.”</p>
<p>He extended his two arms as though to seize Seldon by the waist and
carry him off bodily.</p>
<p>Seldon skittered backward and out of reach. As he did so, the side of
his right palm came down on the sergeant’s right upper arm where the
muscles were thinnest, so that he struck the bone.</p>
<p>The sergeant drew a sudden deep breath and seemed to shake himself a
bit, but turned, face expressionless, and advanced again. Davan,
watching, remained where he was, motionless, but Raych moved behind the
sergeant.</p>
<p>Seldon repeated his palm stroke a second time, then a third, but now
Sergeant Thalus, anticipating the blow, lowered his shoulder to catch it
on hard muscle.</p>
<p>Dors had drawn her knives.</p>
<p>“Sergeant,” she said forcefully. “Turn in this direction. I want you
to understand I may be forced to hurt you severely if you persist in
attempting to carry Dr. Seldon off against his will.”</p>
<p>The sergeant paused, seemed to take in the slowly waving knives
solemnly, then said, “It is not in my instructions to refrain from
harming anyone but Dr. Seldon.”</p>
<p>His right hand moved with surprising speed toward the neuronic whip
in the holster at his hip. Dors moved as quickly forward, knives
flashing.</p>
<p>Neither completed the movement.</p>
<p>Dashing forward, Raych had pushed at the sergeant’s back with his
left hand and withdrew the sergeant’s weapon from its holster with his
right. He moved away quickly, holding the neuronic whip in both hands
now and shouting, “Hands up, Sergeant, or you’re gonna get it!”</p>
<p>The sergeant whirled and a nervous look crossed his reddening face.
It was the only moment that its stolidity had weakened. “Put that down,
sonny,” he growled. “You don’t know how it works.”</p>
<p>Raych howled, “I know about the safety. It’s off and this thing can
fire. And it will if you try to rush me.”</p>
<p>The sergeant froze. He clearly knew how dangerous it was to have an
excited twelve-year-old handling a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>Nor did Seldon feel much better. He said, “Careful, Raych. Don’t
shoot. Keep your finger off the contact.”</p>
<p>“I ain’t gonna let him rush me.”</p>
<p>“He won’t. —Sergeant, please don’t move. Let’s get something
straight. You were told to take me away from here. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said the sergeant, eyes somewhat protruding and
firmly fixed on Raych (whose eyes were as firmly fixed on the
sergeant).</p>
<p>“But you were not told to take anyone else. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“No, I was not, Doctor,” said the sergeant firmly. Not even the
threat of a neuronic whip was going to make him weasel. One could see
that.</p>
<p>“Very well, but listen to me, Sergeant. Were you told not to take
anyone else?”</p>
<p>“I just said—”</p>
<p>“No no. Listen, Sergeant. There’s a difference. Were your
instructions simply ‘Take Dr. Seldon!’? Was that the entire order, with
no mention of anyone else, or were the orders more specific? Were your
orders as follows: ‘Take Dr. Seldon and don’t take anyone else’?”</p>
<p>The sergeant turned that over in his head, then he said, “I was told
to take you, Dr. Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Then there was no mention of anyone else, one way or the other, was
there?”</p>
<p>Pause. “No.”</p>
<p>“You were not told to take Dr. Venabili, but you were not told not to
take Dr. Venabili either. Is that right?”</p>
<p>Pause. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“So you can either take her or not take her, whichever you
please?”</p>
<p>Long pause. “I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“Now then, here’s Raych, the young fellow who’s got a neuronic whip
pointing at you—your neuronic whip, remember—and he is anxious to use
it.”</p>
<p>“Yay!” shouted Raych.</p>
<p>“Not yet, Raych,” said Seldon. “And here is Dr. Venabili with two
knives that she can use very expertly and there’s myself, who can, if I
get the chance, break your Adam’s apple with one hand so that you’ll
never speak above a whisper again. Now then, do you want to take
Dr. Venabili or don’t you want to? Your orders allow you to do
either.”</p>
<p>And finally the sergeant said in a beaten voice, “I will take the
woman.”</p>
<p>“And the boy, Raych.”</p>
<p>“And the boy.”</p>
<p>“Good. Have I your word of honor—your word of honor as a soldier—that
you will do as you have just said … honestly?”</p>
<p>“You have my word of honor as a soldier,” said the sergeant.</p>
<p>“Good. Raych, give back the whip. —Now. —Don’t make me wait.”</p>
<p>Raych, his face twisted into an unhappy grimace, looked at Dors, who
hesitated and then slowly nodded her head. Her face was as unhappy as
Raych’s.</p>
<p>Raych held out the neuronic whip to the sergeant and said, “They’re
makin’ me, ya big—” His last words were unintelligible.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Put away your knives, Dors.”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head, but put them away.</p>
<p>“Now, Sergeant?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>The sergeant looked at the neuronic whip, then at Seldon. He said,
“You are an honorable man, Dr. Seldon, and my word of honor holds.” With
a military snap, he placed his neuronic whip in his holster.</p>
<p>Seldon turned to Davan and said, “Davan, please forget what you have
seen here. We three are going voluntarily with Sergeant Thalus. You tell
Yugo Amaryl when you see him that I will not forget him and that, once
this is over and I am free to act, I will see that he gets into a
University. And if there’s anything reasonable I can ever do for your
cause, Davan, I will. —Now, Sergeant, let’s go.”</p>
