<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>Tamwile Elar was thirty-six years old and had joined Seldon’s
Psychohistory Project as Senior Mathematician four years earlier. He was
a tall man, with a habitual twinkle in his eye and with more than a
touch of self-assurance as well.</p>
<p>His hair was brown and had a loose wave in it, the more noticeable
because he wore it rather long. He had an abrupt way of laughing, but
there was no fault to be found with his mathematical ability.</p>
<p>Elar had been recruited from the West Mandanov University and Seldon
always had to smile when he remembered how suspicious Yugo Amaryl had
been of him at first. But then, Amaryl was suspicious of everyone. Deep
in his heart (Seldon felt sure), Amaryl felt that psychohistory ought to
have remained his and Hari’s private province.</p>
<p>But even Amaryl was now willing to admit that Elar’s membership in
the group had eased his own situation tremendously. Yugo said, “His
techniques for avoiding chaos are unique and fascinating. No one else in
the Project could have worked it out the way he did. Certainly nothing
of this sort ever occurred to me. It didn’t occur to you, either,
Hari.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon grumpily, “I’m getting old.”</p>
<p>“If only,” said Amaryl, “he didn’t laugh so loud.”</p>
<p>“People can’t help the way they laugh.”</p>
<p>Yet the truth was that Seldon found himself having a little trouble
accepting Elar. It was rather humiliating that he himself had come
nowhere near the “achaotic equations,” as they were now called. It
didn’t bother Seldon that he had never thought of the principle behind
the Electro-Clarifier—that was not really his field. The achaotic
equations, however, he should, indeed, have thought of—or at least
gotten close to.</p>
<p>He tried reasoning with himself. Seldon had worked out the entire
basis for psychohistory and the achaotic equations grew naturally out of
that basis. Could Elar have done Seldon’s work three decades earlier?
Seldon was convinced that Elar couldn’t have. And was it so remarkable
that Elar had thought up the principle of achaotism once the basis was
in place?</p>
<p>All this was very sensible and very true, yet Seldon still found
himself uneasy when facing Elar. Just slightly edgy. Weary age facing
flamboyant youth.</p>
<p>Yet Elar never gave him obvious cause for feeling the difference in
years. He never failed to show Seldon full respect or in any way to
imply that the older man had passed his prime.</p>
<p>Of course, Elar was interested in the forthcoming festivities and had
even, as Seldon had discovered, been the first to suggest that Seldon’s
birthday be celebrated. (Was this a nasty emphasis on Seldon’s age?
Seldon dismissed the possibility. If he believed that, it would mean he
was picking up some of Dors’s tricks of suspicion.</p>
<p>Elar strode toward him and said, “Maestro—” And Seldon winced, as
always. He much preferred to have the senior members of the Project call
him Hari, but it seemed such a small point to make a fuss over.</p>
<p>“Maestro,” said Elar. “The word is out that you’ve been called in for
a conference with General Tennar.”</p>
<p>“Yes. He’s the new head of the military junta and I suppose he wants
to see me to ask what psychohistory is all about. They’ve been asking me
that since the days of Cleon and Demerzel.” (The new head! The junta was
like a kaleidoscope, with some of its members periodically falling from
grace and others rising from nowhere.)</p>
<p>“But it’s my understanding he wants it now—right in the middle of the
birthday celebration.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. You can all celebrate without me.”</p>
<p>“No, we can’t, Maestro. I hope you don’t mind, but some of us got
together and put in a call to the Palace and put the appointment off for
a week.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Seldon, annoyed. “Surely that was presumptuous of
you—and risky, besides.”</p>
<p>“It worked out well. They’ve put it off and you’ll need that
time.”</p>
<p>“Why would I need a week?”</p>
<p>Elar hesitated. “May I speak frankly, Maestro?”</p>
<p>“Of course you can. When have I ever asked that anyone speak to me in
any way but frankly?”</p>
<p>Elar flushed slightly, his fair skin reddening, but his voice
remained steady. “It’s not easy to say this, Maestro. You’re a genius at
mathematics. No one on the Project has any doubt of that. No one in the
Empire—if they knew you and understood mathematics—would have any doubt
about it. However, it is not given to anybody to be a universal
genius.”</p>
<p>“I know that as well as you do, Elar.”</p>
<p>“I know you do. Specifically, though, you lack the ability to handle
ordinary people—shall we say, stupid people. You lack a certain
deviousness, a certain ability to sidestep, and if you are dealing with
someone who is both powerful in government and somewhat stupid, you can
easily endanger the Project and, for that matter, your own life, simply
because you are too frank.”</p>
<p>“What is this? Am I suddenly a child? I’ve been dealing with
politicians for a long time. I was First Minister for ten years, as
perhaps you may remember.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Maestro, but you were not an extraordinarily effective
one. You dealt with First Minister Demerzel, who was very intelligent,
by all accounts, and with the Emperor Cleon, who was very friendly. Now
you will encounter military people who are neither intelligent nor
friendly—another matter entirely.”</p>
<p>“I’ve even dealt with military people and survived.”</p>
<p>“Not with General Dugal Tennar. He’s another sort of thing
altogether. I know him.”</p>
<p>“You know him? You have met him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know him personally, but he’s from Mandanov, which, as you
know, is my sector, and he was a power there before he joined the junta
and rose through its ranks.”</p>
<p>“And what do you know about him?”</p>
<p>“Ignorant, superstitious, violent. He is not someone you can handle
easily—or safely. You can use the week to work out methods for dealing
with him.”</p>
<p>Seldon bit his lower lip. There was something to what Elar said and
Seldon recognized the fact that, while he had plans of his own, it would
still be difficult to try to manipulate a stupid, self-important,
short-tempered person with overwhelming force at his disposal.</p>
<p>He said uneasily, “I’ll manage somehow. The whole matter of a
military junta is, in any case, an unstable situation in the Trantor of
today. It has already lasted longer than might have seemed likely.”</p>
<p>“Have we been testing that? I was not aware that we were making
stability decisions on the junta.”</p>
<p>“Just a few calculations by Amaryl, making use of your achaotic
equations.” He paused. “By the way, I’ve come across some references to
them as the Elar Equations.”</p>
<p>“Not by me, Maestro.”</p>
<p>“I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t want that. Psychohistoric
elements are to be described functionally and not personally. As soon as
personalities intervene, bad feelings arise.”</p>
<p>“I understand and quite agree, Maestro.”</p>
<p>“In fact,” said Seldon with a touch of guilt, “I have always felt it
wrong that we speak of the basic Seldon Equations of Psychohistory. The
trouble is that’s been in use for so many years, it’s not practical to
try to change it.”</p>
<p>“If you’ll excuse my saying so, Maestro, you’re an exceptional case.
No one, I think, would quarrel with your receiving full credit for
inventing the science of psychohistory. —But, if I may, I wish to get
back to your meeting with General Tennar.”</p>
<p>“Well, what else is there to say?”</p>
<p>“I can’t help but wonder if it might be better if you did not see
him, did not speak to him, did not deal with him.”</p>
<p>“How am I to avoid that if he calls me in for a conference?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you can plead illness and send someone in your place.”</p>
<p>“Whom?”</p>
<p>Elar was silent for a moment, but his silence was eloquent.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You, I take it.”</p>
<p>“Might that not be the thing to do? I am a fellow sectoral citizen of
the General, which may carry some weight. You are a busy man, getting on
in years, and it would be easy to believe that you are not entirely
well. And if I see him, rather than yourself—please excuse me, Maestro—I
can wiggle and maneuver more easily than you can.”</p>
<p>“Lie, you mean.”</p>
<p>“If necessary.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be taking a huge chance.”</p>
<p>“Not too huge. I doubt that he will order my execution. If he becomes
annoyed with me, as he well might, then I can plead—or you can plead on
my behalf—youth and inexperience. In any case, if I get into trouble,
that will be far less dangerous than if you were to do so. I’m thinking
of the Project, which can do without me a great deal more easily than it
can do without you.”</p>
<p>Seldon said with a frown, “I’m not going to hide behind you, Elar. If
the man wants to see me, he will see me. I refuse to shiver and shake
and ask you to take chances for me. What do you think I am?”</p>
<p>“A frank and honest man—when the need is for a devious one.”</p>
<p>“I will manage to be devious—if I must. Please don’t underestimate
me, Elar.”</p>
<p>Elar shrugged hopelessly. “Very well. I can only argue with you up to
a certain point.”</p>
<p>“In fact, Elar, I wish you had not postponed the meeting. I would
rather skip my birthday and see the General than the reverse. This
birthday celebration was not my idea.” His voice died away in a
grumble.</p>
<p>Elar said, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon with resignation, “we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>He turned and left. Sometimes he wished ardently that he could run
what was called a “tight ship,” making sure that everything went as he
wished it to, leaving little or no room for maneuvering among his
subordinates. To do that, however, would take enormous time, enormous
effort, would deprive him of any chance of working on psychohistory
himself—and, besides, he simply lacked the temperament for it.</p>
<p>He sighed. He would have to speak to Amaryl.</p>
