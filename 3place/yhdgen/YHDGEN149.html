<h4 id="section">11</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon remained uncomfortably silent for a while after Hummin’s
quiet statement. He shrank within himself in sudden recognition of his
own deficiencies.</p>
<p>He had invented a new science: psychohistory. He had extended the
laws of probability in a very subtle manner to take into account new
complexities and uncertainties and had ended up with elegant equations
in innumerable unknowns. —Possibly an infinite number; he couldn’t
tell.</p>
<p>But it was a mathematical game and nothing more.</p>
<p>He had psychohistory—or at least the basis of psychohistory—but only
as a mathematical curiosity. Where was the historical knowledge that
could perhaps give some meaning to the empty equations?</p>
<p>He had none. He had never been interested in history. He knew the
outline of Heliconian history. Courses in that small fragment of the
human story had, of course, been compulsory in the Heliconian schools.
But what was there beyond that? Surely what else he had picked up was
merely the bare skeletons that everyone gathered—half legend, the other
half surely distorted.</p>
<p>Still, how could one say that the Galactic Empire was dying? It had
existed for ten thousand years as an accepted Empire and even before
that, Trantor, as the capital of the dominating kingdom, had held what
was a virtual empire for two thousand years. The Empire had survived the
early centuries when whole sections of the Galaxy would now and then
refuse to accept the end of their local independence. It had survived
the vicissitudes that went with the occasional rebellions, the dynastic
wars, some serious periods of breakdown. Most worlds had scarcely been
troubled by such things and Trantor itself had grown steadily until it
was the worldwide human habitation that now called itself the Eternal
World.</p>
<p>To be sure, in the last four centuries, turmoil had increased somehow
and there had been a rash of Imperial assassinations and takeovers. But
even that was calming down and right now the Galaxy was as quiet as it
had ever been. Under Cleon I and before him under his father, Stanel VI,
the worlds were prosperous—and Cleon himself was not considered a
tyrant. Even those who disliked the Imperium as an institution rarely
had anything truly bad to say about Cleon, much as they might inveigh
against Eto Demerzel.</p>
<p>Why, then, should Hummin say that the Galactic Empire was dying—and
with such conviction?</p>
<p>Hummin was a journalist. He probably knew Galactic history in some
detail and he had to understand the current situation in great detail.
Was it this that supplied him with the knowledge that lay behind his
statement? In that case, just what was the knowledge?</p>
<p>Several times Seldon was on the point of asking, of demanding an
answer, but there was something in Hummin’s solemn face that stopped
him. And there was something in his own ingrained belief that the
Galactic Empire was a given, an axiom, the foundation stone on which all
argument rested that prevented him too. After all, if that was wrong, he
didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>No, he couldn’t believe that he was wrong. The Galactic Empire could
no more come to an end than the Universe itself could. Or, if the
Universe did end, then—and only then—would the Empire end.</p>
<p>Seldon closed his eyes, attempting to sleep but, of course, he could
not. Would he have to study the history of the Universe in order to
advance his theory of psychohistory?</p>
<p>How could he? Twenty-five million worlds existed, each with its own
endlessly complex history. How could he study all that? There were
book-films in many volumes, he knew, that dealt with Galactic history.
He had even skimmed one once for some now-forgotten reason and had found
it too dull to view even halfway through.</p>
<p>The book-films had dealt with important worlds. With some, it dealt
through all or almost all their history; with others, only as they
gained importance for a time and only till they faded away. He
remembered having looked up Helicon in the index and having found only
one citation. He had punched the keys that would turn up that citation
and found Helicon included in a listing of worlds which, on one
occasion, had temporarily lined up behind a certain claimant to the
Imperial throne who had failed to make good his claim. Helicon had
escaped retribution on that occasion, probably because it was not even
sufficiently important to be punished.</p>
<p>What good was such a history? Surely, psychohistory would have to
take into account the actions and reactions and interactions of each
world—each and every world. How could one study the history of
twenty-five million worlds and consider all their possible interactions?
It would surely be an impossible task and this was just one more
reinforcement of the general conclusion that psychohistory was of
theoretical interest but could never be put to any practical use.</p>
<p>Seldon felt a gentle push forward and decided that the air-taxi must
be decelerating.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve come far enough,” said Hummin, “to risk a small
stopover for a bite to eat, a glass of something or other, and a visit
to a washroom.”</p>
<p>And, in the course of the next fifteen minutes, during which the
air-taxi slowed steadily, they came to a lighted recess. The taxi
swerved inward and found a parking spot among five or six other
vehicles.</p>
