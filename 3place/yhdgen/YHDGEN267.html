<h4 id="section">10</h4>
<p>Raych looked in the mirror of his Wye hotel room somberly (it was a
pretty run-down hotel room, but Raych was not supposed to have too many
credits). He did not like what he saw. His mustache was gone; his
sideburns were shortened; his hair was clipped at the sides and
back.</p>
<p>He looked—plucked.</p>
<p>Worse than that. As a result of the change in his facial contours, he
looked baby-faced.</p>
<p>It was disgusting.</p>
<p>Nor was he making any headway. Seldon had given him the security
reports on Kaspal Kaspalov’s death, which he had studied. There wasn’t
much there. Just that Kaspalov had been murdered and that the local
security officers had come up with nothing of importance in connection
with that murder. It seemed quite clear that the security officers
attached little or no importance to it, anyway.</p>
<p>That was not surprising. In the last century, the crime rate had
risen markedly in most worlds, certainly in the grandly complex world of
Trantor, and nowhere were the local security officers up to the job of
doing anything useful about it. In fact, the security establishment had
declined in numbers and efficiency everywhere and (while this was hard
to prove) had become more corrupt. It was inevitable this should be so,
with pay refusing to keep pace with the cost of living. One must pay
civil officials to keep them honest. Failing that, they would surely
make up for their inadequate salaries in other ways.</p>
<p>Seldon had been preaching this doctrine for some years now, but it
did no good. There was no way to increase wages without increasing taxes
and the populace would not sit still for increased taxes. It seemed they
would rather lose ten times the credits in graft.</p>
<p>It was all part (Seldon had said) of the general deterioration of
Imperial society over the previous two centuries.</p>
<p>Well, what was Raych to do? He was here at the hotel where Kaspalov
had lived during the days immediately before his murder. Somewhere in
the hotel there might be someone who had something to do with that—or
who knew someone who had.</p>
<p>It seemed to Raych that he must make himself conspicuous. He must
show an interest in Kaspalov’s death and then someone would get
interested in him and pick him up. It was dangerous, but if he could
make himself sound harmless enough, they might not attack him
immediately.</p>
<p>Well—</p>
<p>Raych looked at his timeband. There would be people enjoying their
predinner aperitifs in the bar. He might as well join them and see what
would happen—if anything.</p>
