<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>Next to Sermak himself, Lewis Bort was the most active in rallying
those dissident elements which had fused into the now-vociferous Action
Party. Yet he had not been one of the deputation that had called on
Salvor Hardin almost half a year previously. That this was so was not
due to any lack of recognition of his efforts; quite the contrary. He
was absent for the very good reason that he was on Anacreon’s capital
world at the time.</p>
<p>He visited it as a private citizen. He saw no official and he did
nothing of importance. He merely watched the obscure corners of the busy
planet and poked his stubby nose into dusty crannies.</p>
<p>He arrived home toward the end of a short winter day that had started
with clouds and was finishing with snow and within an hour was seated at
the octagonal table in Sermak’s home.</p>
<p>His first words were not calculated to improve the atmosphere of a
gathering already considerably depressed by the deepening snow-filled
twilight outside.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid,” he said, “that our position is what is usually termed,
in melodramatic phraseology, a ‘Lost Cause.’ ”</p>
<p>“You think so?” said Sermak, gloomily.</p>
<p>“It’s gone past thought, Sermak. There’s no room for any other
opinion.”</p>
<p>“Armaments—” began Dokor Walto, somewhat officiously, but Bort broke
in at once.</p>
<p>“Forget that. That’s an old story.” His eyes traveled round the
circle. “I’m referring to the people. I admit that it was my idea
originally that we attempt to foster a palace rebellion of some sort to
install as king someone more favorable to the Foundation. It was a good
idea. It still is. The only trifling flaw about it is that it is
impossible. The great Salvor Hardin saw to that.”</p>
<p>Sermak said sourly, “If you’d give us the details, Bort—”</p>
<p>“Details! There aren’t any! It isn’t as simple as that. It’s the
whole damned situation on Anacreon. It’s this religion the Foundation
has established. It works!”</p>
<p>“Well!”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to see it work to appreciate it. All you see here is that
we have a large school devoted to the training of priests, and that
occasionally a special show is put on in some obscure corner of the city
for the benefit of pilgrims—and that’s all. The whole business hardly
affects us as a general thing. But on Anacreon—”</p>
<p>Lem Tarki smoothed his prim little Vandyke with one finger, and
cleared his throat. “What kind of religion is it? Hardin’s always said
that it was just a fluffy flummery to get them to accept our science
without question. You remember, Sermak, he told us that day—”</p>
<p>“Hardin’s explanations,” reminded Sermak, “don’t often mean much at
face value. But what kind of a religion is it, Bort?”</p>
<p>Bort considered. “Ethically, it’s fine. It scarcely varies from the
various philosophies of the old Empire. High moral standards and all
that. There’s nothing to complain about from that viewpoint. Religion is
one of the great civilizing influences of history and in that respect,
it’s fulfilling—”</p>
<p>“We know that,” interrupted Sermak, impatiently. “Get to the
point.”</p>
<p>“Here it is.” Bort was a trifle disconcerted, but didn’t show it.
“The religion—which the Foundation has fostered and encouraged, mind
you—is built on strictly authoritarian lines. The priesthood has sole
control of the instruments of science we have given Anacreon, but
they’ve learned to handle these tools only empirically. They believe in
this religion entirely, and in the … uh … spiritual value of the power
they handle. For instance, two months ago some fool tampered with the
power plant in the Thessalekian Temple—one of the large ones. He
contaminated the city, of course. It was considered divine vengeance by
everyone, including the priests.”</p>
<p>“I remember. The papers had some garbled version of the story at the
time. I don’t see what you’re driving at.”</p>
<p>“Then, listen,” said Bort, stiffly. “The priesthood forms a hierarchy
at the apex of which is the king, who is regarded as a sort of minor
god. He’s an absolute monarch by divine right, and the people believe
it, thoroughly, and the priests, too. You can’t over-throw a king like
that. Now do you get the point?”</p>
<p>“Hold on,” said Walto, at this point. “What did you mean when you
said Hardin’s done all this? How does he come in?”</p>
<p>Bort glanced at his questioner bitterly. “The Foundation has fostered
this delusion assiduously. We’ve put all our scientific backing behind
the hoax. There isn’t a festival at which the king does not preside
surrounded by a radioactive aura shining forth all over his body and
raising itself like a coronet above his head. Anyone touching him is
severely burned. He can move from place to place through the air at
crucial moments, supposedly by inspiration of divine spirit. He fills
the temple with a pearly, internal light at a gesture. There is no end
to these quite simple tricks that we perform for his benefit; but even
the priests believe them, while working them personally.”</p>
<p>“Bad!” said Sermak, biting his lip.</p>
<p>“I could cry—like the fountain in City Hall Park,” said Bort,
earnestly, “when I think of the chance we muffed. Take the situation
thirty years ago, when Hardin saved the Foundation from Anacreon—At that
time, the Anacreonian people had no real conception of the fact that the
Empire was running down. They had been more or less running their own
affairs since the Zeonian revolt, but even after communications broke
down and Lepold’s pirate of a grandfather made himself king, they never
quite realized the Empire had gone kaput.</p>
<p>“If the Emperor had had the nerve to try, he could have taken over
again with two cruisers and with the help of the internal revolt that
would have certainly sprung to life. And we, we could have done the
same; but no, Hardin established monarch worship. Personally, I don’t
understand it. Why? Why? Why?”</p>
<p>“What,” demanded Jaim Orsy, suddenly, “does Verisof do? There was a
day when he was an advanced Actionist. What’s he doing there? Is he
blind, too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Bort, curtly. “He’s high priest to them. As far
as I know, he does nothing but act as adviser to the priesthood on
technical details. Figurehead, blast him, figurehead!”</p>
<p>There was silence all round and all eyes turned to Sermak. The young
party leader was biting a fingernail nervously, and then said loudly,
“No good. It’s fishy!”</p>
<p>He looked around him, and added more energetically, “Is Hardin then
such a fool?”</p>
<p>“Seems to be,” shrugged Bort.</p>
<p>“Never! There’s something wrong. To cut our own throats so thoroughly
and so hopelessly would require colossal stupidity. More than Hardin
could possibly have even if he were a fool, which I deny. On the one
hand, to establish a religion that would wipe out all chance of internal
troubles. On the other hand, to arm Anacreon with all weapons of
warfare. I don’t see it.”</p>
<p>“The matter is a little obscure, I admit,” said Bort, “but the facts
are there. What else can we think?”</p>
<p>Walto said, jerkily, “Outright treason. He’s in their pay.”</p>
<p>But Sermak shook his head impatiently. “I don’t see that, either. The
whole affair is as insane and meaningless—Tell me, Bort, have you heard
anything about a battle cruiser that the Foundation is supposed to have
put into shape for use in the Anacreon navy?”</p>
<p>“Battle cruiser?”</p>
<p>“An old Imperial cruiser—”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t. But that doesn’t mean much. The navy yards are
religious sanctuaries completely inviolate on the part of the lay
public. No one ever hears anything about the fleet.”</p>
<p>“Well, rumors have leaked out. Some of the Party have brought the
matter up in Council. Hardin never denied it, you know. His spokesmen
denounced rumor mongers and let it go at that. It might have
significance.”</p>
<p>“It’s of a piece with the rest,” said Bort. “If true, it’s absolutely
crazy. But it wouldn’t be worse than the rest.”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” said Orsy, “Hardin hasn’t any secret weapon waiting.
That might—”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Sermak, viciously, “a huge jack-in-the-box that will jump
out at the psychological moment and scare old Wienis into fits. The
Foundation may as well blow itself out of existence and save itself the
agony of suspense if it has to depend on any secret weapon.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Orsy, changing the subject hurriedly, “the question
comes down to this: How much time have we left? Eh, Bort?”</p>
<p>“All right. It is the question. But don’t look at me; I don’t know.
The Anacreonian press never mentions the Foundation at all. Right now,
it’s full of the approaching celebrations and nothing else. Lepold is
coming of age next week, you know.”</p>
<p>“We have months then.” Walto smiled for the first time that evening.
“That gives us time—”</p>
<p>“That gives us time, my foot,” ground out Bort, impatiently. “The
king’s a god, I tell you. Do you suppose he has to carry on a campaign
of propaganda to get his people into fighting spirit? Do you suppose he
has to accuse us of aggression and pull out all stops on cheap
emotionalism? When the time comes to strike, Lepold gives the order and
the people fight. Just like that. That’s the damnedness of the system.
You don’t question a god. He may give the order tomorrow for all I know;
and you can wrap tobacco round that and smoke it.”</p>
<p>Everyone tried to talk at once and Sermak was slamming the table for
silence, when the front door opened and Levi Norast stamped in. He
bounded up the stairs, overcoat on, trailing snow.</p>
<p>“Look at that!” he cried, tossing a cold, snow-speckled newspaper
onto the table. “The visicasters are full of it, too.”</p>
<p>The newspaper was unfolded and five heads bent over it.</p>
<p>Sermak said, in a hushed voice, “Great Space, he’s going to Anacreon!
Going to Anacreon!”</p>
<p>“It is treason,” squeaked Tarki, in sudden excitement. “I’ll be
damned if Walto isn’t right. He’s sold us out and now he’s going there
to collect his wage.”</p>
<p>Sermak had risen. “We’ve no choice now. I’m going to ask the Council
tomorrow that Hardin be impeached. And if that fails—”</p>
