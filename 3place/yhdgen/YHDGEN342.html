<h4 id="section">33</h4>
<p>It was midafternoon and the Trantorian sun glinted on the metal skin
covering the great planet. Hari Seldon stood at the edge of the
Streeling University observation deck, attempting to shield his eyes
from the harsh glare with his hand. It had been years since he’d been
out from under the dome, save for his few visits to the Palace, and
somehow those didn’t count; one was still very much enclosed on the
Imperial grounds.</p>
<p>Seldon no longer traveled around only if accompanied. In the first
place, Palver spent the majority of his time with Wanda, either working
on the Prime Radiant, absorbed in mentalic research, or searching for
others like them. But if he had wanted, Seldon could have found another
young man—a University student or a Project member—to act as his
bodyguard.</p>
<p>However, Seldon knew that a bodyguard was no longer necessary. Since
the much publicized hearing and the reestablishment of ties with the
Galactic Library, the Commission for Public Safety had taken a keen
interest in Seldon. Seldon knew that he was being followed; he had
caught sight of his “shadow” on a number of occasions in the past few
months. He also had no doubt that his home and office had been
infiltrated by listening devices, but he himself activated a static
shield whenever he engaged in sensitive communications.</p>
<p>Seldon was not sure what the Commission thought of him—perhaps they
were not yet sure themselves. Regardless of whether they believed him to
be a prophet or a crackpot, they made it their business to know where he
was at all times—and that meant that, until the Commission deemed
otherwise, at all times Seldon was safe.</p>
<p>A light breeze billowed the deep blue cloak Seldon had draped over
his unisuit and ruffled the few wispy white hairs remaining on his head.
He glanced down over the railing, taking in the seamless steel blanket
below. Beneath that blanket, Seldon knew, rumbled the machinery of a
vastly complicated world. If the dome were transparent, one would see
ground-cars racing, gravicabs swooshing through an intricate network of
interconnecting tunnels, space hyperships being loaded and unloaded with
grain and chemicals and jewels bound for and from practically every
world of the Empire.</p>
<p>Below the gleaming metal cover, the lives of forty billion people
were being conducted, with all the attendant pain, joy, and drama of
human life. It was an image he loved dearly—this panorama of human
achievement—and it pierced his heart to know that, in just a few
centuries, all that now lay before him would be in ruins. The great dome
would be ripped and scarred, torn away to reveal the desolate wasteland
of what was once the seat of a thriving civilization. He shook his head
in sadness, for he knew there was nothing he could do to prevent that
tragedy. But, as Seldon foresaw the ruined dome, he also knew that from
the ground laid bare by the last battles of the Empire living shoots
would spring and somehow Trantor would reemerge as a vital member of the
new Empire. The Plan saw to that.</p>
<p>Seldon lowered himself onto one of the benches ringing the deck’s
perimeter. His leg was throbbing painfully; the exertion of the trip had
been a bit much. But it had been worth it to gaze once again at Trantor,
to feel the open air around him and see the vast sky above.</p>
<p>Seldon thought wistfully of Wanda. He rarely saw his granddaughter at
all anymore and invariably Stettin Palver was present when he did. In
the three months since Wanda and Palver had met, they seemed to be
inseparable. Wanda assured Seldon that the constant involvement was
necessary for the Project, but Seldon suspected it went deeper than mere
devotion to one’s job.</p>
<p>He remembered the telltale signs from his early days with Dors. It
was there in the way the two young people looked at each other, with an
intensity born not only of intellectual stimulation but emotional
motivation as well.</p>
<p>Further, by their very natures, Wanda and Palver seemed to be more
comfortable with each other than with other people. In fact, Seldon had
discovered that when no one else was around, Wanda and Palver didn’t
even talk to each other; their mentalic abilities were sufficiently
advanced that they had no need of words to communicate.</p>
<p>The other Project members were not aware of Wanda’s and Palver’s
unique talents. Seldon had felt it best to keep the mentalics’ work
quiet, at least until their role in the Plan was firmly defined.
Actually the Plan itself was firmly defined—but solely in Seldon’s mind.
As a few more pieces fell into place, he would reveal his Plan to Wanda
and Palver and someday, of necessity, to one or two others.</p>
<p>Seldon stood slowly, stiffly. He was due back at Streeling in an hour
to meet Wanda and Palver. They had left word for him that they were
bringing a great surprise. Another piece for the puzzle, Seldon hoped.
He looked out one last time over Trantor and, before turning to make his
way back to the gravitic repulsion elevator, smiled and softly said,
“Foundation.”</p>
