<p>“May I interrupt you, Yugo?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Dors,” said Yugo Amaryl with a large smile. “You are
never an interruption. What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“I am trying to find out a few things, Yugo, and I wonder if you
would humor me in this.”</p>
<p>“If I can.”</p>
<p>“You have something in the Project called the Prime Radiant. I hear
of it now and then. Hari speaks of it, so I imagine I know what it looks
like when it is activated, but I have never actually seen it in
operation. I would like to.”</p>
<p>Amaryl looked uncomfortable. “Actually the Prime Radiant is just
about the most closely guarded part of the Project and you aren’t on the
list of the members who have access.”</p>
<p>“I know that, but we’ve known each other for twenty-eight years—”</p>
<p>“And you’re Hari’s wife. I suppose we can stretch a point. We only
have two full Prime Radiants. There’s one in Hari’s office and one here.
Right there, in fact.”</p>
<p>Dors looked at the squat black cube on the central desk. It looked
utterly undistinguished. “Is that it?”</p>
<p>“That’s it. It stores the equations that describe the future.”</p>
<p>“How do you get at those equations?”</p>
<p>Amaryl moved a contact and at once the room darkened and then came to
life in a variegated glow. All around Dors were symbols, arrows, lines,
mathematical signs of one sort or another. They seemed to be moving,
spiraling, but when she focused her eyes on any particular portion, it
seemed to be standing still.</p>
<p>She said, “Is that the future, then?”</p>
<p>“It may be,” said Amaryl, turning off the instrument. “I had it at
full expansion so you could see the symbols. Without expansion, nothing
is visible but patterns of light and dark.”</p>
<p>“And by studying those equations, you are able to judge what the
future holds in store for us?”</p>
<p>“In theory.” The room was now back to its mundane appearance. “But
there are two difficulties.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What are they?”</p>
<p>“To begin with, no human mind has created those equations directly.
We have merely spent decades programming more powerful computers and
they have devised and stored the equations, but, of course, we don’t
know if they are valid and have meaning. It depends entirely on how
valid and meaningful the programming is in the first place.”</p>
<p>“They could be all wrong, then?”</p>
<p>“They could be.” Amaryl rubbed his eyes and Dors could not help
thinking how old and tired he seemed to have grown in the last couple of
years. He was younger than Hari by nearly a dozen years, but he seemed
much older.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Amaryl went on in a rather weary voice, “we hope that
they aren’t all wrong, but that’s where the second difficulty comes in.
Although Hari and I have been testing and modifying them for decades, we
can never be sure what the equations mean. The computer has constructed
them, so it is to be presumed they must mean something—but what? There
are portions that we think we have worked out. In fact, right now, I’m
working on what we call Section A-23, a particularly knotty system of
relationships. We have not yet been able to match it with anything in
the real Universe. Still, each year sees us further advanced and I look
forward confidently to the establishment of psychohistory as a
legitimate and useful technique for dealing with the future.”</p>
<p>“How many people have access to these Prime Radiants?”</p>
<p>“Every mathematician in the Project has access but not at will. There
have to be applications and time allotted and the Prime Radiant has to
be adjusted to the portion of the equations a mathematician wishes to
refer to. It gets a little complicated when everyone wants to use the
Prime Radiant at the same time. Right now, things are slow, possibly
because we’re still in the aftermath of Hari’s birthday
celebration.”</p>
<p>“Is there any plan for constructing additional Prime Radiants?”</p>
<p>Amaryl thrust out his lips. “Yes and no. It would be very helpful if
we had a third, but someone would have to be in charge of it. It can’t
just be a community possession. I have suggested to Hari that Tamwile
Elar—you know him, I think—”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“That Elar have a third Prime Radiant. His achaotic equations and the
Electro-Clarifier he thought up make him clearly the third man in the
Project after Hari and myself. Hari hesitates, however.”</p>
<p>“Why? Do you know?”</p>
<p>“If Elar gets one, he is openly recognized as the third man, over the
head of other mathematicians who are older and who have more senior
status in the Project. There might be some political difficulties, so to
speak. I think that we can’t waste time in worrying about internal
politics, but Hari— Well, you know Hari.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know Hari. Suppose I tell you that Linn has seen the Prime
Radiant.”</p>
<p>“Linn?”</p>
<p>“Colonel Hender Linn of the junta. Tennar’s lackey.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that very much, Dors.”</p>
<p>“He has spoken of spiraling equations and I have just seen them
produced by the Prime Radiant. I can’t help but think he’s been here and
seen it working.”</p>
<p>Amaryl shook his head, “I can’t imagine anyone bringing a member of
the junta into Hari’s office—or mine.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, who in the Project do you think is capable of working with
the junta in this fashion?”</p>
<p>“No one,” said Amaryl flatly and with clearly unlimited faith. “That
would be unthinkable. Perhaps Linn never saw the Prime Radiant but was
merely told about it.”</p>
<p>“Who would tell him about it?”</p>
<p>Amaryl thought a moment and said, “No one.”</p>
<p>“Well now, you talked about internal politics a while ago in
connection with the possibility of Elar having a third Prime Radiant. I
suppose in a Project such as this one with hundreds of people, there are
little feuds going on all the time—frictions—quarrels.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Poor Hari talks to me about it every once in a while. He has
to deal with them in one way or another and I can well imagine what a
headache it must be for him.”</p>
<p>“Are these feuds so bad that they interfere with the working of the
Project?”</p>
<p>“Not seriously.”</p>
<p>“Are there any people who are more quarrelsome than others or any who
draw more resentment than others? In short, are there people you can get
rid of and perhaps remove 90 percent of the friction at the cost of 5 or
6 percent of the personnel?”</p>
<p>Amaryl raised his eyebrows. “It sounds like a good idea, but I don’t
know whom to get rid of. I don’t really participate in all the minutiae
of internal politics. There’s no way of stopping it, so for my part, I
merely avoid it.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange,” said Dors. “Aren’t you in this way denying any
credibility to psychohistory?”</p>
<p>“In what way?”</p>
<p>“How can you pretend to reach a point where you can predict and guide
the future, when you cannot analyze and correct something as homegrown
as personal frictions in the very Project that promises so much?”</p>
<p>Amaryl chuckled softly. It was unusual, for he was not a man who was
given to humor and laughter. “I’m sorry, Dors, but you picked on the one
problem that we have solved, after a manner of speaking. Hari himself
identified the equations that represented the difficulties of personal
friction years ago and I myself then added the final touch last
year.</p>
<p>“I found that there were ways in which the equations could be changed
so as to indicate a reduction in friction. In every such case, however,
a reduction in friction here meant an increase in friction there. Never
at any time was there a total decrease or, for that matter, a total
increase in the friction within a closed group—that is, one in which no
old members leave and no new members come in. What I proved, with the
help of Elar’s achaotic equations, was that this was true despite any
conceivable action anyone could take. Hari calls it ‘the law of
conservation of personal problems.’</p>
<p>“It gave rise to the notion that social dynamics has its conservation
laws as physics does and that, in fact, it is these laws that offer us
the best possible tools for solving the truly troublesome aspects of
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Rather impressive, but what if you end up finding that
nothing at all can be changed, that everything that is bad is conserved,
and that to save the Empire from destruction is merely to increase
destruction of another kind?”</p>
<p>“Actually some have suggested that, but I don’t believe it.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Back to reality. Is there anything in the frictional
problems within the Project that threaten Hari? I mean, with physical
harm.”</p>
<p>“Harm Hari? Of course not. How can you suggest such a thing?”</p>
<p>“Might there not be some who resent Hari, for being too arrogant, too
pushy, too self-absorbed, too eager to grab all the credit? Or, if none
of these things apply, might they not resent him simply because he has
run the Project for so long a time?”</p>
<p>“I never heard anyone say such a thing about Hari.”</p>
<p>Dors seemed dissatisfied. “I doubt that anyone would say such things
in your hearing, of course. But thank you, Yugo, for being so helpful
and for giving me so much of your time.”</p>
<p>Amaryl stared after her as she left. He felt vaguely troubled, but
then returned to his work and let other matters drift away.</p>
