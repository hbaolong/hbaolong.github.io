<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>Limmar Ponyets was completely a-lather when the call reached his
receiver—which proves that the old bromide about telemessages and the
shower holds true even in the dark, hard space of the Galactic
Periphery.</p>
<p>Luckily that part of a free-lance trade ship which is not given over
to miscellaneous merchandise is extremely snug. So much so, that the
shower, hot water included, is located in a two-by-four cubby, ten feet
from the control panels. Ponyets heard the staccato rattle of the
receiver quite plainly.</p>
<p>Dripping suds and a growl, he stepped out to adjust the vocal, and
three hours later a second trade ship was alongside, and a grinning
youngster entered through the air tube between the ships.</p>
<p>Ponyets rattled his best chair forward and perched himself on the
pilot-swivel.</p>
<p>“What’ve you been doing, Gorm?” he asked, darkly. “Chasing me all the
way from the Foundation?”</p>
<p>Les Gorm broke out a cigarette, and shook his head definitely, “Me?
Not a chance. I’m just a sucker who happened to land on Glyptal IV the
day after the mail. So they sent me out after you with this.”</p>
<p>The tiny, gleaming sphere changed hands, and Gorm added, “It’s
confidential. Super-secret. Can’t be trusted to the sub-ether and all
that. Or so I gather. At least, it’s a Personal Capsule, and won’t open
for anyone but you.”</p>
<p>Ponyets regarded the capsule distastefully, “I can see that. And I
never knew one of these to hold good news, either.”</p>
<p>It opened in his hand and the thin, transparent tape unrolled
stiffly. His eyes swept the message quickly, for when the last of the
tape had emerged, the first was already brown and crinkled. In a minute
and a half it had turned black and, molecule by molecule, fallen
apart.</p>
<p>Ponyets grunted hollowly, “Oh, Galaxy!”</p>
<p>Les Gorm said quietly, “Can I help somehow? Or is it too secret?”</p>
<p>“It will bear telling, since you’re of the Guild. I’ve got to go to
Askone.”</p>
<p>“That place? How come?”</p>
<p>“They’ve imprisoned a trader. But keep it to yourself.”</p>
<p>Gorm’s expression jolted into anger. “Imprisoned! That’s against the
Convention.”</p>
<p>“So is the interference with local politics.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Is that what he did?” Gorm meditated. “Who’s the trader? Anyone
I know?”</p>
<p>“No!” said Ponyets sharply, and Gorm accepted the implication and
asked no further questions.</p>
<p>Ponyets was up and staring darkly out the visiplate. He mumbled
strong expressions at that part of the misty lens-form that was the body
of the Galaxy, then said loudly, “Damnedest mess! I’m way behind
quota.”</p>
<p>Light broke on Gorm’s intellect, “Hey, friend, Askone is a closed
area.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You can’t sell as much as a penknife on Askone. They
won’t buy nuclear gadgets of any sort. With my quota dead on its feet,
it’s murder to go there.”</p>
<p>“Can’t get out of it?”</p>
<p>Ponyets shook his head absently. “I know the fellow involved. Can’t
walk out on a friend. What of it? I am in the hands of the Galactic
Spirit and walk cheerfully in the way he points out.”</p>
<p>Gorm said blankly, “Huh?”</p>
<p>Ponyets looked at him, and laughed shortly. “I forgot. You never read
the ‘Book of the Spirit,’ did you?”</p>
<p>“Never heard of it,” said Gorm, curtly.</p>
<p>“Well, you would if you’d had a religious training.”</p>
<p>“Religious training? For the priesthood?” Gorm was profoundly
shocked.</p>
<p>“Afraid so. It’s my dark shame and secret. I was too much for the
Reverend Fathers, though. They expelled me, for reasons sufficient to
promote me to a secular education under the Foundation. Well, look, I’d
better push off. How’s your quota this year?”</p>
<p>Gorm crushed out his cigarette and adjusted his cap. “I’ve got my
last cargo going now. I’ll make it.”</p>
<p>“Lucky fellow,” gloomed Ponyets, and for many minutes after Les Gorm
left, he sat in motionless reverie.</p>
<p>So Eskel Gorov was on Askone—and in prison as well!</p>
<p>That was bad! In fact, considerably worse than it might appear. It
was one thing to tell a curious youngster a diluted version of the
business to throw him off and send him about his own. It was a thing of
a different sort to face the truth.</p>
<p>For Limmar Ponyets was one of the few people who happened to know
that Master Trader Eskel Gorov was not a trader at all; but that
entirely different thing, an agent of the Foundation!</p>
