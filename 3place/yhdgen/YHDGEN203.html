<h4 id="section">65</h4>
<p>Amaryl arrived a few minutes before 1400, looking warily about. His
hair was neat and his thick mustache was combed and turned up slightly
at the edges. His T-shirt was startlingly white. He did smell, but it
was a fruity odor that undoubtedly came from the slightly
over-enthusiastic use of scent. He had a bag with him.</p>
<p>Seldon, who had been waiting outside for him, seized one elbow
lightly, while Dors seized the other, and they moved rapidly into the
elevator. Having reached the correct level, they passed through the
apartment into Seldon’s room.</p>
<p>Amaryl said in a low hangdog voice, “Nobody home, huh?”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s busy,” said Seldon neutrally. He indicated the only chair
in the room, a pad directly on the floor.</p>
<p>“No,” said Amaryl. “I don’t need that. One of you two use it.” He
squatted on the floor with a graceful downward motion.</p>
<p>Dors imitated the movement, sitting on the edge of Seldon’s
floor-based mattress, but Seldon dropped down rather clumsily, having to
make use of his hands and unable, quite, to find a comfortable position
for his legs.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Well, young man, why do you want to see me?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re a mathematician. You’re the first mathematician I
ever saw—close up—so I could touch him, you know.”</p>
<p>“Mathematicians feel like anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Not to me, Dr. … Dr. … Seldon?”</p>
<p>“That’s my name.”</p>
<p>Amaryl looked pleased. “I finally remembered. —You see, I want to be
a mathematician too.”</p>
<p>“Very good. What’s stopping you?”</p>
<p>Amaryl suddenly frowned. “Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“I presume something is stopping you. Yes, I’m serious.”</p>
<p>“What’s stopping me is I’m a Dahlite, a heatsinker on Dahl. I don’t
have the money to get an education and I can’t get the credits to get an
education. A real education, I mean. All they taught me was to read and
cipher and use a computer and then I knew enough to be a heatsinker. But
I wanted more. So I taught myself.”</p>
<p>“In some ways, that’s the best kind of teaching. How did you do
that?”</p>
<p>“I knew a librarian. She was willing to help me. She was a very nice
woman and she showed me how to use computers for learning mathematics.
And she set up a software system that would connect me with other
libraries. I’d come on my days off and on mornings after my shift.
Sometimes she’d lock me in her private room so I wouldn’t be bothered by
people coming in or she would let me in when the library was closed. She
didn’t know mathematics herself, but she helped me all she could. She
was oldish, a widow lady. Maybe she thought of me as a kind of son or
something. She didn’t have children of her own.”</p>
<p>(Maybe, thought Seldon briefly, there was some other emotion involved
too, but he put the thought away. None of his business.) “I liked number
theory,” said Amaryl. “I worked some things out from what I learned from
the computer and from the book-films it used to teach me mathematics. I
came up with some new things that weren’t in the book-films.”</p>
<p>Seldon raised his eyebrows. “That’s interesting. Like what?”</p>
<p>“I’ve brought some of them to you. I’ve never showed them to anyone.
The people around me—” He shrugged. “They’d either laugh or be annoyed.
Once I tried to tell a girl I knew, but she just said I was weird and
wouldn’t see me anymore. Is it all right for me to show them to
you?”</p>
<p>“Quite all right. Believe me.”</p>
<p>Seldon held out his hand and after a brief hesitation, Amaryl handed
him the bag he was carrying.</p>
<p>For a long time, Seldon looked over Amaryl’s papers. The work was
naïve in the extreme, but he allowed no smile to cross his face. He
followed the demonstrations, not one of which was new, of course—or even
nearly new—or of any importance.</p>
<p>But that didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Seldon looked up. “Did you do all of this yourself?”</p>
<p>Amaryl, looking more than half-frightened, nodded his head.</p>
<p>Seldon extracted several sheets. “What made you think of this?” His
finger ran down a line of mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p>Amaryl looked it over, frowned, and thought about it. Then he
explained his line of thinking.</p>
<p>Seldon listened and said, “Did you ever read a book by Anat
Bigell?”</p>
<p>“On number theory?”</p>
<p>“The title was Mathematical Deduction. It wasn’t about number theory,
particularly.”</p>
<p>Amaryl shook his head. “I never heard of him. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“He worked out this theorem of yours three hundred years ago.”</p>
<p>Amaryl looked stricken. “I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you didn’t. You did it more cleverly, though. It’s not
rigorous, but—”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘rigorous’?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.” Seldon put the papers back together in a sheaf,
restored it to the bag, and said, “Make several copies of all this. Take
one copy, have it dated by an official computer, and place it under
computerized seal. My friend here, Mistress Venabili, can get you into
Streeling University without tuition on some sort of scholarship. You’ll
have to start at the beginning and take courses in other subjects than
mathematics, but—”</p>
<p>By now Amaryl had caught his breath. “Into Streeling University? They
won’t take me.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Dors, you can arrange it, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I can.”</p>
<p>“No, you can’t,” said Amaryl hotly. “They won’t take me. I’m from
Dahl.”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“They won’t take people from Dahl.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked at Dors. “What’s he talking about?”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “I really don’t know.”</p>
<p>Amaryl said, “You’re an Outworlder, Mistress. How long have you been
at Streeling?”</p>
<p>“A little over two years, Mr. Amaryl.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen Dahlites there—short, curly black hair, big
mustaches?”</p>
<p>“There are students with all kinds of appearances.”</p>
<p>“But no Dahlites. Look again the next time you’re there.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“They don’t like us. We look different. They don’t like our
mustaches.”</p>
<p>“You can shave your—” but Seldon’s voice died under the other’s
furious glance.</p>
<p>“Never. Why should I? My mustache is my manhood.”</p>
<p>“You shave your beard. That’s your manhood too.”</p>
<p>“To my people it is the mustache.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked at Dors again and murmured, “Bald heads, mustaches …
madness.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Amaryl angrily.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Tell me what else they don’t like about Dahlites.”</p>
<p>“They make up things not to like. They say we smell. They say we’re
dirty. They say we steal. They say we’re violent. They say we’re
dumb.”</p>
<p>“Why do they say all this?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s easy to say it and it makes them feel good. Sure, if we
work in the heatsinks, we get dirty and smelly. If we’re poor and held
down, some of us steal and get violent. But that isn’t the way it is
with all of us. How about those tall yellow-hairs in the Imperial Sector
who think they own the Galaxy—no, they do own the Galaxy. Don’t they
ever get violent? Don’t they steal sometimes? If they did my job, they’d
smell the way I do. If they had to live the way I have to, they’d get
dirty too.”</p>
<p>“Who denies that there are people of all kinds in all places?” said
Seldon.</p>
<p>“No one argues the matter! They just take it for granted. Master
Seldon, I’ve got to get away from Trantor. I have no chance on Trantor,
no way of earning credits, no way of getting an education, no way of
becoming a mathematician, no way of becoming anything but what they say
I am … a worthless nothing.” This last was said in frustration—and
desperation.</p>
<p>Seldon tried to be reasonable. “The person I’m renting this room from
is a Dahlite. He has a clean job. He’s educated.”</p>
<p>“Oh sure,” said Amaryl passionately. “There are some. They let a few
do it so that they can say it can be done. And those few can live nicely
as long as they stay in Dahl. Let them go outside and they’ll see how
they’re treated. And while they’re in here they make themselves feel
good by treating the rest of us like dirt. That makes them yellow-hairs
in their own eyes. What did this nice person you’re renting this room
from say when you told him you were bringing in a heatsinker? What did
he say I would be like? They’re gone now … wouldn’t be in the same place
with me.”</p>
<p>Seldon moistened his lips. “I won’t forget you. I’ll see to it that
you’ll get off Trantor and into my own University in Helicon—once I’m
back there myself.”</p>
<p>“Do you promise that? Your word of honor? Even though I’m a
Dahlite?”</p>
<p>“The fact that you’re a Dahlite is unimportant to me. The fact that
you are already a mathematician is! But I still can’t quite grasp what
you’re telling me. I find it impossible to believe that there would be
such unreasoning feeling against harmless people.”</p>
<p>Amaryl said bitterly, “That’s because you’ve never had any occasion
to interest yourself in such things. It can all pass right under your
nose and you wouldn’t smell a thing because it doesn’t affect you.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Mr. Amaryl, Dr. Seldon is a mathematician like you and
his head can sometimes be in the clouds. You must understand that. I am
a historian, however. I know that it isn’t unusual to have one group of
people look down upon another group. There are peculiar and almost
ritualistic hatreds that have no rational justification and that can
have their serious historical influence. It’s too bad.”</p>
<p>Amaryl said, “Saying something is ‘too bad’ is easy. You say you
disapprove, which makes you a nice person, and then you can go about
your own business and not be interested anymore. It’s a lot worse than
‘too bad.’ It’s against everything decent and natural. We’re all of us
the same, yellow-hairs and black-hairs, tall and short, Easterners,
Westerners, Southerners, and Outworlders. We’re all of us, you and I and
even the Emperor, descended from the people of Earth, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Descended from what?” asked Seldon. He turned to look at Dors, his
eyes wide.</p>
<p>“From the people of Earth!” shouted Amaryl. “The one planet on which
human beings originated.”</p>
<p>“One planet? Just one planet?”</p>
<p>“The only planet. Sure. Earth.”</p>
<p>“When you say Earth, you mean Aurora, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Aurora? What’s that? —I mean Earth. Have you never heard of
Earth?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon. “Actually not.”</p>
<p>“It’s a mythical world,” began Dors, “that—”</p>
<p>“It’s not mythical. It was a real planet.”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. “I’ve heard this all before. Well, let’s go through it
again. Is there a Dahlite book that tells of Earth?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Some computer software, then?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“Young man, where did you hear about Earth?”</p>
<p>“My dad told me. Everyone knows about it.”</p>
<p>“Is there anyone who knows about it especially? Did they teach you
about it in school?”</p>
<p>“They never said a word about it there.”</p>
<p>“Then how do people know about it?”</p>
<p>Amaryl shrugged his shoulders with an air of being uselessly badgered
over nothing. “Everyone just does. If you want stories about it, there’s
Mother Rittah. I haven’t heard that she’s died yet.”</p>
<p>“Your mother? Wouldn’t you know—”</p>
<p>“She’s not my mother. That’s just what they call her. Mother Rittah.
She’s an old woman. She lives in Billibotton. Or used to.”</p>
<p>“Where’s that?”</p>
<p>“Down in that direction,” said Amaryl, gesturing vaguely.</p>
<p>“How do I get there?”</p>
<p>“Get there? You don’t want to get there. You’d never come back.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Believe me. You don’t want to go there.”</p>
<p>“But I’d like to see Mother Rittah.”</p>
<p>Amaryl shook his head. “Can you use a knife?”</p>
<p>“For what purpose? What kind of knife?”</p>
<p>“A cutting knife. Like this.” Amaryl reached down to the belt that
held his pants tight about his waist. A section of it came away and from
one end there flashed out a knife blade, thin, gleaming, and deadly.</p>
<p>Dors’s hand immediately came down hard upon his right wrist.</p>
<p>Amaryl laughed. “I wasn’t planning to use it. I was just showing it
to you.” He put the knife back in his belt. “You need one in
self-defense and if you don’t have one or if you have one but don’t know
how to use it, you’ll never get out of Billibotton alive. Anyway”—he
suddenly grew very grave and intent—“are you really serious, Master
Seldon, about helping me get to Helicon?”</p>
<p>“Entirely serious. That’s a promise. Write down your name and where
you can be reached by hyper-computer. You have a code, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“My shift in the heatsinks has one. Will that do?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” said Amaryl, looking up earnestly at Seldon, “this means
I have my whole future riding on you, Master Seldon, so please don’t go
to Billibotton. I can’t afford to lose you now.” He turned beseeching
eyes on Dors and said softly, “Mistress Venabili, if he’ll listen to
you, don’t let him go. Please.”</p>
<p>DAHL—… Oddly enough, the best-known aspect of this sector is
Billibotton, a semilegendary place about which innumerable tales have
grown up. In fact, a whole branch of literature now exists in which
heroes and adventurers (and victims) must dare the dangers of passing
through Billibotton. So stylized have these stories become that the one
well-known and, presumably, authentic tale involving such a passage,
that of Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili, has come to seem fantastic simply
by association …</p>
