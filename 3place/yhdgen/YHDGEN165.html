<h4 id="section">27</h4>
<p>The three went up the elevator in an inimical silence. Leggen had
eaten only part of his dinner and had left his wife at the dining area
without adequate explanation. Benastra had eaten no dinner at all and
had possibly disappointed some woman companion, also without adequate
explanation. Dors Venabili had not eaten either and she seemed the most
tense and unhappy of the three. She carried a thermal blanket and two
photonic founts.</p>
<p>When they reached the entrance to Upperside, Leggen, jaw muscles
tightening, entered his identification number and the door opened. A
cold wind rushed at them and Benastra grunted. None of the three was
adequately dressed, but the two men had no intention of remaining up
there long.</p>
<p>Dors said tightly, “It’s snowing.”</p>
<p>Leggen said, “It’s wet snow. The temperature’s just about at the
freezing point. It’s not a killing frost.”</p>
<p>“It depends on how long one remains in it, doesn’t it?” said Dors.
“And being soaked in melting snow won’t help.”</p>
<p>Leggen grunted. “Well, where is he?” He stared resentfully out into
utter blackness, made even worse by the light from the entrance behind
him.</p>
<p>Dors said, “Here, Dr. Benastra, hold this blanket for me. And you,
Dr. Leggen, close the door behind you without locking it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no automatic lock on it. Do you think we’re foolish?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not, but you can lock it from the inside and leave anyone
outside unable to get into the dome.”</p>
<p>“If someone’s outside, point him out. Show him to me,” said
Leggen.</p>
<p>“He could be anywhere.” Dors lifted her arms with a photonic fount
circling each wrist.</p>
<p>“We can’t look everywhere,” mumbled Benastra miserably.</p>
<p>The founts blazed into light, spraying in every direction. The
snowflakes glittered like a vast mob of fireflies, making it even more
difficult to see.</p>
<p>“The footsteps were getting steadily louder,” said Dors. “He had to
be approaching the transducer. Where would it be located?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t any idea,” snapped Leggen. “That’s outside my field and my
responsibility.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Benastra?”</p>
<p>Benastra’s reply was hesitant. “I don’t really know. To tell you the
truth, I’ve never been up here before. It was installed before my time.
The computer knows, but we never thought to ask it that. —I’m cold and I
don’t see what use I am up here.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to stay up here for a while,” said Dors firmly. “Follow
me. I’m going to circle the entrance in an outward spiral.”</p>
<p>“We can’t see much through the snow,” said Leggen.</p>
<p>“I know that. If it wasn’t snowing, we’d have seen him by now. I’m
sure of it. As it is, it may take a few minutes. We can stand that.” She
was by no means as confident as her words made it appear.</p>
<p>She began to walk, swinging her arms, playing the light over as large
a field as she could, straining her eyes for a dark blotch against the
snow.</p>
<p>And, as it happened, it was Benastra who first said, “What’s that?”
and pointed.</p>
<p>Dors overlapped the two founts, making a bright cone of light in the
indicated direction. She ran toward it, as did the other two.</p>
<p>They had found him, huddled and wet, about ten meters from the door,
five from the nearest meteorological device. Dors felt for his
heartbeat, but it was not necessary for, responding to her touch, Seldon
stirred and whimpered.</p>
<p>“Give me the blanket, Dr. Benastra,” said Dors in a voice that was
faint with relief. She flapped it open and spread it out in the snow.
“Lift him onto it carefully and I’ll wrap him. Then we’ll carry him
down.”</p>
<p>In the elevator, vapors were rising from the wrapped Seldon as the
blanket warmed to blood temperature.</p>
<p>Dors said, “Once we have him in his room, Dr. Leggen, you get a
doctor—a good one—and see that he comes at once. If Dr. Seldon gets
through this without harm, I won’t say anything, but only if he does.
Remember—”</p>
<p>“You needn’t lecture me,” said Leggen coldly. “I regret this and I
will do what I can, but my only fault was in allowing this man to come
Upperside in the first place.”</p>
<p>The blanket stirred and a low, weak voice made itself heard.</p>
<p>Benastra started, for Seldon’s head was cradled in the crook of his
elbow. He said, “He’s trying to say something.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I know. He said, ‘What’s going on?’”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but laugh just a little. It seemed such a normal
thing to say.</p>
