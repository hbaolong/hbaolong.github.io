<p>THE VISI-SONOR</p>
<p>Ebling Mis’s house in a not-so-pretentious neighborhood of Terminus
City was well known to the intelligentsia, literati, and
just-plain-well-read of the Foundation. Its notable characteristics
depended, subjectively, upon the source material that was read. To a
thoughtful biographer, it was the “symbolization of a retreat from a
nonacademic reality,” a society columnist gushed silkily at its
“frightfully masculine atmosphere of careless disorder,” a University
Ph.D. called it brusquely, “bookish, but unorganized,” a nonuniversity
friend said, “good for a drink anytime and you can put your feet on the
sofa,” and a breezy newsweekly broadcast, that went in for color, spoke
of the “rocky, down-to-earth, no-nonsense living quarters of
blaspheming, Leftish, balding Ebling Mis.”</p>
<p>To Bayta, who thought for no audience but herself at the moment, and
who had the advantage of firsthand information, it was merely
sloppy.</p>
<p>Except for the first few days, her imprisonment had been a light
burden. Far lighter, it seemed, than this half-hour wait in the
psychologist’s home—under secret observation, perhaps? She had been with
Toran then, at least—</p>
<p>Perhaps she might have grown wearier of the strain, had not
Magnifico’s long nose drooped in a gesture that plainly showed his own
far greater tension.</p>
<p>Magnifico’s pipe-stem legs were folded up under a pointed, sagging
chin, as if he were trying to huddle himself into disappearance, and
Bayta’s hand went out in a gentle and automatic gesture of reassurance.
Magnifico winced, then smiled.</p>
<p>“Surely, my lady, it would seem that even yet my body denies the
knowledge of my mind and expects of others’ hands a blow.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for worry, Magnifico. I’m with you, and I won’t let
anyone hurt you.”</p>
<p>The clown’s eyes sidled towards her, then drew away quickly. “But
they kept me away from you earlier—and from your kind husband—and, on my
word, you may laugh, but I was lonely for missing friendship.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t laugh at that. I was, too.”</p>
<p>The clown brightened, and he hugged his knees closer. He said, “You
have not met this man who will see us?” It was a cautious question.</p>
<p>“No. But he is a famous man. I have seen him in the newscasts and
heard quite a good deal of him. I think he’s a good man, Magnifico, who
means us no harm.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” The clown stirred uneasily. “That may be, my lady, but he has
questioned me before, and his manner is of an abruptness and loudness
that bequivers me. He is full of strange words, so that the answers to
his questions could not worm out of my throat. Almost, I might believe
the romancer who once played on my ignorance with a tale that, at such
moments, the heart lodged in the windpipe and prevented speech.”</p>
<p>“But it’s different now. We’re two to his one, and he won’t be able
to frighten the both of us, will he?”</p>
<p>“No, my lady.”</p>
<p>A door slammed somewhere, and the roaring of a voice entered the
house. Just outside the room, it coagulated into words with a fierce,
“Get the Ga-LAX-y out of here!” and two uniformed guards were
momentarily visible through the opening door, in quick retreat.</p>
<p>Ebling Mis entered frowning, deposited a carefully wrapped bundle on
the floor, and approached to shake Bayta’s hand with careless pressure.
Bayta returned it vigorously, man-fashion. Mis did a double-take as he
turned to the clown, and favored the girl with a longer look.</p>
<p>He said, “Married?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We went through the legal formalities.”</p>
<p>Mis paused. Then, “Happy about it?”</p>
<p>“So far.”</p>
<p>Mis shrugged, and turned again to Magnifico. He unwrapped the
package, “Know what this is, boy?”</p>
<p>Magnifico fairly hurled himself out of his seat and caught the
multikeyed instrument. He fingered the myriad knobby contacts and threw
a sudden back somersault of joy, to the imminent destruction of the
nearby furniture.</p>
<p>He croaked, “A Visi-Sonor—and of a make to distill joy out of a dead
man’s heart.” His long fingers caressed softly and slowly, pressing
lightly on contacts with a rippling motion, resting momentarily on one
key then another—and in the air before them there was a soft glowing
rosiness, just inside the range of vision.</p>
<p>Ebling Mis said, “All right, boy, you said you could pound on one of
those gadgets, and there’s your chance. You’d better tune it, though.
It’s out of a museum.” Then, in an aside to Bayta, “Near as I can make
it, no one on the Foundation can make it talk right.”</p>
<p>He leaned closer and said quickly, “The clown won’t talk without you.
Will you help?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“Good!” he said. “His state of fear is almost fixed, and I doubt that
his mental strength would stand a psychic probe. If I’m to get anything
out of him otherwise, he’s got to feel absolutely at ease. You
understand?”</p>
<p>She nodded again.</p>
<p>“This Visi-Sonor is the first step in the process. He says he can
play it; and his reaction now makes it pretty certain that it’s one of
the great joys of his life. So whether the playing is good or bad, be
interested and appreciative. Then exhibit friendliness and confidence in
me. Above all, follow my lead in everything.” There was a swift glance
at Magnifico, huddled in a corner of the sofa, making rapid adjustments
in the interior of the instrument. He was completely absorbed.</p>
<p>Mis said in a conversational tone to Bayta, “Ever hear a
Visi-Sonor?”</p>
<p>“Once,” said Bayta, equally casually, “at a concert of rare
instruments. I wasn’t impressed.”</p>
<p>“Well, I doubt that you came across good playing. There are very few
really good players. It’s not so much that it requires physical
co-ordination—a multibank piano requires more, for instance—as a certain
type of free-wheeling mentality.” In a lower voice, “That’s why our
living skeleton there might be better than we think. More often than
not, good players are idiots otherwise. It’s one of those queer setups
that makes psychology interesting.”</p>
<p>He added, in a patent effort to manufacture light conversation, “You
know how the beblistered thing works? I looked it up for this purpose,
and all I’ve made out so far is that its radiations stimulate the optic
center of the brain directly, without ever touching the optic nerve.
It’s actually the utilization of a sense never met with in ordinary
nature. Remarkable, when you come to think of it. What you hear is all
right. That’s ordinary. Eardrum, cochlea, all that. But—Shh! He’s ready.
Will you kick that switch. It works better in the dark.”</p>
<p>In the darkness, Magnifico was a mere blob, Ebling Mis a
heavy-breathing mass. Bayta found herself straining her eyes anxiously,
and at first with no effect. There was a thin, reedy quaver in the air,
that wavered raggedly up the scale. It hovered, dropped and caught
itself, gained in body, and swooped into a booming crash that had the
effect of a thunderous split in a veiling curtain.</p>
<p>A little globe of pulsing color grew in rhythmic spurts and burst in
midair into formless gouts that swirled high and came down as curving
streamers in interlacing patterns. They coalesced into little spheres,
no two alike in color—and Bayta began discovering things.</p>
<p>She noticed that closing her eyes made the color pattern all the
clearer; that each little movement of color had its own little pattern
of sound; that she could not identify the colors; and, lastly, that the
globes were not globes but little figures.</p>
<p>Little figures; little shifting flames, that danced and flickered in
their myriads; that dropped out of sight and returned from nowhere; that
whipped about one another and coalesced then into a new color.</p>
<p>Incongruously, Bayta thought of the little blobs of color that come
at night when you close your eyelids till they hurt, and stare
patiently. There was the old familiar effect of the marching polka dots
of shifting color, of the contracting concentric circles, of the
shapeless masses that quiver momentarily. All that, larger,
multivaried—and each little dot of color a tiny figure.</p>
<p>They darted at her in pairs, and she lifted her hands with a sudden
gasp, but they tumbled and for an instant she was the center of a
brilliant snowstorm, while cold light slipped off her shoulders and down
her arms in a luminous ski-slide, shooting off her stiff fingers and
meeting slowly in a shining midair focus. Beneath it all, the sound of a
hundred instruments flowed in liquid streams until she could not tell it
from the light.</p>
<p>She wondered if Ebling Mis were seeing the same thing, and if not,
what he did see. The wonder passed, and then—</p>
<p>She was watching again. The little figures—were they little
figures?—little tiny women with burning hair that turned and bent too
quickly for the mind to focus?—seized one another in star-shaped groups
that turned—and the music was faint laughter—girls’ laughter that began
inside the ear.</p>
<p>The stars drew together, sparked toward one another, grew slowly into
structure—and from below, a palace shot upward in rapid evolution. Each
brick a tiny color, each color a tiny spark, each spark a stabbing light
that shifted patterns and led the eye skyward to twenty jeweled
minarets.</p>
<p>A glittering carpet shot out and about, whirling, spinning an
insubstantial web that engulfed all space, and from it luminous shoots
stabbed upward and branched into trees that sang with a music all their
own.</p>
<p>Bayta sat enclosed in it. The music welled about her in rapid,
lyrical flights. She reached out to touch a fragile tree and blossoming
spicules floated downwards and faded, each with its clear, tiny
tinkle.</p>
<p>The music crashed in twenty cymbals, and before her an area flamed up
in a spout and cascaded down invisible steps into Bayta’s lap, where it
spilled over and flowed in rapid current, raising the fiery sparkle to
her waist, while across her lap was a rainbow bridge and upon it the
little figures—</p>
<p>A palace, and a garden, and tiny men and women on a bridge,
stretching out as far as she could see, swimming through the stately
swells of stringed music converging in upon her—</p>
<p>And then—there seemed a frightened pause, a hesitant, indrawn motion,
a swift collapse. The colors fled, spun into a globe that shrank, and
rose, and disappeared.</p>
<p>And it was merely dark again.</p>
<p>A heavy foot scratched for the pedal, reached it, and the light
flooded in; the flat light of a prosy sun. Bayta blinked until the tears
came, as though for the longing of what was gone. Ebling Mis was a podgy
inertness with his eyes still round and his mouth still open.</p>
<p>Only Magnifico himself was alive, and he fondled his Visi-Sonor in a
crooning ecstasy.</p>
<p>“My lady,” he gasped, “it is indeed of an effect the most magical. It
is of balance and response almost beyond hope in its delicacy and
stability. On this, it would seem I could work wonders. How liked you my
composition, my lady?”</p>
<p>“Was it yours?” breathed Bayta. “Your own?”</p>
<p>At her awe, his thin face turned a glowing red to the tip of his
mighty nose. “My very own, my lady. The Mule liked it not, but often and
often I have played it for my own amusement. It was once, in my youth,
that I saw the palace—a gigantic place of jeweled riches that I saw from
a distance at a time of high carnival. There were people of a splendor
undreamed of—and magnificence more than ever I saw afterwards, even in
the Mule’s service. It is but a poor makeshift I have created, but my
mind’s poverty precludes more. I call it ‘The Memory of Heaven.’ ”</p>
<p>Now through the midst of the chatter, Mis shook himself to active
life. “Here,” he said, “here, Magnifico, would you like to do that same
thing for others?”</p>
<p>For a moment, the clown drew back. “For others?” he quavered.</p>
<p>“For thousands,” cried Mis, “in the great Halls of the Foundation.
Would you like to be your own master, and honored by all, wealthy, and …
and—” his imagination failed him. “And all that? Eh? What do you
say?”</p>
<p>“But how may I be all that, mighty sir, for indeed I am but a poor
clown ungiven to the great things of the world?”</p>
<p>The psychologist puffed out his lips, and passed the back of his hand
across his brow. He said, “But your playing, man. The world is yours if
you would play so for the mayor and his Trading trusts. Wouldn’t you
like that?”</p>
<p>The clown glanced briefly at Bayta, “Would she stay with me?”</p>
<p>Bayta laughed, “Of course, silly. Would it be likely that I’d leave
you now that you’re on the point of becoming rich and famous?”</p>
<p>“It would all be yours,” he replied earnestly, “and surely the wealth
of Galaxy itself would be yours before I could repay my debt to your
kindness.”</p>
<p>“But,” said Mis, casually, “if you would first help me—”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>The psychologist paused, and smiled, “A little surface probe that
doesn’t hurt. It wouldn’t touch but the peel of your brain.”</p>
<p>There was a flare of deadly fear in Magnifico’s eyes. “Not a probe. I
have seen it used. It drains the mind and leaves an empty skull. The
Mule did use it upon traitors and let them wander mindless through the
streets, until out of mercy, they were killed.” He held up his hand to
push Mis away.</p>
<p>“That was a psychic probe,” explained Mis, patiently, “and even that
would only harm a person when misused. This probe I have is a surface
probe that wouldn’t hurt a baby.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Magnifico,” urged Bayta. “It’s only to help beat the
Mule and keep him far away. Once that’s done, you and I will be rich and
famous all our lives.”</p>
<p>Magnifico held out a trembling hand, “Will you hold my hand,
then?”</p>
<p>Bayta took it in both her own, and the clown watched the approach of
the burnished terminal plates with large eyes.</p>
<p>Ebling Mis rested carelessly on the too-lavish chair in Mayor
Indbur’s private quarters, unregenerately unthankful for the
condescension shown him, and watched the small mayor’s fidgeting
unsympathetically. He tossed away a cigar stub and spat out a shred of
tobacco.</p>
<p>“And, incidentally, if you want something for your next concert at
Mallow Hall, Indbur,” he said, “you can dump out those electronic
gadgeteers into the sewers they came from and have this little freak
play the Visi-Sonor for you. Indbur—it’s out of this world.”</p>
<p>Indbur said peevishly, “I did not call you here to listen to your
lectures on music. What of the Mule? Tell me that. What of the
Mule?”</p>
<p>“The Mule? Well, I’ll tell you—I used a surface probe and got little.
Can’t use the psychic probe because the freak is scared blind of it, so
that his resistance will probably blow his unprintable mental fuses as
soon as contact is made. But this is what I’ve got, if you’ll just stop
tapping your fingernails—</p>
<p>“First place, de-stress the Mule’s physical strength. He’s probably
strong, but most of the freak’s fairy tales about it are probably
considerably blown up by his own fearful memory. He wears queer glasses
and his eyes kill, he evidently has mental powers.”</p>
<p>“So much we had at the start,” commented the mayor, sourly.</p>
<p>“Then the probe confirms it, and from there on I’ve been working
mathematically.”</p>
<p>“So? And how long will all this take? Your word-rattling will deafen
me yet.”</p>
<p>“About a month, I should say, and I may have something for you. And I
may not, of course. But what of it? If this is all outside Seldon’s
plans, our chances are precious little, unprintable little.”</p>
<p>Indbur whirled on the psychologist fiercely, “Now I have you,
traitor. Lie! Say you’re not one of these criminal rumormongers that are
spreading defeatism and panic through the Foundation, and making my work
doubly hard.”</p>
<p>“I? I?” Mis gathered anger slowly.</p>
<p>Indbur swore at him, “Because by the dust-clouds of space, the
Foundation will win—the Foundation must win.”</p>
<p>“Despite the loss at Horleggor?”</p>
<p>“It was not a loss. You have swallowed that spreading lie, too? We
were outnumbered and betreasoned—”</p>
<p>“By whom?” demanded Mis, contemptuously.</p>
<p>“By the lice-ridden democrats of the gutter,” shouted Indbur back at
him. “I have known for long that the fleet has been riddled by
democratic cells. Most have been wiped out, but enough remain for the
unexplained surrender of twenty ships in the thickest of the swarming
fight. Enough to force an apparent defeat.</p>
<p>“For that matter, my rough-tongued, simple patriot and epitome of the
primitive virtues, what are your own connections with the
democrats?”</p>
<p>Ebling Mis shrugged it off, “You rave, do you know that? What of the
retreat since, and the loss of half of Siwenna? Democrats again?”</p>
<p>“No. Not democrats,” the little man smiled sharply. “We retreat—as
the Foundation has always retreated under attack, until the inevitable
march of history turns with us. Already, I see the outcome. Already, the
so-called underground of the democrats has issued manifestoes swearing
aid and allegiance to the Government. It could be a feint, a cover for a
deeper treachery, but I make good use of it, and the propaganda
distilled from it will have its effect, whatever the crawling traitors’
scheme. And better than that—”</p>
<p>“Even better than that, Indbur?”</p>
<p>“Judge for yourself. Two days ago, the so-called Association of
Independent Traders declared war on the Mule, and the Foundation fleet
is strengthened, at a stroke, by a thousand ships. You see, this Mule
goes too far. He finds us divided and quarreling among ourselves and
under the pressure of his attack we unite and grow strong. He must lose.
It is inevitable—as always.”</p>
<p>Mis still exuded skepticism, “Then you tell me that Seldon planned
even for the fortuitous occurrence of a mutant.”</p>
<p>“A mutant! I can’t tell him from a human, nor could you but for the
ravings of a rebel captain, some outland youngsters, and an addled
juggler and clown. You forget the most conclusive evidence of all—your
own.”</p>
<p>“My own?” For just a moment, Mis was startled.</p>
<p>“Your own,” sneered the mayor. “The Time Vault opens in nine weeks.
What of that? It opens for a crisis. If this attack of the Mule is not
the crisis, where is the ‘real’ one, the one the Vault is opening for?
Answer me, you lardish ball.”</p>
<p>The psychologist shrugged, “All right. If it keeps you happy. Do me a
favor, though. Just in case … just in case old Seldon makes his speech
and it does go sour, suppose you let me attend the Grand Opening.”</p>
<p>“All right. Get out of here. And stay out of my sight for nine
weeks.”</p>
<p>“With unprintable pleasure, you wizened horror,” muttered Mis to
himself as he left.</p>
