<p>THE WAR ENDS</p>
<p>Lathan Devers felt definitely uncomfortable, and vaguely resentful.
He had received his own decoration and withstood with mute stoicism the
turgid oratory of the mayor which accompanied the slip of crimson
ribbon. That had ended his share of the ceremonies, but, naturally,
formality forced him to remain. And it was formality, chiefly—the type
that couldn’t allow him to yawn noisily or to swing a foot comfortably
onto a chair seat—that made him long to be in space, where he
belonged.</p>
<p>The Siwennese delegation, with Ducem Barr a lionized member, signed
the Convention, and Siwenna became the first province to pass directly
from the Empire’s political rule to the Foundation’s economic one.</p>
<p>Five Imperial Ships of the Line—captured when Siwenna rebelled behind
the lines of the Empire’s Border Fleet—flashed overhead, huge and
massive, detonating a roaring salute as they passed over the city.</p>
<p>Nothing but drinking, etiquette, and small talk now—</p>
<p>A voice called him. It was Forell; the man who, Devers realized
coldly, could buy twenty of him with a morning’s profits—but a Forell
who now crooked a finger at him with genial condescension.</p>
<p>He stepped out upon the balcony into the cool night wind, and bowed
properly, while scowling into his bristling beard. Barr was there, too;
smiling. He said, “Devers, you’ll have to come to my rescue. I’m being
accused of modesty, a horrible and thoroughly unnatural crime.”</p>
<p>“Devers,” Forell removed the fat cigar from the side of his mouth
when he spoke, “Lord Barr claims that your trip to Cleon’s capital had
nothing to do with the recall of Riose.”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all, sir.” Devers was curt. “We never saw the Emperor.
The reports we picked up on our way back concerning the trial, showed it
up to be the purest frame-up. There was a mess of rigmarole about the
general being tied up with subversive interests at the court.”</p>
<p>“And he was innocent?”</p>
<p>“Riose?” interposed Barr. “Yes! By the Galaxy, yes. Brodrig was a
traitor on general principles but was never guilty of the specific
accusations brought against him. It was a judicial farce; but a
necessary one, a predictable one, an inevitable one.”</p>
<p>“By psychohistorical necessity, I presume.” Forell rolled the phrase
sonorously with the humorous ease of long familiarity.</p>
<p>“Exactly.” Barr grew serious. “It never penetrated earlier, but once
it was over and I could … well … look at the answers in the back of the
book, the problem became simple. We can see, now, that the social
background of the Empire makes wars of conquest impossible for it. Under
weak Emperors, it is torn apart by generals competing for a worthless
and surely death-bringing throne. Under strong Emperors, the Empire is
frozen into a paralytic rigor in which disintegration apparently ceases
for the moment, but only at the sacrifice of all possible growth.”</p>
<p>Forell growled bluntly through strong puffs, “You’re not clear, Lord
Barr.”</p>
<p>Barr smiled slowly. “I suppose so. It’s the difficulty of not being
trained in psychohistory. Words are a pretty fuzzy substitute for
mathematical equations. But let’s see now—”</p>
<p>Barr considered, while Forell relaxed, back to railing, and Devers
looked into the velvet sky and thought wonderingly of Trantor.</p>
<p>Then Barr said, “You see, sir, you—and Devers—and everyone, no doubt,
had the idea that beating the Empire meant first prying apart the
Emperor and his general. You, and Devers, and everyone else were
right—right all the time, as far as the principle of internal disunion
was concerned.</p>
<p>“You were wrong, however, in thinking that this internal split was
something to be brought about by individual acts, by inspirations of the
moment. You tried bribery and lies. You appealed to ambition and to
fear. But you got nothing for all your pains. In fact, appearances were
worse after each attempt.</p>
<p>“And through all this wild threshing up of tiny ripples, the Seldon
tidal wave continued onward, quietly—but quite irresistibly.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr turned away, and looked over the railing at the lights of
a rejoicing city. He said, “There was a dead hand pushing all of us; the
mighty general and the great Emperor; my world and your world—the dead
hand of Hari Seldon. He knew that a man like Riose would have to fail,
since it was his success that brought failure; and the greater the
success, the surer the failure.”</p>
<p>Forell said dryly, “I can’t say you’re getting clearer.”</p>
<p>“A moment,” continued Barr earnestly. “Look at the situation. A weak
general could never have endangered us, obviously. A strong general
during the time of a weak Emperor would never have endangered us,
either; for he would have turned his arms towards a much more fruitful
target. Events have shown that three-fourths of the Emperors of the last
two centuries were rebel generals and rebel viceroys before they were
Emperors.</p>
<p>“So it is only the combination of strong Emperor and strong general
that can harm the Foundation; for a strong Emperor cannot be dethroned
easily, and a strong general is forced to turn outwards, past the
frontiers.</p>
<p>“But, what keeps the Emperor strong? What kept Cleon strong? It’s
obvious. He is strong, because he permits no strong subjects. A courtier
who becomes too rich, or a general who becomes too popular is dangerous.
All the recent history of the Empire proves that to any Emperor
intelligent enough to be strong.</p>
<p>“Riose won victories, so the Emperor grew suspicious. All the
atmosphere of the times forced him to be suspicious. Did Riose refuse a
bribe? Very suspicious; ulterior motives. Did his most trusted courtier
suddenly favor Riose? Very suspicious; ulterior motives. It wasn’t the
individual acts that were suspicious. Anything else would have
done—which is why our individual plots were unnecessary and rather
futile. It was the success of Riose that was suspicious. So he was
recalled, and accused, condemned, murdered. The Foundation wins
again.</p>
<p>“Look, there is not a conceivable combination of events that does not
result in the Foundation winning. It was inevitable; whatever Riose did,
whatever we did.”</p>
<p>The Foundation magnate nodded ponderously. “So! But what if the
Emperor and the general had been the same person. Hey? What then? That’s
a case you didn’t cover, so you haven’t proved your point yet.”</p>
<p>Barr shrugged. “I can’t prove anything; I haven’t the mathematics.
But I appeal to your reason. With an Empire in which every aristocrat,
every strong man, every pirate can aspire to the Throne—and, as history
shows, often successfully—what would happen to even a strong Emperor who
preoccupied himself with foreign wars at the extreme end of the Galaxy?
How long would he have to remain away from the capital before somebody
raised the standards of civil war and forced him home? The social
environment of the Empire would make that time short.</p>
<p>“I once told Riose that not all the Empire’s strength could swerve
the dead hand of Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Good! Good!” Forell was expansively pleased. “Then you imply the
Empire can never threaten us again.”</p>
<p>“It seems to me so,” agreed Barr. “Frankly, Cleon may not live out
the year, and there’s going to be a disputed succession almost as a
matter of course, which might mean the last civil war for the
Empire.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Forell, “there are no more enemies.”</p>
<p>Barr was thoughtful. “There’s a Second Foundation.”</p>
<p>“At the other end of the Galaxy? Not for centuries.”</p>
<p>Devers turned suddenly at this, and his face was dark as he faced
Forell. “There are internal enemies, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Are there?” asked Forell, coolly. “Who, for instance?”</p>
<p>“People, for instance, who might like to spread the wealth a bit, and
keep it from concentrating too much out of the hands that work for it.
See what I mean?”</p>
<p>Slowly, Forell’s gaze lost its contempt and grew one with the anger
of Devers’s own.</p>
<p>THE MULE.… Less is known of “The Mule” than of any character of
comparable significance to Galactic history. Even the period of his
greatest renown is known to us chiefly through the eyes of his
antagonists and, principally, through those of a young bride.…</p>
