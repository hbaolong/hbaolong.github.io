<h4 id="section">38</h4>
<p>Seldon looked with some distress at their quarters. It had a small
but individual kitchen and a small but individual bathroom. There were
two narrow beds, two clothes closets, a table, and two chairs. In short
there was everything that was necessary for two people who were willing
to live under cramped conditions.</p>
<p>“We had an individual kitchen and bathroom at Cinna,” said Dors with
an air of resignation.</p>
<p>“Not I,” said Seldon. “Helicon may be a small world, but I lived in a
modern city. Community kitchens and bathrooms. —What a waste this is.
You might expect it in a hotel, where one is compelled to make a
temporary stay, but if the whole sector is like this, imagine the
enormous number and duplications of kitchens and bathrooms.”</p>
<p>“Part of the egalitarianism, I suppose,” said Dors. “No fighting for
favored stalls or for faster service. The same for everyone.”</p>
<p>“No privacy either. Not that I mind terribly, Dors, but you might and
I don’t want to give the appearance of taking advantage. We ought to
make it clear to them that we must have separate rooms—adjoining but
separate.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I’m sure it won’t work. Space is at a premium and I think
they are amazed by their own generosity in giving us this much. We’ll
just make do, Hari. We’re each old enough to manage. I’m not a blushing
maiden and you’ll never convince me that you’re a callow youth.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be here, were it not for me.”</p>
<p>“What of it? It’s an adventure.”</p>
<p>“All right, then. Which bed will you take? Why don’t you take the one
nearer the bathroom?” He sat down on the other. “There’s something else
that bothers me. As long as we’re here, we’re tribespeople, you and I,
as is even Hummin. We’re of the other tribes, not their own cohorts, and
most things are none of our business. —But most things are my business.
That’s what I’ve come here for. I want to know some of the things they
know.”</p>
<p>“Or think they know,” said Dors with a historian’s skepticism. “I
understand they have legends that are supposed to date back to
primordial times, but I can’t believe they can be taken seriously.”</p>
<p>“We can’t know that until we find out what those legends are. Are
there no outside records of them?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of. These people are terribly ingrown. They’re
almost psychotic in their inward clinging. That Hummin can break down
their barriers somewhat and even get them to take us in is
remarkable—really remarkable.”</p>
<p>Seldon brooded. “There has to be an opening somewhere. Sunmaster was
surprised—angry, in fact—that I didn’t know Mycogen was an agricultural
community. That seems to be something they don’t want kept a
secret.”</p>
<p>“The point is, it isn’t a secret. ‘Mycogen’ is supposed to be from
archaic words meaning ‘yeast producer.’ At least, that’s what I’ve been
told. I’m not a paleolinguist. In any case, they culture all varieties
of microfood—yeast, of course, along with algae, bacteria, multicellular
fungi, and so on.”</p>
<p>“That’s not uncommon,” said Seldon. “Most worlds have this
microculture. We have some even on Helicon.”</p>
<p>“Not like Mycogen. It’s their specialty. They use methods as archaic
as the name of their section—secret fertilizing formulas, secret
environmental influences. Who knows what? All is secret.”</p>
<p>“Ingrown.”</p>
<p>“With a vengeance. What it amounts to is that they produce protein
and subtle flavoring, so that their microfood isn’t like any other in
the world. They keep the volume comparatively low and the price is
sky-high. I’ve never tasted any and I’m sure you haven’t, but it sells
in great quantities to the Imperial bureaucracy and to the upper classes
on other worlds. Mycogen depends on such sales for its economic health,
so they want everyone to know that they are the source of this valuable
food. That, at least, is no secret.”</p>
<p>“Mycogen must be rich, then.”</p>
<p>“They’re not poor, but I suspect that it’s not wealth they’re after.
It’s protection. The Imperial government protects them because, without
them, there wouldn’t be these microfoods that add the subtlest flavors,
the tangiest spices, to every dish. That means that Mycogen can maintain
its odd way of life and be haughty toward its neighbors, who probably
find them insupportable.”</p>
<p>Dors looked about. “They live an austere life. There’s no holovision,
I notice, and no book-films.”</p>
<p>“I noticed one in the closet up on the shelf.” Seldon reached for it,
stared at the label, and then said in clear disgust, “A cookbook.”</p>
<p>Dors held out her hand for it and manipulated the keys. It took a
while, for the arrangement was not quite orthodox, but she finally
managed to light the screen and inspect the pages. She said, “There are
a few recipes, but for the most part this seems to consist of
philsophical essays on gastronomy.”</p>
<p>She shut it off and turned it round and about. “It seems to be a
single unit. I don’t see how one would eject the microcard and insert
another. —A one-book scanner. Now that’s a waste.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they think this one book-film is all anyone needs.” He reached
toward the end table that was between the two beds and picked up another
object. “This could be a speaker, except that there’s no screen.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps they consider the voice sufficient.”</p>
<p>“How does it work, I wonder?” Seldon lifted it and looked at it from
different sides. “Did you ever see anything like this?”</p>
<p>“In a museum once—if this is the same thing. Mycogen seems to keep
itself deliberately archaic. I suppose they consider that another way of
separating themselves from the so-called tribesmen that surround them in
overwhelming numbers. Their archaism and odd customs make them
indigestible, so to speak. There’s a kind of perverse logic to all
that.”</p>
<p>Seldon, still playing with the device, said, “Whoops! It went on. Or
something went on. But I don’t hear anything.”</p>
<p>Dors frowned and picked up a small felt-lined cylinder that remained
behind on the end table. She put it to her ear. “There’s a voice coming
out of this,” she said. “Here, try it.” She handed it to him.</p>
<p>Seldon did so and said, “Ouch! It clips on.” He listened and said,
“Yes, it hurt my ear. You can hear me, I take it. —Yes, this is our
room. —No, I don’t know its number. Dors, have you any idea of the
number?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “There’s a number on the speaker. Maybe that will do.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” said Seldon doubtfully. Then he said into the speaker, “The
number on this device is 6LT-3648A. Will that do? —Well, where do I find
out how to use this device properly and how to use the kitchen, for that
matter? —What do you mean, ‘It all works the usual way?’ That doesn’t do
me any good. —See here, I’m a … a tribesman, an honored guest. I don’t
know the usual way. —Yes, I’m sorry about my accent and I’m glad you can
recognize a tribesman when you hear one. —My name is Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>There was a pause and Seldon looked up at Dors with a long-suffering
expression on his face. “He has to look me up. And I suppose he’ll tell
me he can’t find me. —Oh, you have me? Good! In that case, can you give
me the information? —Yes. —Yes. —Yes. —And how can I call someone
outside Mycogen? —Oh, then what about contacting Sunmaster Fourteen, for
instance? —Well, his assistant then, his aide, whatever? —Uh-huh. —Thank
you.”</p>
<p>He put the speaker down, unhooked the hearing device from his ear
with a little difficulty, turned the whole thing off, and said, “They’ll
arrange to have someone show us anything we need to know, but he can’t
promise when that might be. You can’t call outside Mycogen—not on this
thing anyway—so we couldn’t get Hummin if we needed him. And if I want
Sunmaster Fourteen, I’ve got to go through a tremendous rigmarole. This
may be an egalitarian society, but there seem to be exceptions that I
bet no one will openly admit.”</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. “In any case, Dors, I’m not going to view a
cookbook and still less am I going to view learned essays. My watch is
still telling University time, so I don’t know if it’s officially
bedtime and at the moment I don’t care. We’ve been awake most of the
night and I would like to sleep.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right with me. I’m tired too.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. And whenever a new day starts after we’ve caught up on our
sleep, I’m going to ask for a tour of their microfood plantations.”</p>
<p>Dors looked startled. “Are you interested?”</p>
<p>“Not really, but if that’s the one thing they’re proud of, they
should be willing to talk about it and once I get them into a talking
mood then, by exerting all my charm, I may get them to talk about their
legends too. Personally, I think that’s a clever strategy.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” said Dors dubiously, “but I think that the Mycogenians
will not be so easily trapped.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” said Seldon grimly. “I mean to get those legends.”</p>
