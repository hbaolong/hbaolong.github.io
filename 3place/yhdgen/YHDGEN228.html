<h4 id="section">90</h4>
<p>Hummin and Seldon sat at lunch that day, quite alone, a pall of quiet
between them for the most part.</p>
<p>It was toward the end of the meal that Seldon stirred and said in a
lively voice, “Well, sir, how do I address you? I think of you as
‘Chetter Hummin’ still, but even if I accept you in your other persona,
I surely cannot address you as ‘Eto Demerzel.’ In that capacity, you
have a title and I don’t know the proper usage. Instruct me.”</p>
<p>The other said gravely, “Call me ‘Hummin’—if you don’t mind. Or
‘Chetter.’ Yes, I am Eto Demerzel, but with respect to you I am Hummin.
As a matter of fact, the two are not distinct. I told you that the
Empire is decaying and failing. I believe that to be true in both my
capacities. I told you that I wanted psychohistory as a way of
preventing that decay and failure or of bringing about a renewal and
reinvigoration if the decay and failure must run its course. I believe
that in both my capacities too.”</p>
<p>“But you had me in your grip—I presume you were in the vicinity when
I had my meeting with His Imperial Majesty.”</p>
<p>“With Cleon. Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“And you might have spoken to me, then, exactly as you later did as
Hummin.”</p>
<p>“And accomplished what? As Demerzel, I have enormous tasks. I have to
handle Cleon, a well-meaning but not very capable ruler, and prevent
him, insofar as I can, from making mistakes. I have to do my bit in
governing Trantor and the Empire too. And, as you see, I had to spend a
great deal of time in preventing Wye from doing harm.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” murmured Seldon.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t easy and I nearly lost out. I have spent years sparring
carefully with Mannix, learning to understand his thinking and planning
a countermove to his every move. I did not think, at any time, that
while he was still alive he would pass on his powers to his daughter. I
had not studied her and I was not prepared for her utter lack of
caution. Unlike her father, she has been brought up to take power for
granted and had no clear idea of its limitations. So she got you and
forced me to act before I was quite ready.”</p>
<p>“You almost lost me as a result. I faced the muzzle of a blaster
twice.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Hummin, nodding. “And we might have lost you Upperside
too—another accident I could not foresee.”</p>
<p>“But you haven’t really answered my question. Why did you send me
chasing all over the face of Trantor to escape from Demerzel when you
yourself were Demerzel?”</p>
<p>“You told Cleon that psychohistory was a purely theoretical concept,
a kind of mathematical game that made no practical sense. That might
indeed have been so, but if I approached you officially, I was sure you
would merely have maintained your belief. Yet I was attracted to the
notion of psychohistory. I wondered whether it might not be, after all,
just a game. You must understand that I didn’t want merely to use you, I
wanted a real and practical psychohistory.</p>
<p>“So I sent you, as you put it, chasing all over the face of Trantor
with the dreaded Demerzel close on your heels at all times. That, I
felt, would concentrate your mind powerfully. It would make
psychohistory something exciting and much more than a mathematical game.
You would try to work it out for the sincere idealist Hummin, where you
would not for the Imperial flunky Demerzel. Also, you would get a
glimpse of various sides of Trantor and that too would be
helpful—certainly more helpful than living in an ivory tower on a
far-off planet, surrounded entirely by fellow mathematicians. Was I
right? Have you made progress?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “In psychohistory? Yes, I did, Hummin. I thought you
knew.”</p>
<p>“How should I know?”</p>
<p>“I told Dors.”</p>
<p>“But you hadn’t told me. Nevertheless, you tell me so now. That is
good news.”</p>
<p>“Not entirely,” said Seldon. “I have made only the barest beginning.
But it is a beginning.”</p>
<p>“Is it the kind of beginning that can be explained to a
nonmathematician?”</p>
<p>“I think so. You see, Hummin, from the start I have seen
psychohistory as a science that depends on the interaction of
twenty-five million worlds, each with an average population of four
thousand million. It’s too much. There’s no way of handling something
that complex. If I was to succeed at all, if there was to be any way of
finding a useful psychohistory, I would first have to find a simpler
system.</p>
<p>“So I thought I would go back in time and deal with a single world, a
world that was the only one occupied by humanity in the dim age before
the colonization of the Galaxy. In Mycogen they spoke of an original
world of Aurora and in Dahl I heard word of an original world of Earth.
I thought they might be the same world under different names, but they
were sufficiently different in one key point, at least, to make that
impossible. And it didn’t matter. So little was known of either one, and
that little so obscured by myth and legend, that there was no hope of
making use of psychohistory in connection with them.”</p>
<p>He paused to sip at his cold juice, keeping his eyes firmly on
Hummin’s face.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Well? What then?”</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, Dors had told me something I call the hand-on-thigh
story. It was of no innate significance, merely a humorous and entirely
trivial tale. As a result, though, Dors mentioned the different sex
mores on various worlds and in various sectors of Trantor. It occurred
to me that she treated the different Trantorian sectors as though they
were separate worlds. I thought, idly, that instead of twenty-five
million different worlds, I had twenty-five million plus eight hundred
to deal with. It seemed a trivial difference, so I forgot it and thought
no more about it.</p>
<p>“But as I traveled from the Imperial Sector to Streeling to Mycogen
to Dahl to Wye, I observed for myself how different each was. The
thought of Trantor—not as a world but as a complex of worlds—grew
stronger, but still I didn’t see the crucial point.</p>
<p>“It was only when I listened to Rashelle—you see, it was good that I
was finally captured by Wye and it was good that Rashelle’s rashness
drove her into the grandiose schemes that she imparted to me—When I
listened to Rashelle, as I said, she told me that all she wanted was
Trantor and some immediately adjacent worlds. It was an Empire in
itself, she said, and dismissed the outer worlds as ‘distant
nothings.’</p>
<p>“It was then that, in a moment, I saw what I must have been harboring
in my hidden thoughts for a considerable time. On the one hand, Trantor
possessed an extraordinarily complex social system, being a populous
world made up of eight hundred smaller worlds. It was in itself a system
complex enough to make psychohistory meaningful and yet it was simple
enough, compared to the Empire as a whole, to make psychohistory perhaps
practical.</p>
<p>“And the Outer Worlds, the twenty-five million of them? They were
‘distant nothings.’ Of course, they affected Trantor and were affected
by Trantor, but these were second-order effects. If I could make
psychohistory work as a first approximation for Trantor alone, then the
minor effects of the Outer Worlds could be added as later modifications.
Do you see what I mean? I was searching for a single world on which to
establish a practical science of psychohistory and I was searching for
it in the far past, when all the time the single world I wanted was
under my feet now.”</p>
<p>Hummin said with obvious relief and pleasure, “Wonderful!”</p>
<p>“But it’s all left to do, Hummin. I must study Trantor in sufficient
detail. I must devise the necessary mathematics to deal with it. If I am
lucky and live out a full lifetime, I may have the answers before I die.
If not, my successors will have to follow me. Conceivably, the Empire
may have fallen and splintered before psychohistory becomes a useful
technique.”</p>
<p>“I will do everything I can to help you.”</p>
<p>“I know it,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“You trust me, then, despite the fact I am Demerzel?”</p>
<p>“Entirely. Absolutely. But I do so because you are not Demerzel.”</p>
<p>“But I am,” insisted Hummin.</p>
<p>“But you are not. Your persona as Demerzel is as far removed from the
truth as is your persona as Hummin.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Hummin’s eyes grew wide and he backed away
slightly from Seldon.</p>
<p>“I mean that you probably chose the name ‘Hummin’ out of a wry sense
of what was fitting. ‘Hummin’ is a mispronunciation of ‘human,’ isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>Hummin made no response. He continued to stare at Seldon.</p>
<p>And finally Seldon said, “Because you’re not human, are you,
‘Hummin/Demerzel’? You’re a robot.”</p>
<p>SELDON, HARI—… It is customary to think of Hari Seldon only in
connection with psychohistory, to see him only as mathematics and social
change personified. There is no doubt that he himself encouraged this
for at no time in his formal writings did he give any hint as to how he
came to solve the various problems of psychohistory. His leaps of
thought might have all been plucked from air, for all he tells us. Nor
does he tell us of the blind alleys into which he crept or the wrong
turnings he may have made.</p>
<p>… As for his private life, it is a blank. Concerning his parents and
siblings, we know a handful of factors, no more. His only son, Raych
Seldon, is known to have been adopted, but how that came about is not
known. Concerning his wife, we only know that she existed. Clearly,
Seldon wanted to be a cipher except where psychohistory was concerned.
It is as though he felt—or wanted it to be felt—that he did not live, he
merely psychohistorified.</p>
