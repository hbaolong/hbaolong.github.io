<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>Seldon looked up. A young man was standing before him, looking down
at him with an expression of amused contempt. Next to him was another
young man—a bit younger, perhaps. Both were large and appeared to be
strong.</p>
<p>They were dressed in an extreme of Trantorian fashion, Seldon
judged—boldly clashing colors, broad fringed belts, round hats with wide
brims all about and the two ends of a bright pink ribbon extending from
the brim to the back of the neck.</p>
<p>In Seldon’s eyes, it was amusing and he smiled.</p>
<p>The young man before him snapped, “What’re you grinning at,
misfit?”</p>
<p>Seldon ignored the manner of address and said gently, “Please pardon
my smile. I was merely enjoying your costume.”</p>
<p>“My costume? So? And what are you wearing? What’s that awful offal
you call clothes?” His hand went out and his finger flicked at the lapel
of Seldon’s jacket—disgracefully heavy and dull, Seldon himself thought,
in comparison to the other’s lighthearted colors.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’m afraid it’s my Outworlder clothes. They’re all I
have.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t help notice that the few others who were sitting in the
small park were rising to their feet and walking off. It was as though
they were expecting trouble and had no desire to remain in the vicinity.
Seldon wondered if his new friend, Hummin, was leaving too, but he felt
it injudicious to take his eyes away from the young man who was
confronting him. He teetered back on his chair slightly.</p>
<p>The young man said, “You an Outworlder?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Hence my clothes.”</p>
<p>“Hence? What kind of word’s that? Outworld word?”</p>
<p>“What I meant was, that was why my clothes seem peculiar to you. I’m
a visitor here.”</p>
<p>“From what planet?”</p>
<p>“Helicon.”</p>
<p>The young man’s eyebrows drew together. “Never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a large planet.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go back there?”</p>
<p>“I intend to. I’m leaving tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Sooner! Now!”</p>
<p>The young man looked at his partner. Seldon followed the look and
caught a glimpse of Hummin. He had not left, but the park was now empty
except for himself, Hummin, and the two young men.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’d thought I’d spend today sight-seeing.”</p>
<p>“No. You don’t want to do that. You go home now.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “Sorry. I won’t.”</p>
<p>The young man said to his partner, “You like his clothes,
Marbie?”</p>
<p>Marbie spoke for the first time. “No. Disgusting. Turns the
stomach.”</p>
<p>“Can’t let him go around turning stomachs, Marbie. Not good for
people’s health.”</p>
<p>“No, not by no means, Alem,” said Marbie.</p>
<p>Alem grinned. “Well now. You heard what Marbie said.”</p>
<p>And now Hummin spoke. He said, “Look, you two, Alem, Marbie, whatever
your names are. You’ve had your fun. Why don’t you go away?”</p>
<p>Alem, who had been leaning slightly toward Seldon, straightened and
turned. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“That’s not your business,” snapped Hummin.</p>
<p>“You’re Trantorian?” asked Alem.</p>
<p>“Also not your business.”</p>
<p>Alem frowned and said, “You’re dressed Trantorian. We’re not
interested in you, so don’t go looking for problems.”</p>
<p>“I intend to stay. That means there are two of us. Two against two
doesn’t sound like your kind of fight. Why don’t you go away and get
some friends so you can handle two people?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I really think you ought to get away if you can,
Hummin. It’s kind of you to try to protect me, but I don’t want you
harmed.”</p>
<p>“These are not dangerous people, Seldon. Just half-credit
lackeys.”</p>
<p>“Lackeys!” The word seemed to infuriate Alem, so that Seldon thought
it must have a more insulting meaning on Trantor than it had on
Helicon.</p>
<p>“Here, Marbie,” said Alem with a growl. “You take care of that other
motherlackey and I’ll rip the clothes off this Seldon. He’s the one we
want. Now—”</p>
<p>His hands came down sharply to seize Seldon’s lapels and jerk him
upright. Seldon pushed away, instinctively it would seem, and his chair
tipped backward. He seized the hands stretched toward him, his foot went
up, and his chair went down.</p>
<p>Somehow Alem streaked overhead, turning as he did so, and came down
hard on his neck and back behind Seldon.</p>
<p>Seldon twisted as his chair went down and was quickly on his feet,
staring down at Alem, then looking sharply to one side for Marbie.</p>
<p>Alem lay unmoving, his face twisted in agony. He had two badly
sprained thumbs, excruciating pain in his groin, and a backbone that had
been badly jarred.</p>
<p>Hummin’s left arm had grabbed Marbie’s neck from behind and his right
arm had pulled the other’s right arm backward at a vicious angle.
Marbie’s face was red as he labored uselessly for breath. A knife,
glittering with a small laser inset, lay on the ground beside them.</p>
<p>Hummin eased his grip slightly and said, with an air of honest
concern, “You’ve hurt that one badly.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’m afraid so. If he had fallen a little differently,
he would have snapped his neck.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “What kind of a mathematician are you?”</p>
<p>“A Heliconian one.” He stooped to pick up the knife and, after
examining it, said, “Disgusting—and deadly.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “An ordinary blade would do the job without requiring a
power source. —But let’s let these two go. I doubt they want to continue
any further.”</p>
<p>He released Marbie, who rubbed first his shoulder then his neck.
Gasping for air, he turned hate-filled eyes on the two men.</p>
<p>Hummin said sharply, “You two had better get out of here. Otherwise
we’ll have to give evidence against you for assault and attempted
murder. This knife can surely be traced to you.”</p>
<p>Seldon and Hummin watched while Marbie dragged Alem to his feet and
then helped him stagger away, still bent in pain. They looked back once
or twice, but Seldon and Hummin watched impassively.</p>
<p>Seldon held out his hand. “How do I thank you for coming to the aid
of a stranger against two attackers? I doubt I would have been able to
handle them both on my own.”</p>
<p>Hummin raised his hand in a deprecatory manner. “I wasn’t afraid of
them. They’re just street-brawling lackeys. All I had to do was get my
hands on them—and yours, too, of course.”</p>
<p>“That’s a pretty deadly grip you have,” Seldon mused.</p>
<p>Hummin shrugged. “You too.” Then, without changing his tone of voice,
he said, “Come on, we’d better get out of here. We’re wasting time.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Why do we have to get away? Are you afraid those two
will come back?”</p>
<p>“Not in their lifetime. But some of those brave people who cleared
out of the park so quickly in their eagerness to spare themselves a
disagreeable sight may have alerted the police.”</p>
<p>“Fine. We have the hoodlums’ names. And we can describe them fairly
well.”</p>
<p>“Describe them? Why would the police want them?”</p>
<p>“They committed an assault—”</p>
<p>“Don’t be foolish. We don’t have a scratch. They’re virtually
hospital bait, especially Alem. We’re the ones who will be charged.”</p>
<p>“But that’s impossible. Those people witnessed the fact that—”</p>
<p>“No people will be called. —Seldon, get this into your head. Those
two came to find you—specifically you. They were told you were wearing
Heliconian clothes and you must have been described precisely. Perhaps
they were even shown a holograph. I suspect they were sent by the people
who happen to control the police, so let’s not wait any longer.”</p>
<p>Hummin hurried off, his hand gripping Seldon’s upper arm. Seldon
found the grip impossible to shake and, feeling like a child in the
hands of an impetuous nurse, followed.</p>
<p>They plunged into an arcade and, before Seldon’s eyes grew accustomed
to the dimmer light, they heard the burring sound of a ground-car’s
brakes.</p>
<p>“There they are,” muttered Hummin. “Faster, Seldon.” They hopped onto
a moving corridor and lost themselves in the crowd.</p>
