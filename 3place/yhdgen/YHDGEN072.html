<p>THE RUINS OF TRANTOR</p>
<p>The location of an objective upon the great world of Trantor presents
a problem unique in the Galaxy. There are no continents or oceans to
locate from a thousand miles’ distance. There are no rivers, lakes, and
islands to catch sight of through the cloud rifts.</p>
<p>The metal-covered world was—had been—one colossal city, and only the
old Imperial palace could be identified readily from outer space by a
stranger. The Bayta circled the world at almost air-car height in
repeated painful search.</p>
<p>From polar regions, where the icy coating of the metal spires were
somber evidence of the breakdown or neglect of the weather-conditioning
machinery, they worked southwards. Occasionally they could experiment
with the correlations—(or presumable correlations)—between what they saw
and what the inadequate map obtained at Neotrantor showed.</p>
<p>But it was unmistakable when it came. The gap in the metal coat of
the planet was fifty miles. The unusual greenery spread over hundreds of
square miles, enclosing the mighty grace of the ancient Imperial
residences.</p>
<p>The Bayta hovered and slowly oriented itself. There were only the
huge supercauseways to guide them. Long straight arrows on the map,
smooth, gleaming ribbons there below them.</p>
<p>What the map indicated to be the University area was reached by dead
reckoning, and upon the flat area of what once must have been a busy
landing field, the ship lowered itself.</p>
<p>It was only as they submerged into the welter of metal that the
smooth beauty apparent from the air dissolved into the broken, twisted
near-wreckage that had been left in the wake of the Sack. Spires were
truncated, smooth walls gouted and twisted, and just for an instant
there was the glimpse of a shaven area of earth—perhaps several hundred
acres in extent—dark and plowed.</p>
<p>Lee Senter waited as the ship settled downward cautiously. It was a
strange ship, not from Neotrantor, and inwardly he sighed. Strange ships
and confused dealings with the men of outer space could mean the end of
the short days of peace, a return to the old grandiose times of death
and battle. Senter was leader of the Group; the old books were in his
charge and he had read of those old days. He did not want them.</p>
<p>Perhaps ten minutes spent themselves as the strange ship came down to
nestle upon the flatness, but long memories telescoped themselves in
that time. There was first the great farm of his childhood—that remained
in his mind merely as busy crowds of people. Then there was the trek of
the young families to new lands. He was ten, then; an only child,
puzzled, and frightened.</p>
<p>Then the new buildings; the great metal slabs to be uprooted and torn
aside; the exposed soil to be turned, and freshened, and invigorated;
neighboring buildings to be torn down and leveled; others to be
transformed to living quarters.</p>
<p>There were crops to be grown and harvested; peaceful relations with
neighboring farms to be established—</p>
<p>There was growth and expansion, and the quiet efficiency of
self-rule. There was the coming of a new generation of hard, little
youngsters born to the soil. There was the great day when he was chosen
leader of the Group and for the first time since his eighteenth birthday
he did not shave and saw the first stubble of his Leader’s Beard
appear.</p>
<p>And now the Galaxy might intrude and put an end to the brief idyll of
isolation—</p>
<p>The ship landed. He watched wordlessly as the port opened. Four
emerged, cautious and watchful. There were three men, varied, old,
young, thin, and beaked. And a woman striding among them like an equal.
His hand left the two glassy black tufts of his beard as he stepped
forward.</p>
<p>He gave the universal gesture of peace. Both hands were before him;
hard, callused palms upward.</p>
<p>The young man approached two steps and duplicated the gesture. “I
come in peace.”</p>
<p>The accent was strange, but the words were understandable, and
welcome. He replied, deeply, “In peace be it. You are welcome to the
hospitality of the Group. Are you hungry? You shall eat. Are you
thirsty? You shall drink.”</p>
<p>Slowly, the reply came, “We thank you for your kindness, and shall
bear good report of your Group when we return to our world.”</p>
<p>A queer answer, but good. Behind him, the men of the Group were
smiling, and from the recesses of the surrounding structures, the women
emerged.</p>
<p>In his own quarters, he removed the locked, mirror-walled box from
its hidden place, and offered each of the guests the long, plump cigars
that were reserved for great occasions. Before the woman, he hesitated.
She had taken a seat among the men. The strangers evidently allowed,
even expected, such effrontery. Stiffly, he offered the box.</p>
<p>She accepted one with a smile, and drew in its aromatic smoke, with
all the relish one could expect. Lee Senter repressed a scandalized
emotion.</p>
<p>The stiff conversation, in advance of the meal, touched politely upon
the subject of farming on Trantor.</p>
<p>It was the old man who asked, “What about hydroponics? Surely, for
such a world as Trantor, hydroponics would be the answer.”</p>
<p>Senter shook his head slowly. He felt uncertain. His knowledge was
the unfamiliar matter of the books he had read, “Artificial farming in
chemicals, I think? No, not on Trantor. This hydroponics requires a
world of industry—for instance, a great chemical industry. And in war or
disaster, when industry breaks down, the people starve. Nor can all
foods be grown artificially. Some lose their food value. The soil is
cheaper, still better—always more dependable.”</p>
<p>“And your food supply is sufficient?”</p>
<p>“Sufficient; perhaps monotonous. We have fowl that supply eggs, and
milk-yielders for our dairy products—but our meat supply rests upon our
foreign trade.”</p>
<p>“Trade.” The young man seemed roused to sudden interest. “You trade
then. But what do you export?”</p>
<p>“Metal,” was the curt answer. “Look for yourself. We have an infinite
supply, ready processed. They come from Neotrantor with ships, demolish
an indicated area—increasing our growing space—and leave us in exchange
meat, canned fruit, food concentrates, farm machinery, and so on. They
carry off the metal and both sides profit.”</p>
<p>They feasted on bread and cheese, and a vegetable stew that was
unreservedly delicious. It was over the dessert of frosted fruit, the
only imported item on the menu, that, for the first time, the Outlanders
became other than mere guests. The young man produced a map of
Trantor.</p>
<p>Calmly, Lee Senter studied it. He listened—and said gravely, “The
University Grounds are a static area. We farmers do not grow crops on
it. We do not, by preference, even enter it. It is one of our few relics
of another time we would keep undisturbed.”</p>
<p>“We are seekers after knowledge. We would disturb nothing. Our ship
would be our hostage.” The old man offered this—eagerly, feverishly.</p>
<p>“I can take you there then,” said Senter.</p>
<p>That night the strangers slept, and that night Lee Senter sent a
message to Neotrantor.</p>
