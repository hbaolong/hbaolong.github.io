<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>Seldon had tried to persuade Hummin to take him to his hotel room,
but Hummin would have none of that.</p>
<p>“Are you mad?” he half-whispered. “They’ll be waiting for you
there.”</p>
<p>“But all my belongings are waiting for me there too.”</p>
<p>“They’ll just have to wait.”</p>
<p>And now they were in a small room in a pleasant apartment structure
that might be anywhere for all that Seldon could tell. He looked about
the one-room unit. Most of it was taken up by a desk and chair, a bed,
and a computer outlet. There were no dining facilities or washstand of
any kind, though Hummin had directed him to a communal washroom down the
hall. Someone had entered before Seldon was quite through. He had cast
one brief and curious look at Seldon’s clothes, rather than at Seldon
himself, and had then looked away.</p>
<p>Seldon mentioned this to Hummin, who shook his head and said, “We’ll
have to get rid of your clothes. Too bad Helicon is so far out of
fashion—”</p>
<p>Seldon said impatiently, “How much of this might just be your
imagination, Hummin? You’ve got me half-convinced and yet it may be
merely a kind of … of—”</p>
<p>“Are you groping for the word ‘paranoia’?”</p>
<p>“All right, I am. This may be some strange paranoid notion of
yours.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Think about it, will you? I can’t argue it out
mathematically, but you’ve seen the Emperor. Don’t deny it. He wanted
something from you and you didn’t give it to him. Don’t deny that
either. I suspect that details of the future are what he wants and you
refused. Perhaps Demerzel thinks you’re only pretending not to have the
details—that you’re holding out for a higher price or that someone else
is bidding for it too. Who knows? I told you that if Demerzel wants you,
he’ll get you wherever you are. I told you that before those two
splitheads ever appeared on the scene. I’m a journalist and a
Trantorian. I know how these things go. At one point, Alem said, ‘He’s
the one we want.’ Do you remember that?”</p>
<p>“As it happens,” said Seldon, “I do.”</p>
<p>“To him I was only the ‘other motherlackey’ to be kept off, while he
went about the real job of assaulting you.”</p>
<p>Hummin sat down in the chair and pointed to the bed. “Stretch out,
Seldon. Make yourself comfortable. Whoever sent those two—it must have
been Demerzel, in my opinion—can send others, so we’ll have to get rid
of those clothes of yours. I think any other Heliconian in this sector
caught in his own world’s garb is going to have trouble until he can
prove he isn’t you.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on.”</p>
<p>“I mean it. You’ll have to take off the clothes and we’ll have to
atomize them—if we can get close enough to a disposal unit without being
seen. And before we can do that I’ll have to get you a Trantorian
outfit. You’re smaller than I am and I’ll take that into account. It
won’t matter if it doesn’t fit exactly—”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “I don’t have the credits to pay for it. Not
on me. What credits I have—and they aren’t much—are in my hotel
safe.”</p>
<p>“We’ll worry about that another time. You’ll have to stay here for an
hour or two while I go out in search of the necessary clothing.”</p>
<p>Seldon spread his hands and sighed resignedly. “All right. If it’s
that important, I’ll stay.”</p>
<p>“You won’t try to get back to your hotel? Word of honor?”</p>
<p>“My word as a mathematician. But I’m really embarrassed by all the
trouble you’re taking for me. And expense too. After all, despite all
this talk about Demerzel, they weren’t really out to hurt me or carry me
off. All I was threatened with was the removal of my clothes.”</p>
<p>“Not all. They were also going to take you to the spaceport and put
you on a hypership to Helicon.”</p>
<p>“That was a silly threat—not to be taken seriously.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to Helicon. I told them so. I’m going tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“And you still plan to go tomorrow?” asked Hummin.</p>
<p>“Certainly. Why not?”</p>
<p>“There are enormous reasons why not.”</p>
<p>Seldon suddenly felt angry. “Come on, Hummin, I can’t play this game
any further. I’m finished here and I want to go home. My tickets are in
the hotel room. Otherwise I’d try to exchange them for a trip today. I
mean it.”</p>
<p>“You can’t go back to Helicon.”</p>
<p>Seldon flushed. “Why not? Are they waiting for me there too?”</p>
<p>Hummin nodded. “Don’t fire up, Seldon. They would be waiting for you
there too. Listen to me. If you go to Helicon, you are as good as in
Demerzel’s hands. Helicon is good, safe Imperial territory. Has Helicon
ever rebelled, ever fallen into step behind the banner of an
anti-Emperor?”</p>
<p>“No, it hasn’t—and for good reason. It’s surrounded by larger worlds.
It depends on the Imperial peace for security.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Imperial forces on Helicon can therefore count on the full
cooperation of the local government. You would be under constant
surveillance at all times. Any time Demerzel wants you, he will be able
to have you. And, except for the fact that I am now warning you, you
would have no knowledge of this and you would be working in the open,
filled with a false security.”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous. If he wanted me in Helicon, why didn’t he simply
leave me to myself? I was going there tomorrow. Why would he send those
two hoodlums simply to hasten the matter by a few hours and risk putting
me on my guard?”</p>
<p>“Why should he think you would be put on your guard? He didn’t know
I’d be with you, immersing you in what you call my paranoia.”</p>
<p>“Even without the question of warning me, why all the fuss to hurry
me by a few hours?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps because he was afraid you would change your mind.”</p>
<p>“And go where, if not home? If he could pick me up on Helicon, he
could pick me up anywhere. He could pick me up on … on Anacreon, a good
ten thousand parsecs away—if it should fall into my head to go there.
What’s distance to hyperspatial ships? Even if I find a world that’s not
quite as subservient to the Imperial forces as Helicon is, what world is
in actual rebellion? The Empire is at peace. Even if some worlds are
still resentful of injustices in the past, none are going to defy the
Imperial armed forces to protect me. Moreover, anywhere but on Helicon I
won’t be a local citizen and there won’t even be that matter of
principle to help keep the Empire at bay.”</p>
<p>Hummin listened patiently, nodding slightly, but looking as grave and
as imperturbable as ever. He said, “You’re right, as far as you go, but
there’s one world that is not really under the Emperor’s control. That,
I think, is what must be disturbing Demerzel.”</p>
<p>Seldon thought a while, reviewing recent history and finding himself
unable to choose a world on which the Imperial forces might be helpless.
He said at last, “What world is that?”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “You’re on it, which is what makes the matter so
dangerous in Demerzel’s eyes, I imagine. It is not so much that he is
anxious to have you go to Helicon, as that he is anxious to have you
leave Trantor before it occurs to you, for any reason—even if only
tourist’s mania—to stay.”</p>
<p>The two men sat in silence until Seldon finally said sardonically,
“Trantor! The capital of the Empire, with the home base of the fleet on
a space station in orbit about it, with the best units of the army
quartered here. If you believe that it is Trantor that is the safe
world, you’re progressing from paranoia to outright fantasy.”</p>
<p>“No! You’re an Outworlder, Seldon. You don’t know what Trantor is
like. It’s forty billion people and there are few other worlds with even
a tenth of its population. It is of unimaginable technological and
cultural complexity. Where we are now is the Imperial Sector—with the
highest standard of living in the Galaxy and populated entirely by
Imperial functionaries. Elsewhere on the planet, however, are over eight
hundred other sectors, some of them with subcultures totally different
from what we have here and most of them untouchable by Imperial
forces.”</p>
<p>“Why untouchable?”</p>
<p>“The Empire cannot seriously exert force against Trantor. To do so
would be bound to shake some facet or other of the technology on which
the whole planet depends. The technology is so interrelated that to snap
one of the interconnections is to cripple the whole. Believe me, Seldon,
we on Trantor observe what happens when there is an earthquake that
manages to escape being damped out, a volcanic eruption that is not
vented in time, a storm that is not defused, or just some human error
that escapes notice. The planet totters and every effort must be made to
restore the balance at once.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard of such a thing.”</p>
<p>A small smile flickered its way across Hummin’s face. “Of course not.
Do you want the Empire to advertise the weakness at its core? However,
as a journalist, I know what happens even when the Outworlds don’t, even
when much of Trantor itself doesn’t, even when the Imperial pressure is
interested in concealing events. Believe me! The Emperor knows—and Eto
Demerzel knows—even if you don’t, that to disturb Trantor may destroy
the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Then are you suggesting I stay on Trantor for that reason?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I can take you to a place on Trantor where you will be
absolutely safe from Demerzel. You won’t have to change your name and
you will be able to operate entirely in the open and he won’t be able to
touch you. That’s why he wanted to force you off Trantor at once and if
it hadn’t been for the quirk of fate that brought us together and for
your surprising ability to defend yourself, he would have succeeded in
doing so.”</p>
<p>“But how long will I have to remain on Trantor?”</p>
<p>“For as long as your safety requires it, Seldon. For the rest of your
life, perhaps.”</p>
