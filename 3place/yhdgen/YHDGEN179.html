<p>“That was good!” said Seldon explosively. “It was considerably better
than the food Graycloud brought—”</p>
<p>Dors said reasonably, “You have to remember that Graycloud’s woman
had to prepare it on short notice in the middle of the night.” She
paused and said, “I wish they would say ‘wife.’ They make ‘woman’ sound
like such an appanage, like ‘my house’ or ‘my robe.’ It is absolutely
demeaning.”</p>
<p>“I know. It’s infuriating. But they might well make ‘wife’ sound like
an appanage as well. It’s the way they live and the Sisters don’t seem
to mind. You and I aren’t going to change it by lecturing. —Anyway, did
you see how the Sisters did it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did and they made everything seem very simple. I doubted I
could remember everything they did, but they insisted I wouldn’t have
to. I could get away with mere heating. I gathered the bread had some
sort of microderivative added to it in the baking that both raised the
dough and lent it that crunchy consistency and warm flavor. Just a hint
of pepper, didn’t you think?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t tell, but whatever it was, I didn’t get enough. And the
soup. Did you recognize any of the vegetables?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“And what was the sliced meat? Could you tell?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was sliced meat, actually. We did have a lamb dish
back on Cinna that it reminded me of.”</p>
<p>“It was certainly not lamb.”</p>
<p>“I said that I doubted it was meat at all. —I don’t think anyone
outside Mycogen eats like this either. Not even the Emperor, I’m sure.
Whatever the Mycogenians sell is, I’m willing to bet, near the bottom of
the line. They save the best for themselves. We had better not stay here
too long, Hari. If we get used to eating like this, we’ll never be able
to acclimatize ourselves to the miserable stuff they have outside.” She
laughed.</p>
<p>Seldon laughed too. He took another sip at the fruit juice, which
tasted far more tantalizing than any fruit juice he had ever sipped
before, and said, “Listen, when Hummin took me to the University, we
stopped at a roadside diner and had some food that was heavily yeasted.
It tasted like—No, never mind what it tasted like, but I wouldn’t have
thought it conceivable, then, that microfood could taste like this. I
wish the Sisters were still here. It would have been polite to thank
them.”</p>
<p>“I think they were quite aware of how we would feel. I remarked on
the wonderful smell while everything was warming and they said, quite
complacently, that it would taste even better.”</p>
<p>“The older one said that, I imagine.”</p>
<p>“Yes. The younger one giggled. —And they’ll be back. They’re going to
bring me a kirtle, so that I can go out to see the shops with them. And
they made it clear I would have to wash my face if I was to be seen in
public. They will show me where to buy some good-quality kirtles of my
own and where I can buy ready-made meals of all kinds. All I’ll have to
do is heat them up. They explained that decent Sisters wouldn’t do that,
but would start from scratch. In fact, some of the meal they prepared
for us was simply heated and they apologized for that. They managed to
imply, though, that tribespeople couldn’t be expected to appreciate true
artistry in cooking, so that simply heating prepared food would do for
us. —They seem to take it for granted, by the way, that I will be doing
all the shopping and cooking.”</p>
<p>“As we say at home, ‘When in Trantor, do as the Trantorians do.’”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was sure that would be your attitude in this case.”</p>
<p>“I’m only human,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“The usual excuse,” said Dors with a small smile.</p>
<p>Seldon leaned back with a satisfactory well-filled feeling and said,
“You’ve been on Trantor for two years, Dors, so you might understand a
few things that I don’t. Is it your opinion that this odd social system
the Mycogenians have is part of a supernaturalistic view they have?”</p>
<p>“Supernaturalistic?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Would you have heard that this was so?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘supernaturalistic’?”</p>
<p>“The obvious. A belief in entities that are independent of natural
law, that are not bound by the conservation of energy, for instance, or
by the existence of a constant of action.”</p>
<p>“I see. You’re asking if Mycogen is a religious community.”</p>
<p>It was Seldon’s turn. “Religious?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s an archaic term, but we historians use it—our study is
riddled with archaic terms. ‘Religious’ is not precisely equivalent to
‘supernaturalistic,’ though it contains richly supernaturalistic
elements. I can’t answer your specific question, however, because I’ve
never made any special investigation of Mycogen. Still, from what little
I’ve seen of the place and from my knowledge of religions in history, I
wouldn’t be surprised if the Mycogenian society was religious in
character.”</p>
<p>“In that case, would it surprise you if Mycogenian legends were also
religious in character?”</p>
<p>“No, it wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“And therefore not based on historical matter?”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t necessarily follow. The core of the legends might
still be authentically historic, allowing for distortion and
supernaturalistic intermixture.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Seldon and seemed to retire into his thoughts.</p>
<p>Finally Dors broke the silence that followed and said, “It’s not so
uncommon, you know. There is a considerable religious element on many
worlds. It’s grown stronger in the last few centuries as the Empire has
grown more turbulent. On my world of Cinna, at least a quarter of the
population is tritheistic.”</p>
<p>Seldon was again painfully and regretfully conscious of his ignorance
of history. He said, “Were there times in past history when religion was
more prominent than it is today?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. In addition, there are new varieties springing up
constantly. The Mycogenian religion, whatever it might be, could be
relatively new and may be restricted to Mycogen itself. I couldn’t
really tell without considerable study.”</p>
<p>“But now we get to the point of it, Dors. Is it your opinion that
women are more apt to be religious than men are?”</p>
<p>Dors Venabili raised her eyebrows. “I’m not sure if we can assume
anything as simple as that.” She thought a bit. “I suspect that those
elements of a population that have a smaller stake in the material
natural world are more apt to find solace in what you call
supernaturalism—the poor, the disinherited, the downtrodden. Insofar as
supernaturalism overlaps religion, they may also be more religious.
There are obviously many exceptions in both directions. Many of the
downtrodden may lack religion; many of the rich, powerful, and satisfied
may possess it.”</p>
<p>“But in Mycogen,” said Seldon, “where the women seem to be treated as
subhuman—would I be right in assuming they would be more religious than
the men, more involved in the legends that the society has been
preserving?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t risk my life on it, Hari, but I’d be willing to risk a
week’s income on it.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Seldon thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Dors smiled at him. “There’s a bit of your psychohistory, Hari. Rule
number 47,854: The downtrodden are more religious than the
satisfied.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “Don’t joke about psychohistory, Dors. You
know I’m not looking for tiny rules but for vast generalizations and for
means of manipulation. I don’t want comparative religiosity as the
result of a hundred specific rules. I want something from which I can,
after manipulation through some system of mathematicized logic, say,
‘Aha, this group of people will tend to be more religious than that
group, provided that the following criteria are met, and that,
therefore, when humanity meets with these stimuli, it will react with
these responses.’”</p>
<p>“How horrible,” said Dors. “You are picturing human beings as simple
mechanical devices. Press this button and you will get that twitch.”</p>
<p>“No, because there will be many buttons pushing simultaneously to
varying degrees and eliciting so many responses of different sorts that
overall the predictions of the future will be statistical in nature, so
that the individual human being will remain a free agent.”</p>
<p>“How can you know this?”</p>
<p>“I can’t,” said Seldon. “At least, I don’t know it. I feel it to be
so. It is what I consider to be the way things ought to be. If I can
find the axioms, the fundamental Laws of Humanics, so to speak, and the
necessary mathematical treatment, then I will have my psychohistory. I
have proved that, in theory, this is possible—”</p>
<p>“But impractical, right?”</p>
<p>“I keep saying so.”</p>
<p>A small smile curved Dors’s lips, “Is that what you are doing, Hari,
looking for some sort of solution to this problem?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I swear to you I don’t know. But Chetter Hummin is so
anxious to find a solution and, for some reason, I am anxious to please
him. He is so persuasive a man.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>
<p>Seldon let that comment pass, although a small frown flitted across
his face.</p>
<p>Seldon continued. “Hummin insists the Empire is decaying, that it
will collapse, that psychohistory is the only hope for saving it—or
cushioning it or ameliorating it—and that without it humanity will be
destroyed or, at the very least, go through prolonged misery. He seems
to place the responsibility for preventing that on me. Now, the Empire
will certainly last my time, but if I’m to live at ease, I must lift
that responsibility from my shoulders. I must convince myself—and even
convince Hummin—that psychohistory is not a practical way out; that,
despite theory, it cannot be developed. So I must follow up as many
leads as I can and show that each one must fail.”</p>
<p>“Leads? Like going back in history to a time when human society was
smaller than it is now?”</p>
<p>“Much smaller. And far less complex.”</p>
<p>“And showing that a solution is still impractical?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But who is going to describe the early world for you? If the
Mycogenians have some coherent picture of the primordial Galaxy,
Sunmaster certainly won’t reveal it to a tribesman. No Mycogenian will.
This is an ingrown society—how many times have we already said it?—and
its members are suspicious of tribesmen to the point of paranoia.
They’ll tell us nothing.”</p>
<p>“I will have to think of a way to persuade some Mycogenians to talk.
Those Sisters, for instance.”</p>
<p>“They won’t even hear you, male that you are, any more than Sunmaster
hears me. And even if they do talk to you, what would they know but a
few catch phrases?”</p>
<p>“I must start somewhere.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Well, let me think. Hummin says I must protect you and I
interpret that as meaning I must help you when I can. What do I know
about religion? That’s nowhere near my specialty, you know. I have
always dealt with economic forces, rather than philosophic forces, but
you can’t split history into neat little nonoverlapping divisions. For
instance, religions tend to accumulate wealth when successful and that
eventually tends to distort the economic development of a society.
—There, incidentally, is one of the numerous rules of human history that
you’ll have to derive from your basic Laws of Humanics or whatever you
called them. But …”</p>
<p>And here, Dors’s voice faded away as she lapsed into thought. Seldon
watched her cautiously and Dors’s eyes glazed as though she was looking
deep within herself.</p>
<p>Finally she said, “This is not an invariable rule, but it seems to me
that on many occasions, a religion has a book—or books—of significance;
books that give their ritual, their view of history, their sacred
poetry, and who knows what else. Usually, those books are open to all
and are a means of proselytization. Sometimes they are secret.”</p>
<p>“Do you think Mycogen has books of that sort?”</p>
<p>“To be truthful,” said Dors thoughtfully, “I have never heard of any.
I might have if they existed openly—which means they either don’t exist
or are kept secret. In either case, it seems to me you are not going to
see them.”</p>
<p>“At least it’s a starting point,” said Seldon grimly.</p>
