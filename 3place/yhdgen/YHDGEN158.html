<h4 id="section">20</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon sat back in his chair in the alcove that had been
assigned to him through Dors Venabili’s intervention. He was
dissatisfied.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, although that was the expression he used in his
mind, he knew that it was a gross underestimation of his feelings. He
was not simply dissatisfied, he was furious—all the more so because he
wasn’t sure what it was he was furious about. Was it about the
histories? The writers and compilers of histories? The worlds and people
that made the histories?</p>
<p>Whatever the target of his fury, it didn’t really matter. What
counted was that his notes were useless, his new knowledge was useless,
everything was useless.</p>
<p>He had been at the University now for almost six weeks. He had
managed to find a computer outlet at the very start and with it had
begun work—without instruction, but using the instincts he had developed
over a number of years of mathematical labors. It had been slow and
halting, but there was a certain pleasure in gradually determining the
routes by which he could get his questions answered.</p>
<p>Then came the week of instruction with Dors, which had taught him
several dozen shortcuts and had brought with it two sets of
embarrassments. The first set included the sidelong glances he received
from the undergraduates, who seemed contemptuously aware of his greater
age and who were disposed to frown a bit at Dors’s constant use of the
honorific “Doctor” in addressing him.</p>
<p>“I don’t want them to think,” she said, “that you’re some backward
perpetual student taking remedial history.”</p>
<p>“But surely you’ve established the point. Surely, a mere ‘Seldon’ is
sufficient now.”</p>
<p>“No,” Dors said and smiled suddenly. “Besides, I like to call you
‘Dr. Seldon.’ I like the way you look uncomfortable each time.”</p>
<p>“You have a peculiar sense of sadistic humor.”</p>
<p>“Would you deprive me?”</p>
<p>For some reason, that made him laugh. Surely, the natural reaction
would have been to deny sadism. Somehow he found it pleasant that she
accepted the ball of conversation and fired it back. The thought led to
a natural question. “Do you play tennis here at the University?”</p>
<p>“We have courts, but I don’t play.”</p>
<p>“Good. I’ll teach you. And when I do, I’ll call you Professor
Venabili.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you call me in class anyway.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be surprised how ridiculous it will sound on the tennis
court.”</p>
<p>“I may get to like it.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will try to find what else you might get to
like.”</p>
<p>“I see you have a peculiar sense of salacious humor.”</p>
<p>She had put that ball in that spot deliberately and he said, “Would
you deprive me?”</p>
<p>She smiled and later did surprisingly well on the tennis court. “Are
you sure you never played tennis?” he said, puffing, after one
session.</p>
<p>“Positive,” she said.</p>
<p>The other set of embarrassments was more private. He learned the
necessary techniques of historical research and then burned—in
private—at his earlier attempts to make use of the computer’s memory. It
was simply an entirely different mind-set from that used in mathematics.
It was equally logical, he supposed, since it could be used,
consistently and without error, to move in whatever direction he wanted
to, but it was a substantially different brand of logic from that to
which he was accustomed.</p>
<p>But with or without instructions, whether he stumbled or moved in
swiftly, he simply didn’t get any results.</p>
<p>His annoyance made itself felt on the tennis court. Dors quickly
reached the stage where it was no longer necessary to lob easy balls at
her to give her time to judge direction and distance. That made it easy
to forget that she was just a beginner and he expressed his anger in his
swing, firing the ball back at her as though it were a laser beam made
solid.</p>
<p>She came trotting up to the net and said, “I can understand your
wanting to kill me, since it must annoy you to watch me miss the shots
so often. How is it, though, that you managed to miss my head by about
three centimeters that time? I mean, you didn’t even nick me. Can’t you
do better than that?”</p>
<p>Seldon, horrified, tried to explain, but only managed to sound
incoherent.</p>
<p>She said, “Look. I’m not going to face any other returns of yours
today, so why don’t we shower and then get together for some tea and
whatever and you can tell me just what you were trying to kill. If it
wasn’t my poor head and if you don’t get the real victim off your chest,
you’ll be entirely too dangerous on the other side of the net for me to
want to serve as a target.”</p>
<p>Over tea he said, “Dors, I’ve scanned history after history; just
scanned, browsed. I haven’t had time for deep study yet. Even so, it’s
become obvious. All the book-films concentrate on the same few
events.”</p>
<p>“Crucial ones. History-making ones.”</p>
<p>“That’s just an excuse. They’re copying each other. There are
twenty-five million worlds out there and there’s significant mention of
perhaps twenty-five.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “You’re reading general Galactic histories only. Look up
the special histories of some of the minor worlds. On every world,
however small, the children are taught local histories before they ever
find out there’s a great big Galaxy outside. Don’t you yourself know
more about Helicon, right now, than you know about the rise of Trantor
or of the Great Interstellar War?”</p>
<p>“That sort of knowledge is limited too,” said Seldon gloomily. “I
know Heliconian geography and the stories of its settlement and of the
malfeasance and misfeasance of the planet Jennisek—that’s our
traditional enemy, though our teachers carefully told us that we ought
to say ‘traditional rival.’ But I never learned anything about the
contributions of Helicon to general Galactic history.”</p>
<p>“Maybe there weren’t any.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly. Of course there were. There may not have been great,
huge space battles involving Helicon or crucial rebellions or peace
treaties. There may not have been some Imperial competitor making his
base on Helicon. But there must have been subtle influences. Surely,
nothing can happen anywhere without affecting everywhere else. Yet
there’s nothing I can find to help me. —See here, Dors. In mathematics,
all can be found in the computer; everything we know or have found out
in twenty thousand years. In history, that’s not so. Historians pick and
choose and every one of them picks and chooses the same thing.”</p>
<p>“But, Hari,” said Dors, “mathematics is an orderly thing of human
invention. One thing follows from another. There are definitions and
axioms, all of which are known. It is … it is … all one piece. History
is different. It is the unconscious working out of the deeds and
thoughts of quadrillions of human beings. Historians must pick and
choose.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Seldon, “but I must know all of history if I am to
work out the laws of psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“In that case, you won’t ever formulate the laws of
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>That was yesterday. Now Seldon sat in his chair in his alcove, having
spent another day of utter failure, and he could hear Dors’s voice
saying, “In that case, you won’t ever formulate the laws of
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>It was what he had thought to begin with and if it hadn’t been for
Hummin’s conviction to the contrary and his odd ability to fire Seldon
with his own blaze of conviction, Seldon would have continued to think
so.</p>
<p>And yet neither could he quite let go. Might there not be some way
out?</p>
<p>He couldn’t think of any.</p>
<p>TRANTOR—… It is almost never pictured as a world seen from space. It
has long since captured the general mind of humanity as a world of the
interior and the image is that of the human hive that existed under the
domes. Yet there was an exterior as well and there are holographs that
still remain that were taken from space and show varying degrees of
detail (see Figures 14 and 15). Note that the surface of the domes, the
interface of the vast city and the overlying atmosphere, a surface
referred to in its time as “Upperside,” is …</p>
