<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>They traveled along walkways where the light was soft and yellow.
Hummin’s eyes moved this way and that, watchful, and he kept their pace
at crowd speed, neither passing nor being passed.</p>
<p>He kept up a mild but steady conversation on indifferent topics.</p>
<p>Seldon, edgy and unable to do the same, said, “There seems to be a
great deal of walking here. There are endless lines in both directions
and along the crossovers.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Hummin. “Walking is still the best form of
short-distance transportation. It’s the most convenient, the cheapest,
and the most healthful. Countless years of technological advance have
not changed that. —Are you acrophobic, Seldon?”</p>
<p>Seldon looked over the railing on his right into a deep declivity
that separated the two walking lanes—each in an opposite direction
between the regularly spaced crossovers. He shuddered slightly. “If you
mean fear of heights, not ordinarily. Still, looking down isn’t
pleasant. How far does it go down?”</p>
<p>“Forty or fifty levels at this point, I think. This sort of thing is
common in the Imperial Sector and a few other highly developed regions.
In most places, one walks at what might be considered ground level.”</p>
<p>“I should imagine this would encourage suicide attempts.”</p>
<p>“Not often. There are far easier methods. Besides, suicide is not a
matter of social obloquy on Trantor. One can end one’s life by various
recognized methods in centers that exist for the purpose—if one is
willing to go through some psychotherapy at first. There are occasional
accidents, for that matter, but that’s not why I was asking about
acrophobia. We’re heading for a taxi rental where they know me as a
journalist. I’ve done favors for them occasionally and sometimes they do
favors for me in return. They’ll forget to record me and won’t notice
that I have a companion. Of course, I’ll have to pay a premium and,
again of course, if Demerzel’s people lean on them hard enough, they’ll
have to tell the truth and put it down to slovenly accounting, but that
may take considerable time.”</p>
<p>“Where does the acrophobia come in?”</p>
<p>“Well, we can get there a lot faster if we use a gravitic lift. Not
many people use it and I must tell you that I’m not overjoyed at the
idea myself, but if you think you can handle it, we had better.”</p>
<p>“What’s a gravitic lift?”</p>
<p>“It’s experimental. The time may come when it will be widespread over
Trantor, provided it becomes psychologically acceptable—or can be made
so to enough people. Then, maybe, it will spread to other worlds too.
It’s an elevator shaft without an elevator cab, so to speak. We just
step into empty space and drop slowly—or rise slowly—under the influence
of antigravity. It’s about the only application of antigravity that’s
been established so far, largely because it’s the simplest possible
application.”</p>
<p>“What happens if the power blinks out while we’re in transit?”</p>
<p>“Exactly what you would think. We fall and—unless we’re quite near
the bottom to begin with—we die. I haven’t heard of it happening yet
and, believe me, if it had happened I would know. We might not be able
to give out the news for security reasons—that’s the excuse they always
advance for hiding bad news—but I would know. It’s just up ahead. If you
can’t manage it, we won’t do it, but the corridors are slow and tedious
and many find them nauseating after a while.”</p>
<p>Hummin turned down a crossover and into a large recess where a line
of men and women were waiting, one or two with children.</p>
<p>Seldon said in a low voice, “I heard nothing of this back home. Of
course, our own news media are terribly local, but you’d think there’d
be some mention that this sort of thing exists.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “It’s strictly experimental and is confined to the
Imperial Sector. It uses more energy than it’s worth, so the government
is not really anxious to push it right now by giving it publicity. The
old Emperor, Stanel VI, the one before Cleon who amazed everyone by
dying in his bed, insisted on having it installed in a few places. He
wanted his name associated with antigravity, they say, because he was
concerned with his place in history, as old men of no great attainments
frequently are. As I said, the technique may spread, but, on the other
hand, it is possible that nothing much more than the gravitic lift will
ever come of it.”</p>
<p>“What do they want to come of it?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>“Antigrav spaceflight. That, however, will require many breakthroughs
and most physicists, as far as I know, are firmly convinced it is out of
the question. —But, then, most thought that even gravitic lifts were out
of the question.”</p>
<p>The line ahead was rapidly growing shorter and Seldon found himself
standing with Hummin at the edge of the floor with an open gap before
him. The air ahead faintly glittered. Automatically, he reached out his
hand and felt a light shock. It didn’t hurt, but he snatched his hand
back quickly.</p>
<p>Hummin grunted. “An elementary precaution to prevent anyone walking
over the edge before activating the controls.” He punched some numbers
on the control board and the glitter vanished.</p>
<p>Seldon peered over the edge, down the deep shaft.</p>
<p>“You might find it better—or easier,” said Hummin, “if we link arms
and if you close your eyes. It won’t take more than a few seconds.”</p>
<p>He gave Seldon no choice, actually. He took his arm and once again
there was no hanging back in that firm grip. Hummin stepped into
nothingness and Seldon (who heard himself, to his own embarrassment,
emit a small squeak) shuffled off with a lurch.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes tightly and experienced no sense of falling, no
feeling of air movement. A few seconds passed and he was pulled forward.
He tripped slightly, caught his balance, and found himself on solid
ground.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes. “Did we make it?”</p>
<p>Hummin said dryly, “We’re not dead,” then walked away, his grip
forcing Seldon to follow.</p>
<p>“I mean, did we get to the right level?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“What would have happened if we were dropping down and someone else
was moving upward?”</p>
<p>“There are two separate lanes. In one lane everyone drops at the same
speed; in the other everyone rises at the same speed. The shaft clears
only when there are no people within ten meters of each other. There is
no chance of a collision if all works well.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t feel a thing.”</p>
<p>“Why should you? There was no acceleration. After the first tenth of
a second, you were at constant speed and the air in your immediate
vicinity was moving down with you at the same speed.”</p>
<p>“Marvelous.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. But uneconomic. And there seems no great pressure to
increase the efficiency of the procedure and make it worthwhile.
Everywhere one hears the same refrain. ‘We can’t do it. It can’t be
done.’ It applies to everything.” Hummin shrugged in obvious anger and
said, “But we’re here at the taxi rental. Let’s get on with it.”</p>
