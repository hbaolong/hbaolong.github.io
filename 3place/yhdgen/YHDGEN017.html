<p>A deputation!</p>
<p>That Salvor Hardin had seen it coming made it none the more pleasant.
On the contrary, he found anticipation distinctly annoying.</p>
<p>Yohan Lee advocated extreme measures. “I don’t see, Hardin,” he said,
“that we need waste any time. They can’t do anything till next
election—legally, anyway—and that gives us a year. Give them the
brush-off.”</p>
<p>Hardin pursed his lips. “Lee, you’ll never learn. In the forty years
I’ve known you, you’ve never once learned the gentle art of sneaking up
from behind.”</p>
<p>“It’s not my way of fighting,” grumbled Lee.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know that. I suppose that’s why you’re the one man I trust.”
He paused and reached for a cigar. “We’ve come a long way, Lee, since we
engineered our coup against the Encyclopedists way back. I’m getting
old. Sixty-two. Do you ever think how fast those thirty years went?”</p>
<p>Lee snorted. “I don’t feel old, and I’m sixty-six.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I haven’t your digestion.” Hardin sucked lazily at his
cigar. He had long since stopped wishing for the mild Vegan tobacco of
his youth. Those days when the planet Terminus had trafficked with every
part of the Galactic Empire belonged in the limbo to which all Good Old
Days go. Toward the same limbo where the Galactic Empire was heading. He
wondered who the new emperor was—or if there was a new emperor at all—or
any Empire. Space! For thirty years now, since the breakup of
communications here at the edge of the Galaxy, the whole universe of
Terminus had consisted of itself and the four surrounding kingdoms.</p>
<p>How the mighty had fallen! Kingdoms! They were prefects in the old
days, all part of the same province, which in turn had been part of a
sector, which in turn had been part of a quadrant, which in turn had
been part of the all-embracing Galactic Empire. And now that the Empire
had lost control over the farther reaches of the Galaxy, these little
splinter groups of planets became kingdoms—with comic-opera kings and
nobles, and petty, meaningless wars, and a life that went on
pathetically among the ruins.</p>
<p>A civilization falling. Nuclear power forgotten. Science fading to
mythology—until the Foundation had stepped in. The Foundation that Hari
Seldon had established for just that purpose here on Terminus.</p>
<p>Lee was at the window and his voice broke in on Hardin’s reverie.
“They’ve come,” he said, “in a late-model ground car, the young pups.”
He took a few uncertain steps toward the door and then looked at
Hardin.</p>
<p>Hardin smiled, and waved him back. “I’ve given orders to have them
brought up here.”</p>
<p>“Here! What for? You’re making them too important.”</p>
<p>“Why go through all the ceremonies of an official mayor’s audience?
I’m getting too old for red tape. Besides which, flattery is useful when
dealing with youngsters—particularly when it doesn’t commit you to
anything.” He winked. “Sit down, Lee, and give me your moral backing.
I’ll need it with this young Sermak.”</p>
<p>“That fellow, Sermak,” said Lee, heavily, “is dangerous. He’s got a
following, Hardin, so don’t underestimate him.”</p>
<p>“Have I ever underestimated anybody?”</p>
<p>“Well, then, arrest him. You can accuse him of something or other
afterward.”</p>
<p>Hardin ignored that last bit of advice. “There they are, Lee.” In
response to the signal, he stepped on the pedal beneath his desk, and
the door slid aside.</p>
<p>They filed in, the four that composed the deputation, and Hardin
waved them gently to the armchairs that faced his desk in a semicircle.
They bowed and waited for the mayor to speak first.</p>
<p>Hardin flicked open the curiously carved silver lid of the cigar box
that had once belonged to Jord Fara of the old Board of Trustees in the
long-dead days of the Encyclopedists. It was a genuine Empire product
from Santanni, though the cigars it now contained were home-grown. One
by one, with grave solemnity, the four of the deputation accepted cigars
and lit up in ritualistic fashion.</p>
<p>Sef Sermak was second from the right, the youngest of the young
group—and the most interesting with his bristly yellow mustache trimmed
precisely, and his sunken eyes of uncertain color. The other three
Hardin dismissed almost immediately; they were rank and file on the face
of them. It was on Sermak that he concentrated, the Sermak who had
already, in his first term in the City Council, turned that sedate body
topsy-turvy more than once, and it was to Sermak that he said:</p>
<p>“I’ve been particularly anxious to see you, Councilman, ever since
your very excellent speech last month. Your attack on the foreign policy
of this government was a most capable one.”</p>
<p>Sermak’s eyes smoldered. “Your interest honors me. The attack may or
may not have been capable, but it was certainly justified.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps! Your opinions are yours, of course. Still you are rather
young.”</p>
<p>Dryly. “It is a fault that most people are guilty of at some period
of their life. You became mayor of the city when you were two years
younger than I am now.”</p>
<p>Hardin smiled to himself. The yearling was a cool customer. He said,
“I take it now that you have come to see me concerning this same foreign
policy that annoys you so greatly in the Council Chamber. Are you
speaking for your three colleagues, or must I listen to each of you
separately?”</p>
<p>There were quick mutual glances among the four young men, a slight
flickering of eyelids.</p>
<p>Sermak said grimly, “I speak for the people of Terminus—a people who
are not now truly represented in the rubberstamp body they call the
Council.”</p>
<p>“I see. Go ahead, then!”</p>
<p>“It comes to this, Mr. Mayor. We are dissatisfied—”</p>
<p>“By ‘we’ you mean ‘the people,’ don’t you?”</p>
<p>Sermak stared hostilely, sensing a trap, and replied coldly, “I
believe that my views reflect those of the majority of the voters of
Terminus. Does that suit you?”</p>
<p>“Well, a statement like that is all the better for proof, but go on,
anyway. You are dissatisfied.”</p>
<p>“Yes, dissatisfied with the policy which for thirty years has been
stripping Terminus defenseless against the inevitable attack from
outside.”</p>
<p>“I see. And therefore? Go on, go on.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice of you to anticipate. And therefore we are forming a new
political party; one that will stand for the immediate needs of Terminus
and not for a mystic ‘manifest destiny’ of future Empire. We are going
to throw you and your lick-spittle clique of appeasers out of City
Hall—and that soon.”</p>
<p>“Unless? There’s always an ‘unless,’ you know.”</p>
<p>“Not much of one in this case: Unless you resign now. I’m not asking
you to change your policies—I wouldn’t trust you that far. Your promises
are worth nothing. An outright resignation is all we’ll take.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Hardin crossed his legs and teetered his chairback on two
legs. “That’s your ultimatum. Nice of you to give me warning. But, you
see, I rather think I’ll ignore it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t think it was a warning, Mr. Mayor. It was an announcement of
principles and of action. The new party has already been formed, and it
will begin its official activities tomorrow. There is neither room nor
desire for compromise, and, frankly, it was only our recognition of your
services to the City that induced us to offer the easy way out. I didn’t
think you’d take it, but my conscience is clear. The next election will
be a more forcible and quite irresistible reminder that resignation is
necessary.”</p>
<p>He rose and motioned the rest up.</p>
<p>Hardin lifted his arm. “Hold on! Sit down!”</p>
<p>Sef Sermak seated himself once more with just a shade too much
alacrity and Hardin smiled behind a straight face. In spite of his
words, he was waiting for an offer.</p>
<p>Hardin said, “In exactly what way do you want our foreign policy
changed? Do you want us to attack the Four Kingdoms, now, at once, and
all four simultaneously?”</p>
<p>“I make no such suggestion, Mr. Mayor. It is our simple proposition
that all appeasement cease immediately. Throughout your administration,
you have carried out a policy of scientific aid to the Kingdoms. You
have given them nuclear power. You have helped rebuild power plants on
their territories. You have established medical clinics, chemical
laboratories and factories.”</p>
<p>“Well? And your objection?”</p>
<p>“You have done this in order to keep them from attacking us. With
these as bribes, you have been playing the fool in a colossal game of
blackmail, in which you have allowed Terminus to be sucked dry—with the
result that now we are at the mercy of these barbarians.”</p>
<p>“In what way?”</p>
<p>“Because you have given them power, given them weapons, actually
serviced the ships of their navies, they are infinitely stronger than
they were three decades ago. Their demands are increasing, and with
their new weapons, they will eventually satisfy all their demands at
once by violent annexation of Terminus. Isn’t that the way blackmail
usually ends?”</p>
<p>“And your remedy?”</p>
<p>“Stop the bribes immediately and while you can. Spend your effort in
strengthening Terminus itself—and attack first!”</p>
<p>Hardin watched the young fellow’s little blond mustache with an
almost morbid interest. Sermak felt sure of himself or he wouldn’t talk
so much. There was no doubt that his remarks were the reflection of a
pretty huge segment of the population, pretty huge.</p>
<p>His voice did not betray the slightly perturbed current of his
thoughts. It was almost negligent. “Are you finished?”</p>
<p>“For the moment.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, do you notice the framed statement I have on the wall
behind me? Read it, if you will!”</p>
<p>Sermak’s lips twitched. “It says: ‘Violence is the last refuge of the
incompetent.’ That’s an old man’s doctrine, Mr. Mayor.”</p>
<p>“I applied it as a young man, Mr. Councilman—and successfully. You
were busy being born when it happened, but perhaps you may have read
something of it in school.”</p>
<p>He eyed Sermak closely and continued in measured tones, “When Hari
Seldon established the Foundation here, it was for the ostensible
purpose of producing a great Encyclopedia, and for fifty years we
followed that will-of-the-wisp, before discovering what he was really
after. By that time, it was almost too late. When communications with
the central regions of the old Empire broke down, we found ourselves a
world of scientists concentrated in a single city, possessing no
industries, and surrounded by newly created kingdoms, hostile and
largely barbarous. We were a tiny island of nuclear power in this ocean
of barbarism, and an infinitely valuable prize.</p>
<p>“Anacreon, then as now, the most powerful of the Four Kingdoms,
demanded and later actually established a military base upon Terminus,
and the then rulers of the City, the Encyclopedists, knew very well that
this was only a preliminary to taking over the entire planet. That is
how matters stood when I … uh … assumed actual government. What would
you have done?”</p>
<p>Sermak shrugged his shoulders. “That’s an academic question. Of
course, I know what you did.”</p>
<p>“I’ll repeat it, anyway. Perhaps you don’t get the point. The
temptation was great to muster what force we could and put up a fight.
It’s the easiest way out, and the most satisfactory to self-respect—but,
nearly invariably, the stupidest. You would have done it; you and your
talk of ‘attack first.’ What I did, instead, was to visit the three
other kingdoms, one by one; point out to each that to allow the secret
of nuclear power to fall into the hands of Anacreon was the quickest way
of cutting their own throats; and suggest gently that they do the
obvious thing. That was all. One month after the Anacreonian force had
landed on Terminus, their king received a joint ultimatum from his three
neighbors. In seven days, the last Anacreonian was off Terminus.</p>
<p>“Now tell me, where was the need for violence?”</p>
<p>The young councilman regarded his cigar stub thoughtfully and tossed
it into the incinerator chute. “I fail to see the analogy. Insulin will
bring a diabetic to normal without the faintest need of a knife, but
appendicitis needs an operation. You can’t help that. When other courses
have failed, what is left but, as you put it, the last refuge? It’s your
fault that we’re driven to it.”</p>
<p>“I? Oh, yes, again my policy of appeasement. You still seem to lack
grasp of the fundamental necessities of our position. Our problem wasn’t
over with the departure of the Anacreonians. They had just begun. The
Four Kingdoms were more our enemies than ever, for each wanted nuclear
power—and each was kept off our throats only for fear of the other
three. We are balanced on the point of a very sharp sword, and the
slightest sway in any direction—if, for instance, one kingdom becomes
too strong; or if two form a coalition—You understand?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. That was the time to begin all-out preparations for
war.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary. That was the time to begin all-out prevention of
war. I played them one against the other. I helped each in turn. I
offered them science, trade, education, scientific medicine. I made
Terminus of more value to them as a flourishing world than as a military
prize. It worked for thirty years.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you were forced to surround these scientific gifts with the
most outrageous mummery. You’ve made half religion, half balderdash out
of it. You’ve erected a hierarchy of priests and complicated,
meaningless ritual.”</p>
<p>Hardin frowned. “What of that? I don’t see that it has anything to do
with the argument at all. I started that way at first because the
barbarians looked upon our science as a sort of magical sorcery, and it
was easiest to get them to accept it on that basis. The priesthood built
itself and if we help it along we are only following the line of least
resistance. It is a minor matter.”</p>
<p>“But these priests are in charge of the power plants. That is not a
minor matter.”</p>
<p>“True, but we have trained them. Their knowledge of their tools is
purely empirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that
surrounds them.”</p>
<p>“And if one pierces through the mummery, and has the genius to brush
aside empiricism, what is to prevent him from learning actual
techniques, and selling out to the most satisfactory bidder? What price
our value to the kingdoms, then?”</p>
<p>“Little chance of that, Sermak. You are being superficial. The best
men on the planets of the kingdoms are sent here to the Foundation each
year and educated into the priesthood. And the best of these remain here
as research students. If you think that those who are left, with
practically no knowledge of the elements of science, or worse still,
with the distorted knowledge the priests receive, can penetrate at a
bound to nuclear power, to electronics, to the theory of the
hyperwarp—you have a very romantic and very foolish idea of science. It
takes lifetimes of training and an excellent brain to get that far.”</p>
<p>Yohan Lee had risen abruptly during the foregoing speech and left the
room. He had returned now and when Hardin finished speaking, he bent to
his superior’s ear. A whisper was exchanged and then a leaden cylinder.
Then, with one short hostile look at the deputation, Lee resumed his
chair.</p>
<p>Hardin turned the cylinder end for end in his hands, watching the
deputation through his lashes. And then he opened it with a hard, sudden
twist and only Sermak had the sense not to throw a rapid look at the
rolled paper that fell out.</p>
<p>“In short, gentlemen,” he said, “the Government is of the opinion
that it knows what it is doing.”</p>
<p>He read as he spoke. There were the lines of intricate, meaningless
code that covered the page and the three penciled words scrawled in one
corner that carried the message. He took it in at a glance and tossed it
casually into the incinerator shaft.</p>
<p>“That,” Hardin then said, “ends the interview, I’m afraid. Glad to
have met you all. Thank you for coming.” He shook hands with each in
perfunctory fashion, and they filed out.</p>
<p>Hardin had almost gotten out of the habit of laughing, but after
Sermak and his three silent partners were well out of earshot, he
indulged in a dry chuckle and bent an amused look on Lee.</p>
<p>“How did you like that battle of bluffs, Lee?”</p>
<p>Lee snorted grumpily. “I’m not sure that he was bluffing. Treat him
with kid gloves and he’s quite liable to win the next election, just as
he says.”</p>
<p>“Oh, quite likely, quite likely—if nothing happens first.”</p>
<p>“Make sure they don’t happen in the wrong direction this time,
Hardin. I tell you this Sermak has a following. What if he doesn’t wait
till the next election? There was a time when you and I put things
through violently, in spite of your slogan about what violence is.”</p>
<p>Hardin cocked an eyebrow. “You are pessimistic today, Lee. And
singularly contrary, too, or you wouldn’t speak of violence. Our own
little putsch was carried through without loss of life, you remember. It
was a necessary measure put through at the proper moment, and went over
smoothly, painlessly, and all but effortlessly. As for Sermak, he’s up
against a different proposition. You and I, Lee, aren’t the
Encyclopedists. We stand prepared. Order your men onto these youngsters
in a nice way, old fellow. Don’t let them know they’re being watched—but
eyes open, you understand.”</p>
<p>Lee laughed in sour amusement. “I’d be a fine one to wait for your
orders, wouldn’t I, Hardin? Sermak and his men have been under
surveillance for a month now.”</p>
<p>The mayor chuckled. “Got in first, did you? All right. By the way,”
he observed, and added softly, “Ambassador Verisof is returning to
Terminus. Temporarily, I hope.”</p>
<p>There was a short silence, faintly horrified, and then Lee said, “Was
that the message? Are things breaking already?”</p>
<p>“Don’t know. I can’t tell till I hear what Verisof has to say. They
may be, though. After all, they have to before election. But what are
you looking so dead about?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t know how it’s going to turn out. You’re too deep,
Hardin, and you’re playing the game too close to your chest.”</p>
<p>“Even you?” murmured Hardin. And aloud, “Does that mean you’re going
to join Sermak’s new party?”</p>
<p>Lee smiled against his will. “All right. You win. How about lunch
now?”</p>
