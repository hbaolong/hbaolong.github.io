<h4 id="section">63</h4>
<p>Tisalver said, “You’ll need proper clothing.” Mistress Tisalver
sniffed markedly in the background.</p>
<p>Cautiously, Seldon, thinking of kirtles with vague distress, said,
“What do you mean by proper clothing?”</p>
<p>“Something light, such as I wear. A T-shirt, very short sleeves,
loose slacks, loose underpants, foot socks, open sandals. I have it all
for you.”</p>
<p>“Good. It doesn’t sound bad.”</p>
<p>“As for Mistress Venabili, I have the same. I hope it fits.”</p>
<p>The clothes Tisalver supplied each of them (which were his own) fit
fine—if a bit snugly. When they were ready, they bade Mistress Tisalver
good-bye and she, with a resigned if still disapproving air, watched
them from the doorway as they set off.</p>
<p>It was early evening and there was an attractive twilight glow above.
It was clear that Dahl’s lights would soon be winking on. The
temperature was mild and there were virtually no vehicles to be seen;
everyone was walking. In the distance was the everpresent hum of an
Expressway and the occasional glitter of its lights could be easily
seen.</p>
<p>The Dahlites, Seldon noted, did not seem to be walking toward any
particular destination. Rather, there seemed to be a promenade going on,
a walking for pleasure. Perhaps, if Dahl was an impoverished sector, as
Tisalver had implied, inexpensive entertainment was at a premium and
what was as pleasant—and as inexpensive—as an evening stroll?</p>
<p>Seldon felt himself easing automatically into the gait of an aimless
stroll himself and felt the warmth of friendliness all around him.
People greeted each other as they passed and exchanged a few words.
Black mustaches of different shape and thickness flashed everywhere and
seemed a requisite for the Dahlite male, as ubiquitous as the bald heads
of the Mycogenian Brothers.</p>
<p>It was an evening rite, a way of making sure that another day had
passed safely and that one’s friends were still well and happy. And, it
soon became apparent, Dors caught every eye. In the twilight glow, the
ruddiness of her hair had deepened, but it stood out against the sea of
black-haired heads (except for the occasional gray) like a gold coin
winking its way across a pile of coal.</p>
<p>“This is very pleasant,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“It is,” said Tisalver. “Ordinarily, I’d be walking with my wife and
she’d be in her element. There is no one for a kilometer around whom she
doesn’t know by name, occupation, and interrelationships. I can’t do
that. Right now, half the people who greet me … I couldn’t tell you
their names. But, in any case, we mustn’t creep along too slowly. We
must get to the elevator. It’s a busy world on the lower levels.”</p>
<p>They were on the elevator going down when Dors said, “I presume,
Master Tisalver, that the heatsinks are places where the internal heat
of Trantor is being used to produce steam that will turn turbines and
produce electricity.”</p>
<p>“Oh no. Highly efficient large-scale thermopiles produce electricity
directly. Don’t ask me the details, please. I’m just a holovision
programmer. In fact, don’t ask anyone the details down there. The whole
thing is one big black box. It works, but no one knows how.”</p>
<p>“What if something goes wrong?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t usually, but if it does, some expert comes over from
somewhere. Someone who understands computers. The whole thing is highly
computerized, of course.”</p>
<p>The elevator came to a halt and they stepped out. A blast of heat
struck them.</p>
<p>“It’s hot,” said Seldon quite unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is,” said Tisalver. “That’s what makes Dahl so valuable as
an energy source. The magma layer is nearer the surface here than it is
anywhere else in the world. So you have to work in the heat.”</p>
<p>“How about air-conditioning?” said Dors.</p>
<p>“There is air-conditioning, but it’s a matter of expense. We
ventilate and dehumidify and cool, but if we go too far, then we’re
using up too much energy and the whole process becomes too
expensive.”</p>
<p>Tisalver stopped at a door at which he signaled. It opened to a blast
of cooler air and he muttered, “We ought to be able to get someone to
help show us around and he’ll control the remarks that Mistress Venabili
will otherwise be the victim of … at least from the men.”</p>
<p>“Remarks won’t embarrass me,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“They will embarrass me,” said Tisalver.</p>
<p>A young man walked out of the office and introduced himself as Hano
Lindor. He resembled Tisalver quite closely, but Seldon decided that
until he got used to the almost universal shortness, swarthiness, black
hair, and luxuriant mustaches, he would not be able to see individual
differences easily.</p>
<p>Lindor said, “I’ll be glad to show you around for what there is to
see. It’s not one of your spectaculars, you know.” He addressed them
all, but his eyes were fixed on Dors. He said, “It’s not going to be
comfortable. I suggest we remove our shirts.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice and cool in here,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Of course, but that’s because we’re executives. Rank has its
privileges. Out there we can’t maintain air-conditioning at this level.
That’s why they get paid more than I do. In fact, those are the
best-paying jobs in Dahl, which is the only reason we get people to work
down here. Even so, it’s getting harder to get heatsinkers all the
time.” He took a deep breath. “Okay, out into the soup.”</p>
<p>He removed his own shirt and tucked it into his waistband. Tisalver
did the same and Seldon followed suit.</p>
<p>Lindor glanced at Dors and said, “For your own comfort, Mistress, but
it’s not compulsory.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Dors and removed her shirt.</p>
<p>Her brassiere was white, unpadded, and showed considerable
cleavage.</p>
<p>“Mistress,” said Lindor, “that’s not—” He thought a moment, then
shrugged and said, “All right. We’ll get by.”</p>
<p>At first, Seldon was aware only of computers and machinery, huge
pipes, flickering lights, and flashing screens.</p>
<p>The overall light was comparatively dim, though individual sections
of machinery were illuminated. Seldon looked up into the
almost-darkness. He said, “Why isn’t it better lit?”</p>
<p>“It’s lit well enough … where it should be,” said Lindor. His voice
was well modulated and he spoke quickly, but a little harshly. “Overall
illumination is kept low for psychological reasons. Too bright is
translated, in the mind, into heat. Complaints go up when we turn up the
lights, even when the temperature is made to go down.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “It seems to be well computerized. I should think the
operations could be turned over to computers altogether. This sort of
environment is made for artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>“Perfectly right,” said Lindor, “but neither can we take a chance on
any failures. We need people on the spot if anything goes wrong. A
misfunctioning computer can raise problems up to two thousand kilometers
away.”</p>
<p>“So can human error. Isn’t that so?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, but with both people and computers on the job, computer
error can be more quickly tracked down and corrected by people and,
conversely, human error can be more quickly corrected by computers. What
it amounts to is that nothing serious can happen unless human error and
computer error take place simultaneously. And that hardly ever
happens.”</p>
<p>“Hardly ever, but not never, eh?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Almost never, but not never. Computers aren’t what they used to be
and neither are people.”</p>
<p>“That’s the way it always seems,” said Seldon, laughing slightly.</p>
<p>“No no. I’m not talking memory. I’m not talking good old days. I’m
talking statistics.”</p>
<p>At this, Seldon recalled Hummin talking of the degeneration of the
times.</p>
<p>“See what I mean?” said Lindor, his voice dropping. “There’s a bunch
of people, at the C-3 level from the looks of them, drinking. Not one of
them is at his or her post.”</p>
<p>“What are they drinking?” asked Dors.</p>
<p>“Special fluids for replacing electrolyte loss. Fruit juice.”</p>
<p>“You can’t blame them, can you?” said Dors indignantly. “In this dry
heat, you would have to drink.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how long a skilled C-3 can spin out a drink? And there’s
nothing to be done about it either. If we give them five-minute breaks
for drinks and stagger them so they don’t all congregate in a group, you
simply stir up a rebellion.”</p>
<p>They were approaching the group now. There were men and women (Dahl
seemed to be a more or less amphisexual society) and both sexes were
shirtless. The women wore devices that might be called brassieres, but
they were strictly functional. They served to lift the breasts in order
to improve ventilation and limit perspiration, but covered nothing.</p>
<p>Dors said in an aside to Seldon, “That makes sense, Hari. I’m soaking
wet there.”</p>
<p>“Take off your brassiere, then,” said Seldon. “I won’t lift a finger
to stop you.”</p>
<p>“Somehow,” said Dors, “I guessed you wouldn’t.” She left her
brassiere where it was.</p>
<p>They were approaching the congregation of people—about a dozen of
them.</p>
<p>Dors said, “If any of them make rude remarks, I shall survive.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Lindor. “I cannot promise they won’t. —But I’ll
have to introduce you. If they get the idea that you two are inspectors
and in my company, they’ll become unruly. Inspectors are supposed to
poke around on their own without anyone from management overseeing
them.”</p>
<p>He held up his arms. “Heatsinkers, I have two introductions to make.
We have visitors from outside—two Outworlders, two scholars. They’ve got
worlds running short on energy and they’ve come here to see how we do it
here in Dahl. They think they may learn something.”</p>
<p>“They’ll learn how to sweat!” shouted a heatsinker and there was
raucous laughter.</p>
<p>“She’s got a sweaty chest right now,” shouted a woman, “covering up
like that.”</p>
<p>Dors shouted back, “I’d take it off, but mine can’t compete with
yours.” The laughter turned good-natured.</p>
<p>But one young man stepped forward, staring at Seldon with intense
deep-set eyes, his face set into a humorless mask. He said, “I know you.
You’re the mathematician.”</p>
<p>He ran forward, inspecting Seldon’s face with eager solemnity.
Automatically, Dors stepped in front of Seldon and Lindor stepped in
front of her, shouting, “Back, heatsinker. Mind your manners.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Wait! Let him talk to me. Why is everyone piling in
front of me?”</p>
<p>Lindor said in a low voice, “If any of them get close, you’ll find
they don’t smell like hothouse flowers.”</p>
<p>“I’ll endure it,” said Seldon brusquely. “Young man, what is it you
want?”</p>
<p>“My name is Amaryl. Yugo Amaryl. I’ve seen you on holovision.”</p>
<p>“You might have, but what about it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember your name.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“You talked about something called psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know how I wish I hadn’t.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. What is it you want?”</p>
<p>“I want to talk to you. Just for a little while. Now.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked at Lindor, who shook his head firmly. “Not while he’s
on his shift.”</p>
<p>“When does your shift begin, Mr. Amaryl?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>“Sixteen hundred.”</p>
<p>“Can you see me tomorrow at fourteen hundred?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Where?”</p>
<p>Seldon turned to Tisalver. “Would you permit me to see him in your
place?”</p>
<p>Tisalver looked very unhappy. “It’s not necessary. He’s just a
heatsinker.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “He recognized my face. He knows something about me. He
can’t be just an anything. I’ll see him in my room.” And then, as
Tisalver’s face didn’t soften, he added, “My room, for which rent is
being paid. And you’ll be at work, out of the apartment.”</p>
<p>Tisalver said in a low voice, “It’s not me, Master Seldon. It’s my
wife, Casilia. She won’t stand for it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll talk to her,” said Seldon grimly. “She’ll have to.”</p>
