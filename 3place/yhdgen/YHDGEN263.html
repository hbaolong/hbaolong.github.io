<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>The weather was holding up over the undomed area of the Imperial
Palace grounds—warm and sunny.</p>
<p>It didn’t often happen. Hari remembered Dors telling him once how
this particular area with its cold winters and frequent rains had been
chosen as the site.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t actually chosen,” she said. “It was a family estate of the
Morovian family in the early days of the Kingdom of Trantor. When the
Kingdom became an Empire, there were numerous sites where the Emperor
could live—summer resorts, winter places, sports lodges, beach
properties. And, as the planet was slowly domed, one reigning Emperor,
living here, liked it so much that it remained undomed. And, just
because it was the only area left undomed, it became special—a place
apart—and that uniqueness appealed to the next Emperor … and the next …
and the next.… And so, a tradition was born.”</p>
<p>And as always, when hearing something like that, Seldon would think:
And how would psychohistory handle this? Would it predict that one area
would remain undomed but be absolutely unable to say which area? Could
it go even so far? Could it predict that several areas would remain
undomed or none—and be wrong? How could it account for the personal
likes and dislikes of an Emperor who happened to be on the throne at the
crucial time and who made a decision in a moment of whimsy and nothing
more. That way lay chaos—and madness.</p>
<p>Cleon I was clearly enjoying the good weather.</p>
<p>“I’m getting old, Seldon,” he said. “I don’t have to tell you that.
We’re the same age, you and I. Surely it’s a sign of age when I don’t
have the impulse to play tennis or go fishing, even though they’ve newly
restocked the lake, but am willing to walk gently over the
pathways.”</p>
<p>He was eating nuts as he spoke, which resembled what on Seldon’s
native world of Helicon would have been called pumpkin seeds, but which
were larger and a little less delicate in taste. Cleon cracked them
gently between his teeth, peeled the thin shells and popped the kernels
into his mouth.</p>
<p>Seldon did not like the taste particularly but, of course, when he
was offered some by the Emperor, he accepted them and ate a few.</p>
<p>The Emperor had a number of shells in his hand and looked vaguely
around for a receptacle of some sort that he could use for disposal. He
saw none, but he did notice a gardener standing not far away, his body
at attention (as it should be in the Imperial presence) and his head
respectfully bowed.</p>
<p>Cleon said, “Gardener!”</p>
<p>The gardener approached quickly. “Sire!”</p>
<p>“Get rid of these for me,” he said, tapping the shells into the
gardener’s hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I have a few, too, Gruber.”</p>
<p>Gruber held out his hand and said, almost shyly, “Yes, First
Minister.”</p>
<p>He hurried away and the Emperor looked after him curiously. “Do you
know the fellow, Seldon?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, Sire. An old friend.”</p>
<p>“The gardener is an old friend? What is he? A mathematical colleague
fallen on hard times?”</p>
<p>“No, Sire. Perhaps you remember the story. It was the time when”—he
cleared his throat, searching for the most tactful way to recall the
incident—“the sergeant threatened my life shortly after I was appointed
to my present post through your kindness.”</p>
<p>“The assassination attempt.” Cleon looked up to heaven, as though
seeking patience. “I don’t know why everyone is so afraid of that
word.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Seldon smoothly, slightly despising himself for the
ease with which he had become able to flatter, “the rest of us are more
perturbed at the possibility of something untoward happening to our
Emperor than you yourself are.”</p>
<p>Cleon smiled ironically. “I dare say. And what has this to do with
Gruber? Is that his name?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire. Mandell Gruber. I’m sure you will recall, if you cast
your mind back, that there was a gardener who came rushing up with a
rake to defend me against the armed sergeant.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. Was that fellow the gardener who did that?”</p>
<p>“He was the man, Sire. I’ve considered him a friend ever since and I
meet him almost every time I am on the grounds. I think he watches for
me, feels proprietary toward me. And, of course, I feel kindly toward
him.”</p>
<p>“I don’t blame you. —And while we’re on the subject, how is your
formidable lady, Dr. Venabili? I don’t see her often.”</p>
<p>“She’s a historian, Sire. Lost in the past.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t frighten you? She’d frighten me. I’ve been told how she
treated that sergeant. One could almost be sorry for him.”</p>
<p>“She grows savage on my behalf, Sire, but has not had occasion to do
so lately. It’s been very quiet.”</p>
<p>The Emperor looked after the disappearing gardener. “Have we ever
rewarded that man?”</p>
<p>“I have done so, Sire. He has a wife and two daughters and I have
arranged that each daughter will have a sum of money put aside for the
education of any children she may have.”</p>
<p>“Very good. But he needs a promotion, I think. —Is he a good
gardener?”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Sire.”</p>
<p>“The Chief Gardener, Malcomber—I’m not quite sure I remember his
name—is getting on and is, perhaps, not up to the job anymore. He is
well into his late seventies. Do you think this Gruber might be able to
take over?”</p>
<p>“I’m certain he can, Sire, but he likes his present job. It keeps him
out in the open in all kinds of weather.”</p>
<p>“A peculiar recommendation for a job. I’m sure he can get used to
administration and I do need someone for some sort of renewal of the
grounds. Hmmm. I must think upon this. Your friend Gruber may be just
the man I need. —By the way, Seldon, what did you mean by saying it’s
been very quiet?”</p>
<p>“I merely meant, Sire, that there has been no sign of discord at the
Imperial Court. The unavoidable tendency to intrigue seems to be as near
a minimum as it is ever likely to get.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t say that if you were Emperor, Seldon, and had to
contend with all these officials and their complaints. How can you tell
me things are quiet when reports seem to reach me every other week of
some serious breakdown here and there on Trantor?”</p>
<p>“These things are bound to happen.”</p>
<p>“I don’t recall such things happening so frequently in previous
years.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that was because they didn’t, Sire. The infrastructure grows
older with time. To make the necessary repairs properly would take time,
labor, and enormous expense. This is not a time when a rise in taxes
will be looked on favorably.”</p>
<p>“There’s never any such time. I gather that the people are
experiencing serious dissatisfaction over these breakdowns. It must stop
and you must see to it, Seldon. What does psychohistory say?”</p>
<p>“It says what common sense says, that everything is growing
older.”</p>
<p>“Well, all this is quite spoiling the pleasant day for me. I leave it
in your hands, Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire,” said Seldon quietly.</p>
<p>The Emperor strode off and Seldon thought that it was all spoiling
the pleasant day for him, too. This breakdown at the center was the
alternative he didn’t want. But how was he to prevent it and switch the
crisis to the Periphery?</p>
<p>Psychohistory didn’t say.</p>
