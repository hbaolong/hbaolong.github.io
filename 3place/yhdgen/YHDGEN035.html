<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>Korell is that frequent phenomenon in history: the republic whose
ruler has every attribute of the absolute monarch but the name. It
therefore enjoyed the usual despotism unrestrained even by those two
moderating influences in the legitimate monarchies: regal “honor” and
court etiquette.</p>
<p>Materially, its prosperity was low. The day of the Galactic Empire
had departed, with nothing but silent memorials and broken structures to
testify to it. The day of the Foundation had not yet come—and in the
fierce determination of its ruler, the Commdor Asper Argo, with his
strict regulation of the traders and his stricter prohibition of the
missionaries, it was never coming.</p>
<p>The spaceport itself was decrepit and decayed, and the crew of the
Far Star were drearily aware of that. The moldering hangars made for a
moldering atmosphere and Jaim Twer itched and fretted over a game of
solitaire.</p>
<p>Hober Mallow said thoughtfully, “Good trading material here.” He was
staring quietly out the viewport. So far, there was little else to be
said about Korell. The trip here was uneventful. The squadron of
Korellian ships that had shot out to intercept the Far Star had been
tiny, limping relics of ancient glory or battered, clumsy hulks. They
had maintained their distance fearfully, and still maintained it, and
for a week now, Mallow’s requests for an audience with the local
government had been unanswered.</p>
<p>Mallow repeated, “Good trading here. You might call this virgin
territory.”</p>
<p>Jaim Twer looked up impatiently, and threw his cards aside. “What the
devil do you intend doing, Mallow? The crew’s grumbling, the officers
are worried, and I’m wondering—”</p>
<p>“Wondering? About what?”</p>
<p>“About the situation. And about you. What are we doing?”</p>
<p>“Waiting.”</p>
<p>The old trader snorted and grew red. He growled, “You’re going it
blind, Mallow. There’s a guard around the field and there are ships
overhead. Suppose they’re getting ready to blow us into a hole in the
ground.”</p>
<p>“They’ve had a week.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re waiting for reinforcements.” Twer’s eyes were sharp
and hard.</p>
<p>Mallow sat down abruptly. “Yes, I’d thought of that. You see, it
poses a pretty problem. First, we got here without trouble. That may
mean nothing, however, for only three ships out of better than three
hundred went a-glimmer last year. The percentage is low. But that may
mean also that the number of their ships equipped with nuclear power is
small, and that they dare not expose them needlessly, until that number
grows.</p>
<p>“But it could mean, on the other hand, that they haven’t nuclear
power after all. Or maybe they have and are keeping undercover, for fear
we know something. It’s one thing, after all, to piratize blundering,
light-armed merchant ships. It’s another to fool around with an
accredited envoy of the Foundation when the mere fact of his presence
may mean the Foundation is growing suspicious.</p>
<p>“Combine this—”</p>
<p>“Hold on, Mallow, hold on.” Twer raised his hands. “You’re just about
drowning me with talk. What’re you getting at? Never mind the
in-betweens.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to have the in-betweens, or you won’t understand, Twer.
We’re both waiting. They don’t know what I’m doing here and I don’t know
what they’ve got here. But I’m in the weaker position because I’m one
and they’re an entire world—maybe with atomic power. I can’t afford to
be the one to weaken. Sure it’s dangerous. Sure there may be a hole in
the ground waiting for us. But we knew that from the start. What else is
there to do?”</p>
<p>“I don’t—Who’s that, now?”</p>
<p>Mallow looked up patiently, and tuned the receiver. The visiplate
glowed into the craggy face of the watch sergeant.</p>
<p>“Speak, sergeant.”</p>
<p>The sergeant said, “Pardon, sir. The men have given entry to a
Foundation missionary.”</p>
<p>“A what?” Mallow’s face grew livid.</p>
<p>“A missionary, sir. He’s in need of hospitalization, sir—”</p>
<p>“There’ll be more than one in need of that, sergeant, for this piece
of work. Order the men to battle stations.”</p>
<p>Crew’s lounge was almost empty. Five minutes after the order, even
the men on the off-shift were at their guns. It was speed that was the
great virtue in the anarchic regions of the interstellar space of the
Periphery, and it was in speed above all that the crew of a master
trader excelled.</p>
<p>Mallow entered slowly, and stared the missionary up and down and
around. His eye slid to Lieutenant Tinter, who shifted uneasily to one
side and to Watch-Sergeant Demen, whose blank face and stolid figure
flanked the other.</p>
<p>The Master Trader turned to Twer and paused thoughtfully. “Well,
then, Twer, get the officers here quietly, except for the co-ordinators
and the trajectorian. The men are to remain at stations till further
orders.”</p>
<p>There was a five-minute hiatus, in which Mallow kicked open the doors
to the lavatories, looked behind the bar, pulled the draperies across
the thick windows. For half a minute he left the room altogether, and
when he returned he was humming abstractedly.</p>
<p>Men filed in. Twer followed, and closed the door silently.</p>
<p>Mallow said quietly, “First, who let this man in without orders from
me?”</p>
<p>The watch sergeant stepped forward. Every eye shifted. “Pardon, sir.
It was no definite person. It was a sort of mutual agreement. He was one
of us, you might say, and these foreigners here—”</p>
<p>Mallow cut him short. “I sympathize with your feelings, sergeant, and
understand them. These men, were they under your command?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“When this is over, they’re to be confined to individual quarters for
a week. You yourself are relieved of all supervisory duties for a
similar period. Understood?”</p>
<p>The sergeant’s face never changed, but there was the slightest droop
to his shoulders. He said, crisply, “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“You may leave. Get to your gun-station.”</p>
<p>The door closed behind him and the babble rose.</p>
<p>Twer broke in. “Why the punishment, Mallow? You know that these
Korellians kill captured missionaries.”</p>
<p>“An action against my orders is bad in itself whatever other reasons
there may be in its favor. No one was to leave or enter the ship without
permission.”</p>
<p>Lieutenant Tinter murmured rebelliously, “Seven days without action.
You can’t maintain discipline that way.”</p>
<p>Mallow said icily, “I can. There’s no merit in discipline under ideal
circumstances. I’ll have it in the face of death, or it’s useless.
Where’s this missionary? Get him here in front of me.”</p>
<p>The trader sat down, while the scarlet-cloaked figure was carefully
brought forward.</p>
<p>“What’s your name, reverend?”</p>
<p>“Eh?” The scarlet-robed figure wheeled towards Mallow, the whole body
turning as a unit. His eyes were blankly open and there was a bruise on
one temple. He had not spoken, nor, as far as Mallow could tell, moved
during all the previous interval.</p>
<p>“Your name, revered one?”</p>
<p>The missionary started to sudden feverish life. His arms went out in
an embracing gesture. “My son—my children. May you always be in the
protecting arms of the Galactic Spirit.”</p>
<p>Twer stepped forward, eyes troubled, voice husky, “The man’s sick.
Take him to bed, somebody. Order him to bed, Mallow, and have him seen
to. He’s badly hurt.”</p>
<p>Mallow’s great arm shoved him back. “Don’t interfere, Twer, or I’ll
have you out of the room. Your name, revered one?”</p>
<p>The missionary’s hands clasped in sudden supplication, “As you are
enlightened men, save me from the heathen.” The words tumbled out. “Save
me from these brutes and darkened ones who raven after me and would
afflict the Galactic Spirit with their crimes. I am Jord Parma, of the
Anacreonian worlds. Educated at the Foundation; the Foundation itself,
my children. I am a Priest of the Spirit educated into all the
mysteries, who have come here where the inner voice called me.” He was
gasping. “I have suffered at the hands of the unenlightened. As you are
Children of the Spirit; and in the name of that Spirit, protect me from
them.”</p>
<p>A voice broke in upon them, as the emergency alarm box clamored
metallically:</p>
<p>“Enemy units in sight! Instruction desired!”</p>
<p>Every eye shot mechanically upward to the speaker.</p>
<p>Mallow swore violently. He clicked open the reverse and yelled,
“Maintain vigil! That is all!” and turned it off.</p>
<p>He made his way to the thick drapes that rustled aside at a touch and
stared grimly out.</p>
<p>Enemy units! Several thousands of them in the persons of the
individual members of a Korellian mob. The rolling rabble encompassed
the pod from extreme end to extreme end, and in the cold, hard light of
magnesium flares the foremost straggled closer.</p>
<p>“Tinter!” The trader never turned, but the back of his neck was red.
“Get the outer speaker working and find out what they want. Ask if they
have a representative of the law with them. Make no promises and no
threats, or I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>Tinter turned and left.</p>
<p>Mallow felt a rough hand on his shoulder and he struck it aside. It
was Twer. His voice was an angry hiss in his ear. “Mallow, you’re bound
to hold onto this man. There’s no way of maintaining decency and honor
otherwise. He’s of the Foundation and, after all, he—is a priest. These
savages outside—Do you hear me?”</p>
<p>“I hear you, Twer.” Mallow’s voice was incisive. “I’ve got more to do
here than guard missionaries. I’ll do, sir, what I please, and, by
Seldon and all the Galaxy, if you try to stop me, I’ll tear out your
stinking windpipe. Don’t get in my way, Twer, or it will be the last of
you.”</p>
<p>He turned and strode past. “You! Revered Parma! Did you know that, by
convention, no Foundation missionaries may enter the Korellian
territory?”</p>
<p>The missionary was trembling. “I can but go where the Spirit leads,
my son. If the darkened ones refuse enlightenment, is it not the greater
sign of their need for it?”</p>
<p>“That’s outside the question, revered one. You are here against the
law of both Korell and the Foundation. I cannot in law protect you.”</p>
<p>The missionary’s hands were raised again. His earlier bewilderment
was gone. There was the raucous clamor of the ship’s outer communication
system in action, and the faint, undulating gabble of the angry horde in
response. The sound made his eyes wild.</p>
<p>“You hear them? Why do you talk of law to me, of a law made by men?
There are higher laws. Was it not the Galactic Spirit that said: Thou
shalt not stand idly by to the hurt of thy fellowman. And has he not
said: Even as thou dealest with the humble and defenseless, thus shalt
thou be dealt with.</p>
<p>“Have you not guns? Have you not a ship? And behind you is there not
the Foundation? And above and all about you is there not the Spirit that
rules the universe?” He paused for breath.</p>
<p>And then the great outer voice of the Far Star ceased and Lieutenant
Tinter was back, troubled.</p>
<p>“Speak!” said Mallow, shortly.</p>
<p>“Sir, they demand the person of Jord Parma.”</p>
<p>“If not?”</p>
<p>“There are various threats, sir. It is difficult to make much out.
There are so many—and they seem quite mad. There is someone who says he
governs the district and has police powers, but he is quite evidently
not his own master.”</p>
<p>“Master or not,” shrugged Mallow, “he is the law. Tell them that if
this governor, or policeman, or whatever he is, approaches the ship
alone, he can have the Revered Jord Parma.”</p>
<p>And there was suddenly a gun in his hand. He added, “I don’t know
what insubordination is. I have never had any experience with it. But if
there’s anyone here who thinks he can teach me, I’d like to teach him my
antidote in return.”</p>
<p>The gun swiveled slowly, and rested on Twer. With an effort, the old
trader’s face untwisted and his hands unclenched and lowered. His breath
was a harsh rasp in his nostrils.</p>
<p>Tinter left, and in five minutes a puny figure detached itself from
the crowd. It approached slowly and hesitantly, plainly drenched in fear
and apprehension. Twice it turned back, and twice the patently obvious
threats of the many-headed monster urged him on.</p>
<p>“All right.” Mallow gestured with the hand-blaster, which remained
unsheathed. “Grun and Upshur, take him out.”</p>
<p>The missionary screeched. He raised his arms and rigid fingers
speared upward as the voluminous sleeves fell away to reveal the thin,
veined arms. There was a momentary, tiny flash of light that came and
went in a breath. Mallow blinked and gestured again, contemptuously.</p>
<p>The missionary’s voice poured out as he struggled in the two-fold
grasp. “Cursed be the traitor who abandons his fellowman to evil and to
death. Deafened be the ears that are deaf to the pleadings of the
helpless. Blind be the eyes that are blind to innocence. Blackened
forever be the soul that consorts with blackness—”</p>
<p>Twer clamped his hands tightly over his ears.</p>
<p>Mallow flipped his blaster and put it away. “Disperse,” he said,
evenly, “to respective stations. Maintain full vigil for six hours after
dispersion of crowd. Double stations for forty-eight hours thereafter.
Further instructions at that time. Twer, come with me.”</p>
<p>They were alone in Mallow’s private quarters. Mallow indicated a
chair and Twer sat down. His stocky figure looked shrunken.</p>
<p>Mallow stared him down, sardonically. “Twer,” he said, “I’m
disappointed. Your three years in politics seem to have gotten you out
of trader habits. Remember, I may be a democrat back at the Foundation,
but there’s nothing short of tyranny that can run my ship the way I want
it run. I never had to pull a blaster on my men before, and I wouldn’t
have had to now, if you hadn’t gone out of line.</p>
<p>“Twer, you have no official position, but you’re here on my
invitation, and I’ll extend you every courtesy—in private. However, from
now on, in the presence of my officers or men, I’m ‘sir,’ and not
‘Mallow.’ And when I give an order, you’ll jump faster than a
third-class recruit just for luck, or I’ll have you handcuffed in the
sub-level even faster. Understand?”</p>
<p>The party-leader swallowed dryly. He said, reluctantly, “My
apologies.”</p>
<p>“Accepted! Will you shake?”</p>
<p>Twer’s limp fingers were swallowed in Mallow’s huge palm. Twer said,
“My motives were good. It’s difficult to send a man out to be lynched.
That wobbly-kneed governor or whatever-he-was can’t save him. It’s
murder.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help that. Frankly, the incident smelled too bad. Didn’t you
notice?”</p>
<p>“Notice what?”</p>
<p>“This spaceport is deep in the middle of a sleepy far section.
Suddenly a missionary escapes. Where from? He comes here. Coincidence? A
huge crowd gathers. From where? The nearest city of any size must be at
least a hundred miles away. But they arrive in half an hour. How?”</p>
<p>“How?” echoed Twer.</p>
<p>“Well, what if the missionary were brought here and released as bait.
Our friend, Revered Parma, was considerably confused. He seemed at no
time to be in complete possession of his wits.”</p>
<p>“Hard usage—” murmured Twer bitterly.</p>
<p>“Maybe! And maybe the idea was to have us go all chivalrous and
gallant, into a stupid defense of the man. He was here against the laws
of Korell and the Foundation. If I withhold him, it is an act of war
against Korell, and the Foundation would have no legal right to defend
us.”</p>
<p>“That—that’s pretty far-fetched.”</p>
<p>The speaker blared and forestalled Mallow’s answer: “Sir, official
communication received.”</p>
<p>“Submit immediately!”</p>
<p>The gleaming cylinder arrived in its slot with a click. Mallow opened
it and shook out the silver-impregnated sheet it held. He rubbed it
appreciatively between thumb and finger and said, “Teleported direct
from the capital. Commdor’s own stationery.”</p>
<p>He read it in a glance and laughed shortly. “So my idea was
far-fetched, was it?”</p>
<p>He tossed it to Twer, and added, “Half an hour after we hand back the
missionary, we finally get a very polite invitation to the Commdor’s
august presence—after seven days of previous waiting. I think we passed
a test.”</p>
