<h4 id="section">13</h4>
<p>They were now racing rapidly through the tunnel once more. Seldon
decided to give voice to the question that had been nagging at him for
the last hour or so.</p>
<p>“Why do you say the Galactic Empire is dying?”</p>
<p>Hummin turned to look at Seldon again. “As a journalist, I have
statistics poured into me from all sides till they’re squeezing out of
my ears. And I’m allowed to publish very little of it. Trantor’s
population is decreasing. Twenty-five years ago, it stood at almost
forty-five billion.</p>
<p>“Partly, this decrease is because of a decline in the birthrate. To
be sure, Trantor never has had a high birthrate. If you’ll look about
you when you’re traveling on Trantor, you won’t encounter very many
children, considering the enormous population. But just the same it’s
declining. Then too there is emigration. People are leaving Trantor in
greater numbers than are arriving.”</p>
<p>“Considering its large population,” said Seldon, “that’s not
surprising.”</p>
<p>“But it’s unusual just the same because it hasn’t happened before.
Again, all over the Galaxy trade is stagnating. People think that
because there are no rebellions at the moment and because things are
quiet that all is well and that the difficulties of the past few
centuries are over. However, political infighting, rebellions, and
unrest are all signs of a certain vitality too. But now there’s a
general weariness. It’s quiet, not because people are satisfied and
prosperous, but because they’re tired and have given up.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Seldon dubiously.</p>
<p>“I do. And the antigrav phenomenon we’ve talked about is another case
in point. We have a few gravitic lifts in operation, but new ones aren’t
being constructed. It’s an unprofitable venture and there seems no
interest in trying to make it profitable. The rate of technological
advance has been slowing for centuries and is down to a crawl now. In
some cases, it has stopped altogether. Isn’t this something you’ve
noticed? After all, you’re a mathematician.”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I’ve given the matter any thought.”</p>
<p>“No one does. It’s accepted. Scientists are very good these days at
saying that things are impossible, impractical, useless. They condemn
any speculation at once. You, for instance—What do you think of
psychohistory? It is theoretically interesting, but it is useless in any
practical sense. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Yes and no,” said Seldon, annoyed. “It is useless in any practical
sense, but not because my sense of adventure has decayed, I assure you.
It really is useless.”</p>
<p>“That, at least,” said Hummin with a trace of sarcasm, “is your
impression in this atmosphere of decay in which all the Empire
lives.”</p>
<p>“This atmosphere of decay,” said Seldon angrily, “is your impression.
Is it possible that you are wrong?”</p>
<p>Hummin stopped and for a moment appeared thoughtful. Then he said,
“Yes, I might be wrong. I am speaking only from intuition, from guesses.
What I need is a working technique of psychohistory.”</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged and did not take the bait. He said, “I don’t have
such a technique to give you. —But suppose you’re right. Suppose the
Empire is running down and will eventually stop and fall apart. The
human species will still exist.”</p>
<p>“Under what conditions, man? For nearly twelve thousand years,
Trantor, under strong rulers, has largely kept the peace. There’ve been
interruptions to that—rebellions, localized civil wars, tragedy in
plenty—but, on the whole and over large areas, there has been peace. Why
is Helicon so pro-Imperium? Your world, I mean. Because it is small and
would be devoured by its neighbors were it not that the Empire keeps it
secure.”</p>
<p>“Are you predicting universal war and anarchy if the Empire
fails?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m not fond of the Emperor or of the Imperial
institutions in general, but I don’t have any substitute for it. I don’t
know what else will keep the peace and I’m not ready to let go until I
have something else in hand.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You talk as though you are in control of the Galaxy.
You are not ready to let go? You must have something else in hand? Who
are you to talk so?”</p>
<p>“I’m speaking generally, figuratively,” said Hummin. “I’m not worried
about Chetter Hummin personally. It might be said that the Empire will
last my time; it might even show signs of improvement in my time.
Declines don’t follow a straight-line path. It may be a thousand years
before the final crash and you might well imagine I would be dead then
and, certainly, I will leave no descendants. As far as women are
concerned, I have nothing but the occasional casual attachment and I
have no children and intend to have none. I have given no hostages to
fortune. —I looked you up after your talk, Seldon. You have no children
either.”</p>
<p>“I have parents and two brothers, but no children.” He smiled rather
weakly. “I was very attached to a woman at one time, but it seemed to
her that I was attached more to my mathematics.”</p>
<p>“Were you?”</p>
<p>“It didn’t seem so to me, but it seemed so to her. So she left.”</p>
<p>“And you have had no one since?”</p>
<p>“No. I remember the pain too clearly as yet.”</p>
<p>“Well then, it might seem we could both wait out the matter and leave
it to other people, well after our time, to suffer. I might have been
willing to accept that earlier, but no longer. For now I have a tool; I
am in command.”</p>
<p>“What’s your tool?” asked Seldon, already knowing the answer.</p>
<p>“You!” said Hummin.</p>
<p>And because Seldon had known what Hummin would say, he wasted no time
in being shocked or astonished. He simply shook his head and said, “You
are quite wrong. I am no tool fit for use.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. “How often must I repeat it? Psychohistory is not a
practical study. The difficulty is fundamental. All the space and time
of the Universe would not suffice to work out the necessary
problems.”</p>
<p>“Are you certain of that?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, yes.”</p>
<p>“There’s no question of your working out the entire future of the
Galactic Empire, you know. You needn’t trace out in detail the workings
of every human being or even of every world. There are merely certain
questions you must answer: Will the Galactic Empire crash and, if so,
when? What will be the condition of humanity afterward? Can anything be
done to prevent the crash or to ameliorate conditions afterward? These
are comparatively simple questions, it seems to me.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head and smiled sadly. “The history of mathematics
is full of simple questions that had only the most complicated of
answers—or none at all.”</p>
<p>“Is there nothing to be done? I can see that the Empire is falling,
but I can’t prove it. All my conclusions are subjective and I cannot
show that I am not mistaken. Because the view is a seriously unsettling
one, people would prefer not to believe my subjective conclusion and
nothing will be done to prevent the Fall or even to cushion it. You
could prove the coming Fall or, for that matter, disprove it.”</p>
<p>“But that is exactly what I cannot do. I can’t find you proof where
none exists. I can’t make a mathematical system practical when it isn’t.
I can’t find you two even numbers that will yield an odd number as a
sum, no matter how vitally you—or all the Galaxy—may need that odd
number.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Well then, you’re part of the decay. You’re ready to
accept failure.”</p>
<p>“What choice have I?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you try? However useless the effort may seem to you to be,
have you anything better to do with your life? Have you some worthier
goal? Have you a purpose that will justify you in your own eyes to some
greater extent?”</p>
<p>Seldon’s eyes blinked rapidly. “Millions of worlds. Billions of
cultures. Quadrillions of people. Decillions of interrelationships. —And
you want me to reduce it to order.”</p>
<p>“No, I want you to try. For the sake of those millions of worlds,
billions of cultures, and quadrillions of people. Not for the Emperor.
Not for Demerzel. For humanity.”</p>
<p>“I will fail,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Then we will be no worse off. Will you try?”</p>
<p>And against his will and not knowing why, Seldon heard himself say,
“I will try.” And the course of his life was set.</p>
