<h4 id="section">27</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon rose from his seat in horror. He had never seen Dors look
so, her face twisted, her body canted, staggering as though she were
drunk.</p>
<p>“Dors! What happened! What’s wrong!”</p>
<p>He ran to her and grasped her around the waist, even as her body gave
way and collapsed in his arms. He lifted her (she weighed more than an
ordinary woman her size would have, but Seldon was unaware of that at
the moment) and placed her on the couch.</p>
<p>“What happened?” he said.</p>
<p>She told him, gasping, her voice breaking now and then, while he
cradled her head and tried to force himself to believe what was
happening.</p>
<p>“Elar is dead,” she said. “I finally killed a human being. —First
time. —Makes it worse.”</p>
<p>“How badly are you damaged, Dors?”</p>
<p>“Badly. Elar turned on his device—full—when I rushed him.”</p>
<p>“You can be readjusted.”</p>
<p>“How? There’s no one—on Trantor—who knows how. I need Daneel.”</p>
<p>Daneel. Demerzel. Somehow, deep inside, Hari had always known. His
friend—a robot—had provided him with a protector—a robot—to ensure that
psychohistory and the seeds of the Foundations were given a chance to
take root. The only problem was, Hari had fallen in love with his
protector—a robot. It all made sense now. All the nagging doubts and the
questions could be answered. And somehow, it didn’t matter one bit. All
that mattered was Dors.</p>
<p>“We can’t let this happen.”</p>
<p>“It must.” Dors’s eyes fluttered open and looked at Seldon. “Must.
Tried to save you, but missed—vital point—who will protect you now?”</p>
<p>Seldon couldn’t see her clearly. There was something wrong with his
eyes. “Don’t worry about me, Dors. It’s you—It’s you—”</p>
<p>“No. You, Hari. Tell Manella—Manella—I forgive her now. She did
better than I. Explain to Wanda. You and Raych—take care of each
other.”</p>
<p>“No no no,” said Seldon, rocking back and forth. “You can’t do this.
Hang on, Dors. Please. Please, my love.”</p>
<p>Dors’s head shook feebly and she smiled even more feebly. “Good-bye,
Hari, my love. Remember always—all you did for me.”</p>
<p>“I did nothing for you.”</p>
<p>“You loved me and your love made me—human.”</p>
<p>Her eyes remained open, but Dors had ceased functioning.</p>
<p>Yugo Amaryl came storming into Seldon’s office. “Hari, the riots are
beginning, sooner and harder even than exp—”</p>
<p>And then he stared at Seldon and Dors and whispered, “What
happened?”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up at him in agony. “Riots! What do I care about riots
now? —What do I care about anything now?”</p>
<p>SELDON, WANDA— … In the waning years of Hari Seldon’s life, he grew
most attached to (some say dependent upon) his granddaughter, Wanda.
Orphaned in her teens, Wanda Seldon devoted herself to her grandfather’s
Psychohistory Project, filling the vacancy left by Yugo Amaryl.…</p>
<p>The content of Wanda Seldon’s work remains largely a mystery, for it
was conducted in virtually total isolation. The only individuals allowed
access to Wanda Seldon’s research were Hari himself and a young man
named Stettin Palver (whose descendant Preem would four hundred years
later contribute to the rebirth of Trantor, as the planet rose from the
ashes of the Great Sack [300 F.E.]).…</p>
<p>Although the full extent of Wanda Seldon’s contribution to the
Foundation is unknown, it was undoubtedly of the greatest
magnitude.…</p>
