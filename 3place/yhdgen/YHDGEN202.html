<h4 id="section">64</h4>
<p>Casilia Tisalver opened her eyes wide. “A heatsinker? Not in my
apartment.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Besides, he’ll be coming to my room,” said Seldon. “At
fourteen hundred.”</p>
<p>“I won’t have it,” said Mistress Tisalver. “This is what comes of
going down to the heatsinks. Jirad was a fool.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, Mistress Tisalver. We went at my request and I was
fascinated. I must see this young man, since that is necessary to my
scholarly work.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if it is, but I won’t have it.”</p>
<p>Dors Venabili raised her hand. “Hari, let me take care of this.
Mistress Tisalver, if Dr. Seldon must see someone in his room this
afternoon, the additional person naturally means additional rent. We
understand that. For today, then, the rent on Dr. Seldon’s room will be
doubled.”</p>
<p>Mistress Tisalver thought about it. “Well, that’s decent of you, but
it’s not only the credits. There’s the neighbors to think of. A sweaty,
smelly heatsinker—”</p>
<p>“I doubt that he’ll be sweaty and smelly at fourteen hundred,
Mistress Tisalver, but let me go on. Since Dr. Seldon must see him, then
if he can’t see him here, he’ll have to see him elsewhere, but we can’t
run here and there. That would be too inconvenient. Therefore, what we
will have to do is to get a room elsewhere. It won’t be easy and we
don’t want to do it, but we will have to. So we will pay the rent
through today and leave and of course we will have to explain to Master
Hummin why we have had to change the arrangements that he so kindly made
for us.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” Mistress Tisalver’s face became a study of calculation. “We
wouldn’t like to disoblige Master Hummin … or you two. How long would
this creature have to stay?”</p>
<p>“He’s coming at fourteen hundred. He must be at work at sixteen
hundred. He will be here for less than two hours, perhaps considerably
less. We will meet him outside, the two of us, and bring him to
Dr. Seldon’s room. Any neighbors who see us will think he is an
Outworlder friend of ours.”</p>
<p>Mistress Tisalver nodded her head. “Then let it be as you say. Double
rent for Master Seldon’s room for today and the heatsinker will visit
just this one time.”</p>
<p>“Just this one time,” said Dors.</p>
<p>But later, when Seldon and Dors were sitting in her room, Dors said,
“Why do you have to see him, Hari? Is interviewing a heatsinker
important to psychohistory too?”</p>
<p>Seldon thought he detected a small edge of sarcasm in her voice and
he said tartly, “I don’t have to base everything on this huge project of
mine, in which I have very little faith anyway. I am also a human being
with human curiosities. We were down in the heatsinks for hours and you
saw what the working people there were like. They were obviously
uneducated. They were low-level individuals—no play on words
intended—and yet here was one who recognized me. He must have seen me on
holovision on the occasion of the Decennial Convention and he remembered
the word ‘psychohistory.’ He strikes me as unusual—as out of place
somehow—and I would like to talk to him.”</p>
<p>“Because it pleases your vanity to have become known even to
heatsinkers in Dahl?”</p>
<p>“Well … perhaps. But it also piques my curiosity.”</p>
<p>“And how do you know he hasn’t been briefed and intends to lead you
into trouble as has happened before.”</p>
<p>Seldon winced. “I won’t let him run his fingers through my hair. In
any case, we’re more nearly prepared now, aren’t we? And I’m sure you’ll
be with me. I mean, you let me go Upperside alone, you let me go with
Raindrop Forty-Three to the microfarms alone, and you’re not going to do
that again, are you?”</p>
<p>“You can be absolutely sure I won’t,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll talk to the young man and you can watch out for
traps. I have every faith in you.”</p>
