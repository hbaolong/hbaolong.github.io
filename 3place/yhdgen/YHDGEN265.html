<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>They faced each other in Seldon’s private office, his “thinking
place,” as he called it. There, he had spent uncounted hours trying to
think his way past and through the complexities of Imperial and
Trantorian government.</p>
<p>He said, “Have you read much about the recent breakdowns we’ve been
having in planetary services, Raych?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Raych, “but you know, Dad, we’ve got an old planet here.
What we gotta do is get everyone off it, dig the whole thing up, replace
everything, add the latest computerizations, and then bring everyone
back—or at least half of everyone. Trantor would be much better off with
only twenty billion people.”</p>
<p>“Which twenty billion?” asked Seldon, smiling.</p>
<p>“I wish I knew,” said Raych darkly. “The trouble is, we can’t redo
the planet, so we just gotta keep patching.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so, Raych, but there are some peculiar things about it.
Now I want you to check me out. I have some thoughts about this.”</p>
<p>He brought a small sphere out of his pocket.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” asked Raych.</p>
<p>“It’s a map of Trantor, carefully programmed. Do me a favor, Raych,
and clear off this tabletop.”</p>
<p>Seldon placed the sphere more or less in the middle of the table and
placed his hand on a keypad in the arm of his desk chair. He used his
thumb to close a contact and the light in the room went out while the
tabletop glowed with a soft ivory light that seemed about a centimeter
deep. The sphere had flattened and expanded to the edges of the
table.</p>
<p>The light slowly darkened in spots and took on a pattern. After some
thirty seconds, Raych said in surprise, “It is a map of Trantor.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I told you it was. You can’t buy anything like this at a
sector mall, though. This is one of those gadgets the armed forces play
with. It could present Trantor as a sphere, but a planar projection
would more clearly show what I want to show.”</p>
<p>“And what is it you want to show, Dad?”</p>
<p>“Well, in the last year or two, there have been breakdowns. As you
say, it’s an old planet and we’ve got to expect breakdowns, but they’ve
been coming more frequently and they would seem, almost uniformly, to be
the result of human error.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that reasonable?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Within limits. This is true, even where earthquakes
are involved.”</p>
<p>“Earthquakes? On Trantor?”</p>
<p>“I admit Trantor is a fairly nonseismic planet—and a good thing, too,
because enclosing a world in a dome when the world is going to shake
itself badly several times a year and smash a section of that dome would
be highly impractical. Your mother says that one of the reasons Trantor,
rather than some other world, became the Imperial capital is that it was
geologically moribund—that’s her unflattering expression. Still, it
might be moribund, but it’s not dead. There are occasional minor
earthquakes—three of them in the last two years.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t aware of that, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Hardly anyone is. The dome isn’t a single object. It exists in
hundreds of sections, each one of which can be lifted and set ajar to
relieve tensions and compressions in case of an earthquake. Since an
earthquake, when one does occur, lasts for only ten seconds to a minute,
the opening endures only briefly. It comes and goes so rapidly that the
Trantorians beneath are not even aware of it. They are much more aware
of a mild tremor and a faint rattling of crockery than of the opening
and closing of the dome overhead and the slight intrusion of the outside
weather—whatever it is.”</p>
<p>“That’s good, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It should be. It’s computerized, of course. The onset of an
earthquake anywhere sets off the key controls for the opening and
closing of that section of the dome so that it opens just before the
vibration becomes strong enough to do damage.”</p>
<p>“Still good.”</p>
<p>“But in the case of the three minor earthquakes over the last two
years, the dome controls failed in each case. The dome never opened and,
in each case, repairs were required. It took some time, it took some
money, and the weather controls were less than optimum for a
considerable period of time. Now, what, Raych, are the chances that the
equipment would have failed in all three cases?”</p>
<p>“Not high?”</p>
<p>“Not high at all. Less than one in a hundred. One can suppose that
someone had gimmicked the controls in advance of an earthquake. Now,
about once a century, we have a magma leak, which is far more difficult
to control—and I’d hate to think of the results if it went unnoticed
until it was too late. Fortunately that hasn’t happened and isn’t likely
to, but consider—Here on this map you will find the location of the
breakdowns that have plagued us over the past two years and that seem to
be attributable to human error, though we haven’t once been able to tell
to whom each might be attributed.”</p>
<p>“That’s because everyone is busy protecting his back.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’re right. That’s a characteristic of any bureaucracy
and Trantor’s is the largest in history. —But what do you think of the
locations?”</p>
<p>The map had lit up with bright little red markings that looked like
small pustules covering the land surface of Trantor.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Raych cautiously, “they seem to be evenly spread.”</p>
<p>“Exactly—and that’s what’s interesting. One would expect that the
older sections of Trantor, the longest-domed sections, would have the
most decayed infrastructure and would be more liable to events requiring
quick human decision and laying the groundwork for possible human error.
—I’ll superimpose the older sections of Trantor on the map in a bluish
color and you’ll notice that the breakdowns don’t seem to be taking
place any oftener on the blue areas.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And what I think it means, Raych, is that the breakdowns are not of
natural origin but are deliberately caused and spread out in this
fashion to affect as many people as possible, thus creating a
dissatisfaction that is as widespread as possible.”</p>
<p>“It don’t seem likely.”</p>
<p>“No? Then let’s look at the breakdowns as spread through time rather
than through space.”</p>
<p>The blue areas and the red spots disappeared and, for a time, the map
of Trantor was blank—and then the markings began to appear and disappear
one at a time, here and there.</p>
<p>“Notice,” said Seldon, “that they don’t appear in clumps in time,
either. One appears, then another, then another, and so on, almost like
the steady ticking of a metronome.”</p>
<p>“Do ya think that’s on purpose, too?”</p>
<p>“It must be. Whoever is bringing this about wants to cause as much
disruption with as little effort as possible, so there’s no use doing
two at once, where one will partially cancel the other in the news and
in the public consciousness. Each incident must stand out in full
irritation.”</p>
<p>The map went out and the lights went on. Seldon returned the sphere,
shrunken back to its original size, to his pocket.</p>
<p>Raych said, “Who would be doing all this?”</p>
<p>Seldon said thoughtfully, “A few days ago I received a report of a
murder in Wye Sector.”</p>
<p>“That’s not unusual,” said Raych. “Even though Wye isn’t one of your
really lawless sectors, there must be lots of murders there every
day.”</p>
<p>“Hundreds,” said Seldon, shaking his head. “We’ve had bad days when
the number of deaths by violence on Trantor as a whole approaches the
million-a-day mark. Generally there’s not much chance of finding every
culprit, every murderer. The dead just enter the books as statistics.
This one, however, was unusual. The man had been knifed—but
unskillfully. He was still alive when found, just barely. He had time to
gasp out one word before he died and that word was ‘Chief.’</p>
<p>“That roused a certain curiosity and he was actually identified. He
works in Anemoria and we don’t know what he was doing in Wye. But some
worthy officer managed to dig up the fact that he was an old Joranumite.
His name was Kaspal Kaspalov and he is well known to have been one of
the intimates of Laskin Joranum. And now he’s dead—knifed.”</p>
<p>Raych frowned. “Do you suspect another Joranumite Conspiracy, Dad?
There aren’t any Joranumites around anymore.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t long ago that your mother asked me if I thought that the
Joranumites were still active and I told her that any odd belief always
retained a certain cadre, sometimes for centuries. They’re usually not
very important, just splinter groups that simply don’t count. Still,
what if the Joranumites have kept up an organization, what if they have
retained a certain strength, what if they are capable of killing someone
they consider a traitor in their ranks, and what if they are producing
these breakdowns as a preliminary to seizing control?”</p>
<p>“That’s an awful lot of ‘what if’s,’ Dad.”</p>
<p>“I know that. And I might be totally wrong. The murder happened in
Wye and, as it so happens, there have been no infrastructure breakdowns
in Wye.”</p>
<p>“What does that prove?”</p>
<p>“It might prove that the center of the conspiracy is in Wye and that
the conspirators don’t want to make themselves uncomfortable, only the
rest of Trantor. It also might mean that it’s not the Joranumites at all
but members of the old Wyan family who still dream of ruling the Empire
once again.”</p>
<p>“Oh boy, Dad. You’re building all this on very little.”</p>
<p>“I know. Now suppose it is another Joranumite Conspiracy. Joranum
had, as his right-hand man, Gambol Deen Namarti. We have no record of
Namarti’s death, no record of his having left Trantor, no record of his
life over the last decade or so. That’s not terribly surprising. After
all, it’s easy to lose one person among forty billion. There was a time
in my life when I tried to do just that. Of course, Namarti may be dead.
That would be the easiest explanation, but he may not be.”</p>
<p>“What do we do about it?”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. “The logical thing would be to turn to the security
establishment, but I can’t. I don’t have Demerzel’s presence. He could
cow people; I can’t. He had a powerful personality; I’m just
a—mathematician. I shouldn’t be First Minister at all; I’m not cut out
for it. And I wouldn’t be—if the Emperor weren’t fixated on
psychohistory to a far greater extent than it deserves.”</p>
<p>“You’re kinda whipping yourself, ain’t you, Dad?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I suppose I am, but I have a picture of myself going to the
security establishment, for instance, with what I have just shown you on
the map”—he pointed to the now-empty tabletop—“and arguing that we were
in great danger of some conspiracy of unknown consequence and nature.
They would listen solemnly and, after I had left, they would laugh among
themselves about ‘the crazy mathematician’—and then do nothing.”</p>
<p>“Then what do we do about it?” said Raych, returning to the
point.</p>
<p>“It’s what you will do about it, Raych. I need more evidence and I
want you to find it for me. I would send your mother, but she won’t
leave me under any circumstances. I myself can’t leave the Palace
grounds at this time. Next to Dors and myself, I trust you. More than
Dors and myself, in fact. You’re still quite young, you’re strong,
you’re a better Heliconian Twister than I ever was, and you’re
smart.</p>
<p>“Mind you, now, I don’t want you to risk your life. No heroism, no
derring-do. I couldn’t face your mother if anything happened to you.
Just find out what you can. Perhaps you’ll find that Namarti is alive
and operating—or dead. Perhaps you’ll find out that the Joranumites are
an active group—or moribund. Perhaps you’ll find out that the Wyan
ruling family is active—or not. Any of that would be interesting—but not
vital. What I want you to find out is whether the infrastructure
breakdowns are of human manufacture, as I think they are, and, far more
important still, if they are deliberately caused, what else the
conspirators plan to do. It seems to me they must have plans for some
major coup and, if so, I must know what that will be.”</p>
<p>Raych said cautiously, “Do you have some kinda plan to get me
started?”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed, Raych. I want you to go down to the area of Wye where
Kaspalov was killed. Find out if you can if he was an active Joranumite
and see if you can’t join a Joranumite cell yourself.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s possible. I can always pretend to be an old Joranumite.
It’s true that I was pretty young when Jo-Jo was sounding off, but I was
very impressed by his ideas. It’s even sorta true.”</p>
<p>“Well yes, but there’s one important catch. You might be recognized.
After all, you’re the son of the First Minister. You have appeared on
holovision now and then and you have been interviewed concerning your
views on sector equality.”</p>
<p>“Sure, but—”</p>
<p>“No buts, Raych. You’ll wear elevated shoes to add three centimeters
to your height and we’ll have someone show you how to change the shape
of your eyebrows and make your face fuller and change the timbre of your
voice.”</p>
<p>Raych shrugged. “A lotta trouble for nothing.”</p>
<p>“And,” said Seldon with a distinct quaver, “you will shave off your
mustache.”</p>
<p>Raych’s eyes widened and for a moment he sat there in appalled
silence. Finally he said in a hoarse whisper, “Shave my mustache?”</p>
<p>“Clean as a whistle. No one would recognize you without it.”</p>
<p>“But it can’t be done. Like cutting off your— Like castration.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “It’s just a cultural curiosity. Yugo Amaryl
is as Dahlite as you are and he wears no mustache.”</p>
<p>“Yugo is a nut. I don’t think he’s alive at all, except for his
mathematics.”</p>
<p>“He’s a great mathematician and the absence of a mustache does not
alter that fact. Besides, it’s not castration. Your mustache will grow
back in two weeks.”</p>
<p>“Two weeks! It’ll take two years to reach this—this—”</p>
<p>He put his hand up, as though to cover and protect it.</p>
<p>Seldon said inexorably, “Raych, you have to do it. It’s a sacrifice
you must make. If you act as my spy with your mustache, you may—come to
harm. I can’t take that chance.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather die,” said Raych violently.</p>
<p>“Don’t be melodramatic,” said Seldon severely. “You would not rather
die and this is something you must do. However”—and here he
hesitated—“don’t say anything about it to your mother. I will take care
of that.”</p>
<p>Raych stared at his father in frustration and then said in a low and
despairing tone, “All right, Dad.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I will get someone to supervise your disguise and then
you will go to Wye by air-jet. —Buck up, Raych, it’s not the end of the
world.”</p>
<p>Raych smiled wanly and Seldon watched him leave, a deeply troubled
look on his face. A mustache could easily be regrown, but a son could
not. Seldon knew perfectly well that he was sending Raych into
danger.</p>
