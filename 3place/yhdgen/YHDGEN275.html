<h4 id="section">18</h4>
<p>Manella said thoughtfully, “I guess I won’t be seeing you anymore,
Planchet.”</p>
<p>Raych was drying himself after his shower. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“Gleb Andorin doesn’t want me to.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Manella shrugged her smooth shoulders. “He says you have important
work to do and no more time to fool around. Maybe he means you’ll get a
better job.”</p>
<p>Raych stiffened. “What kind of work? Did he mention anything in
particular?”</p>
<p>“No, but he said he would be going to the Imperial Sector.”</p>
<p>“Did he? Does he often tell you things like that?”</p>
<p>“You know how it is, Planchet. When a fellow’s in bed with you, he
talks a lot.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Raych, who was always careful not to. “What else does
he say?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?” She frowned a bit. “He always asks about you, too.
I noticed that about men. They’re curious about each other. Why is that,
do you suppose?”</p>
<p>“What do you tell him about me?”</p>
<p>“Not much. Just that you’re a very decent sort of guy. Naturally I
don’t tell him that I like you better than I like him. That would hurt
his feelings—and it might hurt me, too.”</p>
<p>Raych was getting dressed. “So it’s good-bye, then.”</p>
<p>“For a while, I suppose. Gleb may change his mind. Of course, I’d
like to go to the Imperial Sector—if he’d take me. I’ve never been
there.”</p>
<p>Raych almost slipped, but he managed to cough, then said, “I’ve never
been there, either.”</p>
<p>“It’s got the biggest buildings and the nicest places and the
fanciest restaurants—and that’s where the rich people live. I’d like to
meet some rich people—besides Gleb, I mean.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “I suppose there’s not much you can get out of a person
like me.”</p>
<p>“You’re all right. You can’t think of credits all the time, but
you’ve got to think of them some of the time. Especially since I think
Gleb is getting tired of me.”</p>
<p>Raych felt compelled to say, “No one could get tired of you,” and
then found, a little to his own confusion, that he meant it.</p>
<p>Manella said, “That’s what men always say, but you’d be surprised.
Anyway, it’s been good, you and I, Planchet. Take care of yourself and,
who knows, we may see each other again.”</p>
<p>Raych nodded and found himself at a loss for words. There was no way
in which he could say or do anything to express his feelings.</p>
<p>He turned his mind in other directions. He had to find out what the
Namarti people were planning. If they were separating him from Manella,
the crisis must be rapidly approaching. All he had to go on was that odd
question about gardening.</p>
<p>Nor could he get any further information back to Seldon. He had been
kept under close scrutiny since his meeting with Namarti and all avenues
of communication were cut off—surely another indication of an
approaching crisis.</p>
<p>But if he were to find out what was going on only after it was
done—and if he could communicate the news only after it was no longer
news—he would have failed.</p>
