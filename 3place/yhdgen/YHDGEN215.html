<h4 id="section">77</h4>
<p>The next morning, dressed from the waist down, having washed and
shaved, Seldon knocked on the door that led to Dors’s adjoining room and
said in a moderate voice, “Open the door, Dors.”</p>
<p>She did. The short reddish-gold curls of her hair were still wet and
she too was dressed only from the waist down.</p>
<p>Seldon stepped back in embarrassed alarm. Dors looked down at the
swell of her breasts indifferently and wrapped a towel around her head.
“What is it?” she asked.</p>
<p>Seldon said, looking off to his right, “I was going to ask you about
Wye.”</p>
<p>Dors said very naturally, “About why in connection with what? And for
goodness sake, don’t make me talk to your ear. Surely, you’re not a
virgin.”</p>
<p>Seldon said in a hurt tone, “I was merely trying to be polite. If you
don’t mind, I certainly don’t. And it’s not why about what. I’m asking
about the Wye Sector.”</p>
<p>“Why do you want to know? Or, if you prefer: Why Wye?”</p>
<p>“Look, Dors, I’m serious. Every once in a while, the Wye Sector is
mentioned—the Mayor of Wye, actually. Hummin mentioned him, you did,
Davan did. I don’t know anything about either the sector or the
Mayor.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a native Trantorian either, Hari. I know very little, but
you’re welcome to what I do know. Wye is near the south pole—quite
large, very populous—”</p>
<p>“Very populous at the south pole?”</p>
<p>“We’re not on Helicon, Hari. Or on Cinna either. This is Trantor.
Everything is underground and underground at the poles or underground at
the equator is pretty much the same. Of course, I imagine they keep
their day-night arrangements rather extreme—long days in their summer,
long nights in their winter—almost as it would be on the surface. The
extremes are just affectation; they’re proud of being polar.”</p>
<p>“But Upperside they must be cold, indeed.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. The Wye Upperside is snow and ice, but it doesn’t lie as
thickly there as you might think. If it did, it might crush the dome,
but it doesn’t and that is the basic reason for Wye’s power.”</p>
<p>She turned to her mirror, removed the towel from her head, and threw
the dry-net over her hair, which, in a matter of five seconds, gave it a
pleasant sheen. She said, “You have no idea how glad I am not to be
wearing a skincap,” as she put on the upper portion of her clothing.</p>
<p>“What has the ice layer to do with Wye’s power?”</p>
<p>“Think about it. Forty billion people use a great deal of power and
every calorie of it eventually degenerates into heat and has to be
gotten rid of. It’s piped to the poles, particularly to the south pole,
which is the more developed of the two, and is discharged into space. It
melts most of the ice in the process and I’m sure that accounts for
Trantor’s clouds and rains, no matter how much the meteorology boggins
insist that things are more complicated than that.”</p>
<p>“Does Wye make use of the power before discharging it?”</p>
<p>“They may, for all I know. I haven’t the slightest idea, by the way,
as to the technology involved in discharging the heat, but I’m talking
about political power. If Dahl were to stop producing usable energy,
that would certainly inconvenience Trantor, but there are other sectors
that produce energy and can up their production and, of course, there is
stored energy in one form or another. Eventually, Dahl would have to be
dealt with, but there would be time. Wye, on the other hand—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Well, Wye gets rid of at least 90 percent of all the heat developed
on Trantor and there is no substitute. If Wye were to shut down its heat
emission, the temperature would start going up all over Trantor.”</p>
<p>“In Wye too.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but since Wye is at the south pole, it can arrange an influx of
cold air. It wouldn’t do much good, but Wye would last longer than the
rest of Trantor. The point is, then, that Wye is a very touchy problem
for the Emperor and the Mayor of Wye is—or at least can be—extremely
powerful.”</p>
<p>“And what kind of a person is the present Mayor of Wye?”</p>
<p>“That I don’t know. What I’ve occasionally heard would make it seem
that he is very old and pretty much a recluse, but hard as a hypership
hull and still cleverly maneuvering for power.”</p>
<p>“Why, I wonder? If he’s that old, he couldn’t hold the power for
long.”</p>
<p>“Who knows, Hari? A lifelong obsession, I suppose. Or else it’s the
game … the maneuvering for power, without any real longing for the power
itself. Probably if he had the power and took over Demerzel’s place or
even the Imperial throne itself, he would feel disappointed because the
game would be over. Of course he might, if he was still alive, begin the
subsequent game of keeping power, which might be just as difficult and
just as satisfying.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “It strikes me that no one could possibly want
to be Emperor.”</p>
<p>“No sane person would, I agree, but the ‘Imperial wish,’ as it is
frequently called, is like a disease that, when caught, drives out
sanity. And the closer you get to high office, the more likely you are
to catch the disease. With each ensuing promotion—”</p>
<p>“The disease grows still more acute. Yes, I can see that. But it also
seems to me that Trantor is so huge a world, so interlocking in its
needs and so conflicting in its ambitions, that it makes up the major
part of the inability of the Emperor to rule. Why doesn’t he just leave
Trantor and establish himself on some simpler world?”</p>
<p>Dors laughed. “You wouldn’t ask that if you knew your history.
Trantor is the Empire through thousands of years of custom. An Emperor
who is not at the Imperial Palace is not the Emperor. He is a place,
even more than a person.”</p>
<p>Seldon sank into silence, his face rigid, and after a while Dors
asked, “What’s the matter, Hari?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking,” he said in a muffled voice. “Ever since you told me
that hand-on-thigh story, I’ve had fugitive thoughts that—Now your
remark about the Emperor being a place rather than a person seems to
have struck a chord.”</p>
<p>“What kind of chord?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “I’m still thinking. I may be all wrong.” His
glance at Dors sharpened, his eyes coming into focus. “In any case, we
ought to go down and have breakfast. We’re late and I don’t think
Mistress Tisalver is in a good enough humor to have it brought in for
us.”</p>
<p>“You optimist,” said Dors. “My own feeling is that she’s not in a
good enough humor to want us to stay—breakfast or not. She wants us out
of here.”</p>
<p>“That may be, but we’re paying her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I suspect she hates us enough by now to scorn our
credits.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps her husband will feel a bit more affectionate concerning the
rent.”</p>
<p>“If he has a single word to say, Hari, the only person who would be
more surprised than me to hear it would be Mistress Tisalver. —Very
well, I’m ready.”</p>
<p>And they moved down the stairs to the Tisalver portion of the
apartment to find the lady in question waiting for them with less than
breakfast—and with considerably more too.</p>
