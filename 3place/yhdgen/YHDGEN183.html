<h4 id="section">45</h4>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three stared at Seldon, wild-eyed and breathing
heavily.</p>
<p>“I can’t stay here,” she said.</p>
<p>Seldon looked about. “No one is bothering us. Even the Brother from
whom we got the dainties said nothing about us. He seemed to take us as
a perfectly normal pair.”</p>
<p>“That’s because there is nothing unusual about us—when the light is
dim, when you keep your voice low so the tribesman accent is less
noticeable, and when I seem calm. But now—” Her voice was growing
hoarse.</p>
<p>“What of now?”</p>
<p>“I am nervous and tense. I am … in a perspiration.”</p>
<p>“Who is to notice? Relax. Calm down.”</p>
<p>“I can’t relax here. I can’t calm down while I may be noticed.”</p>
<p>“Where are we to go, then?”</p>
<p>“There are little sheds for resting. I have worked here. I know about
them.”</p>
<p>She was walking rapidly now and Seldon followed.</p>
<p>Up a small ramp, which he would not have noticed in the twilight
without her, there was a line of doors, well spread apart.</p>
<p>“The one at the end,” she muttered. “If it’s free.”</p>
<p>It was unoccupied. A small glowing rectangle said NOT IN USE and the
door was ajar.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three looked about rapidly, motioned Seldon in, then
stepped inside herself. She closed the door and, as she did so, a small
ceiling light brightened the interior.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Is there any way the sign on the door can indicate this
shed is in use?”</p>
<p>“That happened automatically when the door closed and the light went
on,” said the Sister.</p>
<p>Seldon could feel air softly circulating with a small sighing sound,
but where on Trantor was that ever-present sound and feel not
apparent?</p>
<p>The room was not large, but it had a cot with a firm, efficient
mattress, and what were obviously clean sheets. There was a chair and
table, a small refrigerator, and something that looked like an enclosed
hot plate, probably a tiny food-heater.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three sat down on the chair, sitting stiffly upright,
visibly attempting to force herself into relaxation.</p>
<p>Seldon, uncertain as to what he ought to do, remained standing till
she gestured—a bit impatiently—for him to sit on the cot. He did so.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three said softly, as though talking to herself, “If
it is ever known that I have been here with a man—even if only a
tribesman—I shall indeed be an outcast.”</p>
<p>Seldon rose quickly. “Then let’s not stay here.”</p>
<p>“Sit down. I can’t go out when I’m in this mood. You’ve been asking
about religion. What are you after?”</p>
<p>It seemed to Seldon that she had changed completely. Gone was the
passivity, the subservience. There was none of the shyness, the
backwardness in the presence of a male. She was glaring at him through
narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“I told you. Knowledge. I’m a scholar. It is my profession and my
desire to know. I want to understand people in particular, so I want to
learn history. For many worlds, the ancient historical records—the truly
ancient historical records—have decayed into myths and legends, often
becoming part of a set of religious beliefs or of super naturalism. But
if Mycogen does not have a religion, then—”</p>
<p>“I said we have history.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Twice you’ve said you have history. How old?”</p>
<p>“It goes back twenty thousand years.”</p>
<p>“Truly? Let us speak frankly. Is it real history or is it something
that has degenerated into legend?”</p>
<p>“It is real history, of course.”</p>
<p>Seldon was on the point of asking how she could tell, but thought
better of it. Was there really a chance that history might reach back
twenty thousand years and be authentic? He was not a historian himself,
so he would have to check with Dors.</p>
<p>But it seemed so likely to him that on every world the earliest
histories were medleys of self-serving heroisms and minidramas that were
meant as morality plays and were not to be taken literally. It was
surely true of Helicon, yet you would find scarcely a Heliconian who
would not swear by all the tales told and insist it was all true
history. They would support, as such, even that perfectly ridiculous
tale of the first exploration of Helicon and the encounters with large
and dangerous flying reptiles—even though nothing like flying reptiles
had been found to be native to any world explored and settled by human
beings.</p>
<p>He said instead, “How does this history begin?”</p>
<p>There was a faraway look in the Sister’s eyes, a look that did not
focus on Seldon or on anything in the room. She said, “It begins with a
world—our world. One world.”</p>
<p>“One world?” (Seldon remembered that Hummin had spoken of legends of
a single, original world of humanity.)</p>
<p>“One world. There were others later, but ours was the first. One
world, with space, with open air, with room for everyone, with fertile
fields, with friendly homes, with warm people. For thousands of years we
lived there and then we had to leave and skulk in one place or another
until some of us found a corner of Trantor where we learned to grow food
that brought us a little freedom. And here in Mycogen, we now have our
own ways—and our own dreams.”</p>
<p>“And your histories give the full details concerning the original
world? The one world?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it is all in a book and we all have it. Every one of us. We
carry it at all times so that there is never a moment when any one of us
cannot open it and read it and remember who we are and who we were and
resolve that someday we will have our world back.”</p>
<p>“Do you know where this world is and who lives on it now?”</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three hesitated, then shook her head fiercely. “We do
not, but someday we will find it.”</p>
<p>“And you have this book in your possession now?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“May I see that book?”</p>
<p>Now a slow smile crossed the face of the Sister. She said, “So that’s
what you want. I knew you wanted something when you asked to be guided
through the microfarms by me alone.” She seemed a little embarrassed. “I
didn’t think it was the Book.”</p>
<p>“It is all I want,” said Seldon earnestly. “I really did not have my
mind on anything else. If you brought me here because you thought—”</p>
<p>She did not allow him to finish. “But here we are. Do you or don’t
you want the Book?”</p>
<p>“Are you offering to let me see it?”</p>
<p>“On one condition.”</p>
<p>Seldon paused, weighing the possibility of serious trouble if he had
overcome the Sister’s inhibitions to a greater extent than he had ever
intended. “What condition?” he said.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three’s tongue emerged lightly and licked quickly at
her lips. Then she said with a distinct tremor in her voice, “That you
remove your skincap.”</p>
