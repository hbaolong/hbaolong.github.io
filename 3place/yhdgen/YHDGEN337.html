<h4 id="section">28</h4>
<p>“Wanda dear, what is it that has you so engrossed?” asked Hari Seldon
as he entered his granddaughter’s office at Streeling University. The
room had been the office of the brilliant mathematician Yugo Amaryl,
whose death had impoverished the Psychohistory Project. Fortunately,
Wanda had gradually taken over Yugo’s role in recent years, further
refining and adjusting the Prime Radiant.</p>
<p>“Why, I’m working on an equation in Section 33A2D17. See, I’ve
recalibrated this section”—she gestured to a glowing violet patch
suspended in midair in front of her face—“taking into consideration the
standard quotient and— There! Just what I thought—I think.” She stepped
back and rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p>“What is it, Wanda?” Hari moved in closer to study the equation.
“Why, this looks like the Terminus equation and yet … Wanda, this is an
inverse of the Terminus equation, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandpa. See, the numbers weren’t working quite right in the
Terminus equation—look.” Wanda touched a contact in a recessed wallstrip
and another patch sprang to life in vivid red on the other side of the
room. Seldon and Wanda walked over to inspect it. “You see how it’s all
hanging together fine now, Grandpa? It’s taken me weeks to get it this
way.”</p>
<p>“How did you do it?” asked Hari, admiring the equation’s lines, its
logic, its elegance.</p>
<p>“At first, I concentrated on it from over here only. I blocked out
all else. In order to get Terminus to work, work on Terminus—stands to
reason, doesn’t it? But then I realized that I couldn’t just introduce
this equation into the Prime Radiant system and expect it to blend right
in smoothly, as if nothing happened. A placement means a displacement
somewhere else. A weight needs a counterweight.”</p>
<p>“I think the concept to which you are referring is what the ancients
called ‘yin and yang.’”</p>
<p>“Yes, more or less. Yin and yang. So, you see, I realized that to
perfect the yin of Terminus, I had to locate its yang. Which I did, over
there.” She moved back to the violet patch, tucked away at the other
edge of the Prime Radiant sphere. “And once I adjusted the figures here,
the Terminus equation fell into place as well. Harmony!” Wanda looked
pleased with herself, as if she’d solved all the problems of the
Empire.</p>
<p>“Fascinating, Wanda, and later on you must tell me what you think it
all means for the Project. —But right now you must come with me to the
holoscreen. I received an urgent message from Santanni a few minutes
ago. Your father wants us to call him immediately.”</p>
<p>Wanda’s smile faded. She had been alarmed at the recent reports of
fighting on Santanni. As Imperial budget cutbacks went into effect, the
citizens of the Outer Worlds suffered most. They had limited access to
the richer, more populous Inner Worlds and it became more and more
difficult to trade their worlds’ products for much needed imports.
Imperial hyperships going in and out of Santanni were few and the
distant world felt isolated from the rest of the Empire. Pockets of
rebellion had erupted throughout the planet.</p>
<p>“Grandfather, I hope everything’s all right,” said Wanda, her fear
revealed by her voice.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, dear. After all, they must be safe if Raych was able to
send us a message.”</p>
<p>In Seldon’s office, he and Wanda stood before the holoscreen as it
activated. Seldon punched a code on the keypad alongside the screen and
they waited a few seconds for the intragalactic connection to be
established. Slowly the screen seemed to stretch back into the wall, as
if it were the entrance to a tunnel—and out of the tunnel, dimly at
first, came the familiar figure of a stocky powerfully built man. As the
connection sharpened, the man’s features became clearer. When Seldon and
Wanda were able to make out Raych’s bushy Dahlite mustache, the figure
sprang to life.</p>
<p>“Dad! Wanda!” said Raych’s three-dimensional hologram, projected to
Trantor from Santanni. “Listen, I don’t have much time.” He flinched, as
if startled by a loud noise. “Things have gotten pretty bad here. The
government has fallen and a provisional party has taken over. Things are
a mess, as you can imagine. I just put Manella and Bellis on a hypership
to Anacreon. I told them to get in touch with you from there. The name
of the ship is the Arcadia VII.</p>
<p>“You should have seen Manella, Dad. Mad as anything that she had to
go. The only way I was able to convince her to leave was to point out
that it was for Bellis’s sake.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re thinking, Dad and Wanda. Of course I would have
gone with them—if I could have. But there wasn’t enough room. You
should’ve seen what I had to go through just to get them onto the ship.”
Raych flashed one of his lopsided grins that Seldon and Wanda loved so
much, then continued. “Besides, since I’m here, I have to help guard the
University—we may be part of the Imperial University system, but we’re a
place of learning and building, not of destruction. I tell you, if one
of those hot-headed Santanni rebels comes near our stuff—”</p>
<p>“Raych,” Hari broke in, “How bad is it? Are you close to the
fighting?”</p>
<p>“Dad, are you in danger?” asked Wanda.</p>
<p>They waited a few seconds for their message to travel the nine
thousand parsecs across the Galaxy to Raych.</p>
<p>“I—I—I couldn’t quite make out what you said,” the hologram replied.
“There’s a bit of fighting going on. It’s sort of exciting, actually,”
Raych said, breaking into that grin again. “So I’m going to sign off
now. Remember, find out what happened to the Arcadia VII going to
Anacreon. I’ll be back in touch as soon as I’m able. Remember, I—” The
transmission broke off and the hologram faded. The holoscreen tunnel
collapsed in on itself so that Seldon and Wanda were left staring at a
blank wall.</p>
<p>“Grandpa,” said Wanda, “what do you think he was going to say?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea, dear. But there is one thing I do know and that is
that your father can take care of himself. I pity any rebel who gets
near enough for a well-placed Twist-kick from your dad! —Come, let’s get
back to that equation and in a few hours we’ll check on the Arcadia
VII.”</p>
<p>“Commander, have you no idea what happened to the ship?” Hari Seldon
was again engaged in intragalactic conversation, but this time it was
with an Imperial navy commander stationed at Anacreon. For this
communication, Seldon was making use of the visiscreen—much less
realistic than the holoscreen but also much simpler.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, Professor, that we have no record of that hypership
requesting permission to enter the Anacreonic atmosphere. Of course,
communications with Santanni have been broken for several hours and
sporadic at best for the last week. It is possible that the ship tried
to reach us on a Santanni-based channel and could not get through, but I
doubt it.</p>
<p>“No, it’s more likely that the Arcadia VII changed destination.
Voreg, perhaps, or Sarip. Have you tried either of those worlds,
Professor?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon wearily, “but I see no reason if the ship was bound
for Anacreon that it would not go to Anacreon. Commander, it is vital
that I locate that ship.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” the commander ventured, “the Arcadia VII might not have
made it. Out safely, I mean. There’s a lot of fighting going on. Those
rebels don’t care who they blow up. They just train their lasers and
pretend it’s the Emperor Agis they’re blasting. I tell you, it’s a whole
different game out here on the fringe, Professor.”</p>
<p>“My daughter-in-law and granddaughter are on that ship, Commander,”
Seldon said in a tight voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, Professor,” said an abashed commander. “I’ll be in
touch with you as soon as I hear anything.”</p>
<p>Dispiritedly Hari closed the visiscreen contact. How tired I am, he
thought. And, he mused, I’m not surprised—I’ve known that this would
come for nearly forty years.</p>
<p>Seldon chuckled bitterly to himself. Perhaps that commander had
thought he was shocking Seldon, impressing him with the vivid detail of
life “on the fringe.” But Seldon knew all about the fringe. And as the
fringe came apart, like a piece of knitting with one loose thread, the
whole piece would unravel to the core: Trantor.</p>
<p>Seldon became aware of a soft buzzing sound. It was the door signal.
“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Grandpa,” said Wanda, entering the office, “I’m scared.”</p>
<p>“Why, dear?” asked Seldon with concern. He didn’t want to tell her
yet what he had learned—or hadn’t learned—from the commander on
Anacreon.</p>
<p>“Usually, although they’re so far away, I feel Dad and Mom and
Bellis—feel them in here”—she pointed to her head—“and in here”—she
placed her hand over her heart. “But now, today, I don’t feel them—it
feels less, as if they’re fading, like one of the dome bulbs. And I want
to stop it. I want to pull them back, but I can’t.”</p>
<p>“Wanda, I really think this is merely a product of your concern for
your family in light of the rebellion. You know that uprisings occur all
over the Empire all the time—little eruptions to let off steam. Come
now, you know that chances of anything happening to Raych, Manella, or
Bellis are vanishingly small. Your dad will call any day to say all is
well; your mom and Bellis will land on Anacreon at any moment and enjoy
a little vacation. We are the ones to be pitied—we’re stuck here up to
our ears in work! So, sweetheart, go to bed and think only good
thoughts. I promise you, tomorrow, under the sunny dome, things will
look much better.”</p>
<p>“All right, Grandpa,” said Wanda, not sounding entirely convinced.
“But tomorrow—if we haven’t heard by tomorrow—we’ll have to—to—”</p>
<p>“Wanda, what can we do, except wait?” asked Hari, his voice
gentle.</p>
<p>Wanda turned and left, the weight of her worries showing in the slope
of her shoulders. Hari watched her go, finally allowing his own worries
to come to the surface.</p>
<p>It had been three days since the hologram transmission from Raych.
Since then—nothing. And today the naval commander at Anacreon denied
ever having heard of a ship called Arcadia VII.</p>
<p>Hari had tried earlier to get through to Raych on Santanni, but all
communication beams were down. It was as if Santanni—and the Arcadia
VII—had simply broken off from the Empire, like a petal from a
flower.</p>
<p>Seldon knew what he had to do now. The Empire might be down, but it
was not out. Its power, when properly wielded, was still awesome. Seldon
placed an emergency transmission to Emperor Agis XIV.</p>
