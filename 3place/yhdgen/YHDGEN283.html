<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>Wanda was almost eight years old now, going by Galactic Standard
Time—as everyone did. She was quite the little lady—grave in manner,
with straight light-brown hair. Her eyes were blue but were darkening
and she might well end with the brown eyes of her father.</p>
<p>She sat there, lost in thought. —Sixty.</p>
<p>That was the number that preoccupied her. Grandfather was going to
have a birthday and it was going to be his sixtieth—and sixty was a
large number. It bothered her because yesterday she had had a bad dream
about it.</p>
<p>She went in search of her mother. She would have to ask.</p>
<p>Her mother was not hard to find. She was talking to Grandfather—about
the birthday surely. Wanda hesitated. It wouldn’t be nice to ask in
front of Grandfather.</p>
<p>Her mother had no trouble whatever sensing Wanda’s consternation. She
said, “One minute, Hari, and let’s see what’s bothering Wanda. What is
it, dear?”</p>
<p>Wanda pulled at her hand. “Not here, Mother. Private.”</p>
<p>Manella turned to Hari Seldon. “See how early it starts? Private
lives. Private problems. Of course, Wanda, shall we go to your
room?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mother.” Wanda was clearly relieved.</p>
<p>Hand in hand, they went and then her mother said, “Now what is the
problem, Wanda?”</p>
<p>“It’s Grandfather, Mother.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather! I can’t imagine him doing anything to bother you.”</p>
<p>“Well, he is.” Wanda’s eyes filled with sudden tears. “Is he going to
die?”</p>
<p>“Your grandfather? What put that into your head, Wanda?”</p>
<p>“He’s going to be sixty. That’s so old.”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t. It’s not young, but it’s not old, either. People live
to be eighty, ninety, even a hundred—and your grandfather is strong and
healthy. He’ll live a long time.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” She was sniffing.</p>
<p>Manella grasped her daughter by the shoulders and looked her straight
in the eyes. “We must all die someday, Wanda. I’ve explained that to you
before. Just the same, we don’t worry about it till the someday is much
closer.” She wiped Wanda’s eyes gently. “Grandfather is going to stay
alive till you’re all grown up and have babies of your own. You’ll see.
Now come back with me. I want you to talk to Grandfather.”</p>
<p>Wanda sniffed again.</p>
<p>Seldon looked at the little girl with a sympathetic expression on her
return and said, “What is it, Wanda? Why are you unhappy?”</p>
<p>Wanda shook her head.</p>
<p>Seldon turned his gaze to the girl’s mother. “Well, what is it,
Manella?”</p>
<p>Manella shook her head. “She’ll have to tell you herself.”</p>
<p>Seldon sat down and tapped his lap. “Come, Wanda. Have a seat and
tell me your troubles.”</p>
<p>She obeyed and wriggled a bit, then said, “I’m scared.”</p>
<p>Seldon put his arm around her. “Nothing to be scared of in your old
grandfather.”</p>
<p>Manella made a face. “Wrong word.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up at her. “Grandfather?”</p>
<p>“No. Old.”</p>
<p>That seemed to break the dike. Wanda burst into tears. “You’re old,
Grandfather.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. I’m sixty.” He bent his face down to Wanda’s and
whispered, “I don’t like it, either, Wanda. That’s why I’m glad you’re
only seven going on eight.”</p>
<p>“Your hair is white, Grandpa.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t always. It just turned white recently.”</p>
<p>“White hair means you’re going to die, Grandpa.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked shocked. He said to Manella, “What is all this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Hari. It’s her own idea.”</p>
<p>“I had a bad dream,” said Wanda.</p>
<p>Seldon cleared his throat. “We all have bad dreams now and then,
Wanda. It’s good we do. Bad dreams get rid of bad thoughts and then
we’re better off.”</p>
<p>“It was about you dying, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>“I know. I know. Dreams can be about dying, but that doesn’t make
them important. Look at me. Don’t you see how alive I am—and
cheerful—and laughing? Do I look as though I’m dying? Tell me.”</p>
<p>“N-no.”</p>
<p>“There you are, then. Now you go out and play and forget all about
this. I’m just having a birthday and everyone will have a good time. Go
ahead, dear.”</p>
<p>Wanda left in reasonable cheer, but Seldon motioned to Manella to
stay.</p>
