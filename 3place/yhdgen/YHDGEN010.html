<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>Lewis Pirenne was busily engaged at his desk in the one well-lit
corner of the room. Work had to be coordinated. Effort had to be
organized. Threads had to be woven into a pattern.</p>
<p>Fifty years now; fifty years to establish themselves and set up
Encyclopedia Foundation Number One into a smoothly working unit. Fifty
years to gather the raw material. Fifty years to prepare.</p>
<p>It had been done. Five more years would see the publication of the
first volume of the most monumental work the Galaxy had ever conceived.
And then at ten-year intervals—regularly—like clockwork—volume after
volume. And with them there would be supplements; special articles on
events of current interest, until—</p>
<p>Pirenne stirred uneasily, as the muted buzzer upon his desk muttered
peevishly. He had almost forgotten the appointment. He shoved the door
release and out of an abstracted corner of one eye saw the door open and
the broad figure of Salvor Hardin enter. Pirenne did not look up.</p>
<p>Hardin smiled to himself. He was in a hurry, but he knew better than
to take offense at Pirenne’s cavalier treatment of anything or anyone
that disturbed him at his work. He buried himself in the chair on the
other side of the desk and waited.</p>
<p>Pirenne’s stylus made the faintest scraping sound as it raced across
paper. Otherwise, neither motion nor sound. And then Hardin withdrew a
two-credit coin from his vest pocket. He flipped it and its
stainless-steel surface caught flitters of light as it tumbled through
the air. He caught it and flipped it again, watching the flashing
reflections lazily. Stainless steel made good medium of exchange on a
planet where all metal had to be imported.</p>
<p>Pirenne looked up and blinked. “Stop that!” he said querulously.</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“That infernal coin tossing. Stop it.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Hardin pocketed the metal disk. “Tell me when you’re ready,
will you? I promised to be back at the City Council meeting before the
new aqueduct project is put to a vote.”</p>
<p>Pirenne sighed and shoved himself away from the desk. “I’m ready. But
I hope you aren’t going to bother me with city affairs. Take care of
that yourself, please. The Encyclopedia takes up all my time.”</p>
<p>“Have you heard the news?” questioned Hardin, phlegmatically.</p>
<p>“What news?”</p>
<p>“The news that the Terminus City ultrawave set received two hours
ago. The Royal Governor of the Prefect of Anacreon has assumed the title
of king.”</p>
<p>“Well? What of it?”</p>
<p>“It means,” responded Hardin, “that we’re cut off from the inner
regions of the Empire. We’ve been expecting it but that doesn’t make it
any more comfortable. Anacreon stands square across what was our last
remaining trade route to Santanni and to Trantor and to Vega itself.
Where is our metal to come from? We haven’t managed to get a steel or
aluminum shipment through in six months and now we won’t be able to get
any at all, except by grace of the King of Anacreon.”</p>
<p>Pirenne tch-tched impatiently. “Get them through him, then.”</p>
<p>“But can we? Listen, Pirenne, according to the charter which
established this Foundation, the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia
Committee has been given full administrative powers. I, as Mayor of
Terminus City, have just enough power to blow my own nose and perhaps to
sneeze if you countersign an order giving me permission. It’s up to you
and your Board then. I’m asking you in the name of the City, whose
prosperity depends upon uninterrupted commerce with the Galaxy, to call
an emergency meeting—”</p>
<p>“Stop! A campaign speech is out of order. Now, Hardin, the Board of
Trustees has not barred the establishment of a municipal government on
Terminus. We understand one to be necessary because of the increase in
population since the Foundation was established fifty years ago, and
because of the increasing number of people involved in non-Encyclopedia
affairs. But that does not mean that the first and only aim of the
Foundation is no longer to publish the definitive Encyclopedia of all
human knowledge. We are a State-supported, scientific institution,
Hardin. We cannot—must not—will not interfere in local politics.”</p>
<p>“Local politics! By the Emperor’s left toe, Pirenne, this is a matter
of life and death. The planet, Terminus, by itself cannot support a
mechanized civilization. It lacks metals. You know that. It hasn’t a
trace of iron, copper, or aluminum in the surface rocks, and precious
little of anything else. What do you think will happen to the
Encyclopedia if this watchmacallum King of Anacreon clamps down on
us?”</p>
<p>“On us? Are you forgetting that we are under the direct control of
the Emperor himself? We are not part of the Prefect of Anacreon or of
any other prefect. Memorize that! We are part of the Emperor’s personal
domain, and no one touches us. The Empire can protect its own.”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t it prevent the Royal Governor of Anacreon from
kicking over the traces? And only Anacreon? At least twenty of the
outermost prefects of the Galaxy, the entire Periphery as a matter of
fact, have begun steering things their own way. I tell you I feel dammed
uncertain of the Empire and its ability to protect us.”</p>
<p>“Hokum! Royal Governors, Kings—what’s the difference? The Empire is
always shot through with a certain amount of politics and with different
men pulling this way and that. Governors have rebelled, and, for that
matter, Emperors have been deposed, or assassinated before this. But
what has that to do with the Empire itself? Forget it, Hardin. It’s none
of our business. We are first of all and last of all—scientists. And our
concern is the Encyclopedia. Oh, yes, I’d almost forgotten. Hardin!”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“Do something about that paper of yours!” Pirenne’s voice was
angry.</p>
<p>“The Terminus City Journal? It isn’t mine; it’s privately owned.
What’s it been doing?”</p>
<p>“For weeks now it has been recommending that the fiftieth anniversary
of the establishment of the Foundation be made the occasion for public
holidays and quite inappropriate celebrations.”</p>
<p>“And why not? The computoclock will open the Vault in three months. I
would call this first opening a big occasion, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Not for silly pageantry, Hardin. The Vault and its opening concern
the Board of Trustees alone. Anything of importance will be communicated
to the people. That is final and please make it plain to the
Journal.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Pirenne, but the City Charter guarantees a certain minor
matter known as freedom of the press.”</p>
<p>“It may. But the Board of Trustees does not. I am the Emperor’s
representative on Terminus, Hardin, and have full powers in this
respect.”</p>
<p>Hardin’s expression became that of a man counting to ten, mentally.
He said, grimly: “In connection with your status as Emperor’s
representative, then, I have a final piece of news to give you.”</p>
<p>“About Anacreon?” Pirenne’s lips tightened. He felt annoyed.</p>
<p>“Yes. A special envoy will be sent to us from Anacreon. In two
weeks.”</p>
<p>“An envoy? Here? From Anacreon?” Pirenne chewed that. “What for?”</p>
<p>Hardin stood up, and shoved his chair back up against the desk. “I
give you one guess.”</p>
<p>And he left—quite unceremoniously.</p>
