<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>The Vault was furnished with considerably more than six chairs, as
though a larger company had been expected. Hardin noted that
thoughtfully and seated himself wearily in a corner just as far from the
other five as possible.</p>
<p>The Board members did not seem to object to that arrangement. They
spoke among themselves in whispers, which fell off into sibilant
monosyllables, and then into nothing at all. Of them all, only Jord Fara
seemed even reasonably calm. He had produced a watch and was staring at
it somberly.</p>
<p>Hardin glanced at his own watch and then at the glass
cubicle—absolutely empty—that dominated half the room. It was the only
unusual feature of the room, for aside from that there was no indication
that somewhere a computer was splitting off instants of time toward that
precise moment when a muon stream would flow, a connection be made
and—</p>
<p>The lights went dim!</p>
<p>They didn’t go out, but merely yellowed and sank with a suddenness
that made Hardin jump. He had lifted his eyes to the ceiling lights in
startled fashion, and when he brought them down the glass cubicle was no
longer empty.</p>
<p>A figure occupied it—a figure in a wheelchair!</p>
<p>It said nothing for a few moments, but it closed the book upon its
lap and fingered it idly. And then it smiled, and the face seemed all
alive.</p>
<p>It said, “I am Hari Seldon.” The voice was old and soft.</p>
<p>Hardin almost rose to acknowledge the introduction and stopped
himself in the act.</p>
<p>The voice continued conversationally: “As you see, I am confined to
this chair and cannot rise to greet you. Your grandparents left for
Terminus a few months back in my time and since then I have suffered a
rather inconvenient paralysis. I can’t see you, you know, so I can’t
greet you properly. I don’t even know how many of you there are, so all
this must be conducted informally. If any of you are standing, please
sit down; and if you care to smoke, I wouldn’t mind.” There was a light
chuckle. “Why should I? I’m not really here.”</p>
<p>Hardin fumbled for a cigar almost automatically, but thought better
of it.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon put away his book—as if laying it upon a desk at his
side—and when his fingers let go, it disappeared.</p>
<p>He said: “It is fifty years now since this Foundation was
established—fifty years in which the members of the Foundation have been
ignorant of what it was they were working toward. It was necessary that
they be ignorant, but now the necessity is gone.</p>
<p>“The Encyclopedia Foundation, to begin with, is a fraud, and always
has been!”</p>
<p>There was a sound of a scramble behind Hardin and one or two muffled
exclamations, but he did not turn around.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon was, of course, undisturbed. He went on: “It is a fraud
in the sense that neither I nor my colleagues care at all whether a
single volume of the Encyclopedia is ever published. It has served its
purpose, since by it we extracted an imperial charter from the Emperor,
by it we attracted the hundred thousand humans necessary for our scheme,
and by it we managed to keep them preoccupied while events shaped
themselves, until it was too late for any of them to draw back.</p>
<p>“In the fifty years that you have worked on this fraudulent
project—there is no use in softening phrases—your retreat has been cut
off, and you have now no choice but to proceed on the infinitely more
important project that was, and is, our real plan.</p>
<p>“To that end we have placed you on such a planet and at such a time
that in fifty years you were maneuvered to the point where you no longer
have freedom of action. From now on, and into the centuries, the path
you must take is inevitable. You will be faced with a series of crises,
as you are now faced with the first, and in each case your freedom of
action will become similarly circumscribed so that you will be forced
along one, and only one, path.</p>
<p>“It is that path which our psychology has worked out—and for a
reason.</p>
<p>“For centuries Galactic civilization has stagnated and declined,
though only a few ever realized that. But now, at last, the Periphery is
breaking away and the political unity of the Empire is shattered.
Somewhere in the fifty years just past is where the historians of the
future will place an arbitrary line and say: ‘This marks the Fall of the
Galactic Empire.’</p>
<p>“And they will be right, though scarcely any will recognize that Fall
for additional centuries.</p>
<p>“And after the Fall will come inevitable barbarism, a period which,
our psychohistory tells us, should, under ordinary circumstances, last
for thirty thousand years. We cannot stop the Fall. We do not wish to;
for Imperial culture has lost whatever virility and worth it once had.
But we can shorten the period of barbarism that must follow—down to a
single thousand of years.</p>
<p>“The ins and outs of that shortening, we cannot tell you; just as we
could not tell you the truth about the Foundation fifty years ago. Were
you to discover those ins and outs, our plan might fail; as it would
have, had you penetrated the fraud of the Encyclopedia earlier; for
then, by knowledge, your freedom of action would be expanded and the
number of additional variables introduced would become greater than our
psychology could handle.</p>
<p>“But you won’t, for there are no psychologists on Terminus, and never
were, but for Alurin—and he was one of us.</p>
<p>“But this I can tell you: Terminus and its companion Foundation at
the other end of the Galaxy are the seeds of the Renascence and the
future founders of the Second Galactic Empire. And it is the present
crisis that is starting Terminus off to that climax.</p>
<p>“This, by the way, is a rather straightforward crisis, much simpler
than many of those that are ahead. To reduce it to its fundamentals, it
is this: You are a planet suddenly cut off from the still-civilized
centers of the Galaxy, and threatened by your stronger neighbors. You
are a small world of scientists surrounded by vast and rapidly expanding
reaches of barbarism. You are an island of nuclear power in a growing
ocean of more primitive energy; but are helpless despite that, because
of your lack of metals.</p>
<p>“You see, then, that you are faced by hard necessity, and that action
is forced on you. The nature of that action—that is, the solution to
your dilemma—is, of course, obvious!”</p>
<p>The image of Hari Seldon reached into open air and the book once more
appeared in his hand. He opened it and said:</p>
<p>“But whatever devious course your future history may take, impress it
always upon your descendants that the path has been marked out, and that
at its end is a new and greater Empire!”</p>
<p>And as his eyes bent to his book, he flicked into nothingness, and
the lights brightened once more.</p>
<p>Hardin looked up to see Pirenne facing him, eyes tragic and lips
trembling.</p>
<p>The chairman’s voice was firm but toneless. “You were right, it
seems. If you will see us tonight at six, the Board will consult with
you as to the next move.”</p>
<p>They shook his hand, each one, and left; and Hardin smiled to
himself. They were fundamentally sound at that; for they were scientists
enough to admit that they were wrong—but for them, it was too late.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. By this time, it was all over. Lee’s men were
in control and the Board was giving orders no longer.</p>
<p>The Anacreonians were landing their first spaceships tomorrow, but
that was all right, too. In six months, they would be giving orders no
longer.</p>
<p>In fact, as Hari Seldon had said, and as Salvor Hardin had guessed
since the day that Anselm haut Rodric had first revealed to him
Anacreon’s lack of nuclear power—the solution to this first crisis was
obvious.</p>
<p>Obvious as all hell!</p>
<p>THE FOUR KINGDOMS—The name given to those portions of the Province of
Anacreon which broke away from the First Empire in the early years of
the Foundational Era to form independent and short-lived kingdoms. The
largest and most powerful of these was Anacreon itself which in area
…</p>
<p>… Undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the history of the four
Kingdoms involves the strange society forced temporarily upon it during
the administration of Salvor Hardin.…</p>
