<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>The foundry was large, and bore the odor of decay which no amount of
superficial repairs could quite erase. It was empty now and in quite an
unnatural state of quiet, as it played unaccustomed host to the Commdor
and his court.</p>
<p>Mallow had swung the steel sheet onto the two supports with a
careless heave. He had taken the instrument held out to him by Twer and
was gripping the leather handle inside its leaden sheath.</p>
<p>“The instrument,” he said, “is dangerous, but so is a buzz saw. You
just have to keep your fingers away.”</p>
<p>And as he spoke, he drew the muzzle-slit swiftly down the length of
the steel sheet, which quietly and instantly fell in two.</p>
<p>There was a unanimous jump, and Mallow laughed. He picked up one of
the halves and propped it against his knee, “You can adjust the
cutting-length accurately to a hundredth of an inch, and a two-inch
sheet will slit down the middle as easily as this thing did. If you’ve
got the thickness exactly judged, you can place steel on a wooden table,
and split the metal without scratching the wood.”</p>
<p>And at each phrase, the nuclear shear moved and a gouged chunk of
steel flew across the room.</p>
<p>“That,” he said, “is whittling—with steel.”</p>
<p>He passed back the shear. “Or else you have the plane. Do you want to
decrease the thickness of a sheet, smooth out an irregularity, remove
corrosion? Watch!”</p>
<p>Thin, transparent foil flew off the other half of the original sheet
in six-inch swaths, then eight-inch, then twelve.</p>
<p>“Or drills? It’s all the same principle.”</p>
<p>They were crowded around now. It might have been a sleight-of-hand
show, a corner magician, a vaudeville act made into high-pressure
salesmanship. Commdor Asper fingered scraps of steel. High officials of
the government tiptoed around each other’s shoulders, and whispered,
while Mallow punched clean, beautiful round holes through an inch of
hard steel at every touch of his nuclear drill.</p>
<p>“Just one more demonstration. Bring two short lengths of pipe,
somebody.”</p>
<p>An Honorable Chamberlain of something-or-other sprang to obedience in
the general excitement and thought-absorption, and stained his hands
like any laborer.</p>
<p>Mallow stood them upright and shaved the ends off with a single
stroke of the shear, and then joined the pipes, fresh cut to fresh
cut.</p>
<p>And there was a single pipe! The new ends, with even atomic
irregularities missing, formed one piece upon joining.</p>
<p>Then Mallow looked up at his audience, stumbled at his first word and
stopped. There was the keen stirring of excitement in his chest, and the
base of his stomach went tingly and cold.</p>
<p>The Commdor’s own bodyguard, in the confusion, had struggled to the
front line, and Mallow, for the first time, was near enough to see their
unfamiliar hand-weapons in detail.</p>
<p>They were nuclear! There was no mistaking it; an explosive projectile
weapon with a barrel like that was impossible. But that wasn’t the big
point. That wasn’t the point at all.</p>
<p>The butts of those weapons had, deeply etched upon them, in worn gold
plating, the Spaceship-and-Sun!</p>
<p>The same Spaceship-and-Sun that was stamped on every one of the great
volumes of the original Encyclopedia that the Foundation had begun and
not yet finished. The same Spaceship-and-Sun that had blazoned the
banner of the Galactic Empire through millennia.</p>
<p>Mallow talked through and around his thoughts, “Test that pipe! It’s
one piece. Not perfect; naturally, the joining shouldn’t be done by
hand.”</p>
<p>There was no need of further legerdemain. It had gone over. Mallow
was through. He had what he wanted. There was only one thing in his
mind. The golden globe with its conventionalized rays, and the oblique
cigar shape that was a space vessel.</p>
<p>The Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire!</p>
<p>The Empire! The words drilled! A century and a half had passed but
there was still the Empire, somewhere deeper in the Galaxy. And it was
emerging again, out into the Periphery.</p>
<p>Mallow smiled!</p>
