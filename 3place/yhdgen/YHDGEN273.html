<h4 id="section">16</h4>
<p>Gambol Deen Namarti was not, at even the best of times, noted for his
politeness and suavity—and the approaching climax of a decade of
planning had left his disposition sour.</p>
<p>He rose from his chair with some agitation and said, “You’ve taken
your time getting here, Andorin.”</p>
<p>Andorin shrugged. “But I’m here.”</p>
<p>“And this young man of yours—this remarkable tool that you’re
touting. Where is he?”</p>
<p>“He’ll be here eventually.”</p>
<p>“Why not now?”</p>
<p>Andorin’s rather handsome head seemed to sink a bit, as though he
were lost in thought or coming to a decision, and then he said abruptly,
“I don’t want to bring him until I know where I stand.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Simple words in Galactic Standard. How long has it been your aim to
get rid of Hari Seldon?”</p>
<p>“Always! Always! Is that so hard to understand? We deserve revenge
for what he did to Jo-Jo. Even if he hadn’t done that, since he’s the
First Minister, we’d have to put him out of the way.”</p>
<p>“But it’s Cleon—Cleon—who must be brought down. If not only he, then
at least he, in addition to Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Why does a figurehead concern you?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t born yesterday. I’ve never had to explain my part in
this because you’re not so ignorant a fool as not to know. What can I
possibly care about your plans if they don’t include a replacement on
the throne?”</p>
<p>Namarti laughed. “Of course. I’ve known for a long time that you look
upon me as your footstool, your way of climbing up to the Imperial
throne.”</p>
<p>“Would you expect anything else?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I will do the planning, take the chances, and then, when
all is quite done, you gather in the reward. It makes sense, doesn’t
it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it does make sense, for the reward will be yours, too. Won’t
you become the First Minister? Won’t you be able to count on the full
support of a new Emperor, one who is filled with gratitude? Won’t I
be”—and his face twisted with irony as he spat out the words—“the new
figurehead?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you plan to be? A figurehead?”</p>
<p>“I plan to be the Emperor. I supplied advances of credit when you had
none. I supplied the cadre when you had none. I supplied the
respectability you needed to build a large organization here in Wye. I
can still withdraw everything I’ve brought in.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to risk it? Don’t think you can treat me the way you
treated Kaspalov, either. If anything happens to me, Wye will become
uninhabitable for you and yours—and you will find that no other sector
will supply you with what you need.”</p>
<p>Namarti sighed. “Then you insist on having the Emperor killed.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say ‘killed.’ I said ‘brought down.’ The details I leave to
you.” This last statement was accompanied with an almost dismissive wave
of the hand, a flick of the wrist, as if Andorin were already sitting on
the Imperial throne.</p>
<p>“And then you’ll be Emperor?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“No, you won’t. You’ll be dead—and not at my hands, either. Andorin,
let me teach you some of the facts of life. If Cleon is killed, then the
matter of the succession comes up and, to avoid civil war, the Imperial
Guard will at once kill every member of the Wyan Mayoral family they can
find—you first of all. On the other hand, if only the First Minister is
killed, you will be safe.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“A First Minister is only a First Minister. They come and go. It is
possible that Cleon himself may have grown tired of him and arranged the
murder. Certainly we would see to it that rumors of this sort are
spread. The Imperial Guard would hesitate and would give us a chance to
put the new government into place. Indeed, it is quite possible that
they themselves would be grateful for the end of Seldon.”</p>
<p>“And with the new government in place, what am I to do? Keep on
waiting? Forever?”</p>
<p>“No. Once I’m First Minister, there will be ways of dealing with
Cleon. I may even be able to do something with the Imperial Guard—and
even with the security establishment—and use them all as my instruments.
I will then manage to find some safe way of getting rid of Cleon and
replacing him with you.”</p>
<p>Andorin burst out, “Why should you?”</p>
<p>Namarti said, “What do you mean, why should I?”</p>
<p>“You have a personal grudge against Seldon. Once he is gone, why
should you run unnecessary risks at the highest level? You will make
your peace with Cleon and I will have to retire to my crumbling estate
and my impossible dreams. And perhaps, to play it safe, you will have me
killed.”</p>
<p>Namarti said, “No! Cleon was born to the throne. He comes from
several generations of Emperors—the proud Entun Dynasty. He would be
very difficult to handle, a plague. You, on the other hand, would come
to the throne as a member of a new dynasty, without any strong ties to
tradition, for the previous Wyan Emperors were, you will admit, totally
undistinguished. You will be seated on a shaky throne and will need
someone to support you—me. And I will need someone who is dependent upon
me and whom I can therefore handle—you. —Come, Andorin, ours is not a
marriage of love, which fades in a year; it is a marriage of
convenience, which can last as long as we both live. Let us trust each
other.”</p>
<p>“You swear I will be Emperor.”</p>
<p>“What good would swearing do if you couldn’t trust my word? Let us
say I would find you an extraordinarily useful Emperor and I would want
you to replace Cleon as soon as that can safely be managed. Now
introduce me to this man you think will be the perfect tool for your
purposes.”</p>
<p>“Very well. And remember what makes him different. I have studied
him. He’s a not-very-bright idealist. He will do what he’s told,
unconcerned by danger, unconcerned by second thoughts. And he exudes a
kind of trustworthiness so that his victim will trust him, even if he
has a blaster in his hand.”</p>
<p>“I find that impossible to believe.”</p>
<p>“Wait till you meet him,” said Andorin.</p>
