<h4 id="section">37</h4>
<p>“Frankly,” whispered Dors, “I can scarcely believe I’m on
Trantor.”</p>
<p>“I take it, then, you’ve never seen anything like this before?” said
Seldon.</p>
<p>“I’ve only been on Trantor for two years and I’ve spent much of my
time at the University, so I’m not exactly a world traveler. Still, I’ve
been here and there and I’ve heard of this and that, but I’ve never seen
or heard of anything like this. The sameness.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster drove along methodically and without undue haste. There
were other wagonlike vehicles in the roadway, all with hairless men at
the controls, their bald pates gleaming in the light.</p>
<p>On either side there were three-story structures, unornamented, all
lines meeting at right angles, everything gray in color.</p>
<p>“Dreary,” mouthed Dors. “So dreary.”</p>
<p>“Egalitarian,” whispered Seldon. “I suspect no Brother can lay claim
to precedence of any obvious kind over any other.”</p>
<p>There were many pedestrians on the walkways as they passed. There
were no signs of any moving corridors and no sound of any nearby
Expressway.</p>
<p>Dors said, “I’m guessing the grays are women.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to tell,” said Seldon. “The gowns hide everything and one
hairless head is like another.”</p>
<p>“The grays are always in pairs or with a white. The whites can walk
alone and Sunmaster is a white.”</p>
<p>“You may be right.” Seldon raised his voice. “Sunmaster, I am
curious—”</p>
<p>“If you are, then ask what you wish, although I am by no means
required to answer.”</p>
<p>“We seem to be passing through a residential area. There are no signs
of business establishments, industrial areas—”</p>
<p>“We are a farming community entirely. Where are you from that you do
not know this?”</p>
<p>“You know I am an Outworlder,” Seldon said stiffly. “I have been on
Trantor for only two months.”</p>
<p>“Even so.”</p>
<p>“But if you are a farming community, Sunmaster, how is it that we
have passed no farms either?”</p>
<p>“On lower levels,” said Sunmaster briefly.</p>
<p>“Is Mycogen on this level entirely residential, then?”</p>
<p>“And on a few others. We are what you see. Every Brother and his
family lives in equivalent quarters; every cohort in its own equivalent
community; all have the same ground-cars and all Brothers drive their
own. There are no servants and none are at ease through the labor of
others. None may glory over another.”</p>
<p>Seldon lifted his shielded eyebrows at Dors and said, “But some of
the people wear white, while some wear gray.”</p>
<p>“That is because some of the people are Brothers and some are
Sisters.”</p>
<p>“And we?”</p>
<p>“You are a tribesman and a guest. You and your”—he paused and then
said—“companion will not be bound by all aspects of Mycogenian life.
Nevertheless, you will wear a white gown and your companion will wear a
gray one and you will live in special guest quarters like our own.”</p>
<p>“Equality for all seems a pleasant ideal, but what happens as your
numbers increase? Is the pie, then, cut into smaller pieces?”</p>
<p>“There is no increase in numbers. That would necessitate an increase
in area, which the surrounding tribesmen would not allow, or a change
for the worse in our way of life.”</p>
<p>“But if—” began Seldon.</p>
<p>Sunmaster cut him off. “It is enough, Tribesman Seldon. As I warned
you, I am not compelled to answer. Our task, which we have promised our
friend Tribesman Hummin, is to keep you secure as long as you do not
violate our way of life. That we will do, but there it ends. Curiosity
is permitted, but it wears out our patience quickly if persisted
in.”</p>
<p>Something about his tone allowed no more to be said and Seldon
chafed. Hummin, for all his help, had clearly mis-stressed the
matter.</p>
<p>It was not security that Seldon sought. At least, not security alone.
He needed information too and without that he could not—and would
not—stay here.</p>
