<h4 id="section">30</h4>
<p>Wanda Seldon adjusted the waistband of her unisuit, pulling it a
little tighter around her middle. Taking up a hand hoe, she attacked
some weeds that had sprung up in her small flower garden outside the
Psychohistory Building at Streeling. Generally Wanda spent the bulk of
her time in her office, working with her Prime Radiant. She found solace
in its precise statistical elegance; the unvarying equations were
somehow reassuring in this Empire gone so crazy. But when thoughts of
her beloved father, mother, and baby sister became too much to bear,
when even her research could not keep her mind off the horrible losses
she’d so recently undergone, Wanda invariably found herself out here,
scratching at the terraformed ground, as if coaxing a few plants to life
might somehow, in some tiny measure, ameliorate her pain.</p>
<p>Since her father’s death a month ago and the disappearance of Manella
and Bellis, Wanda, who had always been slim, had been losing weight.
Whereas a few months ago Hari Seldon would have been concerned over his
darling granddaughter’s loss of appetite, now he, stuck in his own
grief, seemed not to notice.</p>
<p>A profound change had come over Hari and Wanda Seldon—and the few
remaining members of the Psychohistory Project. Hari seemed to have
given up. He now spent most of his days sitting in an armchair in the
Streeling solarium, staring out at the University grounds, warmed by the
bright bulbs overhead. Occasionally Project members told Wanda that his
bodyguard, a man named Stettin Palver, would badger Seldon into a walk
out under the dome or try to engage him in a discussion of the future
direction of the Project.</p>
<p>Wanda retreated deeper into her study of the Prime Radiant’s
fascinating equations. She could feel the future her grandfather had
worked so hard to achieve finally taking shape, and he was right: The
Encyclopedists must be established on Terminus; they would be the
Foundation.</p>
<p>And Section 33A2D17—in it Wanda could see what Seldon referred to as
the Second, or secret, Foundation. But how? Without Seldon’s active
interest, Wanda was at a loss as to how to proceed. And her sorrow over
the destruction of her family cut so deep that she didn’t seem to have
the strength to figure it out.</p>
<p>The members of the Project itself, those fifty or so hardy souls who
remained, continued their work as well as possible. The majority were
Encyclopedists, researching the source materials they would need to copy
and catalogue for their eventual move to Terminus—when and if they
gained full access to the Galactic Library. At this point, they were
working on faith alone. Professor Seldon had lost his private office at
the Library, so the prospects of any other Project member gaining
special access were slim.</p>
<p>The remaining Project members (other than the Encyclopedists) were
historical analysts and mathematicians. The historians interpreted past
and current human actions and events, turning their findings over to the
mathematicians, who in turn fit those pieces into the great
Psychohistorical Equation. It was long painstaking work.</p>
<p>Many Project members had left because the rewards were so
few—psychohistorians were the butt of many jokes on Trantor and limited
funds had forced Seldon to enact drastic pay cuts. But the constant
reassuring presence of Hari Seldon had—till now—overcome the difficult
working conditions of the Project. Indeed, the Project members who had
stayed on had, to a person, done so out of respect and devotion to
Professor Seldon.</p>
<p>Now, thought Wanda Seldon bitterly, what reason is left for them to
stay? A light breeze blew a piece of her blond hair across her eyes; she
pushed it back absentmindedly and continued her weeding.</p>
<p>“Miss Seldon, may I have a moment of your time?” Wanda turned and
looked up. A young man—she judged him to be in his early twenties—stood
on the gravel path next to her. She immediately sensed him to be strong
and fearsomely intelligent. Her grandfather had chosen wisely. Wanda
rose to speak with him.</p>
<p>“I recognize you. You are my grandfather’s bodyguard, are you not?
Stettin Palver, I believe?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s correct, Miss Seldon,” Palver said and his cheeks
reddened slightly, as if he were pleased that so pretty a girl should
have given him any notice. “Miss Seldon, it is your grandfather I’d like
to talk to you about. I’m very worried about him. We must do
something.”</p>
<p>“Do what, Mr. Palver? I am at a loss. Since my father” —she swallowed
hard, as if she were having difficulty speaking—“died and my mother and
sister disappeared, it is all I can do to get him out of bed in the
morning. And to tell you the truth, it has affected me very deeply as
well. You understand, don’t you?” She looked into his eyes and knew that
he did.</p>
<p>“Miss Seldon,” Palver said softly, “I am terribly sorry about your
losses. But you and Professor Seldon are alive and you must keep working
at psychohistory. The professor seems to have given up. I was hoping
that maybe you—we—could come up with something to give him hope again.
You know, a reason to go on.”</p>
<p>Ah, Mr. Palver, thought Wanda, maybe Grandpa has it right. I wonder
if there truly is any reason to go on. But she said, “I’m sorry,
Mr. Palver, I can think of nothing.” She gestured toward the ground with
her hoe. “And now, as you can see, I must get back to these pesky
weeds.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think your grandfather has got it right. I think there truly
is a reason to go on. We just have to find it.”</p>
<p>The words struck her with full force. How had he known what she had
been thinking? Unless— “You can handle minds, can’t you?” Wanda asked,
holding her breath, as if afraid to hear Palver’s response.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can,” the young man replied. “I always have, I think. At
least, I can’t remember not doing it. Half the time I’m not even
consciously aware of it—I just know what people are thinking—or have
thought.</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” he continued, encouraged by the understanding he felt
emanating from Wanda, “I get flashes of it coming from someone else.
It’s always in a crowd, though, and I can’t locate whoever it is. But I
know there are others like me—us—around.”</p>
<p>Wanda grabbed Palver’s hand excitedly, her gardening tool tossed to
the ground, forgotten. “Have you any idea what this might mean? For
Grandpa, for psychohistory? One of us alone can do only so much, but
both of us together—” Wanda started walking into the Psychohistory
Building, leaving Palver standing on the gravel path. Almost to the
entrance she stopped and turned. Come, Mr. Palver, we must tell my
grandfather, Wanda said without opening her mouth. Yes, I suppose we
should, answered Palver as he joined her.</p>
