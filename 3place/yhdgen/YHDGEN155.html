<h4 id="section">17</h4>
<p>Sleep eluded Seldon. He tossed and turned in the dark, thinking. He
had never felt quite so alone or quite so helpless as he did after
Hummin had nodded, pressed his hand briefly, and left him behind. Now he
was on a strange world—and in a strange part of that world. He was
without the only person he could consider a friend (and that of less
than a day’s duration) and he had no idea of where he was going or what
he would be doing, either tomorrow or at any time in the future.</p>
<p>None of that was conducive to sleep so, of course, at about the time
he decided, hopelessly, that he would not sleep that night or, possibly,
ever again, exhaustion overtook him …</p>
<p>When he woke up it was still dark—or not quite, for across the room
he saw a red light flashing brightly and rapidly, accompanied by a
harsh, intermittent buzz. Undoubtedly, it was that which had awakened
him.</p>
<p>As he tried to remember where he was and to make some sort of sense
out of the limited messages his senses were receiving, the flashing and
buzzing ceased and he became aware of a peremptory rapping.</p>
<p>Presumably, the rapping was at the door, but he didn’t remember where
the door was. Presumably, also, there was a contact that would flood the
room with light, but he didn’t remember where that was either.</p>
<p>He sat up in bed and felt along the wall to his left rather
desperately while calling out, “One moment, please.”</p>
<p>He found the necessary contact and the room suddenly bloomed with a
soft light.</p>
<p>He scrambled out of bed, blinking, still searching for the door,
finding it, reaching out to open it, remembering caution at the last
moment, and saying in a suddenly stern, no-nonsense voice, “Who’s
there?”</p>
<p>A rather gentle woman’s voice said, “My name is Dors Venabili and I
have come to see Dr. Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>Even as that was said, a woman was standing just in front of the
door, without that door ever having been opened.</p>
<p>For a moment, Hari Seldon stared at her in surprise, then realized
that he was wearing only a one-piece undergarment. He let out a
strangled gasp and dashed for the bed and only then realized that he was
staring at a holograph. It lacked the hard edge of reality and it became
apparent the woman wasn’t looking at him. She was merely showing herself
for identification.</p>
<p>He paused, breathing hard, then said, raising his voice to be heard
through the door, “If you’ll wait, I’ll be with you. Give me … maybe
half an hour.”</p>
<p>The woman—or the holograph, at any rate—said, “I’ll wait,” and
disappeared.</p>
<p>There was no shower, so he sponged himself, making a rare mess on the
tiled floor in the washroom corner. There was toothpaste but no
toothbrush, so he used his finger. He had no choice but to put on the
clothes he had been wearing the day before. He finally opened the
door.</p>
<p>He realized, even as he did so, that she had not really identified
herself. She had merely given a name and Hummin had not told him whom to
expect, whether it was to be this Dors Somebody or anyone else. He had
felt secure because the holograph was that of a personable young woman,
but for all he knew there might be half a dozen hostile young men with
her.</p>
<p>He peered out cautiously, saw only the woman, then opened the door
sufficiently to allow her to enter. He immediately closed and locked the
door behind her.</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” he said, “What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Nine,” she said, “The day has long since begun.”</p>
<p>As far as official time was concerned, Trantor held to Galactic
Standard, since only so could sense be made out of interstellar commerce
and governmental dealings. Each world, however, also had a local time
system and Seldon had not yet come to the point where he felt at home
with casual Trantorian references to the hour.</p>
<p>“Midmorning?” he said.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“There are no windows in this room,” he said defensively.</p>
<p>Dors walked to his bed, reached out, and touched a small dark spot on
the wall. Red numbers appeared on the ceiling just over his pillow. They
read: 0903.</p>
<p>She smiled without superiority. “I’m sorry,” she said. “But I rather
assumed Chetter Hummin would have told you I’d be coming for you at
nine. The trouble with him is he’s so used to knowing, he sometimes
forgets that others occasionally don’t know. —And I shouldn’t have used
radio-holographic identification. I imagine you don’t have it on Helicon
and I’m afraid I must have alarmed you.”</p>
<p>Seldon felt himself relax. She seemed natural and friendly and the
casual reference to Hummin reassured him. He said, “You’re quite wrong
about Helicon, Miss—”</p>
<p>“Please call me Dors.”</p>
<p>“You’re still wrong about Helicon, Dors. We do have radio-holography,
but I’ve never been able to afford the equipment. Nor could anyone in my
circle, so I haven’t actually had the experience. But I understood what
had happened soon enough.”</p>
<p>He studied her. She was not very tall, average height for a woman, he
judged. Her hair was a reddish-gold, though not very bright, and was
arranged in short curls about her head. (He had seen a number of women
in Trantor with their hair so arranged. It was apparently a local
fashion that would have been laughed at in Helicon.) She was not
amazingly beautiful, but was quite pleasant to look at, this being
helped by full lips that seemed to have a slight humorous curl to them.
She was slim, well-built, and looked quite young. (Too young, he thought
uneasily, to be of use perhaps.)</p>
<p>“Do I pass inspection?” she asked. (She seemed to have Hummin’s trick
of guessing his thoughts, Seldon thought, or perhaps he himself lacked
the trick of hiding them.)</p>
<p>He said, “I’m sorry. I seem to have been staring, but I’ve only been
trying to evaluate you. I’m in a strange place. I know no one and have
no friends.”</p>
<p>“Please, Dr. Seldon, count me as a friend. Mr. Hummin has asked me to
take care of you.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled ruefully. “You may be a little young for the job.”</p>
<p>“You’ll find I am not.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll try to be as little trouble as possible. Could you please
repeat your name?”</p>
<p>“Dors Venabili.” She spelled the last name and emphasized the stress
on the second syllable. “As I said, please call me Dors and if you don’t
object too strenuously I will call you Hari. We’re quite informal here
at the University and there is an almost self-conscious effort to show
no signs of status, either inherited or professional.”</p>
<p>“Please, by all means, call me Hari.”</p>
<p>“Good. I shall remain informal then. For instance, the instinct for
formality, if there is such a thing, would cause me to ask permission to
sit down. Informally, however, I shall just sit.” She then sat down on
the one chair in the room.</p>
<p>Seldon cleared his throat. “Clearly, I’m not at all in possession of
my ordinary faculties. I should have asked you to sit.” He sat down on
the side of his crumpled bed and wished he had thought to straighten it
out somewhat—but he had been caught by surprise.</p>
<p>She said pleasantly, “This is how it’s going to work, Hari. First,
we’ll go to breakfast at one of the University cafés. Then I’ll get you
a room in one of the domiciles—a better room than this. You’ll have a
window. Hummin has instructed me to get you a credit tile in his name,
but it will take me a day or two to extort one out of the University
bureaucracy. Until that’s done, I’ll be responsible for your expenses
and you can pay me back later. —And we can use you. Chetter Hummin told
me you’re a mathematician and for some reason there’s a serious lack of
good ones at the University.”</p>
<p>“Did Hummin tell you that I was a good mathematician?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, he did. He said you were a remarkable man.”</p>
<p>“Well.” Seldon looked down at his fingernails. “I would like to be
considered so, but Hummin knew me for less than a day and, before that,
he had heard me present a paper, the quality of which he has no way of
judging. I think he was just being polite.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Dors. “He is a remarkable person himself and
has had a great deal of experience with people. I’ll go by his
judgement. In any case, I imagine you’ll have a chance to prove
yourself. You can program computers, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about teaching computers, you understand, and I’m asking
if you can devise programs to teach various phases of contemporary
mathematics.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s part of my profession. I’m assistant professor of
mathematics at the University of Helicon.”</p>
<p>She said, “Yes, I know. Hummin told me that. It means, of course,
that everyone will know you are a non-Trantorian, but that will present
no serious problems. We’re mainly Trantorian here at the University, but
there’s a substantial minority of Outworlders from any number of
different worlds and that’s accepted. I won’t say that you’ll never hear
a planetary slur but actually the Outworlders are more likely to use
them than the Trantorians. I’m an Outworlder myself, by the way.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” He hesitated and then decided it would be only polite to ask.
“What world are you from?”</p>
<p>“I’m from Cinna. Have you ever heard of it?”</p>
<p>He’d be caught out if he was polite enough to lie, Seldon decided, so
he said, “No.”</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised. It’s probably of even less account than Helicon
is. —Anyway, to get back to the programming of mathematical teaching
computers, I suppose that that can be done either proficiently or
poorly.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“And you would do it proficiently.”</p>
<p>“I would like to think so.”</p>
<p>“There you are, then. The University will pay you for that, so let’s
go out and eat. Did you sleep well, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Surprisingly, I did.”</p>
<p>“And are you hungry?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—” He hesitated.</p>
<p>She said cheerfully, “But you’re worried about the quality of the
food, is that it? Well, don’t be. Being an Outworlder myself, I can
understand your feelings about the strong infusion of microfood into
everything, but the University menus aren’t bad. In the faculty dining
room, at least. The students suffer a bit, but that serves to harden
them.”</p>
<p>She rose and turned to the door, but stopped when Seldon could not
keep himself from saying, “Are you a member of the faculty?”</p>
<p>She turned and smiled at him impishly. “Don’t I look old enough? I
got my doctorate two years ago at Cinna and I’ve been here ever since.
In two weeks, I’ll be thirty.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Seldon, smiling in his turn, “but you can’t expect to
look twenty-four and not raise doubts as to your academic status.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you nice?” said Dors and Seldon felt a certain pleasure wash
over him. After all, he thought, you can’t exchange pleasantries with an
attractive woman and feel entirely like a stranger.</p>
