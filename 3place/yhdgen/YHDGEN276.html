<h4 id="section">19</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon was not having a good day. He had not heard from Raych
since his first communique; he had no idea what was happening.</p>
<p>Aside from his natural concern for Raych’s safety (surely he would
hear if something really bad had happened), there was his uneasiness
over what might be planned.</p>
<p>It would have to be subtle. A direct attack on the Palace itself was
totally out of the question. Security there was far too tight. But if
so, what else could be planned that would be sufficiently effective?</p>
<p>The whole thing was keeping him awake at night and distracted by
day.</p>
<p>The signal light flashed.</p>
<p>“First Minister. Your two o’clock appointment, sir—”</p>
<p>“What two o’clock appointment is this?”</p>
<p>“Mandell Gruber, the gardener. He has the necessary
certification.”</p>
<p>Seldon remembered. “Yes. Send him in.”</p>
<p>This was no time to see Gruber, but he had agreed to it in a moment
of weakness—the man had seemed distraught. A First Minister should not
have such moments of weakness, but Seldon had been Seldon long before he
had become First Minister.</p>
<p>“Come in, Gruber,” he said kindly.</p>
<p>Gruber stood before him, head ducking mechanically, eyes darting this
way and that. Seldon was quite certain the gardener had never been in
any room as magnificent as this one and he had the bitter urge to say:
“Do you like it? Please take it. I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>But he only said, “What is it, Gruber? Why are you so unhappy?”</p>
<p>There was no immediate answer; Gruber merely smiled vacantly.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Sit down, man. Right there in that chair.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, First Minister. It would not be fitting. I’ll get it
dirty.”</p>
<p>“If you do, it will be easy to clean. Do as I say. —Good! Now just
sit there a minute or two and gather your thoughts. Then, when you are
ready, tell me what’s the matter.”</p>
<p>Gruber sat silent for a moment, then the words came out in a panting
rush. “First Minister. It is Chief Gardener I am to be. The blessed
Emperor himself told me so.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have heard of that, but that surely isn’t what is troubling
you. Your new post is a matter of congratulations and I do congratulate
you. I may even have contributed to it, Gruber. I have never forgotten
your bravery at the time I was nearly killed and you can be sure I
mentioned it to His Imperial Majesty. It is a suitable reward, Gruber,
and you would deserve the promotion in any case, for it is quite clear
from your record that you are fully qualified for the post. So, now that
that’s out of the way, tell me what is troubling you.”</p>
<p>“First Minister, it is the very post and promotion that’s troubling
me. It is something I cannot manage, for I am not qualified.”</p>
<p>“We are convinced you are.”</p>
<p>Gruber grew agitated. “And is it in an office I will have to sit? I
can’t sit in an office. I could not go out in the open air and work with
the plants and animals. I would be in prison, First Minister.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s eyes opened wide. “No such thing, Gruber. You needn’t stay
in the office longer than you have to. You could wander around the
grounds freely, supervising everything. You will have all the outdoors
you want and you will merely spare yourself the hard work.”</p>
<p>“I want the hard work, First Minister, and it’s no chance at all they
will let me come out of the office. I have watched the present Chief
Gardener. He couldn’t leave his office, though he wanted to, ever so.
There is too much administration, too much bookkeeping. Sure, if he
wants to know what is going on, we must go to his office to tell him. He
watches things on holovision”—he said with infinite contempt—“as though
you can tell anything about growing, living things from pictures. It is
not for me, First Minister.”</p>
<p>“Come, Gruber, be a man. It’s not all that bad. You’ll get used to
it. You’ll work your way in slowly.”</p>
<p>Gruber shook his head. “First off—at the very first first—I will have
to deal with all the new gardeners. I’ll be buried.” Then, with sudden
energy, “It is a job I do not want and must not have, First
Minister.”</p>
<p>“Right now, Gruber, perhaps you don’t want the job, but you are not
alone. I’ll tell you that right now I wish I were not First Minister.
This job is too much for me. I even have a notion that there are times
when the Emperor himself is tired of his Imperial robes. We’re all in
this Galaxy to do our work and the work isn’t always pleasant.”</p>
<p>“I understand that, First Minister, but the Emperor must be Emperor,
for he was born to that. And you must be First Minister, for there is no
one else who can do the job. But in my case, it is just Chief Gardener
we are ruminating upon. There are fifty gardeners in the place who could
do it as well as I could and who wouldn’t mind the office. You say that
you spoke to the Emperor about how I tried to help you. Can’t you speak
to him again and explain that if he wants to reward me for what I did,
he can leave me as I am?”</p>
<p>Seldon leaned back in his chair and said solemnly, “Gruber, I would
do that for you if I could, but I must explain something to you and I
can only hope that you will understand it. The Emperor, in theory, is
absolute ruler of the Empire. In actual fact, there is very little he
can do. I run the Empire right now much more than he does and there is
very little I can do, too. There are millions and billions of people at
all levels of government, all making decisions, all making mistakes,
some acting wisely and heroically, some acting foolishly and thievishly.
There’s no controlling them. Do you understand me, Gruber?”</p>
<p>“I do, but what has this to do with my case?”</p>
<p>“Because there is only one place where the Emperor is really absolute
ruler—and that is over the Imperial grounds. Here, his word is law and
the layers of officials beneath him are few enough for him to handle.
For him to be asked to rescind a decision he has made in connection with
the Imperial Palace grounds would be to invade the only area that he
would consider inviolate. If I were to say, ‘Take back your decision on
Gruber, Your Imperial Majesty,’ he would be much more likely to relieve
me of my duties than to take back his decision. That might be a good
thing for me, but it wouldn’t help you any.”</p>
<p>Gruber said, “Does that mean there’s no way things can be
changed?”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what it means. But don’t worry, Gruber, I’ll help you
all I can. I’m sorry. But now I have really spent all the time with you
that I am able to spare.”</p>
<p>Gruber rose to his feet. In his hands he twisted his green gardening
cap. There was more than a suspicion of tears in his eyes. “Thank you,
First Minister. I know you would like to help. You’re—you’re a good man,
First Minister.”</p>
<p>He turned and left, sorrowing.</p>
<p>Seldon looked after him thoughtfully and shook his head. Multiply
Gruber’s woes by a quadrillion and you would have the woes of all the
people of the twenty-five million worlds of the Empire and how was he,
Seldon, to work out salvation for all of them, when he was helpless to
solve the problem of one single man who had come to him for help?</p>
<p>Psychohistory could not save one man. Could it save a
quadrillion?</p>
<p>He shook his head again, checked the nature and time of his next
appointment, and then suddenly stiffened. He shouted into his
communications wire in sudden wild abandon, quite unlike his usually
strict control. “Get that gardener back! Get him back here right
now!”</p>
