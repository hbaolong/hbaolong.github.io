<h4 id="section">80</h4>
<p>Raych found them a hiding place. It had meant climbing up the metal
rungs of a ladder and it had led them to a large loftlike room, the use
of which Seldon could not imagine. It was filled with equipment, bulky
and silent, the function of which also remained a mystery. The room was
reasonably clean and free of dust and a steady draft of air wafted
through that prevented the dust from settling and—more important—seemed
to lessen the odor.</p>
<p>Raych seemed pleased. “Ain’t this nice?” he demanded. He still rubbed
his shoulder now and then and winced when he rubbed too hard.</p>
<p>“It could be worse,” said Seldon. “Do you know what this place is
used for, Raych?”</p>
<p>Raych shrugged or began to do so and winced. “I dunno,” he said. Then
he added with a touch of swagger, “Who cares?”</p>
<p>Dors, who had sat down on the floor after brushing it with her hand
and then looking suspiciously at her palm, said, “If you want a guess, I
think this is part of a complex that is involved in the detoxification
and recycling of wastes. The stuff must surely end up as
fertilizer.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Seldon gloomily, “those who run the complex will be down
here periodically and may come at any moment, for all we know.”</p>
<p>“I been here before,” said Raych. “I never saw no one here.”</p>
<p>“I suppose Trantor is heavily automated wherever possible and if
anything calls for automation it would be this treatment of wastes,”
said Dors. “We may be safe … for a while.”</p>
<p>“Not for long. We’ll get hungry and thirsty, Dors.”</p>
<p>“I can get food and water for us,” said Raych. “Ya got to know how to
make out if you’re an alley kid.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Raych,” said Seldon absently, “but right now I’m not
hungry.” He sniffed. “I may never be hungry again.”</p>
<p>“You will be,” said Dors, “and even if you lose your appetite for a
while, you’ll get thirsty. At least elimination is no problem. We’re
practically living over what is clearly an open sewer.”</p>
<p>There was silence for a while. The light was dim and Seldon wondered
why the Trantorians didn’t keep it dark altogether. But then it occurred
to him that he had never encountered true darkness in any public area.
It was probably a habit in an energy-rich society. Strange that a world
of forty billion should be energy-rich, but with the internal heat of
the planet to draw upon, to say nothing of solar energy and nuclear
fusion plants in space, it was. In fact, come to think of it, there was
no energy-poor planet in the Empire. Was there a time when technology
had been so primitive that energy poverty was possible?</p>
<p>He leaned against a system of pipes through which—for all he
knew—sewage ran. He drew away from the pipes as the thought occurred to
him and he sat down next to Dors.</p>
<p>He said, “Is there any way we can get in touch with Chetter
Hummin?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “As a matter of fact, I did send a message, though I hated
to.”</p>
<p>“You hated to?”</p>
<p>“My orders are to protect you. Each time I have to get in touch with
him, it means I’ve failed.”</p>
<p>Seldon regarded her out of narrowed eyes. “Do you have to be so
compulsive, Dors? You can’t protect me against the security officers of
an entire sector.”</p>
<p>“I suppose not. We can disable a few—”</p>
<p>“I know. We did. But they’ll send out reinforcements … armored
ground-cars … neuronic cannon … sleeping mist. I’m not sure what they
have, but they’re going to throw in their entire armory. I’m sure of
it.”</p>
<p>“You’re probably right,” said Dors, her mouth tightening.</p>
<p>“They won’t find ya, lady,” said Raych suddenly. His sharp eyes had
moved from one to the other as they talked. “They never find Davan.”</p>
<p>Dors smiled without joy and ruffled the boy’s hair, then looked at
the palm of her hand with a little dismay. She said, “I’m not sure if
you ought to stay with us, Raych. I don’t want them finding you.”</p>
<p>“They won’t find me and if I leave ya, who’ll get ya food and water
and who’ll find ya new hidin’ places, so the Sunbadgers’ll never know
where to look?”</p>
<p>“No, Raych, they’ll find us. They don’t really look too hard for
Davan. He annoys them, but I suspect they don’t take him seriously. Do
you know what I mean?”</p>
<p>“You mean he’s just a pain in the … the neck and they figure he ain’t
worth chasing all over the lot.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I mean. But you see, we hurt two of the officers
very badly and they’re not going to let us get away with that. If it
takes their whole force—if they have to sweep through every hidden or
unused corridor in the sector—they’ll get us.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “That makes me feel like … like nothin’. If I didn’t run
in there and get zapped, ya wouldn’t have taken out them officers and ya
wouldn’t be in such trouble.”</p>
<p>“No, sooner or later, we’d have—uh—taken them out. Who knows? We may
have to take out a few more.”</p>
<p>“Well, ya did it beautiful,” said Raych. “If I hadn’t been aching all
over, I could’ve watched more and enjoyed it.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “It wouldn’t do us any good to try to fight the entire
security system. The question is: What will they do to us once they have
us? A prison sentence, surely.”</p>
<p>“Oh no. If necessary, we’ll have to appeal to the Emperor,” put in
Dors.</p>
<p>“The Emperor?” said Raych, wide-eyed. “You know the Emperor?”</p>
<p>Seldon waved at the boy. “Any Galactic citizen can appeal to the
Emperor. —That strikes me as the wrong thing to do, Dors. Ever since
Hummin and I left the Imperial Sector, we’ve been evading the
Emperor.”</p>
<p>“Not to the extent of being thrown into a Dahlite prison. The
Imperial appeal will serve as a delay—in any case, a diversion—and
perhaps in the course of that delay, we can think of something
else.”</p>
<p>“There’s Hummin.”</p>
<p>“Yes, there is,” said Dors uneasily, “but we can’t consider him the
do-it-all. For one thing, even if my message reached him and even if he
was able to rush to Dahl, how would he find us here? And, even if he
did, what could he do against the entire Dahlite security force?”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Seldon, “we’re going to have to think of
something we can do before they find us.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “If ya follow me, I can keep ya ahead of them. I know
every place there is around here.”</p>
<p>“You can keep us ahead of one person, but there’ll be a great many,
moving down any number of corridors. We’ll escape one group and bump
into another.”</p>
<p>They sat in uncomfortable silence for a good while, each confronting
what seemed to be a hopeless situation. Then Dors Venabili stirred and
said in a tense, low whisper, “They’re here. I hear them.”</p>
<p>For a while, they strained, listening, then Raych sprang to his feet
and hissed, “They comin’ that way. We gotta go this way.”</p>
<p>Seldon, confused, heard nothing at all, but would have been content
to trust the others’ superior hearing, but even as Raych began moving
hastily and quietly away from the direction of the approaching tread, a
voice rang out echoing against the sewer walls. “Don’t move. Don’t
move.”</p>
<p>And Raych said, “That’s Davan. How’d he know we were here?”</p>
<p>“Davan?” said Seldon. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Sure I’m sure. He’ll help.”</p>
