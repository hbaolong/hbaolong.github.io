<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>And at the other end of town, in homelier surroundings, Hober Mallow
kept a second appointment. He had listened long, and now he said
cautiously, “Yes, I’ve heard of your campaigns to get trader
representation in the council. But why me, Twer?”</p>
<p>Jaim Twer, who would remind you any time, asked or unasked, that he
was in the first group of Outlanders to receive a lay education at the
Foundation, beamed.</p>
<p>“I know what I’m doing,” he said. “Remember when I met you first,
last year.”</p>
<p>“At the Trader’s Convention.”</p>
<p>“Right. You ran the meeting. You had those rednecked oxen planted in
their seats, then put them in your shirtpocket and walked off with them.
And you’re all right with the Foundation masses, too. You’ve got
glamour—or, at any rate, solid adventure-publicity, which is the same
thing.”</p>
<p>“Very good,” said Mallow, dryly. “But why now?”</p>
<p>“Because now’s our chance. Do you know that the Secretary of
Education has handed in his resignation? It’s not out in the open yet,
but it will be.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“That—never mind—” He waved a disgusted hand. “It’s so. The Actionist
party is splitting wide open, and we can murder it right now on a
straight question of equal rights for traders; or, rather, democracy,
pro-and anti-.”</p>
<p>Mallow lounged back in his chair and stared at his thick fingers.
“Uh-uh. Sorry, Twer. I’m leaving next week on business. You’ll have to
get someone else.”</p>
<p>Twer stared. “Business? What kind of business?”</p>
<p>“Very super-secret. Triple-A priority. All that, you know. Had a talk
with the mayor’s own secretary.”</p>
<p>“Snake Sutt?” Jaim Twer grew excited. “A trick. The son-of-a-spacer
is getting rid of you. Mallow—”</p>
<p>“Hold on!” Mallow’s hand fell on the other’s balled fist. “Don’t go
into a blaze. If it’s a trick, I’ll be back some day for the reckoning.
If it isn’t, your snake, Sutt, is playing into our hands. Listen,
there’s a Seldon crisis coming up.”</p>
<p>Mallow waited for a reaction but it never came. Twer merely stared.
“What’s a Seldon crisis?”</p>
<p>“Galaxy!” Mallow exploded angrily at the anticlimax. “What the blue
blazes did you do when you went to school? What do you mean anyway by a
fool question like that?”</p>
<p>The elder man frowned, “If you’ll explain—”</p>
<p>There was a long pause, then, “I’ll explain.” Mallow’s eyebrows
lowered, and he spoke slowly. “When the Galactic Empire began to die at
the edges, and when the ends of the Galaxy reverted to barbarism and
dropped away, Hari Seldon and his band of psychologists planted a
colony, the Foundation, out here in the middle of the mess, so that we
could incubate art, science, and technology, and form the nucleus of the
Second Empire.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, yes—”</p>
<p>“I’m not finished,” said the trader, coldly. “The future course of
the Foundation was plotted according to the science of psychohistory,
then highly developed, and conditions arranged so as to bring about a
series of crises that will force us most rapidly along the route to
future Empire. Each crisis, each Seldon crisis, marks an epoch in our
history. We’re approaching one now—our third.”</p>
<p>Twer shrugged. “I suppose this was mentioned in school, but I’ve been
out of school a long time—longer than you.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. Forget it. What matters is that I’m being sent out
into the middle of the development of this crisis. There’s no telling
what I’ll have when I come back, and there is a council election every
year.”</p>
<p>Twer looked up. “Are you on the track of anything?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You have definite plans?”</p>
<p>“Not the faintest inkling of one.”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>“Well, nothing. Hardin once said: ‘To succeed, planning alone is
insufficient. One must improvise as well.’ I’ll improvise.”</p>
<p>Twer shook his head uncertainly, and they stood, looking at each
other.</p>
<p>Mallow said, quite suddenly, but quite matter-of-factly, “I tell you
what, how about coming with me? Don’t stare, man. You’ve been a trader
before you decided there was more excitement in politics. Or so I’ve
heard.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going? Tell me that.”</p>
<p>“Towards the Whassallian Rift. I can’t be more specific till we’re
out in space. What do you say?”</p>
<p>“Suppose Sutt decides he wants me where he can see me.”</p>
<p>“Not likely. If he’s anxious to get rid of me, why not of you as
well? Besides which, no trader would hit space if he couldn’t pick his
own crew. I take whom I please.”</p>
<p>There was a queer glint in the older man’s eyes, “All right. I’ll
go.” He held out his hand. “It’ll be my first trip in three years.”</p>
<p>Mallow grasped and shook the other’s hand. “Good! All fired good! And
now I’ve got to round up the boys. You know where the Far Star docks,
don’t you? Then show up tomorrow. Good-by.”</p>
