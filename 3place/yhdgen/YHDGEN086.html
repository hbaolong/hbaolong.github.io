<h4 id="section">11</h4>
<p>STOWAWAY</p>
<p>It was a little over a month before the summer could be said to have
started. Started, that is, to the extent that Homir Munn had written his
final financial report of the fiscal year, seen to it that the
substitute librarian supplied by the government was sufficiently aware
of the subtleties of the post—last year’s man had been quite
unsatisfactory—and arranged to have his little cruiser the Unimara—named
after a tender and mysterious episode of twenty years past—taken out of
its winter cobwebbery.</p>
<p>He left Terminus in a sullen distemper. No one was at the port to see
him off. That was natural since no one ever had been in the past. He
knew very well that it was important to have this trip in no way
different from any he had made in the past, yet he felt drenched in a
vague resentment. He, Homir Munn, was risking his neck in derring-doery
of the most outrageous sort, and yet he left alone.</p>
<p>At least, so he thought.</p>
<p>And it was because he thought wrongly, that the following day was one
of confusion, both on the Unimara and in Dr. Darell’s suburban home.</p>
<p>It hit Dr. Darell’s home first, in point of time, through the medium
of Poli, the maid, whose month’s vacation was now quite a thing of the
past. She flew down the stairs in a flurry and stutter.</p>
<p>The good doctor met her and she tried vainly to put emotion into
words but ended by thrusting a sheet of paper and a cubical object at
him.</p>
<p>He took them unwillingly and said: “What’s wrong, Poli?”</p>
<p>“She’s gone, doctor.”</p>
<p>“Who’s gone?”</p>
<p>“Arcadia!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, gone? Gone where? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>And she stamped her foot: “I don’t know. She’s gone, and there’s a
suitcase and some clothes gone with her and there’s that letter. Why
don’t you read it, instead of just standing there? Oh, you men!”</p>
<p>Dr. Darell shrugged and opened the envelope. The letter was not long,
and except for the angular signature, “Arkady,” was in the ornate and
flowing handwriting of Arcadia’s Transcriber.</p>
<p>Dear Father:</p>
<p>It would have been simply too heartbreaking to say good-by to you in
person. I might have cried like a little girl and you would have been
ashamed of me. So I’m writing a letter instead to tell you how much I’ll
miss you, even while I’m having this perfectly wonderful summer vacation
with Uncle Homir. I’ll take good care of myself and it won’t be long
before I’m home again. Meanwhile, I’m leaving you something that’s all
my own. You can have it now.</p>
<p>Your loving daughter,</p>
<p>Arkady.</p>
<p>He read it through several times with an expression that grew blanker
each time. He said stiffly, “Have you read this, Poli?”</p>
<p>Poli was instantly on the defensive. “I certainly can’t be blamed for
that, doctor. The envelope has ‘Poli’ written on the outside, and I had
no way of telling there was a letter for you on the inside. I’m no
snoop, doctor, and in the years I’ve been with—”</p>
<p>Darell held up a placating hand, “Very well, Poli. It’s not
important. I just wanted to make sure you understood what had
happened.”</p>
<p>He was considering rapidly. It was no use telling her to forget the
matter. With regard to the enemy, “forget” was a meaningless word; and
the advice, insofar as it made the matter more important, would have had
an opposite effect.</p>
<p>He said instead, “She’s a queer little girl, you know. Very romantic.
Ever since we arranged to have her go off on a space trip this summer,
she’s been quite excited.”</p>
<p>“And just why has no one told me about this space trip?”</p>
<p>“It was arranged while you were away, and we forgot. It’s nothing
more complicated than that.”</p>
<p>Poli’s original emotions now concentrated themselves into a single,
overwhelming indignation, “Simple, is it? The poor chick has gone off
with one suitcase, without a decent stitch of clothes to her, and alone
at that. How long will she be away?”</p>
<p>“Now I won’t have you worrying about it, Poli. There will be plenty
of clothes for her on the ship. It’s been all arranged. Will you tell
Mr. Anthor that I want to see him? Oh, and first—is this the object that
Arcadia has left for me?” He turned it over in his hand.</p>
<p>Poli tossed her head. “I’m sure I don’t know. The letter was on top
of it and that’s every bit I can tell you. Forget to tell me, indeed. If
her mother were alive—”</p>
<p>Darell waved her away. “Please call Mr. Anthor.”</p>
<p>Anthor’s viewpoint on the matter differed radically from that of
Arcadia’s father. He punctuated his initial remarks with clenched fists
and torn hair, and from there, passed on to bitterness.</p>
<p>“Great Space, what are you waiting for? What are we both waiting for?
Get the spaceport on the viewer and have them contact the Unimara.”</p>
<p>“Softly, Pelleas, she’s my daughter.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not your Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Now, wait. She’s an intelligent girl, Pelleas, and she’s thought
this thing out carefully. We had better follow her thoughts while this
thing is fresh. Do you know what this thing is?”</p>
<p>“No. Why should it matter what it is?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s a sound-receiver.”</p>
<p>“That thing?”</p>
<p>“It’s homemade, but it will work. I’ve tested it. Don’t you see? It’s
her way of telling us that she’s been a party to our conversations of
policy. She knows where Homir Munn is going and why. She’s decided it
would be exciting to go along.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Great Space,” groaned the younger man. “Another mind for the
Second Foundation to pick.”</p>
<p>“Except that there’s no reason why the Second Foundation should, a
priori, suspect a fourteen-year-old girl of being a danger—unless we do
anything to attract attention to her, such as calling back a ship out of
space for no reason other than to take her off. Do you forget with whom
we’re dealing? How narrow the margin is that separates us from
discovery? How helpless we are thereafter?”</p>
<p>“But we can’t have everything depend on an insane child.”</p>
<p>“She’s not insane, and we have no choice. She need not have written
the letter, but she did it to keep us from going to the police after a
lost child. Her letter suggests that we convert the entire matter into a
friendly offer on the part of Munn to take an old friend’s daughter off
for a short vacation. And why not? He’s been my friend for nearly twenty
years. He’s known her since she was three, when I brought her back from
Trantor. It’s a perfectly natural thing, and, in fact, ought to decrease
suspicion. A spy does not carry a fourteen-year-old niece about with
him.”</p>
<p>“So. And what will Munn do when he finds her?”</p>
<p>Dr. Darell heaved his eyebrows once. “I can’t say—but I presume
she’ll handle him.”</p>
<p>But the house was somehow very lonely at night and Dr. Darell found
that the fate of the Galaxy made remarkably little difference while his
daughter’s mad little life was in danger.</p>
<p>The excitement on the Unimara, if involving fewer people, was
considerably more intense.</p>
<p>In the luggage compartment, Arcadia found herself, in the first
place, aided by experience, and, in the second, hampered by the
reverse.</p>
<p>Thus, she met the initial acceleration with equanimity and the more
subtle nausea that accompanied the insideoutness of the first jump
through hyperspace with stoicism. Both had been experienced on space
hops before, and she was tensed for them. She knew also that luggage
compartments were included in the ship’s ventilation system and that
they could even be bathed in wall-light. This last, however, she
excluded as being too unconscionably unromantic. She remained in the
dark, as a conspirator should, breathing very softly, and listening to
the little miscellany of noises that surrounded Homir Munn.</p>
<p>They were undistinguished noises, the kind made by a man alone. The
shuffling of shoes, the rustle of fabric against metal, the soughing of
an upholstered chair seat retreating under weight, the sharp click of a
control unit, or the soft slap of a palm over a photoelectric cell.</p>
<p>Yet, eventually, it was the lack of experience that caught up with
Arcadia. In the book-films and on the videos, the stowaway seemed to
have such an infinite capacity for obscurity. Of course, there was
always the danger of dislodging something which would fall with a crash,
or of sneezing—in videos you were almost sure to sneeze; it was an
accepted matter. She knew all this, and was careful. There was also the
realization that thirst and hunger might be encountered. For this, she
was prepared with ration cans out of the pantry. But yet things remained
that the films never mentioned, and it dawned upon Arcadia with a shock
that, despite the best intentions in the world, she could stay hidden in
the closet for only a limited time.</p>
<p>And on a one-man sports-cruiser such as the Unimara, living space
consisted essentially of a single room, so that there wasn’t even the
risky possibility of sneaking out of the compartment while Munn was
engaged elsewhere.</p>
<p>She waited frantically for the sounds of sleep to arise. If only she
knew whether he snored. At least she knew where the bunk was and she
could recognize the rolling protest of one when she heard it. There was
a long breath and then a yawn. She waited through a gathering silence,
punctuated by the bunk’s soft protest against a changed position or a
shifted leg.</p>
<p>The door of the luggage compartment opened easily at the pressure of
her finger, and her craning neck—</p>
<p>There was a definite human sound that broke off sharply.</p>
<p>Arcadia solidified. Silence! Still silence!</p>
<p>She tried to poke her eyes outside the door without moving her head
and failed. The head followed the eyes.</p>
<p>Homir Munn was awake, of course—reading in bed, bathed in the soft,
unspreading bed light, staring into the darkness with wide eyes, and
groping one hand stealthily under the pillow.</p>
<p>Arcadia’s head moved sharply back of itself. Then, the light went out
entirely and Munn’s voice said with shaky sharpness, “I’ve got a
blaster, and I’m shooting, by the Galaxy—”</p>
<p>And Arcadia wailed, “It’s only me. Don’t shoot.”</p>
<p>Remarkable what a fragile flower romance is. A blaster with a nervous
operator behind it can spoil the whole thing.</p>
<p>The light was back on—all over the ship—and Munn was sitting up in
bed. The somewhat grizzled hair on his thin chest and the sparse one-day
growth on his chin lent him an entirely fallacious appearance of
disreputability.</p>
<p>Arcadia stepped out, yanking at her metallene jacket which was
supposed to be guaranteed wrinkleproof.</p>
<p>After a wild moment in which he almost jumped out of bed, but
remembered, and instead yanked the sheet up to his shoulders, Munn
gargled, “W … wha … what—”</p>
<p>He was completely incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Arcadia said meekly, “Would you excuse me for a minute? I’ve got to
wash my hands.” She knew the geography of the vessel, and slipped away
quickly. When she returned, with her courage oozing back, Homir Munn was
standing before her with a faded bathrobe on the outside and a brilliant
fury on the inside.</p>
<p>“What the black holes of Space are you d … doing aboard this ship? H
… how did you get on here? What do you th … think I’m supposed to do
with you? What’s going on here?”</p>
<p>He might have asked questions indefinitely, but Arcadia interrupted
sweetly, “I just wanted to come along, Uncle Homir.”</p>
<p>“Why? I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to Kalgan for information about the Second
Foundation.”</p>
<p>And Munn let out a wild howl and collapsed completely. For one
horrified moment, Arcadia thought he would have hysterics or beat his
head against the wall. He was still holding the blaster and her stomach
grew ice-cold as she watched it.</p>
<p>“Watch out— Take it easy—” was all she could think of to say.</p>
<p>But he struggled back to relative normality and threw the blaster
onto the bunk with a force that should have set it off and blown a hole
through the ship’s hull.</p>
<p>“How did you get on?” he asked slowly, as though gripping each word
with his teeth very carefully to prevent it from trembling before
letting it out.</p>
<p>“It was easy. I just came into the hangar with my suitcase, and said,
‘Mr. Munn’s baggage!’ and the man in charge just waved his thumb without
even looking up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have to take you back, you know,” said Homir, and there was a
sudden wild glee within him at the thought. By Space, this wasn’t his
fault.</p>
<p>“You can’t,” said Arcadia, calmly, “it would attract attention.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You know. The whole purpose of your going to Kalgan was because it
was natural for you to go and ask for permission to look into the Mule’s
records. And you’ve got to be so natural that you’re to attract no
attention at all. If you go back with a girl stowaway, it might even get
into the tele-news reports.”</p>
<p>“Where did you g … get those notions about Kalgan? These … uh …
childish—” He was far too flippant for conviction, of course, even to
one who knew less than did Arcadia.</p>
<p>“I heard,” she couldn’t avoid pride completely, “with a
sound-recorder. I know all about it—so you’ve got to let me come
along.”</p>
<p>“What about your father?” He played a quick trump. “For all he knows,
you’re kidnapped … dead.”</p>
<p>“I left a note,” she said, overtrumping, “and he probably knows he
mustn’t make a fuss, or anything. You’ll probably get a spacegram from
him.”</p>
<p>To Munn the only explanation was sorcery, because the receiving
signal sounded wildly two seconds after she finished.</p>
<p>She said: “That’s my father, I bet,” and it was.</p>
<p>The message wasn’t long and it was addressed to Arcadia. It said:
“Thank you for your lovely present, which I’m sure you put to good use.
Have a good time.”</p>
<p>“You see,” she said, “that’s instructions.”</p>
<p>Homir grew used to her. After a while, he was glad she was there.
Eventually, he wondered how he would have made it without her. She
prattled! She was excited! Most of all, she was completely unconcerned.
She knew the Second Foundation was the enemy, yet it didn’t bother her.
She knew that on Kalgan, he was to deal with a hostile officialdom, but
she could hardly wait.</p>
<p>Maybe it came of being fourteen.</p>
<p>At any rate, the week-long trip now meant conversation rather than
introspection. To be sure, it wasn’t a very enlightening conversation,
since it concerned, almost entirely, the girl’s notions on the subject
of how best to treat the Lord of Kalgan. Amusing and nonsensical, and
yet delivered with weighty deliberation.</p>
<p>Homir found himself actually capable of smiling as he listened and
wondered out of just which gem of historical fiction she got her twisted
notion of the great universe.</p>
<p>It was the evening before the last jump. Kalgan was a bright star in
the scarcely-twinkling emptiness of the outer reaches of the Galaxy. The
ship’s telescope made it a sparkling blob of barely-perceptible
diameter.</p>
<p>Arcadia sat cross-legged in the good chair. She was wearing a pair of
slacks and a none-too-roomy shirt that belonged to Homir. Her own more
feminine wardrobe had been washed and ironed for the landing.</p>
<p>She said, “I’m going to write historical novels, you know.” She was
quite happy about the trip. Uncle Homir didn’t in the least mind
listening to her and it made conversation so much more pleasant when you
could talk to a really intelligent person who was serious about what you
said.</p>
<p>She continued: “I’ve read books and books about all the great men of
Foundation history. You know, like Seldon, Hardin, Mallow, Devers, and
all the rest. I’ve even read most of what you’ve written about the Mule,
except that it isn’t much fun to read those parts where the Foundation
loses. Wouldn’t you rather read a history where they skipped the silly,
tragic parts?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I would,” Munn assured her, gravely. “But it wouldn’t be a fair
history, would it, Arkady? You’d never get academic respect, unless you
give the whole story.”</p>
<p>“Oh, poof. Who cares about academic respect?” She found him
delightful. He hadn’t missed calling her Arkady for days. “My novels are
going to be interesting and are going to sell and be famous. What’s the
use of writing books unless you sell them and become well-known? I don’t
want just some old professors to know me. It’s got to be everybody.”</p>
<p>Her eyes darkened with pleasure at the thought and she wriggled into
a more comfortable position. “In fact, as soon as I can get father to
let me, I’m going to visit Trantor, so’s I can get background material
on the First Empire, you know. I was born on Trantor; did you know
that?”</p>
<p>He did, but he said, “You were?” and put just the right amount of
amazement into his voice. He was rewarded with something between a beam
and a simper.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. My grandmother … you know, Bayta Darell, you’ve heard of her
… was on Trantor once with my grandfather. In fact, that’s where they
stopped the Mule, when all the Galaxy was at his feet; and my father and
mother went there also when they were first married. I was born there. I
even lived there till mother died, only I was just three then, and I
don’t remember much about it. Were you ever on Trantor, Uncle
Homir?”</p>
<p>“No, can’t say I was.” He leaned back against the cold bulkhead and
listened idly. Kalgan was very close, and he felt his uneasiness
flooding back.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just the most romantic world? My father says that under
Stannel V, it had more people than any ten worlds nowadays. He says it
was just one big world of metals—one big city—that was the capital of
all the Galaxy. He’s shown me pictures that he took on Trantor. It’s all
in ruins now, but it’s still stupendous. I’d just love to see it again.
In fact … Homir!”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go there, when we’re finished with Kalgan?”</p>
<p>Some of the fright hurtled back into his face. “What? Now don’t start
on that. This is business, not pleasure. Remember that.”</p>
<p>“But it is business,” she squeaked. “There might be incredible
amounts of information on Trantor. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.” He scrambled to his feet. “Now untangle yourself from
the computer. We’ve got to make the last jump, and then you turn in.”
One good thing about landing, anyway; he was about fed up with trying to
sleep on an overcoat on the metal floor.</p>
<p>The calculations were not difficult. The “Space Route Handbook” was
quite explicit on the Foundation-Kalgan route. There was the momentary
twitch of the timeless passage through hyperspace and the final
light-year dropped away.</p>
<p>The sun of Kalgan was a sun now—large, bright, and yellow-white;
invisible behind the portholes that had automatically closed on the
sunlit side.</p>
<p>Kalgan was only a night’s sleep away.</p>
