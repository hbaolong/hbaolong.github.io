<h4 id="section">68</h4>
<p>The appliance store dealer’s mustache was clearly as lush as it had
been in his younger days, but it was grizzled now, even though the hair
on his head was still black. He touched the mustache out of sheer habit
as he gazed at Dors and brushed it back on each side.</p>
<p>He said, “You’re not a Dahlite.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I still want a knife.”</p>
<p>He said, “It’s against the law to sell knives.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I’m not a policewoman or a government agent of any sort.
I’m going to Billibotton.”</p>
<p>He stared at her thoughtfully. “Alone?”</p>
<p>“With my friend.” She jerked her thumb over her shoulder in the
direction of Seldon, who was waiting outside sullenly.</p>
<p>“You’re buying it for him?” He stared at Seldon and it didn’t take
him long to decide. “He’s an outsider too. Let him come in and buy it
for himself.”</p>
<p>“He’s not a government agent either. And I’m buying it for
myself.”</p>
<p>The dealer shook his head. “Outsiders are crazy. But if you want to
spend some credits, I’ll take them from you.” He reached under the
counter, brought out a stub, turned it with a slight and expert motion,
and the knife blade emerged.</p>
<p>“Is that the largest you have?”</p>
<p>“Best woman’s knife made.”</p>
<p>“Show me a man’s knife.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want one that’s too heavy. Do you know how to use one of
these things?”</p>
<p>“I’ll learn and I’m not worried about heavy. Show me a man’s
knife.”</p>
<p>The dealer smiled. “Well, if you want to see one—” He moved farther
down the counter and brought up a much fatter stub. He gave it a twist
and what appeared to be a butcher’s knife emerged.</p>
<p>He handed it to her, handle first, still smiling.</p>
<p>She said, “Show me that twist of yours.”</p>
<p>He showed her on a second knife, slowly twisting one way to make the
blade appear, then the other way to make it disappear. “Twist and
squeeze,” he said.</p>
<p>“Do it again, sir.”</p>
<p>The dealer obliged.</p>
<p>Dors said, “All right, close it and toss me the haft.”</p>
<p>He did, in a slow upward loop.</p>
<p>She caught it, handed it back, and said, “Faster.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows and then, without warning, backhanded it to
her left side. She made no attempt to bring over her right hand, but
caught it with her left and the blade showed tumescently at once—then
disappeared. The dealer’s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>“And this is the largest you have?” she said.</p>
<p>“It is. If you try to use it, it will just tire you out.”</p>
<p>“I’ll breathe deeply. I’ll take a second one too.”</p>
<p>“For your friend?”</p>
<p>“No. For me.”</p>
<p>“You plan on using two knives?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got two hands.”</p>
<p>The dealer sighed. “Mistress, please stay out of Billibotton. You
don’t know what they do to women there.”</p>
<p>“I can guess. How do I put these knives on my belt?”</p>
<p>“Not the one you’ve got on, Mistress. That’s not a knife belt. I can
sell you one, though.”</p>
<p>“Will it hold two knives?”</p>
<p>“I might have a double belt somewhere. Not much call for them.”</p>
<p>“I’m calling for them.”</p>
<p>“I may not have it in your size.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll cut it down or something.”</p>
<p>“It will cost you a lot of credits.”</p>
<p>“My credit tile will cover it.”</p>
<p>When she emerged at last, Seldon said sourly, “You look ridiculous
with that bulky belt.”</p>
<p>“Really, Hari? Too ridiculous to go with you to Billibotton? Then
let’s both go back to the apartment.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll go on by myself. I’ll be safer by myself.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “There is no use saying that, Hari. We both go back or we
both go forward. Under no circumstances do we separate.”</p>
<p>And somehow the firm look in her blue eyes, the set to her lips, and
the manner in which her hands had dropped to the hafts at her belt,
convinced Seldon she was serious.</p>
<p>“Very well,” he said, “but if you survive and if I ever see Hummin
again, my price for continuing to work on psychohistory—much as I have
grown fond of you—will be your removal. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>And suddenly Dors smiled. “Forget it. Don’t practice your chivalry on
me. Nothing will remove me. Do you understand?”</p>
