<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon sat back in his chair, the vertical back giving as he did
so and allowing him to assume a half-reclining position. His hands were
behind his head and his eyes were unfocused. His breathing was very
soft, indeed.</p>
<p>Dors Venabili was at the other end of the room, with her viewer
turned off and the microfilms back in place. She had been through a
rather concentrated period of revision of her opinions on the Florina
Incident in early Trantorian history and she found it rather restful to
withdraw for a few moments and to speculate on what it was that Seldon
was considering.</p>
<p>It had to be psychohistory. It would probably take him the rest of
his life, tracking down the byways of this semichaotic technique, and he
would end with it incomplete, leaving the task to others (to Amaryl, if
that young man had not also worn himself out on the matter) and breaking
his heart at the need to do that.</p>
<p>Yet it gave him a reason for living. He would live longer with the
problem filling him from end to end—and that pleased her. Someday she
would lose him, she knew, and she found that the thought afflicted her.
It had not seemed it would at the start, when her task had been the
simple one of protecting him for the sake of what he knew.</p>
<p>When had it become a matter of personal need? How could there be so
personal a need? What was there about the man that caused her to feel
uneasy when he was not in her sight, even when she knew he was safe so
that the deeply ingrained orders within her were not called into action?
His safety was all that she had been ordered to be concerned with. How
did the rest intrude itself?</p>
<p>She had spoken of it to Demerzel long before, when the feeling had
made itself unmistakable.</p>
<p>He had regarded her gravely and said, “You are complex, Dors, and
there are no simple answers. In my life there have been several
individuals whose presence made it easier for me to think, pleasanter to
make my responses. I have tried to judge the ease of my responses in
their presence and the unease of my responses in their final absence to
see whether I was the net gainer or loser. In the process, one thing
became plain. The pleasantness of their company outweighed the regret of
their passing. On the whole, then, it is better to experience what you
experience now than not to.”</p>
<p>She thought: Hari will someday leave a void, and each day that
someday is closer, and I must not think of it.</p>
<p>It was to rid herself of the thought that she finally interrupted
him. “What are you thinking of, Hari?”</p>
<p>“What?” Seldon focused his eyes with an apparent effort.</p>
<p>“Psychohistory, I assume. I imagine you’ve traced another blind
pathway.”</p>
<p>“Well now. That’s not on my mind at all.” He laughed suddenly. “Do
you want to know what I’m thinking of? —Hair!”</p>
<p>“Hair? Whose?”</p>
<p>“Right now, yours.” He was looking at her fondly.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with it? Should I dye it another color? Or
perhaps, after all these years, it should go gray.”</p>
<p>“Come! Who needs or wants gray in your hair. —But it’s led me to
other things. Nishaya, for instance.”</p>
<p>“Nishaya? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It was never part of the pre-Imperial Kingdom of Trantor, so I’m not
surprised you haven’t heard of it. It’s a world, a small one. Isolated.
Unimportant. Overlooked. I only know anything at all about it because
I’ve taken the trouble to look it up. Very few worlds out of twenty-five
million can really make much of a sustained splash, but I doubt that
there’s another one as insignificant as Nishaya. Which is very
significant, you see.”</p>
<p>Dors shoved her reference material to one side and said, “What is
this new penchant you have for paradox, which you always tell me you
detest? What is this significance of insignificance?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t mind paradoxes when I perpetrate them. You see, Joranum
comes from Nishaya.”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s Joranum you’re concerned with.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve been viewing some of his speeches—at Raych’s insistence.
They don’t make very much sense, but the total effect can be almost
hypnotic. Raych is very impressed by him.”</p>
<p>“I imagine that anyone of Dahlite origins would be, Hari. Joranum’s
constant call for sector equality would naturally appeal to the
downtrodden heatsinkers. You remember when we were in Dahl?”</p>
<p>“I remember it very well and of course I don’t blame the lad. It just
bothers me that Joranum comes from Nishaya.”</p>
<p>Dors shrugged. “Well, Joranum has to come from somewhere and,
conversely, Nishaya, like any other world, must send its people out at
times, even to Trantor.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but, as I’ve said, I’ve taken the trouble to investigate
Nishaya. I’ve even managed to make hyperspatial contact with some minor
official—which cost a considerable quantity of credits that I cannot, in
good conscience, charge to the department.”</p>
<p>“And did you find anything that was worth the credits?”</p>
<p>“I rather think so. You know, Joranum is always telling little
stories to make his points, stories that are legends on his home planet
of Nishaya. That serves a good purpose for him here on Trantor, since it
makes him appear to be a man of the people, full of homespun philosophy.
Those tales litter his speeches. They make him appear to be from a small
world, to have been brought up on an isolated farm surrounded by an
untamed ecology. People like it, especially Trantorians, who would
rather die than be trapped somewhere in an untamed ecology but who love
to dream about one just the same.”</p>
<p>“But what of it all?”</p>
<p>“The odd point is that not one of the stories was familiar to the
person I spoke to on Nishaya.”</p>
<p>“That’s not significant, Hari. It may be a small world, but it’s a
world. What is current in Joranum’s birth section of the world may not
be current in whatever place your official came from.”</p>
<p>“No no. Folktales, in one form or another, are usually worldwide. But
aside from that, I had considerable trouble in understanding the fellow.
He spoke Galactic Standard with a thick accent. I spoke to a few others
on the world, just to check, and they all had the same accent.”</p>
<p>“And what of that?”</p>
<p>“Joranum doesn’t have it. He speaks a fairly good Trantorian. It’s a
lot better than mine, actually. I have the Heliconian stress on the
letter ‘r.’ He doesn’t. According to the records, he arrived on Trantor
when he was nineteen. It is just impossible, in my opinion, to spend the
first nineteen years of your life speaking that barbarous Nishayan
version of Galactic Standard and then come to Trantor and lose it.
However long he’s been here, some trace of the accent would have
remained—Look at Raych and the way he lapses into his Dahlite way of
speaking on occasion.”</p>
<p>“What do you deduce from all this?”</p>
<p>“What I deduce—what I’ve been sitting here all evening, deducing like
a deduction machine—is that Joranum didn’t come from Nishaya at all. In
fact, I think he picked Nishaya as the place to pretend to come from,
simply because it is so backwoodsy, so out-of-the-way, that no one would
think of checking it. He must have made a thorough computer search to
find the one world least likely to allow him to be caught in a lie.”</p>
<p>“But that’s ridiculous, Hari. Why should he want to pretend to be
from a world he did not come from? It would mean a great deal of
falsification of records.”</p>
<p>“And that’s precisely what he has probably done. He probably has
enough followers in the civil service to make that possible. Probably no
one person has done as much in the way of revision and all of his
followers are too fanatical to talk about it.”</p>
<p>“But still— Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I suspect Joranum doesn’t want people to know where he
really comes from.”</p>
<p>“Why not? All worlds in the Empire are equal, both by laws and by
custom.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that. These high-ideal theories are somehow never
borne out in real life.”</p>
<p>“Then where does he come from? Do you have any idea at all?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Which brings us back to this matter of hair.”</p>
<p>“What about hair?”</p>
<p>“I sat there with Joranum, staring at him and feeling uneasy, without
knowing why I was feeling uneasy. Then finally I realized that it was
his hair that made me uneasy. There was something about it, a life, a
gloss … a perfection to it that I’ve never seen before. And then I knew.
His hair is artificial and carefully grown on a scalp that ought to be
innocent of such things.”</p>
<p>“Ought to be?” Dors’s eyes narrowed. It was clear that she suddenly
understood. “Do you mean—”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do mean. He’s from the past-centered, mythology-ridden
Mycogen Sector of Trantor. That’s what he’s been laboring to hide.”</p>
