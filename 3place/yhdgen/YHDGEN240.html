<h4 id="section">8</h4>
<p>Raych looked at Hari Seldon after the two politicians had gone and
fingered his mustache. It gave him satisfaction to stroke it. Here in
the Streeling Sector, some men wore mustaches, but they were usually
thin despicable things of uncertain color—thin despicable things, even
if dark. Most men did not wear them at all and suffered with naked upper
lips. Seldon didn’t, for instance, and that was just as well. With his
color of hair, a mustache would have been a travesty.</p>
<p>He watched Seldon closely, waiting for him to cease being lost in
thought, and then found he could wait no longer.</p>
<p>“Dad!” he said.</p>
<p>Seldon looked up and said, “What?” He sounded a little annoyed at
having his thoughts interrupted, Raych decided.</p>
<p>Raych said, “I don’t think it was right for you to see those two
guys.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Why not?”</p>
<p>“Well, the thin guy, whatever his name is, was the guy you made
trouble for at the Field. He can’t have liked it.”</p>
<p>“But he apologized.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t mean it. But the other guy, Joranum—he can be dangerous.
What if they had had weapons?”</p>
<p>“What? Here in the University? In my office? Of course not. This
isn’t Billibotton. Besides, if they had tried anything, I could have
handled both of them together. Easily.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Dad,” said Raych dubiously. “You’re getting—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it, you ungrateful monster,” said Seldon, lifting an
admonishing finger. “You’ll sound just like your mother and I have
enough of that from her. I am not getting old—or, at least, not that
old. Besides, you were with me and you’re almost as skilled a Twister as
I am.”</p>
<p>Raych’s nose wrinkled. “Twisting ain’t much good.” (It was no use.
Raych heard himself speak and knew that, even eight years out of the
morass of Dahl, he still slipped into using the Dahlite accent that
marked him firmly as a member of the lower class. And he was short, too,
to the point where he sometimes felt stunted. —But he had his mustache
and no one ever patronized him twice.)</p>
<p>He said, “What are you going to do about Joranum?”</p>
<p>“For now, nothing.”</p>
<p>“Well, look, Dad, I saw Joranum on TrantorVision a couple of times. I
even made some holotapes of his speeches. —Everyone is talking about
him, so I thought I would see what he has to say. And, you know, he
makes some kind of sense. I don’t like him and I don’t trust him, but he
does make some kind of sense. He wants all sectors to have equal rights
and equal opportunities—and there ain’t nothing wrong with that, is
there?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not. All civilized people feel that way.”</p>
<p>“So why don’t we have that sort of stuff? Does the Emperor feel that
way? Does Demerzel?”</p>
<p>“The Emperor and the First Minister have an entire Empire to worry
about. They can’t concentrate all their efforts on Trantor itself. It’s
easy for Joranum to talk about equality. He has no responsibilities. If
he were in the position to rule, he would find that his efforts would be
greatly diluted by an Empire of twenty-five million planets. Not only
that, but he would find himself stopped at every point by the sectors
themselves. Each one wants a great deal of equality for itself—but not
much equality for others. Tell me, Raych, are you of the opinion that
Joranum ought to have a chance to rule, just to show what he can
do?”</p>
<p>Raych shrugged. “I don’t know. I wonder. —But if he had tried
anything on you, I would have been at his throat before he could move
two centimeters.”</p>
<p>“Your loyalty to me, then, exceeds your concern for the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Sure. You’re my dad.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked at Raych fondly, but behind that look he felt a trace
of uncertainty. How far could Joranum’s nearly hypnotic influence
go?</p>
