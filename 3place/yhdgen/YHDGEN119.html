<p>TOWARD COMPORELLON</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It was raining lightly. Trevize looked up at the sky, which was a
solid grayish white.</p>
<p>He was wearing a rain hat that repelled the drops and sent them
flying well away from his body in all directions. Pelorat, standing out
of range of the flying drops, had no such protection.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I don’t see the point of your letting yourself get
wet, Janov.”</p>
<p>“The wet doesn’t bother me, my dear chap,” said Pelorat, looking as
solemn as he always did. “It’s a light and warm rain. There’s no wind to
speak of. And besides, to quote the old saying: ‘In Anacreon, do as the
Anacreonians do.’” He indicated the few Gaians standing near the Far
Star, watching quietly. They were well scattered, as though they were
trees in a Gaian grove, and none wore rain hats.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” said Trevize, “they don’t mind being wet, because all
the rest of Gaia is getting wet. The trees—the grass—the soil—all wet,
and all equally part of Gaia, along with the Gaians.”</p>
<p>“I think it makes sense,” said Pelorat. “The sun will come out soon
enough and everything will dry quickly. The clothing won’t wrinkle or
shrink, there’s no chilling effect, and, since there aren’t any
unnecessary pathogenic microorganisms, no one will get colds, or flu, or
pneumonia. Why worry about a bit of damp then?”</p>
<p>Trevize had no trouble in seeing the logic of that, but he hated to
let go of his grievance. He said, “Still, there is no need for it to
rain as we are leaving. After all, the rain is voluntary. Gaia wouldn’t
rain if it didn’t want to. It’s almost as though it were showing its
contempt for us.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps”—and Pelorat’s lip twitched a bit—“Gaia is weeping with
sorrow at our leaving.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “That may be, but I’m not.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Pelorat went on, “I presume that the soil in this region
needs a wetting down, and that need is more important than your desire
to have the sun shine.”</p>
<p>Trevize smiled. “I suspect you really like this world, don’t you?
Even aside from Bliss, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” said Pelorat, a trace defensively. “I’ve always led a
quiet, orderly life, and think how I could manage here, with a whole
world laboring to keep it quiet and orderly. —After all, Golan, when we
build a house—or that ship—we try to create a perfect shelter. We equip
it with everything we need; we arrange to have its temperature, air
quality, illumination, and everything else of importance, controlled by
us and manipulated in a way to make it perfectly accommodating to us.
Gaia is just an extension of the desire for comfort and security
extended to an entire planet. What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that,” said Trevize, “is that my house or my ship
is engineered to suit me. I am not engineered to suit it. If I were part
of Gaia, then no matter how ideally the planet was devised to suit me, I
would be greatly disturbed over the fact that I was also being devised
to suit it.”</p>
<p>Pelorat pursed his lips. “One could argue that every society molds
its population to fit itself. Customs develop that make sense within the
society, and that chain every individual firmly to its needs.”</p>
<p>“In the societies I know, one can revolt. There are eccentrics, even
criminals.”</p>
<p>“Do you want eccentrics and criminals?”</p>
<p>“Why not? You and I are eccentrics. We’re certainly not typical of
the people living on Terminus. As for criminals, that’s a matter of
definition. And if criminals are the price we must pay for rebels,
heretics, and geniuses, I’m willing to pay it. I demand the price be
paid.”</p>
<p>“Are criminals the only possible payment? Can’t you have genius
without criminals?”</p>
<p>“You can’t have geniuses and saints without having people far outside
the norm, and I don’t see how you can have such things on only one side
of the norm. There is bound to be a certain symmetry. —In any case, I
want a better reason for my decision to make Gaia the model for the
future of humanity than that it is a planetary version of a comfortable
house.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear fellow. I wasn’t trying to argue you into being
satisfied with your decision. I was just making an observa—”</p>
<p>He broke off. Bliss was striding toward them, her dark hair wet and
her robe clinging to her body and emphasizing the rather generous width
of her hips. She was nodding to them as she came.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I delayed you,” she said, panting a little. “It took
longer to check with Dom than I had anticipated.”</p>
<p>“Surely,” said Trevize, “you know everything he knows.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s a matter of a difference in interpretation. We are
not identical, after all, so we discuss. Look here,” she said, with a
touch of asperity, “you have two hands. They are each part of you, and
they seem identical except for one being the mirror-image of the other.
Yet you do not use them entirely alike, do you? There are some things
you do with your right hand most of the time, and some with your left.
Differences in interpretation, so to speak.”</p>
<p>“She’s got you,” said Pelorat, with obvious satisfaction.</p>
<p>Trevize nodded. “It’s an effective analogy, if it were relevant, and
I’m not at all sure it is. In any case, does this mean we can board the
ship now? It is raining.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Our people are all off it, and it’s in perfect shape.”
Then, with a sudden curious look at Trevize, “You’re keeping dry. The
raindrops are missing you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Trevize. “I am avoiding wetness.”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t it feel good to be wet now and then?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. But at my choice, not the rain’s.”</p>
<p>Bliss shrugged. “Well, as you please. All our baggage is loaded so
let’s board.”</p>
<p>The three walked toward the Far Star. The rain was growing still
lighter, but the grass was quite wet. Trevize found himself walking
gingerly, but Bliss had kicked off her slippers, which she was now
carrying in one hand, and was slogging through the grass barefoot.</p>
<p>“It feels delightful,” she said, in response to Trevize’s downward
glance.</p>
<p>“Good,” he said absently. Then, with a touch of irritation, “Why are
those other Gaians standing about, anyway?”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “They’re recording this event, which Gaia finds
momentous. You are important to us, Trevize. Consider that if you should
change your mind as a result of this trip and decide against us, we
would never grow into Galaxia, or even remain as Gaia.”</p>
<p>“Then I represent life and death for Gaia; for the whole world.”</p>
<p>“We believe so.”</p>
<p>Trevize stopped suddenly, and took off his rain hat. Blue patches
were appearing in the sky. He said, “But you have my vote in your favor
now. If you kill me, I’ll never be able to change it.”</p>
<p>“Golan,” murmured Pelorat, shocked. “That is a terrible thing to
say.”</p>
<p>“Typical of an Isolate,” said Bliss calmly. “You must understand,
Trevize, that we are not interested in you as a person, or even in your
vote, but in the truth, in the facts of the matter. You are only
important as a conduit to the truth, and your vote as an indication of
the truth. That is what we want from you, and if we kill you to avoid a
change in your vote, we would merely be hiding the truth from
ourselves.”</p>
<p>“If I tell you the truth is non-Gaia, will you all then cheerfully
agree to die?”</p>
<p>“Not entirely cheerfully, perhaps, but it’s what it would amount to
in the end.”</p>
<p>Trevize shook his head. “If anything ought to convince me that Gaia
is a horror and should die, it might be that very statement you’ve just
made.” Then he said, his eyes returning to the patiently watching (and,
presumably, listening) Gaians, “Why are they spread out like that? And
why do you need so many? If one of them observes this event and stores
it in his or her memory, isn’t it available to all the rest of the
planet? Can’t it be stored in a million different places if you want it
to be?”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “They are observing this each from a different angle, and
each is storing it in a slightly different brain. When all the
observations are studied, it will be seen that what is taking place will
be far better understood from all the observations together than from
any one of them, taken singly.”</p>
<p>“The whole is greater than the sum of the parts, in other words.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. You have grasped the basic justification of Gaia’s
existence. You, as a human individual, are composed of perhaps fifty
trillion cells, but you, as a multicellular individual, are far more
important than those fifty trillion as the sum of their individual
importance. Surely you would agree with that.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize. “I agree with that.”</p>
<p>He stepped into the ship, and turned briefly for one more look at
Gaia. The brief rain had lent a new freshness to the atmosphere. He saw
a green, lush, quiet, peaceful world; a garden of serenity set amid the
turbulence of the weary Galaxy.</p>
<p>—And Trevize earnestly hoped he would never see it again.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>When the airlock closed behind them, Trevize felt as though he had
shut out not exactly a nightmare, but something so seriously abnormal
that it had prevented him from breathing freely.</p>
<p>He was fully aware that an element of that abnormality was still with
him in the person of Bliss. While she was there, Gaia was there—and yet
he was also convinced that her presence was essential. It was the black
box working again, and earnestly he hoped he would never begin believing
in that black box too much.</p>
<p>He looked about the vessel and found it beautiful. It had been his
only since Mayor Harla Branno of the Foundation had forced him into it
and sent him out among the stars—a living lightning rod designed to draw
the fire of those she considered enemies of the Foundation. That task
was done but the ship was still his, and he had no plans to return
it.</p>
<p>It had been his for merely a matter of a few months, but it seemed
like home to him and he could only dimly remember what had once been his
home in Terminus.</p>
<p>Terminus! The off-center hub of the Foundation, destined, by Seldon’s
Plan, to form a second and greater Empire in the course of the next five
centuries, except that he, Trevize, had now derailed it. By his own
decision he was converting the Foundation to nothing, and was making
possible instead, a new society, a new scheme of life, a frightening
revolution that would be greater than any since the development of
multicellular life.</p>
<p>Now he was engaged in a journey designed to prove to himself (or to
disprove) that what he had done was right.</p>
<p>He found himself lost in thought and motionless, so that he shook
himself in self-irritation. He hastened to the pilot-room and found his
computer still there.</p>
<p>It glistened; everything glistened. There had been a most careful
cleaning. The contacts he closed, nearly at random, worked perfectly,
and, it surely seemed, with greater ease than ever. The ventilating
system was so noiseless that he had to put his hand over the vents to
make sure he felt air currents.</p>
<p>The circle of light on the computer glowed invitingly. Trevize
touched it and the light spread out to cover the desk top and the
outline of a right and left hand appeared on it. He drew a deep breath
and realized that he had stopped breathing for a while. The Gaians knew
nothing about Foundation technology and they might easily have damaged
the computer without meaning any malice. Thus far they had not—the hands
were still there.</p>
<p>The crucial test came with the laying on of his own hands, however,
and, for a moment, he hesitated. He would know, almost at once, if
anything were wrong—but if something was, what could he do? For repairs,
he would have to go back to Terminus, and if he did, he felt quite
confident that Mayor Branno would not let him leave again. And if he did
not—</p>
<p>He could feel his heart pounding, and there was clearly no point in
deliberately lengthening the suspense.</p>
<p>He thrust his hands out, right, left, and placed them on the outlines
upon the desk. At once, he had the illusion of another pair of hands
holding his. His senses extended, and he could see Gaia in all
directions, green and moist, the Gaians still watching. When he willed
himself to look upward, he saw a largely cloudy sky. Again, at his will,
the clouds vanished and he looked at an unbroken blue sky with the orb
of Gaia’s sun filtered out.</p>
<p>Again he willed and the blue parted and he saw the stars.</p>
<p>He wiped them out, and willed and saw the Galaxy, like a
foreshortened pinwheel. He tested the computerized image, adjusting its
orientation, altering the apparent progress of time, making it spin
first in one direction, then the other. He located the sun of Sayshell,
the nearest important star to Gaia; then the sun of Terminus; then of
Trantor; one after the other. He traveled from star to star in the
Galactic map that dwelt in the bowels of the computer.</p>
<p>Then he withdrew his hands and let the world of reality surround him
again—and realized he had been standing all this time, half-bowing over
the computer to make the hand contact. He felt stiff and had to stretch
his back muscles before sitting down.</p>
<p>He stared at the computer with warm relief. It had worked perfectly.
It had been, if anything, more responsive, and what he felt for it he
could only describe as love. After all, while he held its hands (he
resolutely refused to admit to himself that he thought of it as her
hands) they were part of each other, and his will directed, controlled,
experienced, and was part of a greater self. He and it must feel, in a
small way (he suddenly, and disturbingly, thought), what Gaia did in a
much larger way.</p>
<p>He shook his head. No! In the case of the computer and himself, it
was he—Trevize—who was in entire control. The computer was a thing of
total submission.</p>
<p>He rose and moved out to the compact galley and dining area. There
was plenty of food of all kinds, with proper refrigeration and
easy-heating facilities. He had already noted that the book-films in his
room were in the proper order, and he was reasonably sure—no, completely
sure—that Pelorat had his personal library in safe storage. He would
otherwise surely have heard from him by now.</p>
<p>Pelorat! That reminded him. He stepped into Pelorat’s room. “Is there
room for Bliss here, Janov?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, quite.”</p>
<p>“I can convert the common room into her bedroom.”</p>
<p>Bliss looked up, wide-eyed. “I have no desire for a separate bedroom.
I am quite content to stay here with Pel. I suppose, though, that I may
use the other rooms when needed. The gym, for instance.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Any room but mine.”</p>
<p>“Good. That’s what I would have suggested be the arrangement, if I
had had the making of it. Naturally, you will stay out of ours.”</p>
<p>“Naturally,” said Trevize, looking down and realizing that his shoes
overlapped the threshold. He took a half-step backward and said grimly,
“These are not honeymoon quarters, Bliss.”</p>
<p>“I should say, in view of its compactness, that it is exactly that
even though Gaia extended it to half again as wide as it was.”</p>
<p>Trevize tried not to smile. “You’ll have to be very friendly.”</p>
<p>“We are,” said Pelorat, clearly ill at ease at the topic of
conversation, “but really, old chap, you can leave it to us to make our
own arrangements.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I can’t,” said Trevize slowly. “I still want to make it
clear that these are not honeymoon accommodations. I have no objection
to anything you do by mutual consent, but you must realize that you will
have no privacy. I hope you understand that, Bliss.”</p>
<p>“There is a door,” said Bliss, “and I imagine you will not disturb us
when it is locked—short of a real emergency, that is.”</p>
<p>“Of course I won’t. However, there is no soundproofing.”</p>
<p>“What you are trying to say, Trevize,” said Bliss, “is that you will
hear, quite clearly, any conversation we may have, and any sounds we may
make in the course of sex.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is what I am trying to say. With that in mind, I expect
you may find you will have to limit your activities here. This may
discommode you, and I’m sorry, but that’s the situation as it is.”</p>
<p>Pelorat cleared his throat, and said gently, “Actually, Golan, this
is a problem I’ve already had to face. You realize that any sensation
Bliss experiences, when together with me, is experienced by all of
Gaia.”</p>
<p>“I have thought of that, Janov,” said Trevize, looking as though he
were repressing a wince. “I didn’t intend to mention it—just in case the
thought had not occurred to you.”</p>
<p>“But it did, I’m afraid,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Don’t make too much of that, Trevize. At any given
moment, there may be thousands of human beings on Gaia who are engaged
in sex; millions who are eating, drinking, or engaged in other
pleasure-giving activities. This gives rise to a general aura of delight
that Gaia feels, every part of it. The lower animals, the plants, the
minerals have their progressively milder pleasures that also contribute
to a generalized joy of consciousness that Gaia feels in all its parts
always, and that is unfelt in any other world.”</p>
<p>“We have our own particular joys,” said Trevize, “which we can share
after a fashion, if we wish; or keep private, if we wish.”</p>
<p>“If you could feel ours, you would know how poverty-stricken you
Isolates are in that respect.”</p>
<p>“How can you know what we feel?”</p>
<p>“Without knowing how you feel, it is still reasonable to suppose that
a world of common pleasures must be more intense than those available to
a single isolated individual.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but even if my pleasures were poverty-stricken, I would
keep my own joys and sorrows and be satisfied with them, thin as they
are, and be me and not blood brother to the nearest rock.”</p>
<p>“Don’t sneer,” said Bliss. “You value every mineral crystal in your
bones and teeth and would not have one of them damaged, though they have
no more consciousness than the average rock crystal of the same
size.”</p>
<p>“That’s true enough,” said Trevize reluctantly, “but we’ve managed to
get off the subject. I don’t care if all Gaia shares your joy, Bliss,
but I don’t want to share it. We’re living here in close quarters and I
do not wish to be forced to participate in your activities even
indirectly.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “This is an argument over nothing, my dear chap. I am
no more anxious than you to have your privacy violated. Nor mine, for
that matter. Bliss and I will be discreet; won’t we, Bliss?”</p>
<p>“It will be as you wish, Pel.”</p>
<p>“After all,” said Pelorat, “we are quite likely to be planet-bound
for considerably longer periods than we will space-borne, and on
planets, the opportunities for true privacy—”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what you do on planets,” interrupted Trevize, “but on
this ship, I am master.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>“Then, with that straightened out, it is time to take off.”</p>
<p>“But wait.” Pelorat reached out to tug at Trevize’s sleeve. “Take off
for where? You don’t know where Earth is, nor do I, nor does Bliss. Nor
does your computer, for you told me long ago that it lacks any
information on Earth. What do you intend doing, then? You can’t simply
drift through space at random, my dear chap.”</p>
<p>At that, Trevize smiled with what was almost joy. For the first time
since he had fallen into the grip of Gaia, he felt master of his own
fate.</p>
<p>“I assure you,” he said, “that it is not my intention to drift,
Janov. I know exactly where I am going.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Pelorat walked quietly into the pilot-room after he had waited long
moments while his small tap on the door had gone unanswered. He found
Trevize looking with keen absorption at the starfield.</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Golan—” and waited.</p>
<p>Trevize looked up. “Janov! Sit down. —Where’s Bliss?”</p>
<p>“Sleeping. —We’re out in space, I see.”</p>
<p>“You see correctly.” Trevize was not surprised at the other’s mild
surprise. In the new gravitic ships, there was simply no way of
detecting takeoff. There were no inertial effects; no accelerational
push; no noise; no vibration.</p>
<p>Possessing the capacity to insulate itself from outside gravitational
fields to any degree up to total, the Far Star lifted from a planetary
surface as though it were floating on some cosmic sea. And while it did
so, the gravitational effect within the ship, paradoxically, remained
normal.</p>
<p>While the ship was within the atmosphere, of course, there was no
need to accelerate so that the whine and vibration of rapidly passing
air would be absent. As the atmosphere was left behind, however,
acceleration could take place, and at rapid rates, without affecting the
passengers.</p>
<p>It was the ultimate in comfort and Trevize did not see how it could
be improved upon until such time as human beings discovered a way of
whisking through hyperspace without ships, and without concern about
nearby gravitational fields that might be too intense. Right now, the
Far Star would have to speed away from Gaia’s sun for several days
before the gravitational intensity was weak enough to attempt the
Jump.</p>
<p>“Golan, my dear fellow,” said Pelorat. “May I speak with you for a
moment or two? You are not too busy?”</p>
<p>“Not at all busy. The computer handles everything once I instruct it
properly. And sometimes it seems to guess what my instructions will be,
and satisfies them almost before I can articulate them.” Trevize brushed
the top of the desk lovingly.</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “We’ve grown very friendly, Golan, in the short time
we’ve known each other, although I must admit that it scarcely seems a
short time to me. So much has happened. It’s really peculiar when I stop
to think of my moderately long life, that half of all the events I have
experienced were squeezed into the last few months. Or so it would seem.
I could almost suppose—”</p>
<p>Trevize held up a hand. “Janov, you’re spinning outward from your
original point, I’m sure. You began by saying we’ve grown very friendly
in a very short time. Yes, we have, and we still are. For that matter,
you’ve known Bliss an even shorter time and have grown even
friendlier.”</p>
<p>“That’s different, of course,” said Pelorat, clearing his throat in
some embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Trevize, “but what follows from our brief but
enduring friendship?”</p>
<p>“If, my dear fellow, we still are friends, as you’ve just said, then
I must pass on to Bliss, whom, as you’ve also just said, is peculiarly
dear to me.”</p>
<p>“I understand. And what of that?”</p>
<p>“I know, Golan, that you are not fond of Bliss, but for my sake, I
wish—”</p>
<p>Trevize raised a hand. “One moment, Janov. I am not overwhelmed by
Bliss, but neither is she an object of hatred to me. Actually, I have no
animosity toward her at all. She’s an attractive young woman and, even
if she weren’t, then, for your sake, I would be prepared to find her so.
It’s Gaia I dislike.”</p>
<p>“But Bliss is Gaia.”</p>
<p>“I know, Janov. That’s what complicates things so. As long as I think
of Bliss as a person, there’s no problem. If I think of her as Gaia,
there is.”</p>
<p>“But you haven’t given Gaia a chance, Golan. —Look, old chap, let me
admit something. When Bliss and I are intimate, she sometimes lets me
share her mind for a minute or so. Not for more than that because she
says I’m too old to adapt to it. —Oh, don’t grin, Golan, you would be
too old for it, too. If an Isolate, such as you or I, were to remain
part of Gaia for more than a minute or two, there might be brain damage
and if it’s as much as five or ten minutes, it would be irreversible.
—If you could only experience it, Golan.”</p>
<p>“What? Irreversible brain damage? No, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Golan, you’re deliberately misunderstanding me. I mean, just that
small moment of union. You don’t know what you’re missing. It’s
indescribable. Bliss says there’s a sense of joy. That’s like saying
there’s a sense of joy when you finally drink a bit of water after you
have all but died of thirst. I couldn’t even begin to tell you what it’s
like. You share all the pleasures that a billion people separately
experience. It isn’t a steady joy; if it were you would quickly stop
feeling it. It vibrates—twinkles—has a strange pulsing rhythm that
doesn’t let you go. It’s more joy—no, not more—it’s a better joy than
you could ever experience separately. I could weep when she shuts the
door on me—”</p>
<p>Trevize shook his head. “You are amazingly eloquent, my good friend,
but you sound very much as though you’re describing pseudendorphin
addiction, or that of some other drug that admits you to joy in the
short term at the price of leaving you permanently in horror in the long
term. Not for me! I am reluctant to sell my individuality for some brief
feeling of joy.”</p>
<p>“I still have my individuality, Golan.”</p>
<p>“But for how long will you have it if you keep it up, Janov? You’ll
beg for more and more of your drug until, eventually, your brain will be
damaged. Janov, you mustn’t let Bliss do this to you. —Perhaps I had
better speak to her about it.”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t! You’re not the soul of tact, you know, and I don’t want
her hurt. I assure you she takes better care of me in that respect than
you can imagine. She’s more concerned with the possibility of brain
damage than I am. You can be sure of that.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, I’ll speak to you. Janov, don’t do this anymore. You’ve
lived for fifty-two years with your own kind of pleasure and joy, and
your brain is adapted to withstanding that. Don’t be snapped up by a new
and unusual vice. There is a price for it; if not immediately, then
eventually.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Golan,” said Pelorat in a low voice, looking down at the tips
of his shoes. Then he said, “Suppose you look at it this way. What if
you were a one-celled creature—”</p>
<p>“I know what you’re going to say, Janov. Forget it. Bliss and I have
already referred to that analogy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but think a moment. Suppose we imagine single-celled organisms
with a human level of consciousness and with the power of thought and
imagine them faced with the possibility of becoming a multicellular
organism. Would not the single-celled organisms mourn their loss of
individuality, and bitterly resent their forthcoming enforced
regimentation into the personality of an overall organism? And would
they not be wrong? Could an individual cell even imagine the power of
the human brain?”</p>
<p>Trevize shook his head violently. “No, Janov, it’s a false analogy.
Single-celled organisms don’t have consciousness or any power of
thought—or if they do it is so infinitesimal it might as well be
considered zero. For such objects to combine and lose individuality is
to lose something they have never really had. A human being, however, is
conscious and does have the power of thought. He has an actual
consciousness and an actual independent intelligence to lose, so the
analogy fails.”</p>
<p>There was silence between the two of them for a moment; an almost
oppressive silence; and finally Pelorat, attempting to wrench the
conversation in a new direction, said, “Why do you stare at the
view-screen?”</p>
<p>“Habit,” said Trevize, smiling wryly. “The computer tells me that
there are no Gaian ships following me and that there are no Sayshellian
fleets coming to meet me. Still I look anxiously, comforted by my own
failure to see such ships, when the computer’s sensors are hundreds of
times keener and more piercing than my eyes. What’s more, the computer
is capable of sensing some properties of space very delicately,
properties that my senses can’t perceive under any conditions. —Knowing
all that, I still stare.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Golan, if we are indeed friends—”</p>
<p>“I promise you I will do nothing to grieve Bliss; at least, nothing I
can help.”</p>
<p>“It’s another matter now. You keep your destination from me, as
though you don’t trust me with it. Where are we going? Are you of the
opinion you know where Earth is?”</p>
<p>Trevize looked up, eyebrows lifted. “I’m sorry. I have been hugging
the secret to my own bosom, haven’t I?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but why?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Why, indeed. I wonder, my friend, if it isn’t a matter
of Bliss.”</p>
<p>“Bliss? Is it that you don’t want her to know. Really, old fellow,
she is completely to be trusted.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that. What’s the use of not trusting her? I suspect she can
tweak any secret out of my mind if she wishes to. I think I have a more
childish reason than that. I have the feeling that you are paying
attention only to her and that I no longer really exist.”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked horrified. “But that’s not true, Golan.”</p>
<p>“I know, but I’m trying to analyze my own feelings. You came to me
just now with fears for our friendship, and thinking about it, I feel as
though I’ve had the same fears. I haven’t openly admitted it to myself,
but I think I have felt cut out by Bliss. Perhaps I seek to ‘get even’
by petulantly keeping things from you. Childish, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Golan!”</p>
<p>“I said it was childish, didn’t I? But where is the person who isn’t
childish now and then? However, we are friends. We’ve settled that and
therefore I will play no further games. We’re going to Comporellon.”</p>
<p>“Comporellon?” said Pelorat, for the moment not remembering.</p>
<p>“Surely you recall my friend, the traitor, Munn Li Compor. We three
met on Sayshell.”</p>
<p>Pelorat’s face assumed a visible expression of enlightenment. “Of
course I remember. Comporellon was the world of his ancestors.”</p>
<p>“If it was. I don’t necessarily believe anything Compor said. But
Comporellon is a known world, and Compor said that its inhabitants knew
of Earth. Well, then, we’ll go there and find out. It may lead to
nothing but it’s the only starting point we have.”</p>
<p>Pelorat cleared his throat and looked dubious. “Oh, my dear fellow,
are you sure?”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing about which to be either sure or not sure. We have
one starting point and, however feeble it might be, we have no choice
but to follow it up.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but if we’re doing it on the basis of what Compor told us, then
perhaps we ought to consider everything he told us. I seem to remember
that he told us, most emphatically, that Earth did not exist as a living
planet—that its surface was radioactive and that it was utterly
lifeless. And if that is so, then we are going to Comporellon for
nothing.”</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The three were lunching in the dining room, virtually filling it as
they did so.</p>
<p>“This is very good,” said Pelorat, with considerable satisfaction.
“Is this part of our original Terminus supply?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” said Trevize. “That’s long gone. This is part of
the supplies we bought on Sayshell, before we headed out toward Gaia.
Unusual, isn’t it? Some sort of seafood, but rather crunchy. As for this
stuff—I was under the impression it was cabbage when I bought it, but it
doesn’t taste anything like it.”</p>
<p>Bliss listened but said nothing. She picked at the food on her own
plate gingerly.</p>
<p>Pelorat said gently, “You’ve got to eat, dear.”</p>
<p>“I know, Pel, and I’m eating.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, with a touch of impatience he couldn’t quite suppress,
“We do have Gaian food, Bliss.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Bliss, “but I would rather conserve that. We don’t
know how long we will be out in space and eventually I must learn to eat
Isolate food.”</p>
<p>“Is that so bad? Or must Gaia eat only Gaia.”</p>
<p>Bliss sighed. “Actually, there’s a saying of ours that goes: ‘When
Gaia eats Gaia, there is neither loss nor gain.’ It is no more than a
transfer of consciousness up and down the scale. Whatever I eat on Gaia
is Gaia and when much of it is metabolized and becomes me, it is still
Gaia. In fact, by the fact that I eat, some of what I eat has a chance
to participate in a higher intensity of consciousness, while, of course,
other portions of it are turned into waste of one sort or another and
therefore sink in the scale of consciousness.”</p>
<p>She took a firm bite of her food, chewed vigorously for a moment,
swallowed, and said, “It represents a vast circulation. Plants grow and
are eaten by animals. Animals eat and are eaten. Any organism that dies
is incorporated into the cells of molds, decay bacteria, and so on—still
Gaia. In this vast circulation of consciousness, even inorganic matter
participates, and everything in the circulation has its chance of
periodically participating in a high intensity of consciousness.”</p>
<p>“All this,” said Trevize, “can be said of any world. Every atom in me
has a long history during which it may have been part of many living
things, including human beings, and during which it may also have spent
long periods as part of the sea, or in a lump of coal, or in a rock, or
as a portion of the wind blowing upon us.”</p>
<p>“On Gaia, however,” said Bliss, “all atoms are also continually part
of a higher planetary consciousness of which you know nothing.”</p>
<p>“Well, what happens, then,” said Trevize, “to these vegetables from
Sayshell that you are eating? Do they become part of Gaia?”</p>
<p>“They do—rather slowly. And the wastes I excrete as slowly cease
being part of Gaia. After all, what leaves me is altogether lacking in
contact with Gaia. It lacks even the less-direct hyperspatial contact
that I can maintain, thanks to my high level of conscious intensity. It
is this hyperspatial contact that causes non-Gaian food to become part
of Gaia—slowly—once I eat it.”</p>
<p>“What about the Gaian food in our stores? Will that slowly become
non-Gaian? If so, you had better eat it while you can.”</p>
<p>“There is no need to be concerned about that,” said Bliss. “Our Gaian
stores have been treated in such a way that they will remain part of
Gaia over a long interval.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, suddenly, “But what will happen when we eat the Gaian
food. For that matter, what happened to us when we ate Gaian food on
Gaia itself. Are we ourselves slowly turning into Gaia?”</p>
<p>Bliss shook her head and a peculiarly disturbed expression crossed
her face. “No, what you ate was lost to us. Or at least the portions
that were metabolized into your tissues were lost to us. What you
excreted stayed Gaia or very slowly became Gaia so that in the end the
balance was maintained, but numerous atoms of Gaia became non-Gaia as a
result of your visit to us.”</p>
<p>“Why was that?” asked Trevize curiously.</p>
<p>“Because you would not have been able to endure the conversion, even
a very partial one. You were our guests, brought to our world under
compulsion, in a manner of speaking, and we had to protect you from
danger, even at the cost of the loss of tiny fragments of Gaia. It was a
willing price we paid, but not a happy one.”</p>
<p>“We regret that,” said Trevize, “but are you sure that non-Gaian
food, or some kinds of non-Gaian food, might not, in their turn, harm
you?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Bliss. “What is edible for you would be edible to me. I
merely have the additional problem of metabolizing such food into Gaia
as well as into my own tissues. It represents a psychological barrier
that rather spoils my enjoyment of the food and causes me to eat slowly,
but I will overcome that with time.”</p>
<p>“What about infection?” said Pelorat, in high-pitched alarm. “I can’t
understand why I didn’t think of this earlier. Bliss! Any world you land
on is likely to have microorganisms against which you have no defense
and you will die of some simple infectious disease. Trevize, we must
turn back.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be panicked, Pel dear,” said Bliss, smiling. “Microorganisms,
too, are assimilated into Gaia when they are part of my food, or when
they enter my body in any other way. If they seem to be in the process
of doing harm, they will be assimilated the more quickly, and once they
are Gaia, they will do me no harm.”</p>
<p>The meal drew to its end and Pelorat sipped at his spiced and heated
mixture of fruit juices. “Dear me,” he said, licking his lips, “I think
it is time to change the subject again. It does seem to me that my sole
occupation on board ship is subject-changing. Why is that?”</p>
<p>Trevize said solemnly, “Because Bliss and I cling to whatever
subjects we discuss, even to the death. We depend upon you, Janov, to
save our sanity. What subject do you want to change to, old friend?”</p>
<p>“I’ve gone through my reference material on Comporellon and the
entire sector of which it is part is rich in legends of age. They set
their settlement far back in time, in the first millennium of
hyperspatial travel. Comporellon even speaks of a legendary founder
named Benbally, though they don’t say where he came from. They say that
the original name of their planet was Benbally World.”</p>
<p>“And how much truth is there in that, in your opinion, Janov?”</p>
<p>“A kernel, perhaps, but who can guess what the kernel might be.”</p>
<p>“I never heard of anyone named Benbally in actual history. Have
you?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t, but you know that in the late Imperial era there was
a deliberate suppression of pre-Imperial history. The Emperors, in the
turbulent last centuries of the Empire, were anxious to reduce local
patriotism, since they considered it, with ample justification, to be a
disintegrating influence. In almost every sector of the Galaxy,
therefore, true history, with complete records and accurate chronology,
begins only with the days when Trantor’s influence made itself felt and
the sector in question had allied itself to the Empire or been annexed
by it.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t think that history would be that easy to eradicate,”
said Trevize.</p>
<p>“In many ways, it isn’t,” said Pelorat, “but a determined and
powerful government can weaken it greatly. If it is sufficiently
weakened, early history comes to depend on scattered material and tends
to degenerate into folk tales. Invariably such folk tales will fill with
exaggeration and come to show the sector to be older and more powerful
than, in all likelihood, it ever really was. And no matter how silly a
particular legend is, or how impossible it might be on the very face of
it, it becomes a matter of patriotism among the locals to believe it. I
can show you tales from every corner of the Galaxy that speak of
original colonization as having taken place from Earth itself, though
that is not always the name they give the parent planet.”</p>
<p>“What else do they call it?”</p>
<p>“Any of a number of names. They call it the Only, sometimes; and
sometimes, the Oldest. Or they call it the Mooned World, which,
according to some authorities is a reference to its giant satellite.
Others claim it means ‘Lost World’ and that ‘Mooned’ is a version of
‘Marooned,’ a pre-Galactic word meaning ‘lost’ or ‘abandoned.’”</p>
<p>Trevize said gently, “Janov, stop! You’ll continue forever with your
authorities and counterauthorities. These legends are everywhere, you
say?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, my dear fellow. Quite. You have only to go through them to
gain a feel for this human habit of beginning with some seed of truth
and layering about it shell after shell of pretty falsehood—in the
fashion of the oysters of Rhampora that build pearls about a piece of
grit. I came across just exactly that metaphor once when—”</p>
<p>“Janov! Stop again! Tell me, is there anything about Comporellon’s
legends that is different from others?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” Pelorat gazed at Trevize blankly for a moment. “Different?
Well, they claim that Earth is relatively nearby and that’s unusual. On
most worlds that speak of Earth, under whatever name they choose, there
is a tendency to be vague about its location—placing it indefinitely far
away or in some never-never land.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Yes, as some on Sayshell told us that Gaia was located
in hyperspace.”</p>
<p>Bliss laughed.</p>
<p>Trevize cast her a quick glance. “It’s true. That’s what we were
told.”</p>
<p>“I don’t disbelieve it. It’s amusing, that’s all. It is, of course,
what we want them to believe. We only ask to be left alone right now,
and where can we be safer and more secure than in hyperspace? If we’re
not there, we’re as good as there, if people believe that to be our
location.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize dryly, “and in the same way there is something
that causes people to believe that Earth doesn’t exist, or that it is
far away, or that it has a radioactive crust.”</p>
<p>“Except,” said Pelorat, “that the Comporellians believe it to be
relatively close to themselves.”</p>
<p>“But nevertheless give it a radioactive crust. One way or another
every people with an Earth-legend consider Earth to be
unapproachable.”</p>
<p>“That’s more or less right,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Many on Sayshell believed Gaia to be nearby; some even
identified its star correctly; and yet all considered it unapproachable.
There may be some Comporellians who insist that Earth is radioactive and
dead, but who can identify its star. We will then approach it,
unapproachable though they may consider it. We did exactly that in the
case of Gaia.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Gaia was willing to receive you, Trevize. You were
helpless in our grip but we had no thought of harming you. What if
Earth, too, is powerful, but not benevolent. What then?”</p>
<p>“I must in any case try to reach it, and accept the consequences.
However, that is my task. Once I locate Earth and head for it, it will
not be too late for you to leave. I will put you off on the nearest
Foundation world, or take you back to Gaia, if you insist, and then go
on to Earth alone.”</p>
<p>“My dear chap,” said Pelorat, in obvious distress. “Don’t say such
things. I wouldn’t dream of abandoning you.”</p>
<p>“Or I of abandoning Pel,” said Bliss, as she reached out a hand to
touch Pelorat’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Very well, then. It won’t be long before we’re ready to take the
Jump to Comporellon and thereafter, let us hope, it will be—on to
Earth.”</p>
