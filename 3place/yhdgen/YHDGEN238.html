<h4 id="section">6</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon kept his face expressionless and bent his head just
sufficiently to allow a sense of reasonable courtesy. He had taken the
trouble to look up a variety of holographs of Joranum, but, as is often
the case, the real thing, unguarded, shifting constantly in response to
changing conditions, is never quite the same as a holograph—however
carefully prepared. Perhaps, thought Seldon, it is the response of the
viewer to the “real thing” that makes it different.</p>
<p>Joranum was a tall man—as tall as Seldon, at any rate—but larger in
other directions. It was not due to a muscular physique, for he gave the
impression of softness, without quite being fat. A rounded face, a thick
head of hair that was sandy rather than yellow, light blue eyes. He wore
a subdued coverall and his face bore a half-smile that gave the illusion
of friendliness, while making it clear, somehow, that it was only an
illusion.</p>
<p>“Professor Seldon”—his voice was deep and under strict control, an
orator’s voice—“I am delighted to meet you. It is kind of you to permit
this meeting. I trust you are not offended that I have brought a
companion, my right-hand man, with me, although I have not cleared that
with you in advance. He is Gambol Deen Namarti—three names, you notice.
I believe you have met him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have. I remember the incident well.” Seldon looked at Namarti
with a touch of the sardonic. At the previous encounter, Namarti had
been speaking at the University Field. Seldon viewed him carefully
now—under relaxed conditions. Namarti was of moderate height, with a
thin face, sallow complexion, dark hair, and a wide mouth. He did not
have Joranum’s half-smile or any noticeable expression—except for a
sense of cautious wariness.</p>
<p>“My friend Dr. Namarti—his degree is in ancient literature—has come
at his own request,” said Joranum, his smile intensifying a bit, “to
apologize.”</p>
<p>Joranum glanced quickly at Namarti—and Namarti, his lips tightening
just at first, said in a colorless voice, “I am sorry, Professor, for
what happened at the Field. I was not quite aware of the strict rules
governing University rallies and I was a little carried away by my own
enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>“Understandably so,” said Joranum. “Nor was he entirely aware of your
identity. I think we may all now forget the matter.”</p>
<p>“I assure you, gentlemen,” said Seldon, “that I have no great desire
to remember it. This is my son, Raych Seldon, so you see I have a
companion, too.”</p>
<p>Raych had grown a mustache, black and abundant—the masculine mark of
the Dahlite. He had had none when he first met Seldon eight years
before, when he was a street boy, ragged and hungry. He was short but
lithe and sinewy and his expression was the haughty one he had adopted
in order to add a few spiritual inches to his physical height.</p>
<p>“Good morning, young man,” said Joranum.</p>
<p>“Good morning, sir,” said Raych.</p>
<p>“Please sit down, gentlemen,” said Seldon. “May I offer you something
to eat or drink?”</p>
<p>Joranum held up his hands in polite refusal. “No, sir. This is not a
social call.” He seated himself in the place indicated. “Though I hope
there will be many such calls in the future.”</p>
<p>“If this is to be about business, then let’s begin.”</p>
<p>“The news reached me, Professor Seldon, of the little incident that
you have so kindly agreed to forget and I wondered why you took the
chance of doing what you did. It was a risk, you must admit.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think so, actually.”</p>
<p>“But I did. So I took the liberty of finding out everything I could
about you, Professor Seldon. You’re an interesting man. From Helicon, I
discovered.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s where I was born. The records are clear.”</p>
<p>“And you’ve been here on Trantor for eight years.”</p>
<p>“That is also a matter of public record.”</p>
<p>“And you made yourself quite famous at the start by delivering a
mathematical paper on—what do you call it?—psychohistory?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head very slightly. How often he had regretted that
indiscretion. Of course, he had had no idea at the time that it was an
indiscretion. He said, “A youthful enthusiasm. It came to nothing.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Joranum looked around him with an air of pleased
surprise. “Yet here you are, the head of the Mathematics Department at
one of Trantor’s greatest Universities, and only forty years old, I
believe. —I’m forty-two, by the way, so I don’t look upon you as very
old at all. You must be a very competent mathematician to be in this
position.”</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged. “I wouldn’t care to make a judgment in that
matter.”</p>
<p>“Or you must have powerful friends.”</p>
<p>“We would all like to have powerful friends, Mr. Joranum, but I think
you will find none here. University professors rarely have powerful
friends or, I sometimes think, friends of any kind.” He smiled.</p>
<p>And so did Joranum. “Wouldn’t you consider the Emperor a powerful
friend, Professor Seldon?”</p>
<p>“I certainly would, but what has that to do with me?”</p>
<p>“I am under the impression that the Emperor is a friend of
yours.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure the records will show, Mr. Joranum, that I had an audience
with His Imperial Majesty eight years ago. It lasted perhaps an hour or
less and I saw no signs of any great friendliness in him at the time.
Nor have I spoken to him since—or even seen him—except on holovision, of
course.”</p>
<p>“But, Professor, it is not necessary to see or speak to the Emperor
to have him as a powerful friend. It is sufficient to see or speak to
Eto Demerzel, the Emperor’s First Minister. Demerzel is your protector
and, since he is, we may as well say the Emperor is.”</p>
<p>“Do you find First Minister Demerzel’s supposed protection of me
anywhere in the records? Or anything at all in the records from which
you can deduce that protection?”</p>
<p>“Why search the records when it is well known that there is a
connection between the two of you? You know it and I know it. Let us
take it then as given and continue. And please”—he raised his hands—“do
not take the trouble to give me any heartfelt denials. It’s a waste of
time.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” said Seldon, “I was going to ask why you should think
that he would want to protect me. To what end?”</p>
<p>“Professor! Are you trying to hurt me by pretending to think I am a
monster of naïveté? I mentioned your psychohistory, which Demerzel
wants.”</p>
<p>“And I told you that it was a youthful indiscretion that came to
nothing.”</p>
<p>“You may tell me a great many things, Professor. I am not compelled
to accept what you tell me. Come, let me speak frankly. I have read your
original paper and have tried to understand it with the help of some
mathematicians on my staff. They tell me it is a wild dream and quite
impossible—”</p>
<p>“I quite agree with them,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“But I have the feeling that Demerzel is waiting for it to be
developed and put to use. And if he can wait, so can I. It would be more
useful to you, Professor Seldon, to have me wait.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“Because Demerzel will not endure in his position for much longer.
Public opinion is turning against him steadily. It may be that when the
Emperor wearies of an unpopular First Minister who threatens to drag the
throne down with him, he will find a replacement. It may even be my poor
self whom the Emperor’s fancy will seize upon. And you will still need a
protector, someone who can see to it that you can work in peace and with
ample funds for whatever you need in the way of equipment and
assistants.”</p>
<p>“And would you be that protector?”</p>
<p>“Of course—and for the same reason that Demerzel is. I want a
successful psychohistoric technique so that I can rule the Empire more
efficiently.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded thoughtfully, waited a moment, then said, “But in that
case, Mr. Joranum, why must I concern myself in this? I am a poor
scholar, living a quiet life, engaged in out-of-the-way mathematical and
pedagogical activities. You say that Demerzel is my present protector
and that you will be my future protector. I can go quietly about my
business, then. You and the First Minister may fight it out. Whoever
prevails, I have a protector still—or, at least, so you tell me.”</p>
<p>Joranum’s fixed smile seemed to fade a bit. Namarti, at his side,
turned his dour face toward Joranum and made as though to say something,
but Joranum’s hand moved slightly and Namarti coughed and did not
speak.</p>
<p>Joranum said, “Dr. Seldon. Are you a patriot?”</p>
<p>“Why, of course. The Empire has given humanity millennia of
peace—mostly peace, at any rate—and fostered steady advancement.”</p>
<p>“So it has—but at a slower pace in the last century or two.”</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged. “I have not studied such matters.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to. You know that, politically, the last century or
two has been a time of turmoil. Imperial reigns have been short and
sometimes have been shortened further by assassination—”</p>
<p>“Even mentioning that,” put in Seldon, “is close to treason. I’d
rather you didn’t—”</p>
<p>“Well, there.” Joranum threw himself back in his seat. “See how
insecure you are. The Empire is decaying. I’m willing to say so openly.
Those who follow me do so because they know only too well it is. We need
someone at the Emperior’s right hand who can control the Empire, subdue
the rebellious impulses that seem to be arising everywhere, give the
armed forces the natural leadership they should have, lead the
economy—”</p>
<p>Seldon made an impatient stopping motion with his arm. “And you’re
the one to do it, are you?”</p>
<p>“I intend to be the one. It won’t be an easy job and I doubt there
would be many volunteers—for good reason. Certainly Demerzel can’t do
it. Under him, the decline of the Empire is accelerating to a total
breakdown.”</p>
<p>“But you can stop it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dr. Seldon. With your help. With psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps Demerzel could stop the breakdown with psychohistory—if
psychohistory existed.”</p>
<p>Joranum said calmly, “It exists. Let us not pretend it does not. But
its existence does not help Demerzel. Psychohistory is only a tool. It
needs a brain to understand it and an arm to wield it.”</p>
<p>“And you have those, I take it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I know my own virtues. I want psychohistory.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “You may want it all you please. I don’t have
it.”</p>
<p>“You do have it. I will not argue the point.” Joranum leaned closer
as though wishing to insinuate his voice into Seldon’s ear, rather than
allowing the sound waves to carry it there. “You say you are a patriot.
I must replace Demerzel to avoid Imperial destruction. However, the
manner of replacement might itself weaken the Empire desperately. I do
not wish that. You can advise me how to achieve the end smoothly,
subtly, without harm or damage—for the sake of the Empire.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I cannot. You accuse me of knowledge I do not possess.
I would like to be of assistance, but I cannot.”</p>
<p>Joranum stood up suddenly. “Well, you know my mind and what it is I
want of you. Think about it. And I ask you to think about the Empire.
You may feel you owe Demerzel—this despoiler of all the millions of
planets of humanity—your friendship. Be careful. What you do may shake
the very foundation of the Empire. I ask you to help me in the name of
the quadrillions of human beings who fill the Galaxy. Think of the
Empire.”</p>
<p>His voice had dropped to a thrilling and powerful half-whisper.
Seldon felt himself almost trembling. “I will always think of the
Empire,” he said.</p>
<p>Joranum said, “Then that is all I ask right now. Thank you for
consenting to see me.”</p>
<p>Seldon watched Joranum and his companion leave as the office doors
slid open noiselessly and the men strode out.</p>
<p>He frowned. Something was bothering him—and he was not sure what it
was.</p>
