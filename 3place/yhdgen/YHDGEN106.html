<p>HYPERSPACE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Trevize said, “Are you ready, Janov?”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked up from the book he was viewing and said, “You mean,
for the Jump, old fellow?”</p>
<p>“For the hyperspatial Jump. Yes.”</p>
<p>Pelorat swallowed. “Now, you’re sure that it will be in no way
uncomfortable. I know it is a silly thing to fear, but the thought of
having myself reduced to incorporeal tachyons, which no one has ever
seen or detected—”</p>
<p>“Come, Janov, it’s a perfected thing. Upon my honor! The Jump has
been in use for twenty-two thousand years, as you explained, and I’ve
never heard of a single fatality in hyperspace. We might come out of
hyperspace in an uncomfortable place, but then the accident would happen
in space—not while we are composed of tachyons.”</p>
<p>“Small consolation, it seems to me.”</p>
<p>“We won’t come out in error, either. To tell you the truth, I was
thinking of carrying it through without telling you, so that you would
never know it had happened. On the whole, though, I felt it would be
better if you experienced it consciously, saw that it was no problem of
any kind, and could forget it totally henceforward.”</p>
<p>“Well—” said Pelorat dubiously. “I suppose you’re right, but honestly
I’m in no hurry.”</p>
<p>“I assure you—”</p>
<p>“No no, old fellow, I accept your assurances unequivocally. It’s just
that—Did you ever read Santerestil Matt?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m not illiterate.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Certainly. I should not have asked. Do you remember
it?”</p>
<p>“Neither am I an amnesiac.”</p>
<p>“I seem to have a talent for offending. All I mean is that I keep
thinking of the scenes where Santerestil and his friend, Ban, have
gotten away from Planet 17 and are lost in space. I think of those
perfectly hypnotic scenes among the stars, lazily moving along in deep
silence, in changelessness, in— Never believed it, you know. I loved it
and I was moved by it, but I never really believed it. But now—after I
got used to just the notion of being in space, I’m experiencing it
and—it’s silly, I know—but I don’t want to give it up. It’s as though
I’m Santerestil—”</p>
<p>“And I’m Ban,” said Trevize with just an edge of impatience.</p>
<p>“In a way. The small scattering of dim stars out there are
motionless, except our sun, of course, which must be shrinking but which
we don’t see. The Galaxy retains its dim majesty, unchanging. Space is
silent and I have no distractions—”</p>
<p>“Except me.”</p>
<p>“Except you. —But then, Golan, dear chap, talking to you about Earth
and trying to teach you a bit of prehistory has its pleasures, too. I
don’t want that to come to an end, either.”</p>
<p>“It won’t. Not immediately, at any rate. You don’t suppose we’ll take
the Jump and come through on the surface of a planet, do you? We’ll
still be in space and the Jump will have taken no measurable time at
all. It may well be a week before we make surface of any kind, so do
relax.”</p>
<p>“By surface, you surely don’t mean Gaia. We may be nowhere near Gaia
when we come out of the Jump.”</p>
<p>“I know that, Janov, but we’ll be in the right sector, if your
information is correct. If it isn’t—well—”</p>
<p>Pelorat shook his head glumly. “How will being in the right sector
help if we don’t know Gaia’s coordinates?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Janov, suppose you were on Terminus, heading for the
town of Argyropol, and you didn’t know where that town was except that
it was somewhere on the isthmus. Once you were on the isthmus, what
would you do?”</p>
<p>Pelorat waited cautiously, as though feeling there must be a terribly
sophisticated answer expected of him. Finally giving up, he said, “I
suppose I’d ask somebody.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! What else is there to do? —Now, are you ready?”</p>
<p>“You mean, now?” Pelorat scrambled to his feet, his pleasantly
unemotional face coming as near as it might to a look of concern. “What
am I supposed to do? Sit?</p>
<p>Stand? What?”</p>
<p>“Time and Space, Pelorat, you don’t do anything. Just come with me to
my room so I can use the computer, then sit or stand or turn
cartwheels—whatever will make you most comfortable. My suggestion is
that you sit before the viewscreen and watch it. It’s sure to be
interesting. Come!”</p>
<p>They stepped along the short corridor to Trevize’s room and he seated
himself at the computer. “Would you like to do this, Janov?” he asked
suddenly. “I’ll give you the figures and all you do is think them. The
computer will do the rest.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “No thank you. The computer doesn’t work well with me,
somehow. I know you say I just need practice, but I don’t believe that.
There’s something about your mind, Golan—”</p>
<p>“Don’t be foolish.”</p>
<p>“No no. That computer just seems to fit you. You and it seem to be a
single organism when you’re hooked up. When I’m hooked up, there are two
objects involved—Janov Pelorat and a computer. It’s just not the
same.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous,” said Trevize, but he was vaguely pleased at the thought
and stroked the hand-rests of the computer with loving fingertips.</p>
<p>“So I’d rather watch,” said Pelorat. “I mean, I’d rather it didn’t
happen at all, but as long as it will, I’d rather watch.” He fixed his
eyes anxiously on the viewscreen and on the foggy Galaxy with the thin
powdering of dim stars in the foreground. “Let me know when it’s about
to happen.” Slowly he backed against the wall and braced himself.</p>
<p>Trevize smiled. He placed his hands on the rests and felt the mental
union. It came more easily day by day, and more intimately, too, and
however he might scoff at what Pelorat said—he actually felt it. It
seemed to him he scarcely needed to think of the coordinates in any
conscious way. It almost seemed the computer knew what he wanted,
without the conscious process of “telling.” It lifted the information
out of his brain for itself.</p>
<p>But Trevize “told” it and then asked for a two-minute interval before
the Jump.</p>
<p>“All right, Janov. We have two minutes: 120—115—110—Just watch the
viewscreen.”</p>
<p>Pelorat did, with a slight tightness about the corners of his mouth
and with a holding of his breath.</p>
<p>Trevize said softly, “15—10—5—4—3—2—1—0.”</p>
<p>With no perceptible motion, no perceptible sensation, the view on the
screen changed. There was a distinct thickening of the starfield and the
Galaxy vanished.</p>
<p>Pelorat started and said, “Was that it?”</p>
<p>“Was what it? You flinched. But that was your fault. You felt
nothing. Admit it.”</p>
<p>“I admit it.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s it. Way back when hyperspatial travel was relatively
new—according to the books, anyway—there would be a queer internal
sensation and some people felt dizziness or nausea. It was perhaps
psychogenic, perhaps not. In any case, with more and more experience
with hyperspatiality and with better equipment, that decreased. With a
computer like the one on board this vessel, any effect is well below the
threshold of sensation. At least, I find it so.”</p>
<p>“And I do, too, I must admit. Where are we, Golan?”</p>
<p>“Just a step forward. In the Kalganian region. There’s a long way to
go yet and before we make another move, we’ll have to check the accuracy
of the Jump.”</p>
<p>“What bothers me is—where’s the Galaxy?”</p>
<p>“All around us, Janov. We’re well inside it, now. If we focus the
viewscreen properly, we can see the more distant parts of it as a
luminous band across the sky.”</p>
<p>“The Milky Way!” Pelorat cried out joyfully. “Almost every world
describes it in their sky, but it’s something we don’t see on Terminus.
Show it to me, old fellow!”</p>
<p>The viewscreen tilted, giving the effect of a swimming of the
starfield across it, and then there was a thick, pearly luminosity
nearly filling the field. The screen followed it around, as it thinned,
then swelled again.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “It’s thicker in the direction of the center of the
Galaxy. Not as thick or as bright as it might be, however, because of
the dark clouds in the sprial arms. You see something like this from
most inhabited worlds.”</p>
<p>“And from Earth, too.”</p>
<p>“That’s no distinction. That would not be an identifying
characteristic.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. But you know— You haven’t studied the history of
science, have you?”</p>
<p>“Not really, though I’ve picked up some of it, naturally. Still, if
you have questions to ask, don’t expect me to be an expert.”</p>
<p>“It’s just that making this Jump has put me in mind of something that
has always puzzled me. It’s possible to work out a description of the
Universe in which hyperspatial travel is impossible and in which the
speed of light traveling through a vacuum is the absolute maximum where
speed is concerned.”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“Under those conditions, the geometry of the Universe is such that it
is impossible to make the trip we have just undertaken in less time than
a ray of light would make it. And if we did it at the speed of light,
our experience of duration would not match that of the Universe
generally. If this spot is, say, forty parsecs from Terminus, then if we
had gotten here at the speed of light, we would have felt no time
lapse—but on Terminus and in the entire Galaxy, about a hundred and
thirty years would have passed. Now we have made a trip, not at the
speed of light but at thousands of times the speed of light actually,
and there has been no time advance anywhere. At least, I hope not.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Don’t expect me to give you the mathematics of the
Olanjen Hyperspatial Theory to you. All I can say is that if you had
traveled at the speed of light within normal space, time would indeed
have advanced at the rate of 3.26 years per parsec, as you described.
The so-called relativistic Universe, which humanity has understood as
far back as we can probe into prehistory—though that’s your department,
I think—remains, and its laws have not been repealed. In our
hyperspatial Jumps, however, we do something outside the conditions
under which relativity operates and the rules are different.
Hyperspatially the Galaxy is a tiny object—ideally a nondimensional
dot—and there are no relativistic effects at all.</p>
<p>“In fact, in the mathematical formulations of cosmology, there are
two symbols for the Galaxy: Gr for the ‘relativistic Galaxy,’ where the
speed of light is a maximum, and Gh for the ‘hyperspatial Galaxy,’ where
speed does not really have a meaning. Hyperspatially the value of all
speed is zero and we do not move; with reference to space itself, speed
is infinite. I can’t explain things a bit more than that.</p>
<p>“Oh, except that one of the beautiful catches in theoretical physics
is to place a symbol or a value that has meaning in Gr into an equation
dealing with Gh—or vice versa—and leave it there for a student to deal
with. The chances are enormous that the student falls into the trap and
generally remains there, sweating and panting, with nothing seeming to
work, till some kindly elder helps him out. I was neatly caught that
way, once.”</p>
<p>Pelorat considered that gravely for a while, then said in a perplexed
sort of way, “But which is the true Galaxy?”</p>
<p>“Either, depending on what you’re doing. If you’re back on Terminus,
you can use a car to cover distance on land and a ship to cover distance
across the sea. Conditions are different in every way, so which is the
true Terminus, the land or the sea?”</p>
<p>Pelorat nodded. “Analogies are always risky,” he said, “but I’d
rather accept that one than risk my sanity by thinking about hyperspace
any further. I’ll concentrate on what we’re doing now.”</p>
<p>“Look upon what we just did,” said Trevize, “as our first stop toward
Earth.”</p>
<p>And, he thought to himself, toward what else, I wonder.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>“Well,” said Trevize. “I’ve wasted a day.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Pelorat looked up from his careful indexing. “In what way?”</p>
<p>Trevize spread his arms. “I didn’t trust the computer. I didn’t dare
to, so I checked our present position with the position we had aimed at
in the Jump. The difference was not measurable. There was no detectable
error.”</p>
<p>“That’s good, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s more than good. It’s unbelievable. I’ve never heard of such a
thing. I’ve gone through Jumps and I’ve directed them, in all kinds of
ways and with all kinds of devices. In school, I had to work one out
with a hand computer and then I sent off a hyper-relay to check results.
Naturally I couldn’t send a real ship, since—aside from the expense—I
could easily have placed it in the middle of a star at the other
end.</p>
<p>“I never did anything that bad, of course,” Trevize went on, “but
there would always be a sizable error. There’s always some error, even
with experts. There’s got to be, since there are so many variables. Put
it this way—the geometry of space is too complicated to handle and
hyperspace compounds all those complications with a complexity of its
own that we can’t even pretend to understand. That’s why we have to go
by steps, instead of making one big Jump from here to Sayshell. The
errors would grow worse with distance.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “But you said this computer didn’t make an error.”</p>
<p>“It said it didn’t make an error. I directed it to check our actual
position with our precalculated position—‘what is’ against ‘what was
asked for.’ It said that the two were identical within its limits of
measurement and I thought: What if it’s lying?”</p>
<p>Until that moment, Pelorat had held his printer in his hand. He now
put it down and looked shaken. “Are you joking? A computer can’t lie.
Unless you mean you thought it might be out of order.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I thought. Space! I thought it was lying. This
computer is so advanced I can’t think of it as anything but
human—superhuman, maybe. Human enough to have pride—and to lie, perhaps.
I gave it directions—to work out a course through hyperspace to a
position near Sayshell Planet, the capital of the Sayshell Union. It
did, and charted a course in twenty-nine steps, which is arrogance of
the worst sort.”</p>
<p>“Why arrogance?”</p>
<p>“The error in the first Jump makes the second Jump that much less
certain, and the added error then makes the third Jump pretty wobbly and
untrustworthy, and so on. How do you calculate twenty-nine steps all at
once? The twenty-ninth could end up anywhere in the Galaxy, anywhere at
all. So I directed it to make the first step only. Then we could check
that before proceeding.”</p>
<p>“The cautious approach,” said Pelorat warmly. “I approve!”</p>
<p>“Yes, but having made the first step, might the computer not feel
wounded at my having mistrusted it? Would it then be forced to salve its
pride by telling me there was no error at all when I asked it? Would it
find it impossible to admit a mistake, to own up to imperfection? If
that were so, we might as well not have a computer.”</p>
<p>Pelorat’s long and gentle face saddened. “What can we do in that
case, Golan?”</p>
<p>“We can do what I did—waste a day. I checked the position of several
of the surrounding stars by the most primitive possible methods:
telescopic observation, photography, and manual measurement. I compared
each actual position with the position expected if there had been no
error. The work of it took me all day and wore me down to nothing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but what happened?”</p>
<p>“I found two whopping errors and checked them over and found them in
my calculations. I had made the mistakes myself. I corrected the
calculations, then ran them through the computer from scratch—just to
see if it would come up with the same answers independently. Except that
it worked them out to several more decimal places, it turned out that my
figures were right and they showed that the computer had made no errors.
The computer may be an arrogant son-of-the-Mule, but it’s got something
to be arrogant about.”</p>
<p>Pelorat exhaled a long breath. “Well, that’s good.”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed! So I’m going to let it take the other twenty-eight
steps.”</p>
<p>“All at once? But—”</p>
<p>“Not all at once. Don’t worry. I haven’t become a daredevil just yet.
It will do them one after the other—but after each step it will check
the surroundings and, if that is where it is supposed to be within
tolerable limits, it can take the next one. Any time it finds the error
too great—and, believe me, I didn’t set the limits generously at all—it
will have to stop and recalculate the remaining steps.”</p>
<p>“When are you going to do this?”</p>
<p>“When? Right now. —Look, you’re working on indexing your
Library—”</p>
<p>“Oh, but this is the chance to do it, Golan. I’ve been meaning to do
it for years, but something always seemed to get in the way.”</p>
<p>“I have no objections. You go on and do it and don’t worry.
Concentrate on the indexing. I’ll take care of everything else.”</p>
<p>Pelorat shook his head. “Don’t be foolish. I can’t relax till this is
over. I’m scared stiff.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have told you, then—but I had to tell someone and you’re
the only one here. Let me explain frankly. There’s always the chance
that we’ll come to rest in a perfect position in interstellar space and
that that will happen to be the precise position which a speeding
meteoroid is occupying, or a mini-black hole, and the ship is wrecked,
and we’re dead. Such things could—in theory—happen.</p>
<p>“The chances are very small, however. After all, you could be at
home, Janov—in your study and working on your films or in your bed
sleeping—and a meteoroid could be streaking toward you through
Terminus’s atmosphere and hit you right in the head and you’d be dead.
But the chances are small.</p>
<p>“In fact, the chance of intersecting the path of something fatal, but
too small for the computer to know about, in the course of a
hyperspatial Jump is far, far smaller than that of being hit by a meteor
in your home. I’ve never heard of a ship being lost that way in all the
history of hyperspatial travel. Any other type of risk—like ending in
the middle of a star—is even smaller.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Then why do you tell me all this, Golan?”</p>
<p>Trevize paused, then bent his head in thought, and finally said, “I
don’t know. —Yes, I do. What I suppose it is, is that however small the
chance of catastrophe might be, if enough people take enough chances,
the catastrophe must happen eventually. No matter how sure I am that
nothing will go wrong, there’s a small nagging voice inside me that
says, ‘Maybe it will happen this time.’ And it makes me feel guilty. —I
guess that’s it. Janov, if something goes wrong, forgive me!”</p>
<p>“But, Golan, my dear chap, if something goes wrong, we will both be
dead instantly. I will not be able to forgive, nor you to receive
forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“I understand that, so forgive me now, will you?”</p>
<p>Pelorat smiled. “I don’t know why, but this cheers me up. There’s
something pleasantly humorous about it. Of course, Golan, I’ll forgive
you. There are plenty of myths about some form of afterlife in world
literature and if there should happen to be such a place—about the same
chance as landing on a mini-black hole, I suppose, or less—and we both
turn up in the same one, then I will bear witness that you did your
honest best and that my death should not be laid at your door.”</p>
<p>“Thank you! Now I’m relieved. I’m willing to take my chance, but I
did not enjoy the thought of you taking my chance as well.”</p>
<p>Pelorat wrung the other’s hand. “You know, Golan, I’ve only known you
less than a week and I suppose I shouldn’t make hasty judgments in these
matters, but I think you’re an excellent chap. —And now let’s do it and
get it over with.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely! All I have to do is touch that little contact. The
computer has its instructions and it’s just waiting for me to say:
‘Start!’ —Would you like to—”</p>
<p>“Never! It’s all yours! It’s your computer.”</p>
<p>“Very well. And it’s my responsibility. I’m still trying to duck it
you see. Keep your eye on the screen!”</p>
<p>With a remarkably steady hand and with his smile looking utterly
genuine, Trevize made contact.</p>
<p>There was a momentary pause and then the starfield changed—and
again—and again. The stars spread steadily thicker and brighter over the
viewscreen.</p>
<p>Pelorat was counting under his breath. At “15” there was a halt, as
though some piece of apparatus had jammed.</p>
<p>Pelorat whispered, clearly afraid that any noise might jar the
mechanism fatally. “What’s wrong? What’s happened?”</p>
<p>Trevize shrugged. “I imagine it’s recalculating. Some object in space
is adding a perceptible bump to the general shape of the overall
gravitational field—some object not taken into account—some uncharted
dwarf star or rogue planet—”</p>
<p>“Dangerous?”</p>
<p>“Since we’re still alive, it’s almost certainly not dangerous. A
planet could be a hundred million kilometers away and still introduce a
large enough gravitational modification to require recalculation. A
dwarf star could be ten billion kilometers away and—”</p>
<p>The screen shifted again and Trevize fell silent. It shifted
again—and again—Finally, when Pelorat said, “28,” there was no further
motion.</p>
<p>Trevize consulted the computer. “We’re here,” he said.</p>
<p>“I counted the first Jump as ‘1’ and in this series I started with
‘2.’ That’s twenty-eight Jumps altogether. You said twenty-nine.”</p>
<p>“The recalculation at Jump 15 probably saved us one Jump. I can check
with the computer if you wish, but there’s really no need. We’re in the
vicinity of Sayshell Planet. The computer says so and I don’t doubt it.
If I were to orient the screen properly, we’d see a nice, bright sun,
but there’s no point in placing a needless strain on its screening
capacity. Sayshell Planet is the fourth one out and it’s about 3.2
million kilometers away from our present position, which is about as
close as we want to be at a Jump conclusion. We can get there in three
days—two, if we hurry.”</p>
<p>Trevize drew a deep breath and tried to let the tension drain.</p>
<p>“Do you realize what this means, Janov?” he said. “Every ship I’ve
ever been in—or heard of—would have made those Jumps with at least a day
in between for painstaking calculation and re-checking, even with a
computer. The trip would have taken nearly a month. Or perhaps two or
three weeks, if they were willing to be reckless about it. We did it in
half an hour. When every ship is equipped with a computer like this
one—”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I wonder why the Mayor let us have a ship this
advanced. It must be incredibly expensive.”</p>
<p>“It’s experimental,” said Trevize dryly. “Maybe the good woman was
perfectly willing to have us try it out and see what deficiencies might
develop.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Don’t get nervous. After all, there’s nothing to worry about. We
haven’t found any deficiencies. I wouldn’t put it past her, though. Such
a thing would put no great strain on her sense of humanity. Besides, she
hasn’t trusted us with offensive weapons and that cuts the expense
considerably.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said thoughtfully, “It’s the computer I’m thinking about. It
seems to be adjusted so well for you—and it can’t be adjusted that well
for everyone. It just barely works with me.”</p>
<p>“So much the better for us, that it works so well with one of
us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but is that merely chance?”</p>
<p>“What else, Janov?”</p>
<p>“Surely the Mayor knows you pretty well.”</p>
<p>“I think she does, the old battlecraft.”</p>
<p>“Might she not have had a computer designed particularly for
you?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I just wonder if we’re not going where the computer wants to take
us.”</p>
<p>Trevize stared. “You mean that while I’m connected to the computer,
it is the computer—and not me—who’s in real charge?”</p>
<p>“I just wonder.”</p>
<p>“That is ridiculous. Paranoid. Come on, Janov.”</p>
<p>Trevize turned back to the computer to focus Sayshell Planet on the
screen and to plot a normalspace course to it.</p>
<p>Ridiculous!</p>
<p>But why had Pelorat put the notion into his head?</p>
