<p>GAIA</p>
<ol type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It took hours for the ship from the space station to reach the
vicinity of the Far Star—very long hours for Trevize to endure.</p>
<p>Had the situation been normal, Trevize would have tried to signal and
would have expected a response. If there had been no response, he would
have taken evasive action.</p>
<p>Since he was unarmed and there had been no response, there was
nothing to do but wait. The computer would not respond to any direction
he could give it that involved anything outside the ship.</p>
<p>Internally, at least, everything worked well. The life-support
systems were in perfect order, so that he and Pelorat were physically
comfortable. Somehow, that didn’t help. Life dragged on and the
uncertainty of what was to come was wearing him down. He noticed with
irritation that Pelorat seemed calm. As though to make it worse, while
Trevize felt no sense of hunger at all, Pelorat opened a small container
of chicken-bits, which on opening had rapidly and automatically warmed
itself. Now he was eating it methodically.</p>
<p>Trevize said irritably, “Space, Janov! That stinks!”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked startled and sniffed at the container. “It smells all
right to me, Golan.”</p>
<p>Trevize shook his head. “Don’t mind me. I’m just upset. But do use a
fork. Your fingers will smell of chicken all day.”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked at his fingers with surprise. “Sorry! I didn’t notice.
I was thinking of something else.”</p>
<p>Trevize said sarcastically, “Would you care to guess at what type of
nonhumans the creatures on the approaching ship must be?” He was ashamed
that he was less calm than Pelorat was. He was a Navy veteran (though he
had never seen battle, of course) and Pelorat was a historian. Yet his
companion sat there quietly.</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “It would be impossible to imagine what direction
evolution would take under conditions differing from those of Earth. The
possibilities may not be infinite, but they would be so vast that they
might as well be. However, I can predict that they are not senselessly
violent and they will treat us in a civilized fashion. If that wasn’t
true, we would be dead by now.”</p>
<p>“At least you can still reason, Janov, my friend—you can still be
tranquil. My nerves seem to be forcing their way through whatever
tranquilization they have put us under. I have an extraordinary desire
to stand up and pace. Why doesn’t that blasted ship arrive?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I am a man of passivity, Golan. I have spent my life
doubled over records while waiting for other records to arrive. I do
nothing but wait. You are a man of action and you are in deep pain when
action is impossible.”</p>
<p>Trevize felt some of his tension leave. He muttered, “I underestimate
your good sense, Janov.”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t,” said Pelorat placidly, “but even a naïve academic
can sometimes make sense out of life.”</p>
<p>“And even the cleverest politician can sometimes fail to do so.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that, Golan.”</p>
<p>“No, but I did. —So let me become active. I can still observe. The
approaching ship is close enough to seem distinctly primitive.”</p>
<p>“Seem?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “If it’s the product of nonhuman minds and hands, what
may seem primitive may, in actual fact, be merely nonhuman.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it might be a nonhuman artifact?” asked Pelorat, his
face reddening slightly.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell. I suspect that artifacts, however much they may vary
from culture to culture, are never quite as plastic as products of
genetic differences might be.”</p>
<p>“That’s just a guess on your part. All we know are different
cultures. We don’t know different intelligent species and therefore have
no way of judging how different artifacts might be.”</p>
<p>“Fish, dolphins, penguins, squids, even the ambiflexes, which are not
of Earthly origin—assuming the others are—all solve the problem of
motion through a viscous medium by streamlining, so that their
appearances are not as different as their genetic makeup might lead one
to believe. It might be so with artifacts.”</p>
<p>“The squid’s tentacles and the ambiflex’s helical vibrators,”
responded Pelorat, “are enormously different from each other, and from
the fins, flippers, and limbs of vertebrates. It might be so with
artifacts.”</p>
<p>“In any case,” said Trevize, “I feel better. Talking nonsense with
you, Janov, quiets my nerves. And I suspect we’ll know what we’re
getting into soon, too. The ship is not going to be able to dock with
ours and whatever is on it will come across on an old-fashioned
tether—or we will somehow be urged to cross to it on one—since the
unilock will be useless. —Unless some nonhuman will use some other
system altogether.”</p>
<p>“How big is the ship?”</p>
<p>“Without being able to use the ship’s computer to calculate the
distance of the ship by radar, we can’t possibly know the size.”</p>
<p>A tether snaked out toward the Far Star.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Either there’s a human aboard or nonhumans use the
same device. Perhaps nothing but a tether can possibly work.”</p>
<p>“They might use a tube,” said Pelorat, “or a horizontal ladder.”</p>
<p>“Those are inflexible things. It would be far too complicated to try
to make contact with those. You need something that combines strength
and flexibility.”</p>
<p>The tether made a dull clang on the Far Star as the solid hull (and
consequently the air within) was set to vibrating. There was the usual
slithering as the other ship made the fine adjustments of speed required
to bring the two into a common velocity. The tether was motionless
relative to both.</p>
<p>A black dot appeared on the hull of the other ship and expanded like
the pupil of an eye.</p>
<p>Trevize grunted. “An expanding diaphragm, instead of a sliding
panel.”</p>
<p>“Nonhuman?”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily, I suppose. But interesting.”</p>
<p>A figure emerged.</p>
<p>Pelorat’s lips tightened for a moment and then he said in a
disappointed voice, “Too bad. Human.”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily,” said Trevize calmly. “All we can make out is that
there seem to be five projections. That could be a head, two arms, and
two legs—but it might not be. —Wait!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It moves more rapidly and smoothly than I expected. —Ah!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There’s some sort of propulsion. It’s not rocketry, as nearly as I
can tell, but neither is it hand over hand. Still, not necessarily
human.”</p>
<p>There seemed an incredibly long wait despite the quick approach of
the figure along the tether, but there was finally the noise of
contact.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “It’s coming in, whatever it is. My impulse is to
tackle it the minute it appears.” He balled a fist.</p>
<p>“I think we had better relax,” said Pelorat. “It may be stronger than
we. It can control our minds. There are surely others on the ship. We
had better wait till we know more about what we are facing.”</p>
<p>“You grow more and more sensible by the minute, Janov,” said Trevize,
“and I, less and less.”</p>
<p>They could hear the airlock moving into action and finally the figure
appeared inside the ship.</p>
<p>“About normal size,” muttered Pelorat. “The space suit could fit a
human being.”</p>
<p>“I never saw or heard of such a design, but it doesn’t fall outside
the limits of human manufacture, it seems to me. —It doesn’t say
anything.”</p>
<p>The space-suited figure stood before them and a forelimb rose to the
rounded helmet, which—if it were made of glass—possessed one-way
transparency only. Nothing could be seen inside.</p>
<p>The limb touched something with a quick motion that Trevize did not
clearly make out and the helmet was at once detached from the rest of
the suit. It lifted off.</p>
<p>What was exposed was the face of a young and undeniably pretty
woman.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Pelorat’s expressionless face did what it could to look stupefied. He
said hesitantly, “Are you human?”</p>
<p>The woman’s eyebrows shot up and her lips pouted. There was no way of
telling from the action whether she was faced with a strange language
and did not understand or whether she understood and wondered at the
question.</p>
<p>Her hand moved quickly to the left side of her suit, which opened in
one piece as though it were on a set of hinges. She stepped out and the
suit remained standing without content for a moment. Then, with a soft
sigh that seemed almost human, it collapsed.</p>
<p>She looked even younger, now that she had stepped out. Her clothing
was loose and translucent, with the skimpy items beneath visible as
shadows. The outer robe reached to her knees.</p>
<p>She was small-breasted and narrow-waisted, with hips rounded and
full. Her thighs, which were seen in shadow, were generous, but her legs
narrowed to graceful ankles. Her hair was dark and shoulder-length, her
eyes brown and large, her lips full and slightly asymmetric.</p>
<p>She looked down at herself and then solved the problem of her
understanding of the language by saying, “Don’t I look human?”</p>
<p>She spoke Galactic Standard with just a trifle of hesitation, as
though she were straining a bit to get the pronunciation quite
right.</p>
<p>Pelorat nodded and said with a small smile, “I can’t deny it. Quite
human. Delightfully human.”</p>
<p>The young woman spread her arms as though inviting closer
examination. “I should hope so, gentlemen. Men have died for this
body.”</p>
<p>“I would rather live for it,” said Pelorat, finding a vein of
gallantry which faintly surprised him.</p>
<p>“Good choice,” said the woman solemnly. “Once this body is attained,
all sighs become sighs of ecstasy.”</p>
<p>She laughed and Pelorat laughed with her.</p>
<p>Trevize, whose forehead had puckered into a frown through this
exchange, rapped out, “How old are you?”</p>
<p>The woman seemed to shrink a little. “Twenty-three—gentleman.”</p>
<p>“Why have you come? What is your purpose here?”</p>
<p>“I have come to escort you to Gaia.” Her command of Galactic Standard
was slipping slightly and her vowels tended to round into diphthongs.
She made “come” sound like “comb” and “Gaia” like “Gay-uh.”</p>
<p>“A girl to escort us.”</p>
<p>The woman drew herself up and suddenly she had the bearing of one in
charge. “I,” she said, “am Gaia, as well as another. It was my stint on
the station.”</p>
<p>“Your stint? Were you the only one on board?”</p>
<p>Proudly. “I was all that was needed.”</p>
<p>“And is it empty now?”</p>
<p>“I am no longer on it, gentleman, but it is not empty. It is
there.”</p>
<p>“It? To what do you refer?”</p>
<p>“To the station. It is Gaia. It doesn’t need me. It holds your
ship.”</p>
<p>“Then what are you doing on the station?”</p>
<p>“It is my stint.”</p>
<p>Pelorat had taken Trevize by the sleeve and had been shaken off. He
tried again. “Golan,” he said in an urgent half-whisper. “Don’t shout at
her. She’s only a girl. Let me deal with this.”</p>
<p>Trevize shook his head angrily, but Pelorat said, “Young woman, what
is your name?”</p>
<p>The woman smiled with sudden sunniness, as though responding to the
softer tone. She said, “Bliss.”</p>
<p>“Bliss?” said Pelorat. “A very nice name. Surely that’s not all there
is.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. A fine thing it would be to have one syllable. It
would be duplicated on every section and we wouldn’t tell one from
another, so that the men would be dying for the wrong body.
Blisse-nobiarella is my name in full.”</p>
<p>“Now that’s a mouthful.”</p>
<p>“What? Seven syllables? That’s not much. I have friends with fifteen
syllables in their names and they never get done trying combinations for
the friend-name. I’ve stuck with Bliss now ever since I turned fifteen.
My mother called me ‘Nobby,’ if you can imagine such a thing.”</p>
<p>“In Galactic Standard, ‘bliss’ means ‘ecstasy’ or ‘extreme
happiness,’” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>“In Gaian language, too. It’s not very different from Standard, and
‘ecstasy’ is the impression I intend to convey.”</p>
<p>“My name is Janov Pelorat.”</p>
<p>“I know that. And this other gentleman—the shouter—is Golan Trevize.
We received word from Sayshell.”</p>
<p>Trevize said at once, his eyes narrow, “How did you receive
word?”</p>
<p>Bliss turned to look at him and said calmly, “I didn’t. Gaia
did.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Miss Bliss, may my partner and myself speak privately
for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly, but we have to get on with it, you know.”</p>
<p>“I won’t take long.” He pulled hard at Trevize’s elbow and was
reluctantly followed into the other room.</p>
<p>Trevize said in a whisper, “What’s all this? I’m sure she can hear us
in here. She can probably read our minds, blast the creature.”</p>
<p>“Whether she can or can’t, we need a bit of psychological isolation
for just a moment. Look, old chap, leave her alone. There’s nothing we
can do, and there’s no use taking that out on her. There’s probably
nothing she can do either. She’s just a messenger girl. Actually, as
long as she’s on board, we’re probably safe; they wouldn’t have put her
on board if they intended to destroy the ship. Keep bullying and perhaps
they will destroy it—and us—after they take her off.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like being helpless,” said Trevize grumpily.</p>
<p>“Who does? But acting like a bully doesn’t make you less helpless. It
just makes you a helpless bully. Oh, my dear chap, I don’t mean to be
bullying you like this and you must forgive me if I’m excessively
critical of you, but the girl is not to be blamed.”</p>
<p>“Janov, she’s young enough to be your youngest daughter.”</p>
<p>Pelorat straightened. “All the more reason to treat her gently. Nor
do I know what you imply by the statement.”</p>
<p>Trevize thought a moment, then his face cleared. “Very well. You’re
right. I’m wrong. It is irritating, though, to have them send a girl.
They might have sent a military officer, for instance, and given us a
sense of some value, so to speak. Just a girl? And she keeps placing
responsibility on Gaia?”</p>
<p>“She’s probably referring to a ruler who takes the name of the planet
as an honorific—or else she’s referring to the planetary council. We’ll
find out, but probably not by direct questioning.”</p>
<p>“Men have died for her body!” said Trevize. “Huh!—She’s
bottom-heavy!”</p>
<p>“No one is asking you to die for it, Golan,” said Pelorat gently.
“Come! Allow her a sense of self-mockery. I consider it amusing and
good-natured, myself.”</p>
<p>They found Bliss at the computer, bending down and staring at its
component parts with her hands behind her back as though she feared
touching it.</p>
<p>She looked up as they entered, ducking their heads under the low
lintel. “This is an amazing ship,” she said. “I don’t understand half of
what I see, but if you’re going to give me a greeting-present, this is
it. It’s beautiful. It makes my ship look awful.”</p>
<p>Her face took on a look of ardent curiosity. “Are you really from the
Foundation?”</p>
<p>“How do you know about the Foundation?” asked Pelorat.</p>
<p>“We learn about it in school. Mostly because of the Mule.”</p>
<p>“Why because of the Mule, Bliss?”</p>
<p>“He’s one of us, gentle— What syllable of your name may I use,
gentleman?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Either Jan or Pel. Which do you prefer?”</p>
<p>“He’s one of us, Pel,” said Bliss with a comradely smile. “He was
born on Gaia, but no one seems to know where exactly.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I imagine he’s a Gaian hero, Bliss, eh?” He had become
determinedly, almost aggressively, friendly and cast a placating glance
in Pelorat’s direction, “Call me Trev,” he added.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” she said at once. “He’s a criminal. He left Gaia without
permission, and no one should do that. No one knows how he did it. But
he left, and I guess that’s why he came to a bad end. The Foundation
beat him in the end.”</p>
<p>“The Second Foundation?” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“Is there more than one? I suppose if I thought about it I would
know, but I’m not interested in history, really. The way I look at it
is, I’m interested in what Gaia thinks best. If history just goes past
me, it’s because there are enough historians or that I’m not well
adapted to it. I’m probably being trained as a space technician myself.
I keep being assigned to stints like this and I seem to like it and it
stands to reason I wouldn’t like it if—”</p>
<p>She was speaking rapidly, almost breathlessly, and Trevize had to
make an effort to insert a sentence.</p>
<p>“Who’s Gaia?”</p>
<p>Bliss looked puzzled at that. “Just Gaia. —Please, Pel and Trev,
let’s get on with it. We’ve got to surface.”</p>
<p>“We’re going there, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but slowly. Gaia feels you can move much more rapidly if you
use the potential of your ship.</p>
<p>Would you do that?”</p>
<p>“We could,” said Trevize grimly. “But if I get the control of the
ship back, wouldn’t I be more likely to zoom off in the opposite
direction?”</p>
<p>Bliss laughed. “You’re funny. Of course you can’t go in any direction
Gaia doesn’t want you to go. But you can go faster in the direction Gaia
does want you to go. See?”</p>
<p>“We see,” said Trevize, “and I’ll try to control my sense of humor.
Where do I land on the surface?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. You just head downward and you’ll land at the
right place. Gaia will see to that.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “And will you stay with us, Bliss, and see that we are
treated well?”</p>
<p>“I suppose I can do that. Let’s see now, the usual fee for my
services—I mean that kind of services—can be entered on my
balance-card.”</p>
<p>“And the other kind of services?”</p>
<p>Bliss giggled. “You’re a nice old man.”</p>
<p>Pelorat winced.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Bliss reacted to the swoop down to gaia with a naïve excitement. She
said, “There’s no feeling of acceleration.”</p>
<p>“It’s a gravitic drive,” said Pelorat. “Everything accelerates
together, ourselves included, so we don’t feel anything.”</p>
<p>“But how does it work, Pel?”</p>
<p>Pelorat shrugged. “I think Trev knows,” he said, “but I don’t think
he’s really in a mood to talk about it.”</p>
<p>Trevize had dropped down Gaia’s gravity-well almost recklessly. The
ship responded to his direction, as Bliss had warned him, in a partial
manner. An attempt to cross the lines of gravitic force obliquely was
accepted—but only with a certain hesitation. An attempt to rise upward
was utterly ignored.</p>
<p>The ship was still not his.</p>
<p>Pelorat said mildly, “Aren’t you going downward rather rapidly,
Golan?”</p>
<p>Trevize, with a kind of flatness to his voice, attempting to avoid
anger (more for Pelorat’s sake, than anything else) said, “The young
lady says that Gaia will take care of us.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Surely, Pel. Gaia wouldn’t let this ship do anything
that wasn’t safe. Is there anything to eat on board?”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed,” said Pelorat. “What would you like?”</p>
<p>“No meat, Pel,” said Bliss in a businesslike way, “but I’ll take fish
or eggs, along with any vegetables you might have.”</p>
<p>“Some of the food we have is Sayshellian, Bliss,” said Pelorat. “I’m
not sure I know what’s in it, but you might like it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll taste some,” said Bliss dubiously.</p>
<p>“Are the people on Gaia vegetarian?” asked Pelorat.</p>
<p>“A lot are.” Bliss nodded her head vigorously. “It depends on what
nutrients the body needs in particular cases. Lately I haven’t been
hungry for meat, so I suppose I don’t need any. And I haven’t been
aching for anything sweet. Cheese tastes good, and shrimp. I think I
probably need to lose weight.” She slapped her right buttock with a
resounding noise. “I need to lose five or six pounds right here.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why,” said Pelorat. “It gives you something comfortable
to sit on.”</p>
<p>Bliss twisted to look down at her rear as best she might, “Oh well,
it doesn’t matter. Weight goes up or down as it ought. I shouldn’t
concern myself.”</p>
<p>Trevize was silent because he was struggling with the Far Star. He
had hesitated a bit too long for orbit and the lower limits of the
planetary exosphere were now screaming past the ship. Little by little,
the ship was escaping from his control altogether. It was as though
something else had learned to handle the gravitic engines. The Far Star,
acting apparently by itself, curved upward into thinner air and slowed
rapidly. It then took a path on its own that brought it into a gentle
downward curve.</p>
<p>Bliss had ignored the edgy sound of air resistance and sniffed
delicately at the steam rising from the container. She said, “It must be
all right, Pel, because if it weren’t, it wouldn’t smell right and I
wouldn’t want to eat it.” She put a slim finger into it and then licked
at the finger. “You guessed correctly, Pel. It’s shrimp or something
like it. Good!”</p>
<p>With a gesture of dissatisfaction, Trevize abandoned the
computer.</p>
<p>“Young woman,” he said, as though seeing her for the first time.</p>
<p>“My name is Bliss,” said Bliss firmly.</p>
<p>“Bliss, then! You knew our names.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Trev.”</p>
<p>“How did you know them?”</p>
<p>“It was important that I know them, in order for me to do my job. So
I knew them.”</p>
<p>“Do you know who Munn Li Compor is?”</p>
<p>“I would—if it were important for me to know who he is. Since I do
not know who he is, Mr. Compor is not coming here. For that matter,” she
paused a moment, “no one is coming here but you two.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see.”</p>
<p>He was looking down. It was a cloudy planet. There wasn’t a solid
layer of cloud, but it was a broken layer that was remarkably evenly
scattered and offered no clear view of any part of the planetary
surface.</p>
<p>He switched to microwave and the radarscope glittered. The surface
was almost an image of the sky. It seemed a world of islands—rather like
Terminus, but more so. None of the islands was very large and none was
very isolated. It was something of an approach to a planetary
archipelago. The ship’s orbit was well inclined to the equatorial plane,
but he saw no sign of ice caps.</p>
<p>Neither were there the unmistakable marks of uneven population
distribution, as would be expected, for instance, in the illumination of
the night side.</p>
<p>“Will I be coming down near the capital city, Bliss?” asked
Trevize.</p>
<p>Bliss said indifferently, “Gaia will put you down somewhere
convenient.”</p>
<p>“I’d prefer a big city.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean a large people-grouping?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s up to Gaia.”</p>
<p>The ship continued its downward path and Trevize tried to find
amusement in guessing on which island it would land.</p>
<p>Whichever it might be, it appeared they would be landing within the
hour.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The ship landed in a quiet, almost feathery manner, without a moment
of jarring, without one anomalous gravitational effect. They stepped
out, one by one: first Bliss, then Pelorat, and finally Trevize.</p>
<p>The weather was comparable to early summer at Terminus City. There
was a mild breeze and with what seemed to be a late-morning sun shining
brightly down from a mottled sky. The ground was green underfoot and in
one direction there were the serried rows of trees that bespoke an
orchard, while in the other there was the distant line of seashore.</p>
<p>There was the low hum of what might have been insect life, a flash of
bird—or some small flying creature—above and to one side, and the
clack-clack of what might have been some farm instrument.</p>
<p>Pelorat was the first to speak and he mentioned nothing he either saw
or heard. Instead, he drew in his breath raspingly and said, “Ah, it
smells good, like fresh-made applesauce.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “That’s probably an apple orchard we’re looking at and,
for all we know, they’re making applesauce.”</p>
<p>“On your ship, on the other hand,” said Bliss, “it smelled like—
Well, it smelled terrible.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t complain when you were on it,” growled Trevize.</p>
<p>“I had to be polite. I was a guest on your ship.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with staying polite?”</p>
<p>“I’m on my own world now. You’re the guest. You be polite.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “She’s probably right about the smell, Golan. Is there
any way of airing out the ship?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize with a snap. “It can be done—if this little
creature can assure us that the ship will not be disturbed. She has
already shown us she can exert unusual power over the ship.”</p>
<p>Bliss drew herself up to her full height. “I’m not exactly little and
if leaving your ship alone is what it takes to get it cleaned up, I
assure you leaving it alone will be a pleasure.”</p>
<p>“And then we can be taken to whoever it is that you speak of as
Gaia?” said Trevize.</p>
<p>Bliss looked amused. “I don’t know if you’re going to believe this,
Trev. I’m Gaia.”</p>
<p>Trevize stared. He had often heard the phrase, “collect one’s
thoughts” used metaphorically. For the first time in his life, he felt
as though he were engaged in the process literally. Finally he said,
“You?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And the ground. And those trees. And that rabbit over there in
the grass. And the man you can see through the trees. The whole planet
and everything on it is Gaia. We’re all individuals—we’re all separate
organisms—but we all share an overall consciousness. The inanimate
planet does so least of all, the various forms of life to a varying
degree, and human beings most of all—but we all share.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “I think, Trevize, that she means Gaia is some sort of
group consciousness.”</p>
<p>Trevize nodded. “I gathered that. —In that case, Bliss, who runs this
world?”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “It runs itself. Those trees grow in rank and file of
their own accord. They multiply only to the extent that is needed to
replace those that for any reason die. Human beings harvest the apples
that are needed; other animals, including insects, eat their share—and
only their share.”</p>
<p>“The insects know what their share is, do they?” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“Yes, they do—in a way. It rains when it is necessary and
occasionally it rains rather hard when that is necessary—and
occasionally there’s a siege of dry weather when that is necessary.”</p>
<p>“And the rain knows what to do, does it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it does,” said Bliss very seriously. “In your own body, don’t
all the different cells know what to do? When to grow and when to stop
growing? When to form certain substances and when not to—and when they
form them, just how much to form, neither more nor less? Each cell is,
to a certain extent, an independent chemical factory, but all draw from
a common fund of raw materials brought to it by a common transportation
system, all deliver wastes into common channels, and all contribute to
an overall group consciousness.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said with a certain enthusiasm. “But that’s remarkable. You
are saying that the planet is a superorganism and that you are a cell of
that superorganism.”</p>
<p>“I’m making an analogy, not an identity. We are the analog of cells,
but we are not identical with cells—do you understand?”</p>
<p>“In what way,” said Trevize, “are you not cells?”</p>
<p>“We are ourselves made up of cells and have a group consciousness, as
far as cells are concerned. This group consciousness, this consciousness
of an individual organism—a human being, in my case—”</p>
<p>“With a body men die for.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. My consciousness is far advanced beyond that of any
individual cell—incredibly far advanced. The fact that we, in turn, are
part of a still greater group consciousness on a higher level does not
reduce us to the level of cells. I remain a human being—but above us is
a group consciousness as far beyond my grasp as my consciousness is
beyond that of one of the muscle cells of my biceps.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Surely someone ordered our ship to be taken.”</p>
<p>“No, not someone! Gaia ordered it. All of us ordered it.”</p>
<p>“The trees and the ground, too, Bliss?”</p>
<p>“They contributed very little, but they contributed. Look, if a
musician writes a symphony, do you ask which particular cell in his body
ordered the symphony written and supervised its construction?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “And, I take it, the group mind, so to speak, of the
group consciousness is much stronger than an individual mind, just as a
muscle is much stronger than an individual muscle cell. Consequently
Gaia can capture our ship at a distance by controlling our computer,
even though no individual mind on the planet could have done so.”</p>
<p>“You understand perfectly, Pel,” said Bliss.</p>
<p>“And I understand it, too,” said Trevize. “It is not that hard to
understand. But what do you want of us? We have not come to attack you.
We have come seeking information. Why have you seized us?”</p>
<p>“To talk to you.”</p>
<p>“You might have talked to us on the ship.”</p>
<p>Bliss shook her head gravely, “I am not the one to do it.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you part of the group mind?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I cannot fly like a bird, buzz like an insect, or grow as
tall as a tree. I do what it is best for me to do and it is not best
that I give you the information—though the knowledge could easily be
assigned to me.”</p>
<p>“Who decided not to assign it to you?”</p>
<p>“We all did.”</p>
<p>“Who will give us the information?”</p>
<p>“Dom.”</p>
<p>“And who is Dom?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Bliss. “His full name is Endomandiovizamarondeyaso—and
so on. Different people call him different syllables at different times,
but I know him as Dom and I think you two will use that syllable as
well. He probably has a larger share of Gaia than anyone on the planet
and he lives on this island. He asked to see you and it was
allowed.”</p>
<p>“Who allowed it?” asked Trevize—and answered himself at once, “Yes, I
know; you all did.”</p>
<p>Bliss nodded.</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “When will we be seeing Dom, Bliss?”</p>
<p>“Right away. If you follow me, I’ll take you to him now, Pel. And
you, too, of course, Trev.”</p>
<p>“And will you leave, then?” asked Pelorat.</p>
<p>“You don’t want me to, Pel?”</p>
<p>“Actually, no.”</p>
<p>“There you are,” said Bliss as they followed her along a smoothly
paved road that skirted the orchard. “Men grow addicted to me on short
order. Even dignified elderly men are overcome with boyish ardor.”</p>
<p>Pelorat laughed. “I wouldn’t count on much boyish ardor, Bliss, but
if I had it I could do no worse than have it on your account, I
think.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Oh, don’t discount your boyish ardor. I work
wonders.”</p>
<p>Trevize said impatiently, “Once we get to where we’re going, how long
will we have to wait for this Dom?”</p>
<p>“He will be waiting for you. After all, Dom-through-Gaia has worked
for years to bring you here.”</p>
<p>Trevize stopped in midstep and looked quickly at Pelorat, who quietly
mouthed: You were right.</p>
<p>Bliss, who was looking straight ahead, said calmly, “I know, Trev,
that you have suspected that I we Gaia was interested in you.”</p>
<p>“ ‘I we Gaia?’ ” said Pelorat softly.</p>
<p>She turned to smile at him. “We have a whole complex of different
pronouns to express the shades of individuality that exist on Gaia. I
could explain them to you, but till then ‘I we Gaia’ gets across what I
mean in a groping sort of way. —Please move on, Trev. Dom is waiting and
I don’t wish to force your legs to move against your will. It is an
uncomfortable feeling if you’re not used to it.”</p>
<p>Trevize moved on. His glance at Bliss was compounded of the deepest
suspicion.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Dom was an elderly man. He recited the two hundred and fifty-three
syllables of his name in a musical flowing of tone and emphasis.</p>
<p>“In a way,” he said, “it is a brief biography of myself. It tells the
hearer—or reader, or senser—who I am, what part I have played in the
whole, what I have accomplished. For fifty years and more, however, I
have been satisfied to be referred to as Dom. When there are other Doms
at issue, I can be called Domandio—and in my various professional
relationships other variants are used. Once a Gaian year—on my
birthday—my full name is recited-in-mind, as I have just recited it for
you in voice. It is very effective, but it is personally
embarrassing.”</p>
<p>He was tall and thin—almost to the point of emaciation. His deep-set
eyes sparkled with anomalous youth, though he moved rather slowly. His
jutting nose was thin and long and flared at the nostrils. His hands,
prominently veined though they were, showed no signs of arthritic
disability. He wore a long robe that was as gray as his hair. It
descended to his ankles and his sandals left his toes bare.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “How old are you, sir?”</p>
<p>“Please address me as Dom, Trev. To use other modes of address
induces formality and inhibits the free exchange of ideas between you
and me. In Galactic Standard Years, I am just past ninety-three, but the
real celebration will come not very many months from now, when I reach
the ninetieth anniversary of my birth in Gaian years.”</p>
<p>“I would have not have guessed you at more than seventy-five, s—Dom,”
said Trevize.</p>
<p>“By Gaian standards I am not remarkable, either in years or in
appearance of years, Trev. —But come, have we eaten?”</p>
<p>Pelorat looked down at his plate, on which perceptible remnants of a
most unremarkable and indifferently prepared meal remained, and said in
a diffident manner, “Dom, may I attempt to ask an embarrassing question?
Of course, if it’s offensive, you will please say so, and I will
withdraw it.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” said Dom, smiling. “I am anxious to explain to you
anything about Gaia which arouses your curiosity.”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Trevize at once.</p>
<p>“Because you are honored guests— May I have Pel’s question?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Since all things on Gaia share in the group
consciousness, how is it that you—one element of the group—can eat this,
which was clearly another element?”</p>
<p>“True! But all things recycle. We must eat and everything we can eat,
plant as well as animal—even the inanimate seasonings—are part of Gaia.
But, then, you see, nothing is killed for pleasure or sport, nothing is
killed with unnecessary pain. And I’m afraid we make no attempt to
glorify our meal preparations, for no Gaian would eat except that one
must. You did not enjoy this meal, Pel? Trev? Well, meals are not to
enjoy.</p>
<p>“Then, too, what is eaten remains, after all, part of the planetary
consciousness. Insofar as portions of it are incorporated into my body,
it will participate in a larger share of the total consciousness. When I
die, I, too, will be eaten—even if only by decay bacteria—and I will
then participate in a far smaller share of the total. But someday, parts
of me will be parts of other human beings, parts of many.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “A sort of transmigration of souls.”</p>
<p>“Of what, Pel?”</p>
<p>“I speak of an old myth that is current on some worlds.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I don’t know of it. You must tell me on some occasion.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “But your individual consciousness—whatever it is about
you that is Dom—will never fully reassemble.”</p>
<p>“No, of course not. But does that matter? I will be part of Gaia and
that is what counts. There are mystics among us who wonder if we should
take measures to develop group memories of past existences, but the
sense-of-Gaia is that this cannot be done in any practical way and would
serve no useful purpose. It would merely blur present consciousness. —Of
course, as conditions change, the sense-of-Gaia may change, too, but I
find no chance of that in the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>“Why must you die, Dom?” asked Trevize. “Look at you in your
nineties. Could not the group consciousness—”</p>
<p>For the first time, Dom frowned. “Never,” he said. “I can contribute
only so much. Each new individual is a reshuffling of molecules and
genes into something new. New talents, new abilities, new contributions
to Gaia. We must have them—and the only way we can is to make room. I
have done more than most, but even I have my limit and it is
approaching. There is no more desire to live past one’s time than to die
before it.”</p>
<p>And then, as if realizing he had lent a suddenly somber note to the
evening, he rose and stretched his arms out to the two. “Come,
Trev—Pel—let us move into my studio where I can show you some of my
personal art objects. You won’t blame an old man for his little
vanities, I hope.”</p>
<p>He led the way into another room where, on a small circular table,
there was a group of smoky lenses connected in pairs.</p>
<p>“These,” said Dom, “are Participations I have designed. I am not one
of the masters, but I specialize in inanimates, which few of the masters
bother with.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “May I pick one up? Are they fragile?”</p>
<p>“No no. Bounce them on the floor if you like.—Or perhaps you had
better not. Concussion could dull the sharpness of the vision.”</p>
<p>“How are they used, Dom?”</p>
<p>“You put them over your eyes. They’ll cling. They do not transmit
light. Quite the contrary. They obscure light that might otherwise
distract you—though the sensations do reach your brain by way of the
optic nerve. Essentially your consciousness is sharpened and is allowed
to participate in other facets of Gaia. In other words, if you look at
that wall, you will experience that wall as it appears to itself.”</p>
<p>“Fascinating,” muttered Pelorat. “May I try that?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Pel. You may take one at random. Each is a different
construct that shows the wall—or any other inanimate object you look
at—in a different aspect of the object’s consciousness.”</p>
<p>Pelorat placed one pair over his eyes and they clung there at once.
He started at the touch and then remained motionless for a long
time.</p>
<p>Dom said, “When you are through, place your hands on either side of
the Participation and press them toward each other. It will come right
off.”</p>
<p>Pelorat did so, blinked his eyes rapidly, then rubbed them.</p>
<p>Dom said, “What did you experience?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “It’s hard to describe. The wall seemed to twinkle and
glisten and, at times, it seemed to turn fluid. It seemed to have ribs
and changing symmetries. I—I’m sorry, Dom, but I did not find it
attractive.”</p>
<p>Dom sighed. “You do not participate in Gaia, so you would not see
what we see. I had rather feared that. Too bad! I assure you that
although these Participations are enjoyed primarily for their aesthetic
value, they have their practical uses, too. A happy wall is a long-lived
wall, a practical wall, a useful wall.”</p>
<p>“A happy wall?” said Trevize, smiling slightly.</p>
<p>Dom said, “There is a dim sensation that a wall experiences that is
analogous to what ‘happy’ means to us. A wall is happy when it is well
designed, when it rests firmly on its foundation, when its symmetry
balances its part and produces no unpleasant stresses. Good design can
be worked out on the mathematical principles of mechanics, but the use
of a proper Participation can fine tune it down to virtually atomic
dimensions. No sculptor can possibly produce a first-class work of art
here on Gaia without a well-crafted Participation and the ones I produce
of this particular type are considered excellent—if I do say so
myself.</p>
<p>“Animate Participations, which are not my field,” and Dom was going
on with the kind of excitement one expects in someone riding his hobby,
“give us, by analogy, a direct experience of ecological balance. The
ecological balance on Gaia is rather simple, as it is on all worlds, but
here, at least, we have the hope of making it more complex and thus
enriching the total consciousness enormously.”</p>
<p>Trevize held up his hand in order to forestall Pelorat and wave him
into silence. He said, “How do you know that a planet can bear a more
complex ecological balance if they all have simple ones?”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Dom, his eyes twinkling shrewdly, “you are testing the old
man. You know as well as I do that the original home of humanity, Earth,
had an enormously complex ecological balance. It is only the secondary
worlds—the derived worlds—that are simple.”</p>
<p>Pelorat would not be kept silent. “But that is the problem I have set
myself in life. Why was it only Earth that bore a complex ecology? What
distinguished it from other worlds? Why did millions upon millions of
other worlds in the Galaxy—worlds that were capable of bearing
life—develop only an undistinguished vegetation, together with small and
unintelligent animal life-forms?”</p>
<p>Dom said, “We have a tale about that—a fable, perhaps. I cannot vouch
for its authenticity. In fact, on the face of it, it sounds like
fiction.”</p>
<p>It was at this point that Bliss—who had not participated in the
meal—entered, smiling at Pelorat. She was wearing a silvery blouse, very
sheer.</p>
<p>Pelorat rose at once. “I thought you had left us.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I had reports to make out, work to do. May I join you
now, Dom?”</p>
<p>Dom had also risen (though Trevize remained seated). “You are
entirely welcome and you ravish these aged eyes.”</p>
<p>“It is for your ravishment that I put on this blouse. Pel is above
such things and Trev dislikes them.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “If you think I am above such things, Bliss, I may
surprise you someday.”</p>
<p>“What a delightful surprise that would be,” Bliss said, and sat down.
The two men did as well. “Please don’t let me interrupt you.”</p>
<p>Dom said, “I was about to tell our guests the story of Eternity. —To
understand it, you must first understand that there are many different
Universes that can exist—virtually an infinite number. Every single
event that takes place can take place or not take place, or can take
place in this fashion or in that fashion, and each of an enormous number
of alternatives will result in a future course of events that are
distinct to at least some degree.</p>
<p>“Bliss might not have come in just now; or she might have been with
us a little earlier; or much earlier; or having come in now, she might
have worn a different blouse; or even in this blouse, she might not have
smiled roguishly at elderly men as is their kindhearted custom. In each
of these alternatives—or in each of a very large number of other
alternatives of this one event—the Universe would have taken a different
track thereafter, and so on for every other variation of every other
event, however minor.”</p>
<p>Trevize stirred restlessly. “I believe this is a common speculation
in quantum mechanics—a very ancient one, in fact.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you’ve heard of it. But let us go on. Imagine it is possible for
human beings to freeze all the infinite number of Universes, to step
from one to another at will, and to choose which one should be made
‘real’—whatever that word means in this connection.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I hear your words and can even imagine the concept you
describe, but I cannot make myself believe that anything like this could
ever happen.”</p>
<p>“Nor I, on the whole,” said Dom, “which is why I say that it would
all seem to be a fable. Nevertheless, the fable states that there were
those who could step out of time and examine the endless strands of
potential reality. These people were called the Eternals and when they
were out of time they were said to be in Eternity.</p>
<p>“It was their task to choose a Reality that would be most suitable to
humanity. They modified endlessly—and the story goes into great detail,
for I must tell you that it has been written in the form of an epic of
inordinate length. Eventually they found (or it is said) a Universe in
which Earth was the only planet in the entire Galaxy on which could be
found a complex ecological system, together with the development of an
intelligent species capable of working out a high technology.</p>
<p>“That, they decided, was the situation in which humanity could be
most secure. They froze that strand of events as Reality and then ceased
operations. Now we live in a Galaxy that has been settled by human
beings only, and, to a large extent, by the plants, animals, and
microscopic life that they carry with them—voluntarily or
inadvertently—from planet to planet and which usually overwhelm the
indigenous life.</p>
<p>“Somewhere in the dim mists of probability there are other Realities
in which the Galaxy is host to many intelligences, but they are
unreachable. We in our Reality are alone. From every action and every
event in our Reality, there are new branches that set off, with only one
in each separate case being a continuation of Reality, so that there are
vast numbers of potential Universes—perhaps an infinite number—stemming
from ours, but all of them are presumably alike in containing the
one-intelligence Galaxy in which we live. —Or perhaps I should say that
all but a vanishingly small percentage are alike in this way, for it is
dangerous to rule out anything where the possibilities approach the
infinite.”</p>
<p>He stopped, shrugged slightly, and added, “At least, that’s the
story. It dates back to before the founding of Gaia. I don’t vouch for
its truth.”</p>
<p>The three others had listened intently. Bliss nodded her head, as
though it were something she had heard before and she were checking the
accuracy of Dom’s account.</p>
<p>Pelorat reacted with a silent solemnity for the better part of a
minute and then balled his fist and brought it down upon the arm of his
chair.</p>
<p>“No,” he said in a strangled voice, “that affects nothing. There’s no
way of demonstrating the truth of the story by observation or by reason,
so it can’t ever be anything but a piece of speculation, but aside from
that— Suppose it’s true! The Universe we live in is still one in which
only Earth has developed a rich life and an intelligent species, so that
in this Universe—whether it is the all-in-all or only one out of an
infinite number of possibilities—there must be something unique in the
nature of the planet Earth. We should still want to know what that
uniqueness is.”</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, it was Trevize who finally stirred and
shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, Janov,” he said, “that’s not the way it works. Let us say that
the chances are one in a billion trillion—one in 1021—that out of the
billion of habitable planets in the Galaxy only Earth—through the
workings of sheer chance—would happen to develop a rich ecology and,
eventually, intelligence. If that is so, then one in 1021 of the various
strands of potential Realities would represent such a Galaxy and the
Eternals picked it. We live, therefore, in a Universe in which Earth is
the only planet to develop a complex ecology, an intelligent species, a
high technology—not because there is something special about Earth, but
because simply by chance it developed on Earth and nowhere else.</p>
<p>“I suppose, in fact,” Trevize went on thoughtfully, “that there are
strands of Reality in which only Gaia has developed an intelligent
species, or only Sayshell, or only Terminus, or only some plane which in
this Reality happens to bear no life at all. And all of these very
special cases are a vanishingly small percentage of the total number of
Realities in which there is more than one intelligent species in the
Galaxy. —I suppose that if the Eternals had looked long enough they
would have found a potential strand of Reality in which every single
habitable planet had developed an intelligent species.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Might you not also argue that a Reality had been found
in which Earth was for some reason not as it was in other strands, but
specially suited in some way for the development of intelligence? In
fact, you can go further and say that a Reality had been found in which
the whole Galaxy was not as it was in other strands, but was somehow in
such a state of development that only Earth could produce
intelligence.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “You might argue so, but I would suppose that my
version makes more sense.”</p>
<p>“That’s a purely subjective decision, of course—” began Pelorat with
some heat, but Dom interrupted, saying, “This is logic-chopping. Come,
let us not spoil what is proving, at least for me, a pleasant and
leisurely evening.”</p>
<p>Pelorat endeavored to relax and to allow his heat to drain away. He
smiled finally and said, “As you say, Dom.”</p>
<p>Trevize, who had been casting glances at Bliss, who sat with mocking
demurity, hands in her lap, now said, “And how did this world come to
be, Dom? Gaia, with its group consciousness?”</p>
<p>Dom’s old head leaned back and he laughed in a high-pitched manner.
His face crinkled as he said, “Fables again! I think about that
sometimes, when I read what records we have on human history. No matter
how carefully records are kept and filed and computerized, they grow
fuzzy with time. Stories grow by accretion. Tales accumulate—like dust.
The longer the time lapse, the dustier the history—until it degenerates
into fables.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “We historians are familiar with the process, Dom.
There is a certain preference for the fable. ‘The falsely dramatic
drives out the truly dull,’ said Liebel Gennerat about fifteen centuries
ago. It’s called Gennerat’s Law now.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” said Dom. “And I thought the notion was a cynical invention
of my own. Well, Gennerat’s Law fills our past history with glamour and
uncertainty. —Do you know what a robot is?”</p>
<p>“We found out on Sayshell,” said Trevize dryly.</p>
<p>“You saw one?”</p>
<p>“No. We were asked the question and, when we answered in the
negative, it was explained to us.”</p>
<p>“I understand. —Humanity once lived with robots, you know, but it
didn’t work well.”</p>
<p>“So we were told.”</p>
<p>“The robots were deeply indoctrinated with what are called the Three
Laws of Robotics, which date back into prehistory. There are several
versions of what those Three Laws might have been. The orthodox view has
the following reading: ‘1) A robot may not harm a human being or,
through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2) A robot must
obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would
conflict with the First Law; 3) A robot must protect its own existence,
as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second
Law.’</p>
<p>“As robots grew more intelligent and versatile, they interpreted
these Laws, especially the all-overriding First, more and more
generously and assumed, to a greater and greater degree, the role of
protector of humanity. The protection stifled people and grew
unbearable.</p>
<p>“The robots were entirely kind. Their labors were clearly humane and
were meant entirely for the benefit of all—which somehow made them all
the more unbearable.</p>
<p>“Every robotic advance made the situation worse. Robots were
developed with telepathic capacity, but that meant that even human
thought could be monitored, so that human behavior became still more
dependent on robotic oversight.</p>
<p>“Again robots grew steadily more like human beings in appearance, but
they were unmistakably robots in behavior and being humanoid made them
more repulsive. So, of course, it had to come to an end.”</p>
<p>“Why ‘of course?’” asked Pelorat, who had been listening
intently.</p>
<p>Dom said, “It’s a matter of following the logic to the bitter end.
Eventually, the robots grew advanced enough to become just sufficiently
human to appreciate why human beings should resent being deprived of
everything human in the name of their own good. In the long run, the
robots were forced to decide that humanity might be better off caring
for themselves, however carelessly and ineffectively.</p>
<p>“Therefore, it is said, it was the robots who established Eternity
somehow and became the Eternals. They located a Reality in which they
felt that human beings could be as secure as possible—alone in the
Galaxy. Then, having done what they could to guard us and in order to
fulfill the First Law in the truest sense, the robots of their own
accord ceased to function and ever since we have been human
beings—advancing, however we can, alone.”</p>
<p>Dom paused. He looked from Trevize to Pelorat, and then said, “Well,
do you believe all that?”</p>
<p>Trevize shook his head slowly. “No. There is nothing like this in any
historical record I have ever heard of. How about you, Janov?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “There are myths that are similar in some ways.”</p>
<p>“Come, Janov, there are myths that would match anything that any of
us can make up, given sufficiently ingenious interpretation. I’m talking
about history—reliable records.”</p>
<p>“Oh well. Nothing there, as far as I know.”</p>
<p>Dom said, “I’m not surprised. Before the robots withdrew, many
parties of human beings left to colonize robotless worlds in deeper
space, in order to take their own measures of freedom. They came
particularly from overcrowded Earth, with its long history of resistance
to robots. The new worlds were founded fresh and they did not even want
to remember their bitter humiliation as children under robot nursemaids.
They kept no records of it and they forgot.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “This is unlikely.”</p>
<p>Pelorat turned to him. “No, Golan. It’s not at all unlikely.
Societies create their own history and tend to wipe out lowly
beginnings, either by forgetting them or inventing totally fictitious
heroic rescues. The Imperial government made attempts to suppress
knowledge of the pre-Imperial past in order to strengthen the mystic
aura of eternal rule. Then, too, there are almost no records of the days
before hyperspatial travel—and you know that the very existence of Earth
is unknown to most people today.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “You can’t have it both ways, Janov. If the Galaxy has
forgotten the robots, how is it that Gaia remembers?”</p>
<p>Bliss intervened with a sudden lilt of soprano laughter. “We’re
different.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Trevize. “In what way?”</p>
<p>Dom said, “Now, Bliss, leave this to me. We are different, men of
Terminus. Of all the refugee groups fleeing from robotic domination, we
who eventually reached Gaia (following in the track of others who
reached Sayshell) were the only ones who had learned the craft of
telepathy from the robots.</p>
<p>“It is a craft, you know. It is inherent in the human mind, but it
must be developed in a very subtle and difficult manner. It takes many
generations to reach its full potential, but once well begun, it feeds
on itself. We have been at it for over twenty thousand years and the
sense-of-Gaia is that full potential has even now not been reached. It
was long ago that our development of telepathy made us aware of group
consciousness—first only of human beings; then animals; then plants; and
finally, not many centuries ago, the inanimate structure of the planet
itself.</p>
<p>“Because we traced this back to the robots, we did not forget them.
We considered them not our nursemaids but our teachers. We felt they had
opened our mind to something we would never for one moment want them
closed to. We remember them with gratitude.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “But just as once you were children to the robots, now
you are children to the group consciousness. Have you not lost humanity
now, as you had then?”</p>
<p>“It is different, Trev. What we do now is our own choice—our own
choice. That is what counts. It is not forced on us from outside, but is
developed from the inside. It is something we never forget. And we are
different in another way, too. We are unique in the Galaxy. There is no
world like Gaia.”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure?”</p>
<p>“We would know, Trev. We would detect a world consciousness such as
ours even at the other end of the Galaxy. We can detect the beginnings
of such a consciousness in your Second Foundation, for instance, though
not until two centuries ago.”</p>
<p>“At the time of the Mule?”</p>
<p>“Yes. One of ours.” Dom looked grim. “He was an aberrant and he left
us. We were naïve enough to think that was not possible, so we did not
act in time to stop him. Then, when we turned our attention to the
Outside Worlds, we became aware of what you call the Second Foundation
and we left it to them.”</p>
<p>Trevize stared blankly for several moments, then muttered, “There go
our history books!” He shook his head and said in a louder tone of
voice, “That was rather cowardly of Gaia, wasn’t it, to do so?” said
Trevize. “He was your responsibility.”</p>
<p>“You are right. But once we finally turned our eyes upon the Galaxy,
we saw what until then we had been blind to, so that the tragedy of the
Mule proved a lifesaving matter to us. It was then that we recognized
that eventually a dangerous crisis would come upon us. And it has—but
not before we were able to take measures, thanks to the incident of the
Mule.”</p>
<p>“What sort of crisis?”</p>
<p>“One that threatens us with destruction.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that. You held off the Empire, the Mule, and
Sayshell. You have a group consciousness that can pluck a ship out of
space at a distance of millions of kilometers. What can you have to
fear? —Look at Bliss. She doesn’t look the least bit perturbed. She
doesn’t think there’s a crisis.”</p>
<p>Bliss had placed one shapely leg over the arm of the chair and
wriggled her toes at him. “Of course I’m not worried, Trev. You’ll
handle it.”</p>
<p>Trev said forcefully, “Me?”</p>
<p>Dom said, “Gaia has brought you here by means of a hundred gentle
manipulations. It is you who must face our crisis.”</p>
<p>Trev stared at him and slowly his face turned from stupefaction into
gathering rage. “Me? Why, in all of space, me? I have nothing to do with
this.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, Trev,” said Dom with an almost hypnotic calmness,
“you. Only you. In all of space, only you.”</p>
