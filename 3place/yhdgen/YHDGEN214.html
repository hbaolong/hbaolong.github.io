<h4 id="section">76</h4>
<p>Raych was eating, licking his fingers, and crumpling the bag in which
the food—whatever it was—had been. A strong smell of onions pervaded the
air—different somehow, yeast-based perhaps.</p>
<p>Dors, retreating a little from the odor, said, “Where did you get the
food from, Raych?”</p>
<p>“Davan’s guys. They brought it to me. Davan’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Then we don’t have to buy you dinner, do we?” said Seldon, conscious
of his own empty stomach.</p>
<p>“Ya owe me somethin’,” said Raych, looking greedily in Dors’s
direction. “How about the lady’s knife? One of ’em.”</p>
<p>“No knife,” said Dors. “You get us back safely and I’ll give you five
credits.”</p>
<p>“Can’t get no knife for five credits,” grumbled Raych.</p>
<p>“You’re not getting anything but five credits,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“You’re a lousy dame, lady,” said Raych.</p>
<p>“I’m a lousy dame with a quick knife, Raych, so get moving.”</p>
<p>“All right. Don’t get all perspired.” Raych waved his hand. “This
way.”</p>
<p>It was back through the empty corridors, but this time Dors, looking
this way and that, stopped. “Hold on, Raych. We’re being followed.”</p>
<p>Raych looked exasperated. “Ya ain’t supposed to hear ’em.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, bending his head to one side, “I don’t hear
anything.”</p>
<p>“I do,” said Dors. “Now, Raych, I don’t want any fooling around. You
tell me right now what’s going on or I’ll rap your head so that you
won’t see straight for a week. I mean it.”</p>
<p>Raych held up one arm defensively. “You try it, you lousy dame. You
try it. —It’s Davan’s guys. They’re just taking care of us, in case any
knifers come along.”</p>
<p>“Davan’s guys?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. They’re goin’ along the service corridors.”</p>
<p>Dors’s right hand shot out and seized Raych by the scruff of his
upper garment. She lifted and he dangled, shouting, “Hey, lady.
Hey!”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Dors! Don’t be hard on him.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be harder still if I think he’s lying. You’re my charge, Hari,
not he.”</p>
<p>“I’m not lyin’,” said Raych, struggling. “I’m not.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he isn’t,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll see. Raych, tell them to come out where we can see
them.” She let him drop and dusted her hands.</p>
<p>“You’re some kind of nut, lady,” said Raych aggrievedly. Then he
raised his voice. “Yay, Davan! Come out here, some of ya guys!”</p>
<p>There was a wait and then, from an unlit opening along the corridor,
two dark-mustached men came out, one with a scar running the length of
his cheek. Each held the sheath of a knife in his hand, blade
withdrawn.</p>
<p>“How many more of you are there?” asked Dors harshly.</p>
<p>“A few,” said one of the newcomers. “Orders. We’re guarding you.
Davan wants you safe.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Try to be even quieter. Raych, keep on moving.”</p>
<p>Raych said sulkily, “Ya roughed me up when I was telling the
truth.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” said Dors. “At least, I think you’re right … and I
apologize.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I should accept,” said Raych, trying to stand tall.
“But awright, just this once.” He moved on.</p>
<p>When they reached the walkway, the unseen corps of guards vanished.
At least, even Dors’s keen ears could hear them no more. By now, though,
they were moving into the respectable part of the sector.</p>
<p>Dors said thoughtfully, “I don’t think we have clothes that would fit
you, Raych.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “Why do ya want clothes to fit me, Missus?”
(Respectability seemed to invade Raych once they were out of the
corridors.) “I got clothes.”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d like to come into our place and take a bath.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “What for? I’ll wash one o’ these days. And I’ll put on
my other shirt.” He looked up at Dors shrewdly. “You’re sorry ya roughed
me up. Right? Ya tryin’ to make up?”</p>
<p>Dors smiled. “Yes. Sort of.”</p>
<p>Raych waved a hand in lordly fashion. “That’s all right. Ya didn’t
hurt. Listen. You’re strong for a lady. Ya lifted me up like I was
nothin’.”</p>
<p>“I was annoyed, Raych. I have to be concerned about Master
Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Ya sort of his bodyguard?” Raych looked at Seldon inquiringly. “Ya
got a lady for a bodyguard?”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it,” said Seldon, smiling wryly. “She insists. And she
certainly knows her job.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Think again, Raych. Are you sure you won’t have a bath? A
nice warm bath.”</p>
<p>Raych said, “I got no chance. Ya think that lady is gonna let me in
the house again?”</p>
<p>Dors looked up and saw Casilia Tisalver outside the front door of the
apartment complex, staring first at the Outworld woman and then at the
slum-bred boy. It would have been impossible to tell in which case her
expression was angrier.</p>
<p>Raych said, “Well, so long, Mister and Missus. I don’t know if she’ll
let either of ya in the house.” He placed his hands in his pocket and
swaggered off in a fine affectation of carefree indifference.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Good evening, Mistress Tisalver. It’s rather late,
isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s very late,” she replied. “There was a near riot today outside
this very complex because of that newsman you pushed the street vermin
at.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t push anyone on anyone,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“I was there,” said Mistress Tisalver intransigently. “I saw it.” She
stepped aside to let them enter, but delayed long enough to make her
reluctance quite plain.</p>
<p>“She acts as though that was the last straw,” said Dors as she and
Seldon made their way up to their rooms.</p>
<p>“So? What can she do about it?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” said Dors.</p>
<p>RAYCH—… According to Hari Seldon, the original meeting with Raych was
entirely accidental. He was simply a gutter urchin from whom Seldon had
asked directions. But his life, from that moment on, continued to be
intertwined with that of the great mathematician until …</p>
