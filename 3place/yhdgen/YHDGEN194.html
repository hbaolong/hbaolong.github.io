<h4 id="section">56</h4>
<p>They were not noticed.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili repeated the trip of the day before and
this time no one gave them a second look. Hardly anyone even gave them a
first look. On several occasions, they had to tuck their knees to one
side to allow someone sitting on an inner seat to get past them and out.
When someone got in, they quickly realized they had to move over if
there was an inner empty seat.</p>
<p>This time they quickly grew tired of the smell of kirtles that were
not freshly laundered because they were not so easily diverted by what
went on outside.</p>
<p>But eventually they were there.</p>
<p>“That’s the library,” said Seldon in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I suppose so,” said Dors. “At least that’s the building that
Mycelium Seventy-Two pointed out yesterday.”</p>
<p>They sauntered toward it leisurely.</p>
<p>“Take a deep breath,” said Seldon. “This is the first hurdle.”</p>
<p>The door ahead was open, the light within subdued. There were five
broad stone steps leading upward. They stepped onto the lowermost one
and waited several moments before they realized that their weight did
not cause the steps to move upward. Dors grimaced very slightly and
gestured Seldon upward.</p>
<p>Together they walked up the stairs, feeling embarrassed on behalf of
Mycogen for its backwardness. Then, through a door, where, at a desk
immediately inside was a man bent over the simplest and clumsiest
computer Seldon had ever seen.</p>
<p>The man did not look up at them. No need, Seldon supposed. White
kirtle, bald head—all Mycogenians looked so nearly the same that one’s
eyes slid off them and that was to the tribespeople’s advantage at the
moment.</p>
<p>The man, who still seemed to be studying something on the desk, said,
“Scholars?”</p>
<p>“Scholars,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>The man jerked his head toward a door. “Go in. Enjoy.”</p>
<p>They moved inward and, as nearly as they could see, they were the
only ones in this section of the library. Either the library was not a
popular resort or the scholars were few or—most likely—both.</p>
<p>Seldon whispered, “I thought surely we would have to present some
sort of license or permission form and I would have to plead having
forgotten it.”</p>
<p>“He probably welcomes our presence under any terms. Did you ever see
a place like this? If a place, like a person, could be dead, we would be
inside a corpse.”</p>
<p>Most of the books in this section were print-books like the Book in
Seldon’s inner pocket. Dors drifted along the shelves, studying them.
She said, “Old books, for the most part. Part classic. Part
worthless.”</p>
<p>“Outside books? Non-Mycogen, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. If they have their own books, they must be kept in another
section. This one is for outside research for poor little self-styled
scholars like yester day’s. —This is the reference department and here’s
an Imperial Encyclopedia … must be fifty years old if a day … and a
computer.”</p>
<p>She reached for the keys and Seldon stopped her. “Wait. Something
could go wrong and we’ll be delayed.”</p>
<p>He pointed to a discreet sign above a free-standing set of shelves
that glowed with the letters TO THE SACR TORIUM. The second A in
SACRATORIUM was dead, possibly recently or possibly because no one
cared. (The Empire, thought Sheldon, was in decay. All parts of it.
Mycogen too.)</p>
<p>He looked about. The poor library, so necessary to Mycogenian pride,
perhaps so useful to the Elders who could use it to find crumbs to shore
up their own beliefs and present them as being those of sophisticated
tribespeople, seemed to be completely empty. No one had entered after
them.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Let’s step in here, out of eyeshot of the man at the
door, and put on our sashes.”</p>
<p>And then, at the door, aware suddenly there would be no turning back
if they passed this second hurdle, he said, “Dors, don’t come in with
me.”</p>
<p>She frowned. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“It’s not safe and I don’t want you to be at risk.”</p>
<p>“I am here to protect you,” she said with soft firmness.</p>
<p>“What kind of protection can you be? I can protect myself, though you
may not think it. And I’d be handicapped by having to protect you. Don’t
you see that?”</p>
<p>“You mustn’t be concerned about me, Hari,” said Dors. “Concern is my
part.” She tapped her sash where it crossed in the space between her
obscured breasts.</p>
<p>“Because Hummin asked you to?”</p>
<p>“Because those are my orders.”</p>
<p>She seized Seldon’s arms just above his elbow and, as always, he was
surprised by her firm grip. She said, “I’m against this, Hari, but if
you feel you must go in, then I must go in too.”</p>
<p>“All right, then. But if anything happens and you can wriggle out of
it, run. Don’t worry about me.”</p>
<p>“You’re wasting your breath, Hari. And you’re insulting me.”</p>
<p>Seldon touched the entrance panel and the portal slid open. Together,
almost in unison, they walked through.</p>
