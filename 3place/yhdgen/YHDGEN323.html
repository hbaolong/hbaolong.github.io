<h4 id="section">14</h4>
<p>They were back at Streeling now and Seldon’s leg was stretched out on
a hassock.</p>
<p>Raych looked at him somberly. “Dad,” he began, “you’re not to go
walking around Trantor on your own from now on.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “Why, because of one incident?”</p>
<p>“It was enough of an incident. You can’t take care of yourself any
longer. You’re seventy years old and your right leg will not support you
in an emergency. And you have enemies—”</p>
<p>“Enemies!”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed. And you know it. Those sewer rats were not after simply
anyone. They were not looking for just any unwary person to rip off.
They identified you by calling out, ‘Psychohistory!’ And they called you
a creep. Why do you suppose that was?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know why.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you live in a world all your own, Dad, and you don’t
know what’s going on on Trantor. Don’t you suppose the Trantorians know
that their world is going downhill at a rapid rate? Don’t you suppose
they know that your psychohistory has been predicting this for years?
Doesn’t it occur to you that they may blame the messenger for the
message? If things go bad—and they are going bad—there are many who
think that you are responsible for it.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that.”</p>
<p>“Why do you suppose there’s a faction at the Galactic Library that
wants you out of there? They don’t want to be in the way when you are
mobbed. So—you’ve got to take care of yourself. You can’t go out alone.
I’ll have to be with you or you will have to have bodyguards. That’s the
way it’s going to be, Dad.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked dreadfully unhappy.</p>
<p>Raych softened and said, “But not for long, Dad. I’ve got a new
job.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up. “A new job. What kind?”</p>
<p>“Teaching. At a University.”</p>
<p>“Which University?”</p>
<p>“Santanni.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s lips trembled. “Santanni! That’s nine thousand parsecs away
from Trantor. It’s a provincial world on the other side of the
Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s why I want to go there. I’ve been on Trantor all my
life, Dad, and I’m tired of it. There’s no world in all the Empire
that’s deteriorating the way Trantor is. It’s become a haunt of crime
with no one to protect us. The economy is limping, the technology is
failing. Santanni, on the other hand, is a decent world, still humming
along, and I want to be there to build a new life, along with Manella
and Wanda and Bellis. We’re all going there in two months.”</p>
<p>“All of you!”</p>
<p>“And you, Dad. And you. We wouldn’t leave you behind on Trantor.
You’re coming with us to Santanni.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “Impossible, Raych. You know that.”</p>
<p>“Why impossible?”</p>
<p>“You know why. The Project. My psychohistory. Are you asking me to
abandon my life’s work?”</p>
<p>“Why not? It’s abandoned you.”</p>
<p>“You’re mad.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. Where are you going with it? You have no credits. You
can’t get any. There’s no one left on Trantor who’s willing to support
you.”</p>
<p>“For nearly forty years—”</p>
<p>“Yes, I admit that. But after all that time, you’ve failed, Dad.
There’s no crime in failing. You’ve tried so hard and you’ve gone so
far, but you’ve run into a deteriorating economy, a falling Empire. It’s
the very thing you’ve been predicting for so long that’s stopping you at
last. So—”</p>
<p>“No. I will not stop. Somehow or other, I will keep going.”</p>
<p>“I tell you what, Dad. If you’re really going to be so stubborn, then
take psychohistory with you. Start it again on Santanni. There may be
enough credits—and enthusiasm—to support it there.”</p>
<p>“And the men and women who have been working for me so
faithfully?”</p>
<p>“Oh bull, Dad. They’ve been leaving you because you can’t pay them.
You hang around here for the rest of your life and you’ll be alone. —Oh,
come on, Dad. Do you think I like to talk to you this way? It’s because
no one had wanted to—because no one has had the heart to—that you’re in
your present predicament. Let’s be honest with each other now. When you
walk the streets of Trantor and you’re attacked for no reason other than
that you’re Hari Seldon, don’t you think it’s time for a little bit of
truth?”</p>
<p>“Never mind the truth. I have no intention of leaving Trantor.”</p>
<p>Raych shook his head. “I was sure you’d be stubborn, Dad. You’ve got
two months to change your mind. Think about it, will you?”</p>
