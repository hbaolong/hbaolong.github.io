<h4 id="section">26</h4>
<p>Dors Venabili knew that Leggen would not willingly go Upperside now.
He would have to be forced.</p>
<p>First, she checked the library and the dining areas again. Then she
called Seldon’s room. Finally, she went up there and signaled at the
door. When Seldon did not respond, she had the floor manager open it. He
wasn’t there. She questioned some of those who, over the last few weeks,
had come to know him. No one had seen him.</p>
<p>Well, then, she would make Leggen take her Upperside. By now, though,
it was night. He would object strenuously and how long could she spend
arguing if Hari Seldon was trapped up there on a freezing night with
sleet turning to snow?</p>
<p>A thought occurred to her and she rushed to the small University
computer, which kept track of the doings of the students, faculty, and
service staff.</p>
<p>Her fingers flew over the keys and she soon had what she wanted.</p>
<p>There were three of them in another part of the campus. She signed
out for a small glidecart to take her over and found the domicile she
was looking for. Surely, one of them would be available—or findable.</p>
<p>Fortune was with her. The first door at which she signaled was
answered by a query light. She punched in her identification number,
which included her department affiliation. The door opened and a plump
middle-aged man stared out at her. He had obviously been washing up
before dinner. His dark blond hair was askew and he was not wearing any
upper garment.</p>
<p>He said, “Sorry. You catch me at a disadvantage. What can I do for
you, Dr. Venabili?”</p>
<p>She said a bit breathlessly, “You’re Rogen Benastra, the Chief
Seismologist, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“This is an emergency. I must see the seismological records for
Upperside for the last few hours.”</p>
<p>Benastra stared at her. “Why? Nothing’s happened. I’d know if it had.
The seismograph would inform us.”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about a meteoric impact.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I. We don’t need a seismograph for that. I’m talking
about gravel, pinpoint fractures. Nothing today.”</p>
<p>“Not that either. Please. Take me to the seismograph and read it for
me. This is life or death.”</p>
<p>“I have a dinner appointment—”</p>
<p>“I said life or death and I mean it.”</p>
<p>Benastra said, “I don’t see—” but he faded out under Dors’s glare. He
wiped his face, left a quick word on his message relay, and struggled
into a shirt.</p>
<p>They half-ran (under Dors’s pitiless urging) to the small squat
Seismology Building. Dors, who knew nothing about seismology, said,
“Down? We’re going down?”</p>
<p>“Below the inhabited levels. Of course. The seismograph has to be
fixed to bedrock and be removed from the constant clamor and vibration
of the city levels.”</p>
<p>“But how can you tell what’s happening Upperside from down here?”</p>
<p>“The seismograph is wired to a set of pressure transducers located
within the thickness of the dome. The impact of a speck of grit will
send the indicator skittering off the screen. We can detect the
flattening effect on the dome of a high wind. We can—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” said Dors impatiently. She was not here for a lecture on
the virtues and refinements of the instruments. “Can you detect human
footsteps?”</p>
<p>“Human footsteps?” Benastra looked confused. “That’s not likely
Upperside.”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s likely. There were a group of meteorologists
Upperside this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, footsteps would scarcely be noticeable.”</p>
<p>“It would be noticeable if you looked hard enough and that’s what I
want you to do.”</p>
<p>Benastra might have resented the firm note of command in her voice,
but, if so, he said nothing. He touched a contact and the computer
screen jumped to life.</p>
<p>At the extreme right center, there was a fat spot of light, from
which a thin horizontal line stretched to the left limit of the screen.
There was a tiny wriggle to it, a random nonrepetitive series of little
hiccups and these moved steadily leftward. It was almost hypnotic in its
effect on Dors.</p>
<p>Benastra said, “That’s as quiet as it can possibly be. Anything you
see is the result of changing air pressure above, raindrops maybe, the
distant whirr of machinery. There’s nothing up there.”</p>
<p>“All right, but what about a few hours ago? Check on the records at
fifteen hundred today, for instance. Surely, you have some
recordings.”</p>
<p>Benastra gave the computer its necessary instructions and for a
second or two there was wild chaos on the screen. Then it settled down
and again the horizontal line appeared.</p>
<p>“I’ll sensitize it to maximum,” muttered Benastra. There were now
pronounced hiccups and as they staggered leftward they changed in
pattern markedly.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” said Dors. “Tell me.”</p>
<p>“Since you say there were people up there, Venabili, I would guess
they were footsteps—the shifting of weight, the impact of shoes. I don’t
know that I would have guessed it if I hadn’t known about the people up
there. It’s what we call a benign vibration, not associated with
anything we know to be dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell how many people are present?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not by eye. You see, we’re getting a resultant of all the
impacts.”</p>
<p>“You say ‘not by eye.’ Can the resultant be analyzed into its
components by the computer?”</p>
<p>“I doubt it. These are minimal effects and you have to allow for the
inevitable noise. The results would be untrustworthy.”</p>
<p>“Well then. Move the time forward till the footstep indications stop.
Can you make it fast-forward, so to speak?”</p>
<p>“If I do—the kind of fast-forward you’re speaking of—then it will all
just blur into a straight line with a slight haze above and below. What
I can do is move it forward in fifteen-minute stages and study it
quickly before moving on.”</p>
<p>“Good. Do that!”</p>
<p>Both watched the screen until Benastra said, “There’s nothing there
now. See?”</p>
<p>There was again a line with nothing but tiny uneven hiccups of
noise.</p>
<p>“When did the footsteps stop?”</p>
<p>“Two hours ago. A trifle more.”</p>
<p>“And when they stopped were there fewer than there were earlier?”</p>
<p>Benastra looked mildly outraged. “I couldn’t tell. I don’t think the
finest analysis could make a certain decision.”</p>
<p>Dors pressed her lips together. Then she said, “Are you testing a
transducer—is that what you called it—near the meteorological
outlet?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s where the instruments are and that’s where the
meteorologists would have been.” Then, unbelievingly, “Do you want me to
try others in the vicinity? One at a time?”</p>
<p>“No. Stay on this one. But keep on going forward at fifteen-minute
intervals. One person may have been left behind and may have made his
way back to the instruments.”</p>
<p>Benastra shook his head and muttered something under his breath.</p>
<p>The screen shifted again and Dors said sharply, “What’s that?” She
was pointing.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Noise.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s periodic. Could it be a single person’s footsteps?”</p>
<p>“Sure, but it could be a dozen other things too.”</p>
<p>“It’s coming along at about the time of footsteps, isn’t it?” Then,
after a while, she said, “Push it forward a little.”</p>
<p>He did and when the screen settled down she said, “Aren’t those
unevennesses getting bigger?”</p>
<p>“Possibly. We can measure them.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have to. You can see they’re getting bigger. The footsteps
are approaching the transducer. Go forward again. See when they
stop.”</p>
<p>After a while Benastra said, “They stopped twenty or twenty-five
minutes ago.” Then cautiously, “Whatever they are.”</p>
<p>“They’re footsteps,” said Dors with mountain-moving conviction.
“There’s a man up there and while you and I have been fooling around
here, he’s collapsed and he’s going to freeze and die. Now don’t say,
‘Whatever they are!’ Just call Meteorology and get me Jenarr Leggen.
Life or death, I tell you. Say so!”</p>
<p>Benastra, lips quivering, had passed the stage where he could
possibly resist anything this strange and passionate woman demanded.</p>
<p>It took no more than three minutes to get Leggen’s hologram on the
message platform. He had been pulled away from his dinner table. There
was a napkin in his hand and a suspicious greasiness under his lower
lip.</p>
<p>His long face was set in a fearful scowl. “ ‘Life or death?’ What is
this? Who are you?” Then his eye caught Dors, who had moved closer to
Benastra so that her image would be seen on Jenarr’s screen. He said,
“You again. This is simple harassment.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “It is not. I have consulted Rogen Benastra, who is Chief
Seismologist at the University. After you and your party had left
Upperside, the seismograph shows clear footsteps of one person still
there. It’s my student Hari Seldon, who went up there in your care and
who is now, quite certainly, lying in a collapsed stupor and may not
live long.</p>
<p>“You will, therefore, take me up there right now with whatever
equipment may be necessary. If you do not do so immediately, I shall
proceed to University security—to the President himself, if necessary.
One way or another I’ll get up there and if anything has happened to
Hari because you delay one minute, I will see to it that you are hauled
in for negligence, incompetence—whatever I can make stick—and will have
you lose all status and be thrown out of academic life. And if he’s
dead, of course, that’s manslaughter by negligence. Or worse, since I’ve
now warned you he’s dying.”</p>
<p>Jenarr, furious, turned to Benastra. “Did you detect—”</p>
<p>But Dors cut in. “He told me what he detected and I’ve told you. I do
not intend to allow you to bulldoze him into confusion. Are you coming?
Now?”</p>
<p>“Has it occurred to you that you may be mistaken?” said Jenarr,
thin-lipped. “Do you know what I can do to you if this is a mischievous
false alarm? Loss of status works both ways.”</p>
<p>“Murder doesn’t,” said Dors. “I’m ready to chance a trial for
malicious mischief. Are you ready to chance a trial for murder?”</p>
<p>Jenarr reddened, perhaps more at the necessity of giving in than at
the threat. “I’ll come, but I’ll have no mercy on you, young woman, if
your student eventually turns out to have been safe within the dome
these past three hours.”</p>
