<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>The snow had ceased, but it caked the ground deeply now and the sleek
ground car advanced through the deserted streets with lumbering effort.
The murky gray light of incipient dawn was cold not only in the poetical
sense but also in a very literal way—and even in the then turbulent
state of the Foundation’s politics, no one, whether Actionist or
pro-Hardin, found his spirits sufficiently ardent to begin street
activity that early.</p>
<p>Yohan Lee did not like that and his grumblings grew audible. “It’s
going to look bad, Hardin. They’re going to say you sneaked away.”</p>
<p>“Let them say it if they wish. I’ve got to get to Anacreon and I want
to do it without trouble. Now that’s enough, Lee.”</p>
<p>Hardin leaned back into the cushioned seat and shivered slightly. It
wasn’t cold inside the well-heated car, but there was something frigid
about a snow-covered world, even through glass, that annoyed him.</p>
<p>He said, reflectively, “Some day when we get around to it we ought to
weather-condition Terminus. It could be done.”</p>
<p>“I,” replied Lee, “would like to see a few other things done first.
For instance, what about weather-conditioning Sermak? A nice, dry cell
fitted for twenty-five centigrade all year round would be just
right.”</p>
<p>“And then I’d really need bodyguards,” said Hardin, “and not just
those two.” He indicated two of Lee’s bully-boys sitting up front with
the driver, hard eyes on the empty streets, ready hands at their atom
blasts. “You evidently want to stir up civil war.”</p>
<p>“I do? There are other sticks in the fire and it won’t require much
stirring, I can tell you.” He counted off on blunt fingers, “One: Sermak
raised hell yesterday in the City Council and called for an
impeachment.”</p>
<p>“He had a perfect right to do so,” responded Hardin, coolly. “Besides
which, his motion was defeated 206 to 184.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. A majority of twenty-two when we had counted on sixty as
a minimum. Don’t deny it; you know you did.”</p>
<p>“It was close,” admitted Hardin.</p>
<p>“All right. And two; after the vote, the fifty-nine members of the
Actionist Party reared up on their hind legs and stamped out of the
Council Chambers.”</p>
<p>Hardin was silent, and Lee continued, “And three: Before leaving,
Sermak howled that you were a traitor, that you were going to Anacreon
to collect your payment, that the Chamber majority in refusing to vote
impeachment had participated in the treason, and that the name of their
party was not ‘Actionist’ for nothing. What does that sound like?”</p>
<p>“Trouble, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“And now you’re chasing off at daybreak, like a criminal. You ought
to face them, Hardin—and if you have to, declare martial law, by
space!”</p>
<p>“Violence is the last refuge—”</p>
<p>“—Of the incompetent. Bah!”</p>
<p>“All right. We’ll see. Now listen to me carefully, Lee. Thirty years
ago, the Time Vault opened, and on the fiftieth anniversary of the
beginning of the Foundation, there appeared a Hari Seldon recording to
give us our first idea of what was really going on.”</p>
<p>“I remember.” Lee nodded reminiscently, with a half smile. “It was
the day we took over the government.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It was the time of our first major crisis. This is our
second—and three weeks from today will be the eightieth anniversary of
the beginning of the Foundation. Does that strike you as in any way
significant?”</p>
<p>“You mean he’s coming again?”</p>
<p>“I’m not finished. Seldon never said anything about returning, you
understand, but that’s of a piece with his whole plan. He’s always done
his best to keep all foreknowledge from us. Nor is there any way of
telling whether the computer is set for further openings short of
dismantling the Vault—and it’s probably set to destroy itself if we were
to try that. I’ve been there every anniversary since the first
appearance, just on the chance. He’s never shown up, but this is the
first time since then that there’s really been a crisis.”</p>
<p>“Then he’ll come.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I don’t know. However, this is the point. At today’s session
of the Council, just after you announce that I have left for Anacreon,
you will further announce, officially, that on March 14th next, there
will be another Hari Seldon recording, containing a message of the
utmost importance regarding the recent successfully concluded crisis.
That’s very important, Lee. Don’t add anything more no matter how many
questions are asked.”</p>
<p>Lee stared. “Will they believe it?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. It will confuse them, which is all I want.
Between wondering whether it is true and what I mean by it if it
isn’t—they’ll decide to postpone action till after March 14th. I’ll be
back considerably before then.”</p>
<p>Lee looked uncertain. “But that ‘successfully concluded.’ That’s
bull!”</p>
<p>“Highly confusing bull. Here’s the airport!”</p>
<p>The waiting spaceship bulked somberly in the dimness. Hardin stamped
through the snow toward it and at the open air lock turned about with
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>“Good-by, Lee. I hate to leave you in the frying pan like this, but
there’s not another I can trust. Now please keep out of the fire.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. The frying pan is hot enough. I’ll follow orders.” He
stepped back, and the air lock closed.</p>
