<h4 id="section">47</h4>
<p>“Felt your hair?” said Dors Venabili. She looked at Seldon’s hair as
though she was of a mind to feel it herself.</p>
<p>Seldon moved away slightly. “Please don’t. The woman made it seem
like a perversion.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it was—from her standpoint. Did you derive no pleasure
from it yourself?”</p>
<p>“Pleasure? It gave me gooseflesh. When she finally stopped, I was
able to breathe again. I kept thinking: What other conditions will she
make?”</p>
<p>Dors laughed. “Were you afraid that she would force sex upon you? Or
hopeful?”</p>
<p>“I assure you I didn’t dare think. I just wanted the Book.”</p>
<p>They were in their room now and Dors turned on her field distorter to
make sure they would not be overheard.</p>
<p>The Mycogenian night was about to begin. Seldon had removed his
skincap and kirtle and had bathed, paying particular attention to his
hair, which he had foamed and rinsed twice. He was now sitting on his
cot, wearing a light nightgown that had been hanging in the closet.</p>
<p>Dors said, eyes dancing, “Did she know you have hair on your
chest?”</p>
<p>“I was hoping earnestly she wouldn’t think of that.”</p>
<p>“Poor Hari. It was all perfectly natural, you know. I would probably
have had similar trouble if I was alone with a Brother. Worse, I’m sure,
since he would believe—Mycogenian society being what it is—that as a
woman I would be bound to obey his orders without delay or demur.”</p>
<p>“No, Dors. You may think it was perfectly natural, but you didn’t
experience it. The poor woman was in a high state of sexual excitement.
She engaged all her senses … smelled her fingers, licked them. If she
could have heard hair grow, she would have listened avidly.”</p>
<p>“But that’s what I mean by ‘natural.’ Anything you make forbidden
gains sexual attractiveness. Would you be particularly interested in
women’s breasts if you lived in a society in which they were displayed
at all times?”</p>
<p>“I think I might.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you be more interested if they were always hidden, as in
most societies they are? —Listen, let me tell you something that
happened to me. I was at a lake resort back home on Cinna … I presume
you have resorts on Helicon, beaches, that sort of thing?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Seldon, slightly annoyed. “What do you think
Helicon is, a world of rocks and mountains, with only well water to
drink?”</p>
<p>“No offense, Hari. I just want to make sure you’ll get the point of
the story. On our beaches at Cinna, we’re pretty lighthearted about what
we wear … or don’t wear.”</p>
<p>“Nude beaches?”</p>
<p>“Not actually, though I suppose if someone removed all of his or her
clothing it wouldn’t be much remarked on. The custom is to wear a decent
minimum, but I must admit that what we consider decent leaves very
little to the imagination.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “We have somewhat higher standards of decency on
Helicon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I could tell that by your careful treatment of me, but to each
its own. In any case, I was sitting at the small beach by the lake and a
young man approached to whom I had spoken earlier in the day. He was a
decent fellow I found nothing particularly wrong with. He sat on the arm
of my chair and placed his right hand on my left thigh, which was bare,
of course, in order to steady himself.</p>
<p>“After we had spoken for a minute and a half or so, he said,
impishly, ‘Here I am. You know me hardly at all and yet it seems
perfectly natural to me that I place my hand on your thigh. What’s more,
it seems perfectly natural to you, since you don’t seem to mind that it
remains there.’</p>
<p>“It was only then that I actually noticed that his hand was on my
thigh. Bare skin in public somehow loses some of its sexual quality. As
I said, it’s the hiding from view that is crucial.</p>
<p>“And the young man felt this too, for he went on to say, ‘Yet if I
were to meet you under more formal conditions and you were wearing a
gown, you wouldn’t dream of letting me lift your gown and place my hand
on your thigh on the precise spot it now occupies.’</p>
<p>“I laughed and we continued to talk of this and that. Of course, the
young man, now that my attention had been called to the position of his
hand, felt it no longer appropriate to keep it there and removed it.</p>
<p>“That night I dressed for dinner with more than usual care and
appeared in clothing that was considerably more formal than was required
or than other women in the dining room were wearing. I found the young
man in question. He was sitting at one of the tables. I approached,
greeted him, and said, ‘Here I am in a gown, but under it my left thigh
is bare. I give you permission. Just lift the gown and place your hand
on my left thigh where you had it earlier.’</p>
<p>“He tried. I’ll give him credit for that, but everyone was staring. I
wouldn’t have stopped him and I’m sure no one else would have stopped
him either, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. It was no more
public then than it had been earlier and the same people were present in
both cases. It was clear that I had taken the initiative and that I had
no objections, but he could not bring himself to violate the
proprieties. The conditions, which had been hand-on-thigh in the
afternoon, were not hand-on-thigh in the evening and that meant more
than anything logic could say.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I would have put my hand on your thigh.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Positive.”</p>
<p>“Even though your standards of decency on the beach are higher than
ours are?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Dors sat down on her own cot, then lay down with her hands behind her
head. “So that you’re not particularly disturbed that I’m wearing a
nightgown with very little underneath it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not particularly shocked. As for being disturbed, that depends
on the definition of the word. I’m certainly aware of how you’re
dressed.”</p>
<p>“Well, if we’re going to be cooped up here for a period of time,
we’ll have to learn to ignore such things.”</p>
<p>“Or take advantage of them,” said Seldon, grinning. “And I like your
hair. After seeing you bald all day, I like your hair.”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t touch it. I haven’t washed it yet.” She half-closed her
eyes. “It’s interesting. You’ve detached the informal and formal level
of respectability. What you’re saying is that Helicon is more
respectable at the informal level than Cinna is and less respectable at
the formal level. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m just talking about the young man who placed his hand
on your thigh and myself. How representative we are as Cinnians and
Heliconians, respectively, I can’t say. I can easily imagine some
perfectly proper individuals on both worlds—and some madcaps too.”</p>
<p>“We’re talking about social pressures. I’m not exactly a Galactic
traveler, but I’ve had to involve myself in a great deal of social
history. On the planet of Derowd, there was a time when premarital sex
was absolutely free. Multiple sex was allowed for the unmarried and
public sex was frowned upon only when traffic was blocked. And yet,
after marriage, monogamy was absolute and unbroken. The theory was that
by working off all one’s fantasies first, one could settle down to the
serious business of life.”</p>
<p>“Did it work?”</p>
<p>“About three hundred years ago that stopped, but some of my
colleagues say it stopped through external pressure from other worlds
who were losing too much tourist business to Derowd. There is such a
thing as overall Galactic social pressure too.”</p>
<p>“Or perhaps economic pressure, in this case.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. And being at the University, by the way, I get a chance to
study social pressures, even without being a Galactic traveler. I meet
people from scores of places inside and outside of Trantor and one of
the pet amusements in the social science departments is the comparison
of social pressures.</p>
<p>“Here in Mycogen, for instance, I have the impression that sex is
strictly controlled and is permitted under only the most stringent
rules, all the more tightly enforced because it is never discussed. In
the Streeling Sector, sex is never discussed either, but it isn’t
condemned. In the Jennat Sector, where I spent a week once doing
research, sex is discussed endlessly, but only for the purpose of
condemning it. I don’t suppose there are any two sectors in Trantor—or
any two worlds outside Trantor—in which attitudes toward sex are
completely duplicated.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You know what you make it sound like? It would
appear—”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I’ll tell you how it appears. All this talk of sex makes
one thing clear to me. I’m simply not going to let you out of my sight
anymore.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Twice I let you go, the first time through my own misjudgment and
the second because you bullied me into it. Both times it was clearly a
mistake. You know what happened to you the first time.”</p>
<p>Seldon said indignantly, “Yes, but nothing happened to me the second
time.”</p>
<p>“You nearly got into a lot of trouble. Suppose you had been caught
indulging in sexual escapades with a Sister?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a sexual—”</p>
<p>“You yourself said she was in a high state of sexual excitement.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“It was wrong. Please get it through your head, Hari. From now on,
you go nowhere without me.”</p>
<p>“Look,” said Seldon freezingly, “my object was to find out about
Mycogenian history and as a result of the so-called sexual escapade with
a Sister, I have a book—the Book.”</p>
<p>“The Book! True, there’s the Book. Let’s see it.”</p>
<p>Seldon produced it and Dors thoughtfully hefted it.</p>
<p>She said, “It might not do us any good, Hari. This doesn’t look as
though it will fit any projector I’ve ever encountered. That means
you’ll have to get a Mycogenian projector and they’ll want to know why
you want it. They’ll then find out you have this Book and they’ll take
it away from you.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “If your assumptions were correct, Dors, your
conclusions would be inescapable, but it happens that this is not the
kind of book you think it is. It’s not meant to be projected. The
material is printed on various pages and the pages are turned. Raindrop
Forty-Three explained that much to me.”</p>
<p>“A print-book!” It was hard to tell whether Dors was shocked or
amused. “That’s from the Stone Age.”</p>
<p>“It’s certainly pre-Empire,” said Seldon, “but not entirely so. Have
you ever seen a print-book?”</p>
<p>“Considering that I’m a historian? Of course, Hari.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but like this one?”</p>
<p>He handed over the Book and Dors, smiling, opened it—then turned to
another page—then flipped the pages. “It’s blank,” she said.</p>
<p>“It appears to be blank. The Mycogenians are stubbornly
primitivistic, but not entirely so. They will keep to the essence of the
primitive, but have no objection to using modern technology to modify it
for convenience’s sake. Who knows?”</p>
<p>“Maybe so, Hari, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.”</p>
<p>“The pages aren’t blank, they’re covered with microprint. Here, give
it back. If I press this little nubbin on the inner edge of the
cover—Look!”</p>
<p>The page to which the book lay open was suddenly covered with lines
of print that rolled slowly upward.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You can adjust the rate of upward movement to match
your reading speed by slightly twisting the nubbin one way or the other.
When the lines of print reach their upward limit—when you reach the
bottom line, that is—they snap downward and turn off. You turn to the
next page and continue.”</p>
<p>“Where does the energy come from that does all this?”</p>
<p>“It has an enclosed microfusion battery that lasts the life of the
book.”</p>
<p>“Then when it runs down—”</p>
<p>“You discard the book, which you may be required to do even before it
runs down, given wear and tear, and get another copy. You never replace
the battery.”</p>
<p>Dors took the Book a second time and looked at it from all sides. She
said, “I must admit I never heard of a book like this.”</p>
<p>“Nor I. The Galaxy, generally, has moved into visual technology so
rapidly, it skipped over this possibility.”</p>
<p>“This is visual.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but not with the orthodox effects. This type of book has its
advantages. It holds far more than an ordinary visual book does.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Where’s the turn-on? —Ah, let me see if I can work it.”
She had opened to a page at random and set the lines of print marching
upward. Then she said, “I’m afraid this won’t do you any good, Hari.
It’s pre-Galactic. I don’t mean the book. I mean the print … the
language.”</p>
<p>“Can you read it, Dors? As a historian—”</p>
<p>“As a historian, I’m used to dealing with archaic language—but within
limits. This is far too ancient for me. I can make out a few words here
and there, but not enough to be useful.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Seldon. “If it’s really ancient, it will be useful.”</p>
<p>“Not if you can’t read it.”</p>
<p>“I can read it,” said Seldon. “It’s bilingual. You don’t suppose that
Raindrop Forty-Three can read the ancient script, do you?”</p>
<p>“If she’s educated properly, why not?”</p>
<p>“Because I suspect that women in Mycogen are not educated past
household duties. Some of the more learned men can read this, but
everyone else would need a translation to Galactic.” He pushed another
nubbin. “And this supplies it.”</p>
<p>The lines of print changed to Galactic Standard.</p>
<p>“Delightful,” said Dors in admiration.</p>
<p>“We could learn from these Mycogenians, but we don’t.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t known about it.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that. I know about it now. And you know about it.
There must be outsiders coming into Mycogen now and then, for commercial
or political reasons, or there wouldn’t be skincaps so ready for use. So
every once in a while someone must have caught a glimpse of this sort of
print-book and seen how it works, but it’s probably dismissed as
something curious but not worth further study, simply because it’s
Mycogenian.”</p>
<p>“But is it worth study?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Everything is. Or should be. Hummin would probably point
to this lack of concern about these books as a sign of degeneration in
the Empire.”</p>
<p>He lifted the Book and said with a gush of excitement, “But I am
curious and I will read this and it may push me in the direction of
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” said Dors, “but if you take my advice, you’ll sleep
first and approach it fresh in the morning. You won’t learn much if you
nod over it.”</p>
<p>Seldon hesitated, then said, “How maternal you are!”</p>
<p>“I’m watching over you.”</p>
<p>“But I have a mother alive on Helicon. I would rather you were my
friend.”</p>
<p>“As for that, I have been your friend since first I met you.”</p>
<p>She smiled at him and Seldon hesitated as though he were not certain
as to the appropriate rejoinder. Finally he said, “Then I’ll take your
advice—as a friend—and sleep before reading.”</p>
<p>He made as though to put the Book on a small table between the two
cots, hesitated, turned, and put it under his pillow.</p>
<p>Dors Venabili laughed softly. “I think you’re afraid I will wake
during the night and read parts of the Book before you have a chance to.
Is that it?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon, trying not to look ashamed, “that may be it.
Even friendship only goes so far and this is my book and it’s my
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” said Dors, “and I promise you that we won’t quarrel over
that. By the way, you were about to say something earlier when I
interrupted you. Remember?”</p>
<p>Seldon thought briefly. “No.”</p>
<p>In the dark, he thought only of the Book. He gave no thought to the
hand-on-thigh story. In fact, he had already quite forgotten it,
consciously at least.</p>
