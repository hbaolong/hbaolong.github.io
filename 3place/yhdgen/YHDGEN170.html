<h4 id="section">32</h4>
<p>The three remained huddled in Seldon’s quarters till past lunch.
During that time, Hari and Dors spoke occasionally and quietly on
indifferent subjects, but Hummin maintained an almost complete silence.
He sat upright, ate little, and his grave countenance (which, Seldon
thought, made him look older than his years) remained quiet and
withdrawn.</p>
<p>Seldon imagined him to be reviewing the immense geography of Trantor
in his mind, searching for a corner that would be ideal. Surely, it
couldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>Seldon’s own Helicon was somewhat larger by a percent or two than
Trantor was and had a smaller ocean. The Heliconian land surface was
perhaps 10 percent larger than the Trantorian. But Helicon was sparsely
populated, its surface only sprinkled with scattered cities; Trantor was
all city. Where Helicon was divided into twenty administrative sectors,
Trantor had over eight hundred and every one of those hundreds was
itself a complex of subdivisions.</p>
<p>Finally Seldon said in some despair, “Perhaps it might be best,
Hummin, to choose which candidate for my supposed abilities is most
nearly benign, hand me over to that one, and count on him to defend me
against the rest.”</p>
<p>Hummin looked up and said in utmost seriousness, “That is not
necessary. I know the candidate who is most nearly benign and he already
has you.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “Do you place yourself on the same level with the
Mayor of Wye and the Emperor of all the Galaxy?”</p>
<p>“In point of view of position, no. But as far as the desire to
control you is concerned, I rival them. They, however, and anyone else I
can think of want you in order to strengthen their own wealth and power,
while I have no ambitions at all, except for the good of the
Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“I suspect,” said Seldon dryly, “that each of your competitors—if
asked—would insist that he too was thinking only of the good of the
Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“I am sure they would,” said Hummin, “but so far, the only one of my
competitors, as you call them, whom you have met is the Emperor and he
was interested in having you advance fictionalized predictions that
might stabilize his dynasty. I do not ask you for anything like that. I
ask only that you perfect your psychohistorical technique so that
mathematically valid predictions, even if only statistical in nature,
can be made.”</p>
<p>“True. So far, at least,” said Seldon with a half-smile.</p>
<p>“Therefore, I might as well ask: How are you coming along with that
task? Any progress?”</p>
<p>Seldon was uncertain whether to laugh or rage. After a pause, he did
neither, but managed to speak calmly. “Progress? In less than two
months? Hummin, this is something that might easily take me my whole
life and the lives of the next dozen who follow me. —And even then end
in failure.”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about anything as final as a solution or even as
hopeful as the beginning of a solution. You’ve said flatly a number of
times that a useful psychohistory is possible but impractical. All I am
asking is whether there now seems any hope that it can be made
practical.”</p>
<p>“Frankly, no.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Please excuse me. I am not a mathematician, so I hope
this is not a foolish question. How can you know something is both
possible and impractical? I’ve heard you say that, in theory, you might
personally meet and greet all the people in the Empire, but that it is
not a practical feat because you couldn’t live long enough to do it. But
how can you tell that psychohistory is something of this sort?”</p>
<p>Seldon looked at Dors with some incredulity. “Do you want that
explained?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, nodding her head vigorously so that her curled hair
vibrated.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact,” said Hummin, “so would I.”</p>
<p>“Without mathematics?” said Seldon with just a trace of a smile.</p>
<p>“Please,” said Hummin.</p>
<p>“Well—” He retired into himself to choose a method of presentation.
Then he said, “If you want to understand some aspect of the Universe, it
helps if you simplify it as much as possible and include only those
properties and characteristics that are essential to understanding. If
you want to determine how an object drops, you don’t concern yourself
with whether it is new or old, is red or green, or has an odor or not.
You eliminate those things and thus do not needlessly complicate
matters. The simplification you can call a model or a simulation and you
can present it either as an actual representation on a computer screen
or as a mathematical relationship. If you consider the primitive theory
of nonrelativistic gravitation—”</p>
<p>Dors said at once, “You promised there would be no mathematics. Don’t
try to slip it in by calling it ‘primitive.’”</p>
<p>“No no. I mean ‘primitive’ only in that it has been known as long as
our records go back, that its discovery is shrouded in the mists of
antiquity as is that of fire or the wheel. In any case, the equations
for such gravitational theory contain within themselves a description of
the motions of a planetary system, of a double star, of tides, and of
many other things. Making use of such equations, we can even set up a
pictorial simulation and have a planet circling a star or two stars
circling each other on a two-dimensional screen or set up more
complicated systems in a three-dimensional holograph. Such simplified
simulations make it far easier to grasp a phenomenon than it would be if
we had to study the phenomenon itself. In fact, without the
gravitational equations, our knowledge of planetary motions and of
celestial mechanics generally would be sparse indeed.</p>
<p>“Now, as you wish to know more and more about any phenomenon or as a
phenomenon becomes more complex, you need more and more elaborate
equations, more and more detailed programming, and you end with a
computerized simulation that is harder and harder to grasp.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you form a simulation of the simulation?” asked Hummin. “You
would go down another degree.”</p>
<p>“In that case, you would have to eliminate some characteristic of the
phenomenon which you want to include and your simulation becomes
useless. The LPS—that is, ‘the least possible simulation’—gains in
complexity faster than the object being simulated does and eventually
the simulation catches up with the phenomenon. Thus, it was established
thousands of years ago that the Universe as a whole, in its full
complexity, cannot be represented by any simulation smaller than
itself.</p>
<p>“In other words, you can’t get any picture of the Universe as a whole
except by studying the entire Universe. It has been shown also that if
one attempts to substitute simulations of a small part of the Universe,
then another small part, then another small part, and so on, intending
to put them all together to form a total picture of the Universe, one
would find that there are an infinite number of such part simulations.
It would therefore take an infinite time to understand the Universe in
full and that is just another way of saying that it is impossible to
gain all the knowledge there is.”</p>
<p>“I understand you so far,” said Dors, sounding a little
surprised.</p>
<p>“Well then, we know that some comparatively simple things are easy to
simulate and as things grow more and more complex they become harder to
simulate until finally they become impossible to simulate. But at what
level of complexity does simulation cease to be possible? Well, what I
have shown, making use of a mathematical technique first invented in
this past century and barely usable even if one employs a large and very
fast computer, our Galactic society falls short of that mark. It can be
represented by a simulation simpler than itself. And I went on to show
that this would result in the ability to predict future events in a
statistical fashion—that is, by stating the probability for alternate
sets of events, rather than flatly predicting that one set will take
place.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Hummin, “since you can profitably simulate
Galactic society, it’s only a matter of doing so. Why is it
impractical?”</p>
<p>“All I have proved is that it will not take an infinite time to
understand Galactic society, but if it takes a billion years it will
still be impractical. That will be essentially the same as infinite time
to us.”</p>
<p>“Is that how long it would take? A billion years?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been able to work out how long it would take, but I
strongly suspect that it will take at least a billion years, which is
why I suggested that number.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t really know.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to work it out.”</p>
<p>“Without success?”</p>
<p>“Without success.”</p>
<p>“The University library does not help?” Hummin cast a look at Dors as
he asked the question.</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head slowly. “Not at all.”</p>
<p>“Dors can’t help?”</p>
<p>Dors sighed. “I know nothing about the subject, Chetter. I can only
suggest ways of looking. If Hari looks and doesn’t find, I am
helpless.”</p>
<p>Hummin rose to his feet. “In that case, there is no great use in
staying here at the University and I must think of somewhere else to
place you.”</p>
<p>Seldon reached out and touched his sleeve. “Still, I have an
idea.”</p>
<p>Hummin stared at him with a faint narrowing of eyes that might have
belied surprise—or suspicion. “When did you get the idea? Just now?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s been buzzing in my head for a few days before I went
Upperside. That little experience eclipsed it for a while, but asking
about the library reminded me of it.”</p>
<p>Hummin seated himself again. “Tell me your idea—if it’s not something
that’s totally marinated in mathematics.”</p>
<p>“No mathematics at all. It’s just that reading history in the library
reminded me that Galactic society was less complicated in the past.
Twelve thousand years ago, when the Empire was on the way to being
established, the Galaxy contained only about ten million inhabited
worlds. Twenty thousand years ago, the pre-Imperial kingdoms included
only about ten thousand worlds altogether. Still deeper in the past, who
knows how society shrinks down? Perhaps even to a single world as in the
legends you yourself once mentioned, Hummin.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “And you think you might be able to work out
psychohistory if you dealt with a much simpler Galactic society?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it seems to me that I might be able to do so.”</p>
<p>“Then too,” said Dors with sudden enthusiasm, “suppose you work out
psychohistory for a smaller society of the past and suppose you can make
predictions from a study of the pre-Imperial situation as to what might
happen a thousand years after the formation of the Empire—you could then
check the actual situation at that time and see how near the mark you
were.”</p>
<p>Hummin said coldly, “Considering that you would know in advance the
situation of the year 1,000 of the Galactic Era, it would scarcely be a
fair test. You would be unconsciously swayed by your prior knowledge and
you would be bound to choose values for your equation in such a way as
to give you what you would know to be the solution.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Dors. “We don’t know the situation in 1,000
G.E. very well and we would have to dig. After all, that was eleven
millennia ago.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s face turned into a picture of dismay. “What do you mean we
don’t know the situation in 1,000 G.E. very well? There were computers
then, weren’t there, Dors?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“And memory storage units and recordings of ear and eye? We should
have all the records of 1,000 G.E. as we have of the present year of
12,020 G.E.”</p>
<p>“In theory, yes, but in actual practice—Well, you know, Hari, it’s
what you keep saying. It’s possible to have full records of 1,000 G.E.,
but it’s not practical to expect to have it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but what I keep saying, Dors, refers to mathematical
demonstrations. I don’t see the applications to historical records.”</p>
<p>Dors said defensively, “Records don’t last forever, Hari. Memory
banks can be destroyed or defaced as a result of conflict or can simply
deteriorate with time. Any memory bit, any record that is not referred
to for a long time, eventually drowns in accumulated noise. They say
that fully one third of the records in the Imperial Library are simply
gibberish, but, of course, custom will not allow those records to be
removed. Other libraries are less tradition-bound. In the Streeling
University library, we discard worthless items every ten years.</p>
<p>“Naturally, records frequently referred to and frequently duplicated
on various worlds and in various libraries—governmental and
private—remain clear enough for thousands of years, so that many of the
essential points of Galactic history remain known even if they took
place in pre-Imperial times. However, the farther back you go, the less
there is preserved.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that,” said Seldon. “I should think that new copies
would be made of any record in danger of withering. How could you let
knowledge disappear?”</p>
<p>“Undesired knowledge is useless knowledge,” said Dors. “Can you
imagine all the time, effort, and energy expended in a continual
refurbishing of unused data? And that wastage would grow steadily more
extreme with time.”</p>
<p>“Surely, you would have to allow for the fact that someone at some
time might need the data being so carelessly disposed of.”</p>
<p>“A particular item might be wanted once in a thousand years. To save
it all just in case of such a need isn’t cost-effective. Even in
science. You spoke of the primitive equations of gravitation and say it
is primitive because its discovery is lost in the mists of antiquity.
Why should that be? Didn’t you mathematicians and scientists save all
data, all information, back and back to the misty primeval time when
those equations were discovered?”</p>
<p>Seldon groaned and made no attempt to answer. He said, “Well, Hummin,
so much for my idea. As we look back into the past and as society grows
smaller, a useful psychohistory becomes more likely. But knowledge
dwindles even more rapidly than size, so psychohistory becomes less
likely—and the less outweighs the more.”</p>
<p>“To be sure, there is the Mycogen Sector,” said Dors, musing.</p>
<p>Hummin looked up quickly. “So there is and that would be the perfect
place to put Seldon. I should have thought of it myself.”</p>
<p>“Mycogen Sector,” repeated Hari, looking from one to the other. “What
and where is Mycogen Sector?”</p>
<p>“Hari, please, I’ll tell you later. Right now, I have preparations to
make. You’ll leave tonight.”</p>
