<h4 id="section">94</h4>
<p>Dors said, “The palace is cleared. Rashelle will not be physically
harmed. And you’ll return to the Imperial Sector, Hari.”</p>
<p>“And you, Dors?” said Seldon in a low tight voice.</p>
<p>“I presume I will go back to the University,” she said. “My work is
being neglected, my classes abandoned.”</p>
<p>“No, Dors, you have a greater task.”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory. I cannot tackle the project without you.”</p>
<p>“Of course you can. I am a total illiterate in mathematics.”</p>
<p>“And I in history—and we need both.”</p>
<p>Dors laughed. “I suspect that, as a mathematician, you are one of a
kind. I, as a historian, am merely adequate, certainly not outstanding.
You will find any number of historians who will suit the needs of
psychohistory better than I do.”</p>
<p>“In that case, Dors, let me explain that psychohistory needs more
than a mathematician and a historian. It also needs the will to tackle
what will probably be a lifetime problem. Without you, Dors, I will not
have that will.”</p>
<p>“Of course you’ll have it.”</p>
<p>“Dors, if you’re not with me, I don’t intend to have it.”</p>
<p>Dors looked at Seldon thoughtfully. “This is a fruitless discussion,
Hari. Undoubtedly, Hummin will make the decision. If he sends me back to
the University—”</p>
<p>“He won’t.”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure?”</p>
<p>“Because I’ll put it to him plainly. If he sends you back to the
University, I’ll go back to Helicon and the Empire can go ahead and
destroy itself.”</p>
<p>“You can’t mean it.”</p>
<p>“But I certainly do.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you realize that Hummin can arrange to have your feelings
change so that you will work on psychohistory—even without me?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “Hummin will not make such an arbitrary
decision. I’ve spoken to him. He dares not do much to the human mind
because he is bound by what he calls the Laws of Robotics. To change my
mind to the point where I will not want you with me, Dors, would mean a
change of the kind he cannot risk. On the other hand, if he leaves me
alone and if you join me in the project, he will have what he wants—a
true chance at psychohistory. Why should he not settle for that?”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “He may not agree for reasons of his own.”</p>
<p>“Why should he disagree? You were asked to protect me, Dors. Has
Hummin canceled that request?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then he wants you to continue your protection. And I want your
protection.”</p>
<p>“Against what? You now have Hummin’s protection, both as Demerzel and
as Daneel, and surely that is all you need.”</p>
<p>“If I had the protection of every person and every force in the
Galaxy, it would still be yours I would want.”</p>
<p>“Then you don’t want me for psychohistory. You want me for
protection.”</p>
<p>Seldon scowled. “No! Why are you twisting my words? Why are you
forcing me to say what you must know? It is neither psychohistory nor
protection I want you for. Those are excuses and I’ll use any other I
need. I want you—just you. And if you want the real reason, it is
because you are you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t even know me.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. I don’t care. —And yet I do know you in a way.
Better than you think.”</p>
<p>“Do you indeed?”</p>
<p>“Of course. You follow orders and you risk your life for me without
hesitation and with no apparent care for the consequences. You learned
how to play tennis so quickly. You learned how to use knives even more
quickly and you handled yourself perfectly in the fight with Marron.
Inhumanly—if I may say so. Your muscles are amazingly strong and your
reaction time is amazingly fast. You can somehow tell when a room is
being eavesdropped and you can be in touch with Hummin in some way that
does not involve instrumentation.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “And what do you think of all that?”</p>
<p>“It has occurred to me that Hummin, in his persona as R. Daneel
Olivaw, has an impossible task. How can one robot try to guide the
Empire? He must have helpers.”</p>
<p>“That is obvious. Millions, I should imagine. I am a helper. You are
a helper. Little Raych is a helper.”</p>
<p>“You are a different kind of helper.”</p>
<p>“In what way? Hari, say it. If you hear yourself say it, you will
realize how crazy it is.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked long at her and then said in a low voice, “I will not
say it because … I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t? You wish to take me as I am?”</p>
<p>“I will take you as I must. You are Dors and, whatever else you are,
in all the world I want nothing else.”</p>
<p>Dors said softly, “Hari, I want what is good for you because of what
I am, but I feel that if I wasn’t what I am, I would still want what is
good for you. And I don’t think I am good for you.”</p>
<p>“Good for me or bad, I don’t care.” Here Hari looked down as he paced
a few steps, weighing what he would say next. “Dors, have you ever been
kissed?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Hari. It’s a social part of life and I live
socially.”</p>
<p>“No no! I mean, have you ever really kissed a man? You know,
passionately?”</p>
<p>“Well yes, Hari, I have.”</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy it?”</p>
<p>Dors hesitated. She said, “When I’ve kissed in that way, I enjoyed it
more than I would have enjoyed disappointing a young man I liked,
someone whose friendship meant something to me.” At this point, Dors
blushed and she turned her face away. “Please, Hari, this is difficult
for me to explain.”</p>
<p>But Hari, more determined now than ever, pressed further. “So you
kissed for the wrong reasons, then, to avoid hurt feelings.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps everyone does, in a sense.”</p>
<p>Seldon mulled this over, then said suddenly, “Did you ever ask to be
kissed?”</p>
<p>Dors paused, as though looking back on her life. “No.”</p>
<p>“Or wish to be kissed again, once you had?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever slept with a man?” he asked softly, desperately.</p>
<p>“Of course. I told you. These things are a part of life.”</p>
<p>Hari gripped her shoulders as if he was going to shake her. “But have
you ever felt the desire, a need for that kind of closeness with just
one special person? Dors, have you ever felt love?”</p>
<p>Dors looked up slowly, almost sadly, and locked eyes with Seldon.
“I’m sorry, Hari, but no.”</p>
<p>Seldon released her, letting his arms fall dejectedly to his
sides.</p>
<p>Then Dors placed her hand gently on his arm and said, “So you see,
Hari. I’m not really what you want.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s head drooped and he stared at the floor. He weighed the
matter and tried to think rationally. Then he gave up. He wanted what he
wanted and he wanted it beyond thought and beyond rationality.</p>
<p>He looked up. “Dors, dear, even so, I don’t care.”</p>
<p>Seldon put his arms around her and brought his head close to hers
slowly, as though waiting for her to pull away, all the while drawing
her nearer.</p>
<p>Dors made no move and he kissed her—slowly, lingeringly, and then
passionately—and her arms suddenly tightened around him.</p>
<p>When he stopped at last, she looked at him with eyes that mirrored
her smile and she said:</p>
<p>“Kiss me again, Hari. —Please.”</p>
<p>DEMERZEL, ETO— … While there is no question that Eto Demerzel was the
real power in the government during much of the reign of Emperor Cleon
I, historians are divided as to the nature of his rule. The classic
interpretation is that he was another in the long line of strong and
ruthless oppressors in the last century of the undivided Galactic
Empire, but there are revisionist views that have surfaced and that
insist his was, if a despotism, a benevolent one. Much is made, in this
view, of his relationship with Hari Seldon, though that remains forever
uncertain, particularly during the unusual episode of Laskin Joranum,
whose meteoric rise— ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA*</p>
