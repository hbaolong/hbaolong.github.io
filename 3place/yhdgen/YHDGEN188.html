<h4 id="section">50</h4>
<p>The two Raindrops arrived at midmorning. Raindrop Forty-Five seemed
as cheerful as ever, but Raindrop Forty-Three paused just inside the
door, looking drawn and circumspect. She kept her eyes down and did not
as much as glance at Seldon.</p>
<p>Seldon looked uncertain and gestured to Dors, who said in a cheerful
businesslike tone of voice, “One moment, Sisters. I must give
instructions to my man or he won’t know what to do with himself
today.”</p>
<p>They moved into the bathroom and Dors whispered, “Is something
wrong?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Raindrop Forty-Three is obviously shattered. Please tell her
that I will return the Book as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Dors favored Seldon with a long surprised look. “Hari,” she said,
“you’re a sweet, caring person, but you haven’t the good sense of an
amoeba. If I as much as mention the Book to the poor woman, she’ll be
certain that you told me all about what happened yesterday and then
she’ll really be shattered. The only hope is to treat her exactly as I
would ordinarily.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded his head and said dispiritedly, “I suppose you’re
right.”</p>
<p>Dors returned in time for dinner and found Seldon on his cot, still
leafing through the Book, but with intensified impatience.</p>
<p>He looked up with a scowl and said, “If we’re going to be staying
here any length of time, we’re going to need a communication device of
some sort between us. I had no idea when you’d get back and I was a
little concerned.”</p>
<p>“Well, here I am,” she said, removing her skincap gingerly and
looking at it with more than a little distaste. “I’m really pleased at
your concern. I rather thought you’d be so lost in the Book, you
wouldn’t even realize I was gone.”</p>
<p>Seldon snorted.</p>
<p>Dors said, “As for communications devices, I doubt that they are easy
to come by in Mycogen. It would mean easing communication with
tribespeople outside and I suspect the leaders of Mycogen are bound and
determined to cut down on any possible interaction with the great
beyond.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Seldon, tossing the Book to one side, “I would expect
that from what I see in the Book. Did you find out about the whatever
you called it … the temple?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, removing her eyebrow patches. “It exists. There are
a number of them over the area of the sector, but there’s a central
building that seems to be the important one. —Would you believe that one
woman noticed my eyelashes and told me that I shouldn’t let myself be
seen in public? I have a feeling she intended to report me for indecent
exposure.”</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” said Seldon impatiently. “Do you know where the
central temple is located?”</p>
<p>“I have directions, but Raindrop Forty-Five warned me that women were
not allowed inside except on special occasions, none of which are coming
up soon. It’s called the Sacratorium.”</p>
<p>“The what?”</p>
<p>“The Sacratorium.”</p>
<p>“What an ugly word. What does it mean?”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “It’s new to me. And neither Raindrop knew what
it meant either. To them, Sacratorium isn’t what the building is called,
it’s what it is. Asking them why they called it that probably sounded
like asking them why a wall is called a wall.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything about it they do know?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Hari. They know what it’s for. It’s a place that’s
devoted to something other than the life here in Mycogen. It’s devoted
to another world, a former and better one.”</p>
<p>“The world they once lived on, you mean?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Raindrop Forty-Five all but said so, but not quite. She
couldn’t bring herself to say the word.”</p>
<p>“Aurora?”</p>
<p>“That’s the word, but I suspect that if you were to say it out loud
to a group of Mycogenians, they would be shocked and horrified. Raindrop
Forty-Five, when she said, ‘The Sacratorium is dedicated to—’, stopped
at that point and carefully wrote out the letters one by one with her
finger on the palm of her hand. And she blushed, as though she was doing
something obscene.”</p>
<p>“Strange,” said Seldon. “If the Book is an accurate guide, Aurora is
their dearest memory, their chief point of unification, the center about
which everything in Mycogen revolves. Why should its mention be
considered obscene? —Are you sure you didn’t misinterpret what the
Sister meant?”</p>
<p>“I’m positive. And perhaps it’s no mystery. Too much talk about it
would get to tribespeople. The best way of keeping it secret unto
themselves is to make its very mention taboo.”</p>
<p>“Taboo?”</p>
<p>“A specialized anthropological term. It’s a reference to serious and
effective social pressure forbidding some sort of action. The fact that
women are not allowed in the Sacratorium probably has the force of a
taboo. I’m sure that a Sister would be horrified if it was suggested
that she invade its precincts.”</p>
<p>“Are the directions you have good enough for me to get to the
Sacratorium on my own?”</p>
<p>“In the first place, Hari, you’re not going alone. I’m going with
you. I thought we had discussed the matter and that I had made it clear
that I cannot protect you at long distance—not from sleet storms and not
from feral women. In the second place, it’s impractical to think of
walking there. Mycogen may be a small sector, as sectors go, but it
simply isn’t that small.”</p>
<p>“An Expressway, then.”</p>
<p>“There are no Expressways passing through Mycogenian territory. It
would make contact between Mycogenians and tribespeople too easy. Still,
there are public conveyances of the kind that are found on
less-developed planets. In fact, that’s what Mycogen is, a piece of an
undeveloped planet, embedded like a splinter in the body of Trantor,
which is otherwise a patchwork of developed societies. —And Hari, finish
with the Book as soon as possible. It’s apparent that Rainbow
Forty-Three is in trouble as long as you have it and so will we be if
they find out.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean a tribesperson reading it is taboo?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>“Well, it would be no great loss to give it back. I should say that
95 percent of it is incredibly dull; endless in-fighting among political
groups, endless justification of policies whose wisdom I cannot possibly
judge, endless homilies on ethical matters which, even when enlightened,
and they usually aren’t, are couched with such infuriating
self-righteousness as to almost enforce violation.”</p>
<p>“You sound as though I would be doing you a great favor if I took the
thing away from you.”</p>
<p>“Except that there’s always the other 5 percent that discusses the
never-to-be-mentioned Aurora. I keep thinking that there may be
something there and that it may be helpful to me. That’s why I wanted to
know about the Sacratorium.”</p>
<p>“Do you hope to find support for the Book’s concept of Aurora in the
Sacratorium?”</p>
<p>“In a way. And I’m also terribly caught up in what the Book has to
say about automata, or robots, to use their term. I find myself
attracted to the concept.”</p>
<p>“Surely, you don’t take it seriously?”</p>
<p>“Almost. If you accept some passages of the Book literally, then
there is an implication that some robots were in human shape.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. If you’re going to construct a simulacrum of a human
being, you will make it look like a human being.”</p>
<p>“Yes, simulacrum means ‘likeness,’ but a likeness can be crude
indeed. An artist can draw a stick figure and you might know he is
representing a human being and recognize it. A circle for the head, a
stalk for the body, and four bent lines for arms and legs and you have
it. But I mean robots that really look like a human being, in every
detail.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous, Hari. Imagine the time it would take to fashion the
metal of the body into perfect proportions, with the smooth curve of
underlying muscles.”</p>
<p>“Who said ‘metal,’ Dors? The impression I got is that such robots
were organic or pseudo-organic, that they were covered with skin, that
you could not easily draw a distinction between them and human beings in
any way.”</p>
<p>“Does the Book say that?”</p>
<p>“Not in so many words. The inference, however—”</p>
<p>“Is your inference, Hari. You can’t take it seriously.”</p>
<p>“Let me try. I find four things that I can deduce from what the Book
says about robots—and I followed up every reference the index gave.
First, as I say, they—or some of them—exactly resembled human beings;
second, they had very extended life spans—if you want to call it
that.”</p>
<p>“Better say ‘effectiveness,’” said Dors, “or you’ll begin thinking of
them as human altogether.”</p>
<p>“Third,” said Seldon, ignoring her, “that some—or, at any rate, at
least one—continues to live on to this day.”</p>
<p>“Hari, that’s one of the most widespread legends we have. The ancient
hero does not die but remains in suspended animation, ready to return to
save his people at some time of great need. Really, Hari.”</p>
<p>“Fourth,” said Seldon, still not rising to the bait, “there are some
lines that seem to indicate that the central temple—or the Sacratorium,
if that’s what it is, though I haven’t found that word in the Book,
actually—contains a robot.” He paused, then said, “Do you see?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “No. What should I see?”</p>
<p>“If we combine the four points, perhaps a robot that looks exactly
like a human being and that is still alive, having been alive for, say,
the last twenty thousand years, is in the Sacratorium.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Hari, you can’t believe that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t actually believe it, but I can’t entirely let go either.
What if it’s true? What if—it’s only one chance out of a million, I
admit—it’s true? Don’t you see how useful he could be to me? He could
remember the Galaxy as it was long before any reliable historical
records existed. He might help make psychohistory possible.”</p>
<p>“Even if it was true, do you suppose the Mycogenians would let you
see and interview the robot?”</p>
<p>“I don’t intend to ask permission. I can at least go to the
Sacratorium and see if there’s something to interview first.”</p>
<p>“Not now. Tomorrow at the earliest. And if you don’t think better of
it by morning, we go.”</p>
<p>“You told me yourself they don’t allow women—”</p>
<p>“They allow women to look at it from outside, I’m sure, and I suspect
that is all we’ll get to do.”</p>
<p>And there she was adamant.</p>
