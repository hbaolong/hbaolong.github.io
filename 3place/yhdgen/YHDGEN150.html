<h4 id="section">12</h4>
<p>Hummin’s practiced eye seemed to take in the recess, the other taxis,
the diner, the walkways, and the men and women all at a glance. Seldon,
trying to look inconspicuous and again not knowing how, watched him,
trying not to do so too intently.</p>
<p>When they sat down at a small table and punched in their orders,
Seldon, attempting to sound indifferent, said, “Everything okay?”</p>
<p>“Seems so,” said Hummin.</p>
<p>“How can you tell?”</p>
<p>Hummin let his dark eyes rest on Seldon for a moment. “Instinct,” he
said. “Years of news gathering. You look and know, ‘No news here.’”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded and felt relieved. Hummin might have said it
sardonically, but there must be a certain amount of truth to it.</p>
<p>His satisfaction did not last through the first bite of his sandwich.
He looked up at Hummin with his mouth full and with a look of hurt
surprise on his face.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “This is a wayside diner, my friend. Cheap, fast, and
not very good. The food’s homegrown and has an infusion of rather sharp
yeast. Trantorian palates are used to it.”</p>
<p>Seldon swallowed with difficulty. “But back in the hotel—”</p>
<p>“You were in the Imperial Sector, Seldon. Food is imported there and
where microfood is used it is high-quality. It is also expensive.”</p>
<p>Seldon wondered whether to take another bite. “You mean that as long
as I stay on Trantor—”</p>
<p>Hummin made a hushing motion with his lips. “Don’t give anyone the
impression that you’re used to better. There are places on Trantor where
to be identified as an aristocrat is worse than being identified as an
Outworlder. The food won’t be so bad everywhere, I assure you. These
wayside places have a reputation for low quality. If you can stomach
that sandwich, you’ll be able to eat anywhere on Trantor. And it won’t
hurt you. It’s not decayed or bad or anything like that. It just has a
harsh, strong taste and, honestly, you may grow accustomed to it. I’ve
met Trantorians who spit out honest food and say it lacks that homegrown
tang.”</p>
<p>“Do they grow much food on Trantor?” asked Seldon. A quick side
glance showed him there was no one seated in the immediate vicinity and
he spoke quietly. “I’ve always heard it takes twenty surrounding worlds
to supply the hundreds of freight ships required to feed Trantor every
day.”</p>
<p>“I know. And hundreds to carry off the load of wastes. And if you
want to make the story really good, you say that the same freight ships
carry food one way and waste the other. It’s true that we import
considerable quantities of food, but that’s mostly luxury items. And we
export considerable waste, carefully treated into inoffensiveness, as
important organic fertilizer—every bit as important to other worlds as
the food is to us. But that’s only a small fraction of the whole.”</p>
<p>“It is?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In addition to fish in the sea, there are gardens and truck
farms everywhere. And fruit trees and poultry and rabbits and vast
microorganism farms—usually called yeast farms, though the yeast makes
up a minority of the growths. And our wastes are mostly used right here
at home to maintain all that growth. In fact, in many ways Trantor is
very much like an enormous and overgrown space settlement. Have you ever
visited one of those?”</p>
<p>“Indeed I have.”</p>
<p>“Space settlements are essentially enclosed cities, with everything
artificially cycled, with artificial ventilation, artificial day and
night, and so on. Trantor is different only in that even the largest
space settlement has a population of only ten million and Trantor has
four thousand times that. Of course, we have real gravity. And no space
settlement can match us in our microfoods. We have yeast vats, fungal
mats, and algae ponds vast beyond the imagination. And we are strong on
artificial flavoring, added with no light hand. That’s what gives the
taste to what you’re eating.”</p>
<p>Seldon had gotten through most of his sandwich and found it not as
offensive as the first bite had been. “And it won’t affect me?”</p>
<p>“It does hit the intestinal flora and every once in a while it
afflicts some poor Outworlder with diarrhea, but that’s rare, and you
harden even to that quickly. Still, drink your milkshake, which you
probably won’t like. It contains an antidiarrhetic that should keep you
safe, even if you tend to be sensitive to such things.”</p>
<p>Seldon said querulously, “Don’t talk about it, Hummin. A person can
be suggestible to such things.”</p>
<p>“Finish the milkshake and forget the suggestibility.”</p>
<p>They finished the rest of their meal in silence and soon were on
their way again.</p>
