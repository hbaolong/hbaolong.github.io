<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>“And so I said,” said Hari Seldon. “ ‘that will mark the beginning of
the Fall of the Galactic Empire.’ And so it will, Dors.”</p>
<p>Dors listened, tight-lipped. She accepted Seldon’s First Ministership
as she accepted everything—calmly. Her only mission was to protect him
and his psychohistory, but that task, she well knew, was made harder by
his position. The best security was to go unnoticed and, as long as the
Spaceship-and-Sun, the symbol of the Empire, shone down upon Seldon, all
of the physical barriers in existence would be unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>The luxury in which they now lived—the careful shielding from spy
beams, as well as from physical interference; the advantages to her own
historical research of being able to make use of nearly unlimited
funds—did not satisfy her. She would gladly have exchanged it all for
their old quarters at Streeling University. Or, better yet, for a
nameless apartment in a nameless sector where no one knew them.</p>
<p>“That’s all very well, Hari dear,” she said, “but it’s not
enough.”</p>
<p>“What’s not enough?”</p>
<p>“The information you’re giving me. You say we might lose the
Periphery. How? Why?”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled briefly. “How nice it would be to know, Dors, but
psychohistory is not yet at the stage where it could tell us.”</p>
<p>“In your opinion, then. Is it the ambition of local faraway governors
to declare themselves independent?”</p>
<p>“That’s a factor, certainly. It’s happened in past history—as you
know far better than I—but never for long. Maybe this time it will be
permanent.”</p>
<p>“Because the Empire is weaker?”</p>
<p>“Yes, because trade flows less freely than it once did, because
communications are stiffer than they once were, because the governors in
the Periphery are, in actual fact, closer to independence than they have
ever been. If one of them arises with particular ambitions—”</p>
<p>“Can you tell which one it might be?”</p>
<p>“Not in the least. All we can force out of psychohistory at this
stage is the definite knowledge that if a governor of unusual ability
and ambition arises, he would find conditions more suitable for his
purposes than he would have in the past. It could be other things,
too—some great natural disaster or some sudden civil war between two
distant Outer World coalitions. None of that can be precisely predicted
as of now, but we can tell that anything of the sort that happens will
have more serious consequences than it would have had a century
ago.”</p>
<p>“But if you don’t know a little more precisely what will happen in
the Periphery, how can you so guide actions as to make sure the
Periphery goes, rather than Trantor?”</p>
<p>“By keeping a close eye on both and trying to stabilize Trantor and
not trying to stabilize the Periphery. We can’t expect psychohistory to
order events automatically without much greater knowledge of its
workings, so we have to make use of constant manual controls, so to
speak. In days to come, the technique will be refined and the need for
manual control will decrease.”</p>
<p>“But that,” said Dors, “is in days to come. Right?”</p>
<p>“Right. And even that is only a hope.”</p>
<p>“And just what kind of instabilities threaten Trantor—if we hang on
to the Periphery?”</p>
<p>“The same possibilities—economic and social factors, natural
disasters, ambitious rivalries among high officials. And something more.
I have described the Empire to Yugo as being overheated—and Trantor is
the most overheated portion of all. It seems to be breaking down. The
infrastructure—water supply, heating, waste disposal, fuel lines,
everything—seems to be having unusual problems and that’s something I’ve
been turning my attention to more and more lately.”</p>
<p>“What about the death of the Emperor?”</p>
<p>Seldon spread his hands. “That happens inevitably, but Cleon is in
good health. He’s only my age, which I wish was younger, but he isn’t
too old. His son is totally inadequate for the succession, but there
will be enough claimants. More than enough to cause trouble and make his
death distressing, but it might not prove a total catastrophe—in the
historic sense.”</p>
<p>“Let’s say his assassination, then.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up nervously. “Don’t say that. Even if we’re shielded,
don’t use the word.”</p>
<p>“Hari, don’t be foolish. It’s an eventuality that must be reckoned
with. There was a time when the Joranumites might have taken power and,
if they had, the Emperor, one way or another—”</p>
<p>“Probably not. He would have been more useful as a figurehead. And in
any case, forget it. Joranum died last year on Nishaya, a rather
pathetic figure.”</p>
<p>“He had followers.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Everyone has followers. Did you ever come across the
Globalist party on my native world of Helicon in your studies of the
early history of the Kingdom of Trantor and of the Galactic Empire?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t. I don’t want to hurt your feelings, Hari, but I don’t
recall coming across any piece of history in which Helicon played a
role.”</p>
<p>“I’m not hurt, Dors. Happy the world without a history, I always say.
—In any case, about twenty-four hundred years ago, there arose a group
of people on Helicon who were quite convinced that Helicon was the only
inhabited globe in the Universe. Helicon was the Universe and beyond it
there was only a solid sphere of sky speckled with tiny stars.”</p>
<p>“How could they believe that?” said Dors. “They were part of the
Empire, I presume.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but Globalists insisted that all evidence to the effect that
the Empire existed was either illusion or deliberate deceit, that
Imperial emissaries and officials were Heliconians playing a part for
some reason. They were absolutely immune to reason.”</p>
<p>“And what happened?”</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s always pleasant to think that your particular world
is the world. At their peak, the Globalists may have persuaded 10
percent of the population of the planet to be part of the movement. Only
10 percent, but they were a vehement minority that drowned out the
indifferent majority and threatened to take over.”</p>
<p>“But they didn’t, did they?”</p>
<p>“No, they didn’t. What happened was that Globalism caused a
diminishing of Imperial trade and the Heliconian economy slid into the
doldrums. When the belief began to affect the pocketbooks of the
population, it lost popularity rapidly. The rise and fall puzzled many
at the time, but psychohistory, I’m sure, would have shown it to be
inevitable and would have made it unnecessary to give it any
thought.”</p>
<p>“I see. But, Hari, what is the point of this story? I presume there’s
some connection with what we were discussing.”</p>
<p>“The connection is that such movements never completely die, no
matter how ridiculous their tenets may seem to sane people. Right now,
on Helicon, right now there are still Globalists. Not many, but every
once in a while seventy or eighty of them get together in what they call
a Global Congress and take enormous pleasure in talking to each other
about Globalism. —Well, it is only ten years since the Joranumite
movement seemed such a terrible threat on this world and it would not be
at all surprising if there weren’t still some remnants left. There may
still be some remnants a thousand years from now.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it possible that a remnant may be dangerous?”</p>
<p>“I doubt it. It was Jo-Jo’s charisma that made the movement
dangerous—and he’s dead. He didn’t even die a heroic death or one that
was in any way remarkable; he just withered away and died in exile, a
broken man.”</p>
<p>Dors stood up and walked the length of the room quickly, swinging her
arms at her sides and clenching her fists. She returned and stood before
the seated Seldon.</p>
<p>“Hari,” she said, “let me speak my mind. If psychohistory points to
the possibility of serious disturbances on Trantor, then if there are
Joranumites still left, they may still be plotting the Emperor’s
death.”</p>
<p>Seldon laughed nervously. “You jump at shadows, Dors. Relax.”</p>
<p>But he found that he could not dismiss what she had said quite that
easily.</p>
