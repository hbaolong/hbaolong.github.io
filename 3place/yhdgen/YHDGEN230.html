<h4 id="section">92</h4>
<p>It was as though they were sitting in a tiny Universe of their own.
There, in the middle of Wye, with the Wyan army being disarmed by
Imperial force, they sat quietly. There, in the midst of events that all
of Trantor—and perhaps all the Galaxy—was watching, there was this small
bubble of utter isolation within which Seldon and Hummin were playing
their game of attack and defense—Seldon trying hard to force a new
reality, Hummin making no move to accept that new reality.</p>
<p>Seldon had no fear of interruption. He was certain that the bubble
within which they sat had a boundary that could not be penetrated, that
Hummin’s—no, the robot’s—powers would keep all at a distance till the
game was over.</p>
<p>Hummin finally said, “You are an ingenious fellow, Hari, but I fail
to see why I must admit that I am a robot and why I have no choice but
to do so. Everything you say may be true as facts—your own behavior,
Dors’s behavior, Sunmaster’s, Tisalver’s, the Wyan generals’—all, all
may have happened as you said, but that doesn’t force your
interpretation of the meaning of the events to be true. Surely,
everything that happened can have a natural explanation. You trusted me
because you accepted what I said; Dors felt your safety to be important
because she felt psychohistory to be crucial, herself being a historian;
Sunmaster and Tisalver were beholden to me for favors you know nothing
of, the Wyan generals resented being ruled by a woman, no more. Why must
we flee to the supernatural?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “See here, Hummin, do you really believe the Empire to
be falling and do you really consider it important that it not be
allowed to do so with no move made to save it or, at the least, cushion
its Fall?”</p>
<p>“I really do.” Somehow Seldon knew this statement was sincere.</p>
<p>“And you really want me to work out the details of psychohistory and
you feel that you yourself cannot do it?”</p>
<p>“I lack the capability.”</p>
<p>“And you feel that only I can handle psychohistory—even if I
sometimes doubt it myself?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you must therefore feel that if you can possibly help me in any
way, you must.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Personal feelings—selfish considerations—could play no part?”</p>
<p>A faint and brief smile passed over Hummin’s grave face and for a
moment Seldon sensed a vast and arid desert of weariness behind Hummin’s
quiet manner. “I have built a long career on paying no heed to personal
feelings or to selfish considerations.”</p>
<p>“Then I ask your help. I can work out psychohistory on the basis of
Trantor alone, but I will run into difficulties. Those difficulties I
may overcome, but how much easier it would be to do so if I knew certain
key facts. For instance, was Earth or Aurora the first world of humanity
or was it some other world altogether? What was the relationship between
Earth and Aurora? Did either or both colonize the Galaxy? If one, why
didn’t the other? If both, how was the issue decided? Are there worlds
descended from both or from only one? How did robots come to be
abandoned? How did Trantor become the Imperial world, rather than
another planet? What happened to Aurora and Earth in the meantime? There
are a thousand questions I might ask right now and a hundred thousand
that might arise as I go along. Would you allow me to remain ignorant,
Hummin, and fail in my task when you could inform me and help me
succeed?”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “If I were the robot, would I have room in my brain for
all of twenty thousand years of history for millions of different
worlds?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the capacity of robotic brains. I don’t know the
capacity of yours. But if you lack the capacity, then you must have that
information which you cannot hold safely recorded in a place and in a
way that would make it possible for you to call upon it. And if you have
it and I need information, how can you deny and withhold it from me? And
if you cannot withhold it from me, how can you deny that you are a
robot—that robot—the Renegade?”</p>
<p>Seldon sat back and took a deep breath. “So I ask you again: Are you
that robot? If you want psychohistory, then you must admit it. If you
still deny you are a robot and if you convince me you are not, then my
chances at psychohistory become much, much smaller. It is up to you,
then. Are you a robot? Are you Da-Nee?”</p>
<p>And Hummin said, as imperturbable as ever, “Your arguments are
irrefutable. I am R. Daneel Olivaw. The ‘R’ stands for ‘robot.’”</p>
