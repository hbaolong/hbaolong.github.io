<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon sat at Yugo Amaryl’s bedside—patiently, sadly. Yugo was
utterly spent. He was beyond medical help, even if he would have
consented to avail himself of such help, which he refused.</p>
<p>He was only fifty-five. Seldon was himself sixty-six and yet he was
in fine shape, except for the twinge of sciatica—or whatever it was—that
occasionally lamed him.</p>
<p>Amaryl’s eyes opened. “You’re still here, Hari?”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “I won’t leave you.”</p>
<p>“Till I die?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Then, in an outburst of grief, he said, “Why have you done
this, Yugo? If you had lived sensibly, you could have had twenty to
thirty more years of life.”</p>
<p>Amaryl smiled faintly. “Live sensibly? You mean, take time off? Go to
resorts? Amuse myself with trifles?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes.”</p>
<p>“And I would either have longed to return to my work or I would have
learned to like wasting my time and, in the additional twenty to thirty
years you speak of, I would have accomplished no more. Look at you.”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>“For ten years you were First Minister under Cleon. How much science
did you do then?”</p>
<p>“I spent about a quarter of my time on psychohistory,” said Seldon
gently.</p>
<p>“You exaggerate. If it hadn’t been for me, plugging away,
psychohistorical advance would have screeched to a halt.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “You are right, Yugo. For that I am grateful.”</p>
<p>“And before and since, when you spend at least half your time on
administrative duties, who does—did—the real work? Eh?”</p>
<p>“You, Yugo.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.” His eyes closed again.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Yet you always wanted to take over those administrative
duties if you survived me.”</p>
<p>“No! I wanted to head the Project to keep it moving in the direction
it had to move in, but I would have delegated all administration.”</p>
<p>Amaryl’s breathing was growing stertorous, but then he stirred and
his eyes opened, staring directly at Hari. He said, “What will happen to
psychohistory when I’m gone? Have you thought of that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have. And I want to speak to you about it. It may please you.
Yugo, I believe that psychohistory is being revolutionized.”</p>
<p>Amaryl frowned slightly. “In what way? I don’t like the sound of
that.”</p>
<p>“Listen. It was your idea. Years ago, you told me that two
Foundations should be established. Separate—isolated and safe—and
arranged so that they would serve as nuclei for an eventual Second
Galactic Empire. Do you remember? That was your idea.”</p>
<p>“The psychohistoric equations—”</p>
<p>“I know. They suggested it. I’m busy working on it now, Yugo. I’ve
managed to wangle an office in the Galactic Library—”</p>
<p>“The Galactic Library.” Amaryl’s frown deepened. “I don’t like them.
A bunch of self-satisfied idiots.”</p>
<p>“The Chief Librarian, Las Zenow, is not so bad, Yugo.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever meet a Librarian named Mummery, Gennaro Mummery?”</p>
<p>“No, but I’ve heard of him.”</p>
<p>“A miserable human being. We had an argument once when he claimed I
had misplaced something or other. I had done no such thing and I grew
very annoyed, Hari. All of a sudden I was back in Dahl. —One thing about
the Dahlite culture, Hari, it is a cesspool of invective. I used some of
it on him and I told him he was interfering with psychohistory and he
would go down in history as a villain. I didn’t just say ‘villain,’
either.” Amaryl chuckled faintly. “I left him speechless.”</p>
<p>Suddenly Seldon could see where Mummery’s animosity toward outsiders
and, most probably, psychohistory must come from—at least, in part—but
he said nothing.</p>
<p>“The point is, Yugo, you wanted two Foundations, so that if one
failed, the other would continue. But we’ve gone beyond that.”</p>
<p>“In what way?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember that Wanda was able to read your mind two years ago
and see that something was wrong with a portion of the equations in the
Prime Radiant?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“Well, we will find others like Wanda. We will have one Foundation
that will consist largely of physical scientists, who will preserve the
knowledge of humanity and serve as the nucleus for the Second Empire.
And there will be a Second Foundation of psychohistorians
only—mentalists, mind-touching psychohistorians—who will be able to work
on psychohistory in a multi-minded way, advancing it far more quickly
than individual thinkers ever could. They will serve as a group who will
introduce fine adjustments as time goes on, you see. Ever in the
background, watching. They will be the Empire’s guardians.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” said Amaryl weakly. “Wonderful! You see how I’ve chosen
the right time to die? There’s nothing left for me to do.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that, Yugo.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make such a fuss over it, Hari. I’m too tired to do anything.
Thank you—thank you—for telling me”—his voice was weakening—“about the
revolution. It makes me—happy—happy—hap—”</p>
<p>And those were Yugo Amaryl’s last words.</p>
<p>Seldon bent over the bed. Tears stung his eyes and rolled down his
cheeks.</p>
<p>Another old friend gone. Demerzel, Cleon, Dors, now Yugo … leaving
him emptier and lonelier as he grew old.</p>
<p>And the revolution that had allowed Amaryl to die happy might never
come to pass. Could he manage to make use of the Galactic Library? Could
he find more people like Wanda? Most of all, how long would it take?</p>
<p>Seldon was sixty-six. If only he could have started this revolution
at thirty-two when he first came to Trantor.…</p>
<p>Now it might be too late.</p>
