<h4 id="section">66</h4>
<p>When Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili were alone, Dors asked
thoughtfully, “Are you really planning to see this ‘Mother’ woman?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about it, Dors.”</p>
<p>“You’re an odd one, Hari. You seem to go steadily from bad to worse.
You went Upperside, which seemed harmless enough, for a rational purpose
when you were in Streeling. Then, in Mycogen, you broke into the Elders’
aerie, a much more dangerous task, for a much more foolish purpose. And
now in Dahl, you want to go to this place, which that young man seems to
think is simple suicide, for something altogether nonsensical.”</p>
<p>“I’m curious about this reference to Earth—and must know if there’s
anything to it.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “It’s a legend and not even an interesting one. It is
routine. The names differ from planet to planet, but the content is the
same. There is always the tale of an original world and a golden age.
There is a longing for a supposedly simple and virtuous past that is
almost universal among the people of a complex and vicious society. In
one way or another, this is true of all societies, since everyone
imagines his or her own society to be too complex and vicious, however
simple it may be. Mark that down for your psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“Just the same,” said Seldon, “I have to consider the possibility
that one world did once exist. Aurora … Earth … the name doesn’t matter.
In fact—”</p>
<p>He paused and finally Dors said, “Well?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “Do you remember the hand-on-thigh story you
told me in Mycogen? It was right after I got the Book from Raindrop
Forty-Three … Well, it popped into my head one evening recently when we
were talking to the Tisalvers. I said something that reminded me, for an
instant—”</p>
<p>“Reminded you of what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember. It came into my head and went out again, but
somehow every time I think of the single-world notion, it seems to me I
have the tips of my fingers on something and then lose it.”</p>
<p>Dors looked at Seldon in surprise. “I don’t see what it could be. The
hand-on-thigh story has nothing to do with Earth or Aurora.”</p>
<p>“I know, but this … thing … that hovers just past the edge of my mind
seems to be connected with this single world anyway and I have the
feeling that I must find out more about it at any cost. That … and
robots.”</p>
<p>“Robots too? I thought the Elders’ aerie put an end to that.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I’ve been thinking about them.” He stared at Dors with a
troubled look on his face for a long moment, then said, “But I’m not
sure.”</p>
<p>“Sure about what, Hari?”</p>
<p>But Seldon merely shook his head and said nothing more.</p>
<p>Dors frowned, then said, “Hari, let me tell you one thing. In sober
history—and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about—there is no
mention of one world of origin. It’s a popular belief, I admit. I don’t
mean just among the unsophisticated followers of folklore, like the
Mycogenians and the Dahlite heatsinkers, but there are biologists who
insist that there must have been one world of origin for reasons that
are well outside my area of expertise and there are the more mystical
historians who tend to speculate about it. And among the leisure-class
intellectuals, I understand such speculations are becoming fashionable.
Still, scholarly history knows nothing about it.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “All the more reason, perhaps, to go beyond scholarly
history. All I want is a device that will simplify psychohistory for me
and I don’t care what the device is, whether it is a mathematical trick
or a historical trick or something totally imaginary. If the young man
we’ve just talked to had had a little more formal training, I’d have set
him on the problem. His thinking is marked by considerable ingenuity and
originality—”</p>
<p>Dors said, “And you’re really going to help him, then?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Just as soon as I’m in a position to.”</p>
<p>“But ought you to make promises you’re not sure you’ll be able to
keep?”</p>
<p>“I want to keep it. If you’re that stiff about impossible promises,
consider that Hummin told Sunmaster Fourteen that I’d use psychohistory
to get the Mycogenians their world back. There’s just about zero chance
of that. Even if I work out psychohistory, who knows if it can be used
for so narrow and specialized a purpose? There’s a real case of
promising what one can’t deliver.”</p>
<p>But Dors said with some heat, “Chetter Hummin was trying to save our
lives, to keep us out of the hands of Demerzel and the Emperor. Don’t
forget that. And I think he really would like to help the
Mycogenians.”</p>
<p>“And I really would like to help Yugo Amaryl and I am far more likely
to be able to help him than I am the Mycogenians, so if you justify the
second, please don’t criticize the first. What’s more, Dors”—and his
eyes flashed angrily—“I really would like to find Mother Rittah and I’m
prepared to go alone.”</p>
<p>“Never!” snapped Dors. “If you go, I go.”</p>
