<h4 id="section">93</h4>
<p>R. Daneel Olivaw still spoke quietly, but it seemed to Seldon that
there was a subtle change in his voice, as though he spoke more easily
now that he was no longer playing a part.</p>
<p>“In twenty thousand years,” said Daneel, “no one has guessed I was a
robot when it was not my intention to have him or her know. In part,
that was because human beings abandoned robots so long ago that very few
remember that they even existed at one time. And in part, it is because
I do have the ability to detect and affect human emotion. The detection
offers no trouble, but to affect emotion is difficult for me for reasons
having to do with my robotic nature—although I can do it when I wish. I
have the ability but must deal with my will not to use it. I try never
to interfere except when I have no choice but to do so. And when I do
interfere, it is rarely that I do more than strengthen, as little as I
can, what is already there. If I can achieve my purposes without doing
even so much, I avoid it.</p>
<p>“It was not necessary to tamper with Sunmaster Fourteen in order to
have him accept you—I call it ‘tampering,’ you notice, because it is not
a pleasant thing to do. I did not have to tamper with him because he did
owe me for favors rendered and he is an honorable man, despite the
peculiarities you found in him. I did interfere the second time, when
you had committed sacrilege in his eyes, but it took very little. He was
not anxious to hand you over to the Imperial authorities, whom he does
not like. I merely strengthened the dislike a trifle and he handed you
over to my care, accepting the arguments I offered, which otherwise he
might have considered specious.</p>
<p>“Nor did I tamper with you noticeably. You distrusted the Imperials
too. Most human beings do these days, which is an important factor in
the decay and deterioration of the Empire. What’s more, you were proud
of psychohistory as a concept, proud of having thought of it. You would
not have minded having it prove to be a practical discipline. That would
have further fed your pride.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned and said, “Pardon me, Master Robot, but I am not aware
that I am quite such a monster of pride.”</p>
<p>Daneel said mildly, “You are not a monster of pride at all. You are
perfectly aware that it is neither admirable nor useful to be driven by
pride, so you try to subdue that drive, but you might as well disapprove
of having yourself powered by your heartbeat. You cannot help either
fact. Though you hide your pride from yourself for the sake of your own
peace of mind, you cannot hide it from me. It is there, however
carefully you mask it over. And I had but to strengthen it a touch and
you were at once willing to take measures to hide from Demerzel,
measures that a moment before you would have resisted. And you were
eager to work at psychohistory with an intensity that a moment before
you would have scorned.</p>
<p>“I saw no necessity to touch anything else and so you have reasoned
out your robothood. Had I foreseen the possibility of that, I might have
stopped it, but my foresight and my abilities are not infinite. Nor am I
sorry now that I failed, for your arguments are good ones and it is
important that you know who I am and that I use what I am to help
you.</p>
<p>“Emotions, my dear Seldon, are a powerful engine of human action, far
more powerful than human beings themselves realize, and you cannot know
how much can be done with the merest touch and how reluctant I am to do
it.”</p>
<p>Seldon was breathing heavily, trying to see himself as a man driven
by pride and not liking it. “Why reluctant?”</p>
<p>“Because it would be so easy to overdo. I had to stop Rashelle from
converting the Empire into a feudal anarchy. I might have bent minds
quickly and the result might well have been a bloody uprising. Men are
men—and the Wyan generals are almost all men. It does not actually take
much to rouse resentment and latent fear of women in any man. It may be
a biological matter that I, as a robot, cannot fully understand.</p>
<p>“I had but to strengthen the feeling to produce a breakdown in her
plans. If I had done it the merest millimeter too much, I would have
lost what I wanted—a bloodless takeover. I wanted nothing more than to
have them not resist when my soldiers arrived.”</p>
<p>Daneel paused, as though trying to pick his words, then said, “I do
not wish to go into the mathematics of my positronic brain. It is more
than I can understand, though perhaps not more than you can if you give
it enough thought. However, I am governed by the Three Laws of Robotics
that are traditionally put into words—or once were, long ago. They are
these:</p>
<p>“ ’One. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,
allow a human being to come to harm.</p>
<p>“ ’Two. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except
where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p>
<p>“ ‘Three. A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such
protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.’</p>
<p>“But I had a … a friend twenty thousand years ago. Another robot. Not
like myself. He could not be mistaken for a human being, but it was he
who had the mental powers and it was through him that I gained mine.</p>
<p>“It seemed to him that there should be a still more general rule than
any of the Three Laws. He called it the Zeroth Law, since zero comes
before one. It is:</p>
<p>“ ‘Zero. A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow
humanity to come to harm.’</p>
<p>“Then the First Law must read:</p>
<p>“ ‘One. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,
allow a human being to come to harm, except where that would conflict
with the Zeroth Law.’</p>
<p>“And the other laws must be similarly modified. Do you
understand?”</p>
<p>Daneel paused earnestly and Seldon said, “I understand.”</p>
<p>Daneel went on. “The trouble is, Hari, that a human being is easy to
identify. I can point to one. It is easy to see what will harm a human
being and what won’t—relatively easy, at least. But what is humanity? To
what can we point when we speak of humanity? And how can we define harm
to humanity? When will a course of action do more good than harm to
humanity as a whole and how can one tell? The robot who first advanced
the Zeroth Law died—became permanently inactive—because he was forced
into an action that he felt would save humanity, yet which he could not
be sure would save humanity. And as he became inactivated, he left the
care of the Galaxy to me.</p>
<p>“Since then, I have tried. I have interfered as little as possible,
relying on human beings themselves to judge what was for the good. They
could gamble; I could not. They could miss their goals; I did not dare.
They could do harm unwittingly; I would grow inactive if I did. The
Zeroth Law makes no allowance for unwitting harm.</p>
<p>“But at times I am forced to take action. That I am still functioning
shows that my actions have been moderate and discreet. However, as the
Empire began to fail and to decline, I have had to interfere more
frequently and for decades now I have had to play the role of Demerzel,
trying to run the government in such a way as to stave off ruin—and yet
I still function, you see.</p>
<p>“When you made your speech to the Decennial Convention, I realized at
once that in psychohistory there was a tool that might make it possible
to identify what was good and bad for humanity. With it, the decisions
we would make would be less blind. I would even trust to human beings to
make those decisions and again reserve myself only for the greatest
emergencies. So I arranged quickly to have Cleon learn of your speech
and call you in. Then, when I heard your denial of the worth of
psychohistory, I was forced to think of some way to make you try anyway.
Do you understand, Hari?”</p>
<p>More than a little daunted, Seldon said, “I understand, Hummin.”</p>
<p>“To you, I must remain Hummin on those rare occasions when I will be
able to see you. I will give you what information I have if it is
something you need and in my persona as Demerzel I will protect you as
much as I can. As Daneel, you must never speak of me.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want to,” said Seldon hurriedly. “Since I need your help,
it would ruin matters to have your plans impeded.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know you wouldn’t want to.” Daneel smiled wearily. “After
all, you are vain enough to want full credit for psychohistory. You
would not want anyone to know—ever—that you needed the help of a
robot.”</p>
<p>Seldon flushed. “I am not—”</p>
<p>“But you are, even if you carefully hide it from yourself. And it is
important, for I am strengthening that emotion within you minimally so
that you will never be able to speak of me to others. It will not even
occur to you that you might do so.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I suspect Dors knows—”</p>
<p>“She knows of me. And she too cannot speak of me to others. Now that
you both know of my nature, you can speak of me to each other freely,
but not to anyone else.”</p>
<p>Daneel rose. “Hari, I have my work to do now. Before long, you and
Dors will be taken back to the Imperial Sector—”</p>
<p>“The boy Raych must come with me. I cannot abandon him. And there is
a young Dahlite named Yugo Amaryl—”</p>
<p>“I understand. Raych will be taken too and you can do with any friend
as you will. You will all be taken care of appropriately. And you will
work on psychohistory. You will have a staff. You will have the
necessary computers and reference material. I will interfere as little
as possible and if there is resistance to your views that does not
actually reach the point of endangering the mission, then you will have
to deal with it yourself.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Hummin,” said Seldon urgently. “What if, despite all your help
and all my endeavors, it turns out that psychohistory cannot be made
into a practical device after all? What if I fail?”</p>
<p>Daneel rose. “In that case, I have a second plan in hand. One I have
been working on a long time on a separate world in a separate way. It
too is very difficult and in some ways even more radical than
psychohistory. It may fail too, but there is a greater chance of success
if two roads are open than if either one alone was.</p>
<p>“Take my advice, Hari! If the time comes when you are able to set up
some device that may act to prevent the worst from happening, see if you
can think of two devices, so that if one fails, the other will carry on.
The Empire must be steadied or rebuilt on a new foundation. Let there be
two such, rather than one, if that is possible.”</p>
<p>He rose, “Now I must return to my ordinary work and you must turn to
yours. You will be taken care of.”</p>
<p>With one final nod, he rose and left.</p>
<p>Seldon looked after him and said softly, “First I must speak to
Dors.”</p>
