<h4 id="section">62</h4>
<p>Jirad Tisalver of the Dahl Sector was short. The top of his head came
up only to Hari Seldon’s nose. He did not seem to take that to heart,
however. He had handsome, even features, was given to smiling, and
sported a thick black mustache and crisply curling black hair.</p>
<p>He lived, with his wife and a half-grown daughter, in an apartment of
seven small rooms, kept meticulously clean, but almost bare of
furnishings.</p>
<p>Tisalver said, “I apologize, Master Seldon and Mistress Venabili,
that I cannot give you the luxury to which you must be accustomed, but
Dahl is a poor sector and I am not even among the better-off among our
people.”</p>
<p>“The more reason,” responded Seldon, “that we must apologize to you
for placing the burden of our presence upon you.”</p>
<p>“No burden, Master Seldon. Master Hummin has arranged to pay us
generously for your use of our humble quarters and the credits would be
welcome even if you were not—and you are.”</p>
<p>Seldon remembered Hummin’s parting words when they finally arrived in
Dahl.</p>
<p>“Seldon,” he had said, “this is the third place I’ve arranged as
sanctuary. The first two were notoriously beyond the reach of the
Imperium, which might well have served to attract their attention; after
all, they were logical places for you. This one is different. It is
poor, unremarkable, and, as a matter of fact, unsafe in some ways. It is
not a natural refuge for you, so that the Emperor and his Chief of Staff
may not think to turn their eyes in this direction. Would you mind
staying out of trouble this time, then?”</p>
<p>“I will try, Hummin,” said Seldon, a little offended. “Please be
aware that the trouble is not of my seeking. I am trying to learn what
may well take me thirty lifetimes to learn if I am to have the slightest
chance of organizing psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” said Hummin. “Your efforts at learning brought you to
Upperside in Streeling and to the Elders’ aerie in Mycogen and to who
can guess where in Dahl. As for you, Dr. Venabili, I know you’ve been
trying to take care of Seldon, but you must try harder. Get it fixed in
your head that he is the most important person on Trantor—or in the
Galaxy, for that matter—and that he must be kept secure at any
cost.”</p>
<p>“I will continue to do my best,” said Dors stiffly.</p>
<p>“And as for your host family, they have their peculiarities, but they
are essentially good people with whom I have dealt before. Try not to
get them in trouble either.”</p>
<p>But Tisalver, at least, did not seem to anticipate trouble of any
kind from his new tenants and his expressed pleasure at the company he
now had—quite apart from the rent credits he would be getting—seemed
quite sincere.</p>
<p>He had never been outside Dahl and his appetite for tales of distant
places was enormous. His wife too, bowing and smiling, would listen and
their daughter, with a finger in her mouth, would allow one eye to peep
from behind the door.</p>
<p>It was usually after dinner, when the entire family assembled, that
Seldon and Dors were expected to talk of the outside world. The food was
plentiful enough, but it was bland and often tough. So soon after the
tangy food of Mycogen, it was all but inedible. The “table” was a long
shelf against one wall and they ate standing up.</p>
<p>Gentle questioning by Seldon elicited the fact that this was the
usual situation among Dahlites as a whole and was not due to unusual
poverty. Of course, Mistress Tisalver explained, there were those with
high government jobs in Dahl who were prone to adopt all kinds of effete
customs like chairs—she called them “body shelves” but this was looked
down upon by the solid middle class.</p>
<p>Much as they disapproved of unnecessary luxury, though, the Tisalvers
loved hearing about it, listening with a virtual storm of
tongue-clicking when told of mattresses lifted on legs, of ornate chests
and wardrobes, and of a superfluity of tableware.</p>
<p>They listened also to a description of Mycogenian customs, while
Jirad Tisalver stroked his own hair complacently and made it quite
obvious that he would as soon think of emasculation as of depilation.
Mistress Tisalver was furious at any mention of female subservience and
flatly refused to believe that the Sisters accepted it tranquilly.</p>
<p>They seized most, however, on Seldon’s casual reference to the
Imperial grounds. When, upon questioning, it turned out that Seldon had
actually seen and spoken to the Emperor, a blanket of awe enveloped the
family. It took a while before they dared ask questions and Seldon found
that he could not satisfy them. He had not, after all, seen much of the
grounds and even less of the Palace interior.</p>
<p>That disappointed the Tisalvers and they were unremitting in their
attempts to elicit more. And, having heard of Seldon’s Imperial
adventure, they found it hard to believe Dors’s assertion that, for her
part, she had never been anywhere in the Imperial grounds. Most of all,
they rejected Seldon’s casual comment that the Emperor had talked and
behaved very much as any ordinary human being would. That seemed utterly
impossible to the Tisalvers.</p>
<p>After three evenings of this, Seldon found himself tiring. He had, at
first, welcomed the chance to do nothing for a while (during the day, at
least) but view some of the history book-films that Dors recommended.
The Tisalvers turned over their book-viewer to their guests during the
day with good grace, though the little girl seemed unhappy and was sent
over to a neighbor’s apartment to use theirs for her homework.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t help,” Seldon said restlessly in the security of his room
after he had piped in some music to discourage eavesdropping. “I can see
your fascination with history, but it’s all endless detail. It’s a
mountainous heap—no, a Galactic heap—of data in which I can’t see the
basic organization.”</p>
<p>“I dare say,” said Dors, “that there must have been a time when human
beings saw no organization in the stars in the sky, but eventually they
discovered the Galactic structure.”</p>
<p>“And I’m sure that took generations, not weeks. There must have been
a time when physics seemed a mass of unrelated observations before the
central natural laws were discovered and that took generations. —And
what of the Tisalvers?”</p>
<p>“What of them? I think they’re being very nice.”</p>
<p>“They’re curious.”</p>
<p>“Of course they are. Wouldn’t you be if you were in their place?”</p>
<p>“But is it just curiosity? They seem to be ferociously interested in
my meeting with the Emperor.”</p>
<p>Dors seemed impatient. “Again … it’s only natural. Wouldn’t you be—if
the situation was reversed?”</p>
<p>“It makes me nervous.”</p>
<p>“Hummin brought us here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but he’s not perfect. He brought me to the University and I was
maneuvered Upperside. He brought us to Sunmaster Fourteen, who entrapped
us. You know he did. Twice bitten, at least once shy. I’m tired of being
questioned.”</p>
<p>“Then turn the tables, Hari. Aren’t you interested in Dahl?”</p>
<p>“Of course. What do you know about it to begin with?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s just one of more than eight hundred sectors and I’ve
only been on Trantor a little over two years.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. And there are twenty-five million other worlds and I’ve
been on this problem only a little over two months. —I tell you. I want
to go back to Helicon and take up a study of the mathematics of
turbulence, which was my Ph.D. problem, and forget I ever saw—or thought
I saw—that turbulence gave an insight into human society.”</p>
<p>But that evening he said to Tisalver, “But you know, Master Tisalver,
you’ve never told me what you do, the nature of your work.”</p>
<p>“Me?” Tisalver placed his fingers on his chest, which was covered by
the simple white T-shirt with nothing underneath, which seemed to be the
standard male uniform in Dahl. “Nothing much. I work at the local
holovision station in programming. It’s very dull, but it’s a
living.”</p>
<p>“And it’s respectable,” said Mistress Tisalver. “It means he doesn’t
have to work in the heatsinks.”</p>
<p>“The heatsinks?” said Dors, lifting her light eyebrows and managing
to look fascinated.</p>
<p>“Oh well,” said Tisalver, “that’s what Dahl is best known for. It
isn’t much, but forty billion people on Trantor need energy and we
supply a lot of it. We don’t get appreciated, but I’d like to see some
of the fancy sectors do without it.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked confused. “Doesn’t Trantor get its energy from solar
power stations in orbit?”</p>
<p>“Some,” said Tisalver, “and some from nuclear fusion stations out on
the islands and some from microfusion motors and some from wind stations
Upperside, but half”—he raised a finger in emphasis and his face looked
unusually grave—“half comes from the heatsinks. There are heatsinks in
lots of places, but none—none—as rich as those in Dahl. Are you serious
that you don’t know about the heatsinks? You sit there and stare at
me.”</p>
<p>Dors said quickly, “We are Outworlders, you know.” (She had almost
said “tribespeople,” but had caught herself in time.) “Especially
Dr. Seldon. He’s only been on Trantor a couple of months.”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Mistress Tisalver. She was a trifle shorter than her
husband, was plump without quite being fat, had her dark hair drawn
tightly back into a bun, and possessed rather beautiful dark eyes. Like
her husband, she appeared to be in her thirties.</p>
<p>(After a period in Mycogen, not actually long in duration but
intense, it struck Dors as odd to have a woman enter the conversation at
will. How quickly modes and manners establish themselves, she thought,
and made a mental note to mention that to Seldon—one more item for his
psychohistory.)</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” she said. “Dr. Seldon is from Helicon.”</p>
<p>Mistress Tisalver registered polite ignorance. “And where might that
be?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Why, it’s—” She turned to Seldon. “Where is it,
Hari?”</p>
<p>Seldon looked abashed. “To tell you the truth, I don’t think I could
locate it very easily on a Galactic model without looking up the
co-ordinates. All I can say is that it’s on the other side of the
central black hole from Trantor and getting there by hypership is rather
a chore.”</p>
<p>Mistress Tisalver said, “I don’t think Jirad and I will ever be on a
hypership.”</p>
<p>“Someday, Casilia,” said Tisalver cheerfully, “maybe we will. But
tell us about Helicon, Master Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “To me that would be dull. It’s just a world,
like any other. Only Trantor is different from all the rest. There are
no heatsinks on Helicon—or probably anywhere else—except Trantor. Tell
me about them.”</p>
<p>(“Only Trantor is different from all the rest.” The sentence repeated
itself in Seldon’s mind and for a moment he grasped at it, and for some
reason Dors’s hand-on-thigh story suddenly recurred to him, but Tisalver
was speaking and it passed out of Seldon’s mind as quickly as it had
entered.)</p>
<p>Tisalver said, “If you really want to know about heatsinks, I can
show you.” He turned to his wife. “Casilia, would you mind if tomorrow
evening I take Master Seldon to the heatsinks?”</p>
<p>“And me,” said Dors quickly.</p>
<p>“And Mistress Venabili?”</p>
<p>Mistress Tisalver frowned and said sharply, “I don’t think it would
be a good idea. Our visitors would find it dull.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, Mistress Tisalver,” said Seldon ingratiatingly.
“We would very much like to see the heatsinks. We would be delighted if
you would join us too … and your little daughter—if she wants to
come.”</p>
<p>“To the heatsinks?” said Mistress Tisalver, stiffening. “It’s no
place at all for a decent woman.”</p>
<p>Seldon felt embarrassed at his gaffe. “I meant no harm, Mistress
Tisalver.”</p>
<p>“No offense,” said Tisalver. “Casilia thinks it’s beneath us and so
it is, but as long as I don’t work there, it’s no distress merely to
visit and show it to guests. But it is uncomfortable and I would never
get Casilia to dress properly.”</p>
<p>They got up from their crouching positions. Dahlite “chairs” were
merely molded plastic seats on small wheels and they cramped Seldon’s
knees terribly and seemed to wiggle at his least body movement. The
Tisalvers, however, had mastered the art of sitting firmly and rose
without trouble and without needing to use their arms for help as Seldon
had to. Dors also got up without trouble and Seldon once again marveled
at her natural grace.</p>
<p>Before they parted to their separate rooms for the night, Seldon said
to Dors, “Are you sure you know nothing about heatsinks? Mistress
Tisalver makes them seem unpleasant.”</p>
<p>“They can’t be that unpleasant or Tisalver wouldn’t suggest taking us
on tour. Let’s be content to be surprised.”</p>
