<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>Seldon was not at all sure he would meet the Emperor. At best, he
would meet some official in the fourth or fifth echelon who would claim
to speak for the Emperor.</p>
<p>How many people ever did see the Emperor? In person, rather than on
holovision? How many people saw the real, tangible Emperor, an Emperor
who never left the Imperial grounds that he, Seldon, was now rolling
over.</p>
<p>The number was vanishingly small. Twenty-five million inhabited
worlds, each with its cargo of a billion human beings or more—and among
all those quadrillions of human beings, how many had, or would ever, lay
eyes on the living Emperor. A thousand?</p>
<p>And did anyone care? The Emperor was no more than a symbol of Empire,
like the Spaceship-and-Sun but far less pervasive, far less real. It was
his soldiers and his officials, crawling everywhere, that now
represented an Empire that had become a dead weight upon its people—not
the Emperor.</p>
<p>So it was that when Seldon was ushered into a moderately sized,
lavishly furnished room and found a young-looking man sitting on the
edge of a table in a windowed alcove, one foot on the ground and one
swinging over the edge, he found himself wondering that any official
should be looking at him in so blandly good-natured a way. He had
already experienced the fact, over and over, that government
officials—and particularly those in the Imperial service—looked grave at
all times, as though bearing the weight of the entire Galaxy on their
shoulders. And it seemed the lower in importance they were, the graver
and more threatening their expression.</p>
<p>This, then, might be an official so high in the scale, with the sun
of power so bright upon him, that he felt no need of countering it with
clouds of frowning.</p>
<p>Seldon wasn’t sure how impressed he ought to be, but he felt that it
would be best to remain silent and let the other speak first.</p>
<p>The official said, “You are Hari Seldon, I believe. The
mathematician.”</p>
<p>Seldon responded with a minimal “Yes, sir,” and waited again.</p>
<p>The young man waved an arm. “It should be ‘Sire,’ but I hate
ceremony. It’s all I get and I weary of it. We are alone, so I will
pamper myself and eschew ceremony. Sit down, professor.”</p>
<p>Halfway through the speech, Seldon realized that he was speaking to
the Emperor Cleon, First of that Name, and he felt the wind go out of
him. There was a faint resemblance (now that he looked) to the official
holograph that appeared constantly in the news, but in that holograph,
Cleon was always dressed imposingly, seemed taller, nobler,
frozen-faced.</p>
<p>And here he was, the original of the holograph, and somehow he
appeared to be quite ordinary.</p>
<p>Seldon did not budge.</p>
<p>The Emperor frowned slightly and, with the habit of command present
even in the attempt to abolish it, at least temporarily, said
peremptorily, “I said, ‘Sit down,’ man. That chair. Quickly.”</p>
<p>Seldon sat down, quite speechless. He could not even bring himself to
say, “Yes, Sire.”</p>
<p>Cleon smiled. “That’s better. Now we can talk like two fellow human
beings, which, after all, is what we are once ceremony is removed. Eh,
my man?”</p>
<p>Seldon said cautiously, “If Your Imperial Majesty is content to say
so, then it is so.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come, why are you so cautious? I want to talk to you on equal
terms. It is my pleasure to do so. Humor me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire.”</p>
<p>“A simple ‘Yes,’ man. Is there no way I can reach you?”</p>
<p>Cleon stared at Seldon and Seldon thought it was a lively and
interested stare.</p>
<p>Finally the Emperor said, “You don’t look like a mathematician.”</p>
<p>At last, Seldon found himself able to smile. “I don’t know what a
mathematician is supposed to look like, Your Imp—”</p>
<p>Cleon raised a cautioning hand and Seldon choked off the
honorific.</p>
<p>Cleon said, “White-haired, I suppose. Bearded, perhaps. Old,
certainly.”</p>
<p>“Yet even mathematicians must be young to begin with.”</p>
<p>“But they are then without reputation. By the time they obtrude
themselves on the notice of the Galaxy, they are as I have
described.”</p>
<p>“I am without reputation, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“Yet you spoke at this convention they held here.”</p>
<p>“A great many of us did. Some were younger than myself. Few of us
were granted any attention whatever.”</p>
<p>“Your talk apparently attracted the attention of some of my
officials. I am given to understand that you believe it possible to
predict the future.”</p>
<p>Seldon suddenly felt weary. It seemed as though this
misinterpretation of his theory was constantly going to occur. Perhaps
he should not have presented his paper.</p>
<p>He said, “Not quite, actually. What I have done is much more limited
than that. In many systems, the situation is such that under some
conditions chaotic events take place. That means that, given a
particular starting point, it is impossible to predict outcomes. This is
true even in some quite simple systems, but the more complex a system,
the more likely it is to become chaotic. It has always been assumed that
anything as complicated as human society would quickly become chaotic
and, therefore, unpredictable. What I have done, however, is to show
that, in studying human society, it is possible to choose a starting
point and to make appropriate assumptions that will suppress the chaos.
That will make it possible to predict the future, not in full detail, of
course, but in broad sweeps; not with certainty, but with calculable
probabilities.”</p>
<p>The Emperor, who had listened carefully, said, “But doesn’t that mean
that you have shown how to predict the future?”</p>
<p>“Again, not quite. I have shown that it is theoretically possible,
but no more. To do more, we would actually have to choose a correct
starting point, make correct assumptions, and then find ways of carrying
through calculations in a finite time. Nothing in my mathematical
argument tells us how to do any of this. And even if we could do it all,
we would, at best, only assess probabilities. That is not the same as
predicting the future; it is merely a guess at what is likely to happen.
Every successful politician, businessman, or human being of any calling
must make these estimates of the future and do it fairly well or he or
she would not be successful.”</p>
<p>“They do it without mathematics.”</p>
<p>“True. They do it by intuition.”</p>
<p>“With the proper mathematics, anyone would be able to assess the
probabilities. It wouldn’t take the rare human being who is successful
because of a remarkable intuitive sense.”</p>
<p>“True again, but I have merely shown that mathematical analysis is
possible; I have not shown it to be practical.”</p>
<p>“How can something be possible, yet not practical?”</p>
<p>“It is theoretically possible for me to visit each world of the
Galaxy and greet each person on each world. However, it would take far
longer to do this than I have years to live and, even if I was immortal,
the rate at which new human beings are being born is greater than the
rate at which I could interview the old and, even more to the point, old
human beings would die in great numbers before I could ever get to
them.”</p>
<p>“And is this sort of thing true of your mathematics of the
future?”</p>
<p>Seldon hesitated, then went on. “It might be that the mathematics
would take too long to work out, even if one had a computer the size of
the Universe working at hyperspatial velocities. By the time any answer
had been received, enough years would have elapsed to alter the
situation so grossly as to make the answer meaningless.”</p>
<p>“Why cannot the process be simplified?” Cleon asked sharply.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty” Seldon felt the Emperor growing more formal
as the answers grew less to his liking and responded with greater
formality of his own—“consider the manner in which scientists have dealt
with subatomic particles. There are enormous numbers of these, each
moving or vibrating in random and unpredictable manner, but this chaos
turns out to have an underlying order, so that we can work out a quantum
mechanics that answers all the questions we know how to ask. In studying
society, we place human beings in the place of subatomic particles, but
now there is the added factor of the human mind. Particles move
mindlessly; human beings do not. To take into account the various
attitudes and impulses of mind adds so much complexity that there lacks
time to take care of all of it.”</p>
<p>“Could not mind, as well as mindless motion, have an underlying
order?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. My mathematical analysis implies that order must underlie
everything, however disorderly it may appear to be, but it does not give
any hint as to how this underlying order may be found.
Consider—Twenty-five million worlds, each with its overall
characteristics and culture, each being significantly different from all
the rest, each containing a billion or more human beings who each have
an individual mind, and all the worlds interacting in innumerable ways
and combinations! However theoretically possible a psychohistorical
analysis may be, it is not likely that it can be done in any practical
sense.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘psychohistorical’?”</p>
<p>“I refer to the theoretical assessment of probabilities concerning
the future as ‘psychohistory.’”</p>
<p>The Emperor rose to his feet suddenly, strode to the other end of the
room, turned, strode back, and stopped before the still-sitting
Seldon.</p>
<p>“Stand up!” he commanded.</p>
<p>Seldon rose and looked up at the somewhat taller Emperor. He strove
to keep his gaze steady.</p>
<p>Cleon finally said, “This psychohistory of yours … if it could be
made practical, it would be of great use, would it not?”</p>
<p>“Of enormous use, obviously. To know what the future holds, in even
the most general and probabilistic way, would serve as a new and
marvelous guide for our actions, one that humanity has never before had.
But, of course—” He paused.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Cleon impatiently.</p>
<p>“Well, it would seem that, except for a few decision-makers, the
results of psychohistorical analysis would have to remain unknown to the
public.”</p>
<p>“Unknown!” exclaimed Cleon with surprise.</p>
<p>“It’s clear. Let me try to explain. If a psychohistorical analysis is
made and the results are then given to the public, the various emotions
and reactions of humanity would at once be distorted. The
psychohistorical analysis, based on emotions and reactions that take
place without knowledge of the future, become meaningless. Do you
understand?”</p>
<p>The Emperor’s eyes brightened and he laughed aloud. “Wonderful!”</p>
<p>He clapped his hand on Seldon’s shoulder and Seldon staggered
slightly under the blow.</p>
<p>“Don’t you see, man?” said Cleon. “Don’t you see? There’s your use.
You don’t need to predict the future. Just choose a future—a good
future, a useful future—and make the kind of prediction that will alter
human emotions and reactions in such a way that the future you predicted
will be brought about. Better to make a good future than predict a bad
one.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “I see what you mean, Sire, but that is equally
impossible.”</p>
<p>“Impossible?”</p>
<p>“Well, at any rate, impractical. Don’t you see? If you can’t start
with human emotions and reactions and predict the future they will bring
about, you can’t do the reverse either. You can’t start with a future
and predict the human emotions and reactions that will bring it
about.”</p>
<p>Cleon looked frustrated. His lips tightened. “And your paper, then?…
Is that what you call it, a paper?… Of what use is it?”</p>
<p>“It was merely a mathematical demonstration. It made a point of
interest to mathematicians, but there was no thought in my mind of its
being useful in any way.”</p>
<p>“I find that disgusting,” said Cleon angrily.</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged slightly. More than ever, he knew he should never
have given the paper. What would become of him if the Emperor took it
into his head that he had been made to play the fool?</p>
<p>And indeed, Cleon did not look as though he was very far from
believing that.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” he said, “what if you were to make predictions of the
future, mathematically justified or not; predictions that government
officials, human beings whose expertise it is to know what the public is
likely to do, will judge to be the kind that will bring about useful
reactions?”</p>
<p>“Why would you need me to do that? The government officials could
make those predictions themselves and spare the middleman.”</p>
<p>“The government officials could not do so as effectively. Government
officials do make statements of the sort now and then. They are not
necessarily believed.”</p>
<p>“Why would I be?”</p>
<p>“You are a mathematician. You would have calculated the future, not …
not intuited it—if that is a word.”</p>
<p>“But I would not have done so.”</p>
<p>“Who would know that?” Cleon watched him out of narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Seldon felt trapped. If given a direct order by
the Emperor, would it be safe to refuse? If he refused, he might be
imprisoned or executed. Not without trial, of course, but it is only
with great difficulty that a trial can be made to go against the wishes
of a heavy-handed officialdom, particularly one under the command of the
Emperor of the vast Galactic Empire.</p>
<p>He said finally, “It wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“If I were asked to predict vague generalities that could not
possibly come to pass until long after this generation and, perhaps, the
next were dead, we might get away with it, but, on the other hand, the
public would pay little attention. They would not care about a glowing
eventuality a century or two in the future.</p>
<p>“To attain results,” Seldon went on, “I would have to predict matters
of sharper consequence, more immediate eventualities. Only to these
would the public respond. Sooner or later, though—and probably
sooner—one of the eventualities would not come to pass and my usefulness
would be ended at once. With that, your popularity might be gone, too,
and, worst of all, there would be no further support for the development
of psychohistory so that there would be no chance for any good to come
of it if future improvements in mathematical insights help to make it
move closer to the realm of practicality.”</p>
<p>Cleon threw himself into a chair and frowned at Seldon. “Is that all
you mathematicians can do? Insist on impossibilities?”</p>
<p>Seldon said with desperate softness, “It is you, Sire, who insist on
impossibilities.”</p>
<p>“Let me test you, man. Suppose I asked you to use your mathematics to
tell me whether I would some day be assassinated? What would you
say?”</p>
<p>“My mathematical system would not give an answer to so specific a
question, even if psychohistory worked at its best. All the quantum
mechanics in the world cannot make it possible to predict the behavior
of one lone electron, only the average behavior of many.”</p>
<p>“You know your mathematics better than I do. Make an educated guess
based on it. Will I someday be assassinated?”</p>
<p>Seldon said softly, “You lay a trap for me, Sire. Either tell me what
answer you wish and I will give it to you or else give me free right to
make what answer I wish without punishment.”</p>
<p>“Speak as you will.”</p>
<p>“Your word of honor?”</p>
<p>“Do you want it in writing?” Cleon was sarcastic.</p>
<p>“Your spoken word of honor will be sufficient,” said Seldon, his
heart sinking, for he was not certain it would be.</p>
<p>“You have my word of honor.”</p>
<p>“Then I can tell you that in the past four centuries nearly half the
Emperors have been assassinated, from which I conclude that the chances
of your assassination are roughly one in two.”</p>
<p>“Any fool can give that answer,” said Cleon with contempt. “It takes
no mathematician.”</p>
<p>“Yet I have told you several times that my mathematics is useless for
practical problems.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you even suppose that I learn the lessons that have been given
me by my unfortunate predecessors?”</p>
<p>Seldon took a deep breath and plunged in. “No, Sire. All history
shows that we do not learn from the lessons of the past. For instance,
you have allowed me here in a private audience. What if it were in my
mind to assassinate you? —Which it isn’t, Sire,” he added hastily.</p>
<p>Cleon smiled without humor. “My man, you don’t take into account our
thoroughness—or advances in technology. We have studied your history,
your complete record. When you arrived, you were scanned. Your
expression and voiceprints were analyzed. We knew your emotional state
in detail; we practically knew your thoughts. Had there been the
slightest doubt of your harmlessness, you would not have been allowed
near me. In fact, you would not now be alive.”</p>
<p>A wave of nausea swept through Seldon, but he continued. “Outsiders
have always found it difficult to get at Emperors, even with technology
less advanced. However, almost every assassination has been a palace
coup. It is those nearest the Emperor who are the greatest danger to
him. Against that danger, the careful screening of outsiders is
irrelevant. And as for your own officials, your own Guardsmen, your own
intimates, you cannot treat them as you treat me.”</p>
<p>Cleon said, “I know that, too, and at least as well as you do. The
answer is that I treat those about me fairly and I give them no cause
for resentment.”</p>
<p>“A foolish—” began Seldon, who then stopped in confusion.</p>
<p>“Go on,” said Cleon angrily. “I have given you permission to speak
freely. How am I foolish?”</p>
<p>“The word slipped out, Sire. I meant ‘irrelevant.’ Your treatment of
your intimates is irrelevant. You must be suspicious; it would be
inhuman not to be. A careless word, such as the one I used, a careless
gesture, a doubtful expression and you must withdraw a bit with narrowed
eyes. And any touch of suspicion sets in motion a vicious cycle. The
intimate will sense and resent the suspicion and will develop a changed
behavior, try as he might to avoid it. You sense that and grow more
suspicious and, in the end, either he is executed or you are
assassinated. It is a process that has proved unavoidable for the
Emperors of the past four centuries and it is but one sign of the
increasing difficulty of conducting the affairs of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Then nothing I can do will avoid assassination.”</p>
<p>“No, Sire,” said Seldon, “but, on the other hand, you may prove
fortunate.”</p>
<p>Cleon’s fingers were drumming on the arm of his chair. He said
harshly, “You are useless, man, and so is your psychohistory. Leave me.”
And with those words, the Emperor looked away, suddenly seeming much
older than his thirty-two years.</p>
<p>“I have said my mathematics would be useless to you, Sire. My
profound apologies.”</p>
<p>Seldon tried to bow but at some signal he did not see, two guards
entered and took him away. Cleon’s voice came after him from the royal
chamber. “Return that man to the place from which he was brought
earlier.”</p>
