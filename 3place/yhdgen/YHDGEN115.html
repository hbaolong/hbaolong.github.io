<p>COLLISION</p>
<ol type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Stor Gendibal was edging toward gaia almost as cautiously as Trevize
had—and now that its star was a perceptible disc and could be viewed
only through strong filters, he paused to consider.</p>
<p>Sura Novi sat to one side, looking up at him now and then in a
timorous manner.</p>
<p>She said softly, “Master?”</p>
<p>“What is it, Novi?” he asked abstractedly.</p>
<p>“Are you unhappy?”</p>
<p>He looked up at her quickly. “No. Concerned. Remember that word? I am
trying to decide whether to move in quickly or to wait longer. Shall I
be very brave, Novi?”</p>
<p>“I think you are very brave all times, Master.”</p>
<p>“To be brave is sometimes to be foolish.”</p>
<p>Novi smiled. “How can a master scholar be foolish? —That is a sun, is
it not, Master?” She pointed to the screen.</p>
<p>Gendibal nodded.</p>
<p>Novi said, after an irresolute pause, “Is it the sun that shines on
Trantor? Is it the Hamish sun?”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “No, Novi. It is a far different sun. There are many
suns, billions of them.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I have known this with my head. I could not make myself believe,
however. How is it, Master, that one can know with the head—and yet not
believe?”</p>
<p>Gendibal smiled faintly, “In your head, Novi—” he began and,
automatically, as he said that, he found himself in her head. He stroked
it gently, as he always did, when he found himself there—just a soothing
touch of mental tendrils to keep her calm and untroubled—and he would
then have left again, as he always did, had not something drawn him
back.</p>
<p>What he sensed was indescribable in any but mentalic terms, but
metaphorically, Novi’s brain glowed. It was the faintest possible
glow.</p>
<p>It would not be there except for the existence of a mentalic field
imposed from without—a mentalic field of an intensity so small that the
finest receiving function of Gendibal’s own well-trained mind could just
barely detect it, even against the utter smoothness of Novi’s mentalic
structure.</p>
<p>He said sharply, “Novi, how do you feel?”</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wide. “I feel well, Master.”</p>
<p>“Are you dizzy, confused? Close your eyes and sit absolutely still
until I say, ‘Now.’”</p>
<p>Obediently she closed her eyes. Carefully Gendibal brushed away all
extraneous sensations from her mind, quieted her thoughts, soothed her
emotions, stroked—stroked—He left nothing but the glow and it was so
faint that he could almost persuade himself it was not there.</p>
<p>“Now,” he said and Novi opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“How do you feel, Novi?”</p>
<p>“Very calm, Master. Rested.”</p>
<p>It was clearly too feeble for it to have any noticeable effect on
her.</p>
<p>He turned to the computer and wrestled with it. He had to admit to
himself that he and the computer did not mesh very well together.
Perhaps it was because he was too used to using his mind directly to be
able to work through an intermediary. But he was looking for a ship, not
a mind, and the initial search could be done more efficiently with the
help of the computer.</p>
<p>And he found the sort of ship he suspected might be present. It was
half a million kilometers away and it was much like his own in design,
but it was much larger and more elaborate.</p>
<p>Once it was located with the computer’s help, Gendibal could allow
his mind to take over directly. He sent it outward—tight-beamed—and with
it felt (or the mentalic equivalent of “felt”) the ship, inside and
out.</p>
<p>He then sent his mind toward the planet Gaia, approaching it more
closely by several millions of kilometers of space—and withdrew. Neither
process was sufficient in itself to tell him, unmistakably, which—if
either—was the source of the field.</p>
<p>He said, “Novi, I would like you to sit next to me for what is to
follow.”</p>
<p>“Master, is there danger?”</p>
<p>“You are not to be in any way concerned, Novi. I will see to it that
you are safe and secure.”</p>
<p>“Master, I am not concerned that I be safe and secure. If there is
danger, I want to be able to help you.”</p>
<p>Gendibal softened. He said, “Novi, you have already helped. Because
of you, I became aware of a very small thing it was important to be
aware of. Without you, I might have blundered rather deeply into a bog
and might have had to pull out only through a great deal of
trouble.”</p>
<p>“Have I done this with my mind, Master, as you once explained?” asked
Novi, astonished.</p>
<p>“Quite so, Novi. No instrument could have been more sensitive. My own
mind is not; it is too full of complexity.”</p>
<p>Delight filled Novi’s face. “I am so grateful I can help.”</p>
<p>Gendibal smiled and nodded—and then subsided into the somber
knowledge that he would need other help as well. Something childish
within him objected. The job was his—his alone.</p>
<p>Yet it could not be his alone. The odds were climbing—</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>On trantor, Quindor Shandess felt the responsibility of First
Speakerhood resting upon him with a suffocating weight. Since Gendibal’s
ship had vanished into the darkness beyond the atmosphere, he had called
no meetings of the Table. He had been lost in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>Had it been wise to allow Gendibal to go off on his own? Gendibal was
brilliant, but not so brilliant that it left no room for overconfidence.
Gendibal’s great fault was arrogance, as Shandess’s own great fault (he
thought bitterly) was the weariness of age.</p>
<p>Over and over again, it occurred to him that the precedent of Preem
Palver, flitting over the Galaxy to set things right, was a dangerous
one. Could anyone else be a Preem Palver? Even Gendibal? And Palver had
had his wife with him.</p>
<p>To be sure, Gendibal had this Hamishwoman, but she was of no
consequence. Palver’s wife had been a Speaker in her own right.</p>
<p>Shandess felt himself aging from day to day as he waited for word
from Gendibal—and with each day that word did not come, he felt an
increasing tension.</p>
<p>It should have been a fleet of ships, a flotilla—</p>
<p>No. The Table would not have allowed it.</p>
<p>And yet—</p>
<p>When the call finally came, he was asleep—an exhausted sleep that was
bringing him no relief. The night had been windy and he had had trouble
falling asleep to begin with. Like a child, he had imagined voices in
the wind.</p>
<p>His last thoughts before falling into an exhausted slumber had been a
wistful building of the fancy of resignation, a wish he could do so
together with the knowledge he could not, for at this moment Delarmi
would succeed him.</p>
<p>And then the call came and he sat up in bed, instantly awake.</p>
<p>“You are well?” he said.</p>
<p>“Perfectly well, First Speaker,” said Gendibal. “Should we have
visual connection for more condensed communication?”</p>
<p>“Later, perhaps,” said Shandess. “First, what is the situation?”</p>
<p>Gendibal spoke carefully, for he sensed the other’s recent arousal
and he perceived a deep weariness. He said, “I am in the neighborhood of
an inhabited planet called Gaia, whose existence is not hinted at in any
of the Galactic records, as far as I know.”</p>
<p>“The world of those who have been working to perfect the Plan? The
Anti-Mules?”</p>
<p>“Possibly, First Speaker. There is the reason to think so. First, the
ship bearing Trevize and Pelorat has moved far in toward Gaia and has
probably landed there. Second, there is, in space, about half a million
kilometers from me, a First Foundation warship.”</p>
<p>“There cannot be this much interest for no reason.”</p>
<p>“First Speaker, this may not be independent interest. I am here only
because I am following Trevize—and the warship may be here for the same
reason. It remains only to be asked why Trevize is here.”</p>
<p>“Do you plan to follow him in toward the planet, Speaker?”</p>
<p>“I had considered that a possibility, but something has come up. I am
now a hundred million kilometers from Gaia and I sense in the space
about me a mentalic field—a homogeneous one that is excessively faint. I
would not have been aware of it at all, but for the focusing effect of
the mind of the Hamishwoman. It is an unusual mind; I agreed to take her
with me for that very purpose.”</p>
<p>“You were right, then, in supposing it would be so—Did Speaker
Delarmi know this, do you think?”</p>
<p>“When she urged me to take the woman? I scarcely think so—but I
gladly took advantage of it, First Speaker.”</p>
<p>“I am pleased that you did. Is it your opinion, Speaker Gendibal,
that the planet is the focus of the field?”</p>
<p>“To ascertain that, I would have to take measurements at widely
spaced points in order to see if there is a general spherical symmetry
to the field. My unidirectional mental probe made this seem likely but
not certain. Yet it would not be wise to investigate further in the
presence of the First Foundation warship.”</p>
<p>“Surely it is no threat.”</p>
<p>“It may be. I cannot as yet be sure that it is not itself the focus
of the field, First Speaker.”</p>
<p>“But they—”</p>
<p>“First Speaker, with respect, allow me to interrupt. We do not know
what technological advances the First Foundation has made. They are
acting with a strange self-confidence and may have unpleasant surprises
for us. It must be decided whether they have learned to handle mentalics
by means of some of their devices. In short, First Speaker, I am facing
either a warship of mentalics or a planet of them.</p>
<p>“If it is the warship, then the mentalics may be far too weak to
immobilize me, but they might be enough to slow me—and the purely
physical weapons on the warship may then suffice to destroy me. On the
other hand, if it is the planet that is the focus, then to have the
field detectable at such a distance could mean enormous intensity at the
surface—more than even I can handle.</p>
<p>“In either case, it will be necessary to set up a network—a total
network—in which, at need, the full resources of Trantor can be placed
at my disposal.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker hesitated. “A total network. This has never been
used, never even suggested—except in the time of the Mule.”</p>
<p>“This crisis may well be even greater than that of the Mule, First
Speaker.”</p>
<p>“I do not know that the Table would agree.”</p>
<p>“I do not think you should ask them to agree, First Speaker. You
should invoke a state of emergency.”</p>
<p>“What excuse can I give?”</p>
<p>“Tell them what I have told you, First Speaker.”</p>
<p>“Speaker Delarmi will say that you are an incompetent coward, driven
to madness by your own fears.”</p>
<p>Gendibal paused before answering. Then he said, “I imagine she will
say something like that, First Speaker, but let her say whatever she
likes and I will survive it. What is at stake now is not my pride or
self-love but the actual existence of the Second Foundation.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Harla Branno smiled grimly, her lined face setting more deeply into
its fleshy crags. She said, “I think we can push on with it. I’m ready
for them.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “Do you still feel sure you know what you’re doing?”</p>
<p>“If I were as mad as you pretend you think I am, Liono, would you
have insisted on remaining on this ship with me?”</p>
<p>Kodell shrugged and said, “Probably. I would then be here on the off
chance, Madam Mayor, that I might stop you, divert you, at least slow
you, before you went too far. And, of course, if you’re not mad—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Why, then I wouldn’t want to have the histories of the future give
you all the mention. Let them state that I was here with you and wonder,
perhaps, to whom the credit really belongs, eh, Mayor?”</p>
<p>“Clever, Liono, clever—but quite futile. I was the power behind the
throne through too many Mayoralties for anyone to believe I would permit
such a phenomenon in my own administration.”</p>
<p>“We shall see.”</p>
<p>“No, we won’t, for such historical judgments will come after we are
dead. However, I have no fears. Not about my place in history and not
about that,“ and she pointed to the screen.</p>
<p>“Compor’s ship,” said Kodell.</p>
<p>“Compor’s ship, true,” said Branno, “but without Compor aboard. One
of our scoutships observed the changeover. Compor’s ship was stopped by
another. Two people from the other ship boarded that one and Compor
later moved off and entered the other.”</p>
<p>Branno rubbed her hands. “Trevize fulfilled his role perfectly. I
cast him out into space in order that he might serve as lightning rod
and so he did. He drew lightning. The ship that stopped Compor was
Second Foundation.”</p>
<p>“How can you be sure of that, I wonder?” said Kodell, taking out his
pipe and slowly beginning to pack it with tobacco.</p>
<p>“Because I always wondered if Compor might not be under Second
Foundation control. His life was too smooth. Things always broke right
for him—and he was such an expert at hyperspatial tracking. His betrayal
of Trevize might easily have been the simple politics of an ambitious
man—but he did it with such unnecessary thoroughness, as though there
were more than personal ambition to it.”</p>
<p>“All guesswork, Mayor!”</p>
<p>“The guesswork stopped when he followed Trevize through multiple
Jumps as easily as if there had been but one.”</p>
<p>“He had the computer to help, Mayor.”</p>
<p>But Branno leaned her head back and laughed. “My dear Liono, you are
so busy devising intricate plots that you forget the efficacy of simple
procedures. I sent Compor to follow Trevize, not because I needed to
have Trevize followed. What need was there for that? Trevize, however
much he might want to keep his movements secret, could not help but call
attention to himself in any non-Foundation world he visited. His
advanced Foundation vessel—his strong Terminus accent—his Foundation
credits—would automatically surround him with a glow of notoriety. And
in case of any emergency, he would automatically turn to Foundation
officials for help, as he did on Sayshell, where we knew all that he did
as soon as he did it—and quite independently of Compor.</p>
<p>“No,” she went on thoughtfully, “Compor was sent out to test Compor.
And that succeeded, for we gave him a defective computer quite
deliberately; not one that was defective enough to make the ship
outmaneuverable, but certainly one that was insufficiently agile to aid
him in following a multiple Jump. Yet Compor managed that without
trouble.”</p>
<p>“I see there’s a great deal you don’t tell me, Mayor, until you
decide you ought to.”</p>
<p>“I only keep those matters from you, Liono, that it will not hurt you
not to know. I admire you and I use you, but there are sharp limits to
my trust, as there is in yours for me—and please don’t bother to deny
it.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” said Kodell dryly, “and someday, Mayor, I will take the
liberty of reminding you of that. —Meanwhile, is there anything else
that I ought to know now? What is the nature of the ship that stopped
them? Surely, if Compor is Second Foundation, so was that ship.”</p>
<p>“It is always a pleasure to speak to you, Liono. You see things
quickly. The Second Foundation, you see, doesn’t bother to hide its
tracks. It has defenses that it relies on to make those tracks
invisible, even when they are not. It would never occur to a Second
Foundationer to use a ship of alien manufacture, even if they knew how
neatly we could identify the origin of a ship from the pattern of its
energy use. They could always remove that knowledge from any mind that
had gained it, so why bother taking the trouble to hide? Well, our scout
ship was able to determine the origin of the ship that approached Compor
within minutes of sighting it.”</p>
<p>“And now the Second Foundation will wipe that knowledge from our
minds, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“If they can,” said Branno, “but they may find that things have
changed.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “Earlier you said you knew where the Second Foundation
was. You would take care of Gaia first, then Trantor. I deduce from this
that the other ship was of Trantorian origin.”</p>
<p>“You suppose correctly. Are you surprised?”</p>
<p>Kodell shook his head slowly. “Not in hindsight. Ebling Mis, Toran
Darell and Bayta Darell were all on Trantor during the period when the
Mule was stopped. Arkady Darell, Bayta’s granddaughter, was born on
Trantor and was on Trantor again when the Second Foundation was itself
supposedly stopped. In her account of events, there is a Preem Palver
who played a key role, appearing at convenient times, and he was a
Trantorian trader. I should think it was obvious that the Second
Foundation was on Trantor, where, incidentally, Hari Seldon himself
lived at the time he founded both Foundations.”</p>
<p>“Quite obvious, except that no one ever suggested the possibility.
The Second Foundation saw to that. It is what I meant when I said they
didn’t have to cover their tracks, when they could so easily arrange to
have no one look in the direction of those tracks—or wipe out the memory
of those tracks after they had been seen.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “In that case, let us not look too quickly in the
direction in which they may simply be wanting us to look. How is it, do
you suppose, that Trevize was able to decide the Second Foundation
existed? Why didn’t the Second Foundation stop him?”</p>
<p>Branno held up her gnarled fingers and counted on them. “First,
Trevize is a very unusual man who, for all his obstreperous inability to
use caution, has something about him that I have not been able to
penetrate. He may be a special case. Second, the Second Foundation was
not entirely ignorant. Compor was on Trevize’s tail at once and reported
him to me. I was relied on to stop Trevize without the Second Foundation
having to risk open involvement. Third, when I didn’t quite react as
expected—no execution, no imprisonment, no memory erasure, no Psychic
Probe of his brain—when I merely sent him out into space, the Second
Foundation went further. They made the direct move of sending one of
their own ships after him.”</p>
<p>And she added with tight-lipped pleasure, “Oh, excellent lightning
rod.”</p>
<p>Kodell said, “And our next move?”</p>
<p>“We are going to challenge that Second Foundationer we now face. In
fact, we’re moving toward him rather sedately right now.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Gendibal and Novi sat together, side by side, watching the
screen.</p>
<p>Novi was frightened. To Gendibal, that was quite apparent, as was the
fact that she was desperately trying to fight off that fright. Nor could
Gendibal do anything to help her in her struggle, for he did not think
it wise to touch her mind at this moment, lest he obscure the response
she displayed to the feeble mentalic field that surrounded them.</p>
<p>The Foundation warship was approaching slowly—but deliberately. It
was a large warship, with a crew of perhaps as many as six, judging from
past experience with Foundation ships. Her weapons, Gendibal was
certain, would be sufficient in themselves to hold off and, if
necessary, wipe out a fleet made up of every ship available to the
Second Foundation—if those ships had to rely on physical force
alone.</p>
<p>As it was, the advance of the warship, even against a single ship
manned by a Second Foundationer, allowed certain conclusions to be
drawn. Even if the ship possessed mentalic ability, it would not be
likely to advance into the teeth of the Second Foundation in this
manner. More likely, it was advancing out of ignorance—and this might
exist in any of several degrees.</p>
<p>It could mean that the captain of the warship was not aware that
Compor had been replaced or—if aware—did not know the replacement was a
Second Foundationer, or perhaps was not even aware what a Second
Foundationer might be.</p>
<p>Or (and Gendibal intended to consider everything) what if the ship
did possess mentalic force and, nevertheless, advanced in this
self-confident manner? That could only mean it was under the control of
a megalomaniac or that it possessed powers far beyond any that Gendibal
could bring himself to consider possible.</p>
<p>But what he considered possible was not the final judgment—</p>
<p>Carefully he sensed Novi’s mind. Novi could not sense mentalic fields
consciously, whereas Gendibal, of course, could—yet Gendibal’s mind
could not do so as delicately or detect as feeble a mental field as
could Novi’s. This was a paradox that would have to be studied in future
and might produce fruit that would in the long run prove of far greater
importance than the immediate problem of an approaching spaceship.</p>
<p>Gendibal had grasped the possibility of this, intuitively, when he
first became aware of the unusual smoothness and symmetry of Novi’s
mind—and he felt a somber pride in this intuitive ability he possessed.
Speakers had always been proud of their intuitive powers, but how much
was this the product of their inability to measure fields by
straightforward physical methods and their failure, therefore, to
understand what it was that they really did? It was easy to cover up
ignorance by the mystical word “intuition.” And how much of this
ignorance of theirs might arise from their underestimation of the
importance of physics as compared to mentalics?</p>
<p>And how much of that was blind pride? When he became First Speaker,
Gendibal thought, this would change. There would have to be some
narrowing of the physical gap between the Foundations. The Second
Foundation could not face forever the possibility of destruction any
time the mentalic monopoly slipped even slightly.</p>
<p>—Indeed, the monopoly might be slipping now. Perhaps the First
Foundation had advanced or there was an alliance between the First
Foundation and the Anti-Mules. (That thought occurred to him now for the
first time and he shivered.)</p>
<p>His thoughts of the subject slipped through his mind with a rapidity
common to a Speaker—and while he was thinking, he also remained
sensitively aware of the glow in Novi’s mind, the response to the gently
pervasive mentalic field about them. It was not growing stronger as the
Foundation warship drew nearer.</p>
<p>This was not, in itself, an absolute indication that the warship was
not equipped with mentalics. It was well known that the mentalic field
did not obey the inverse-square law. It did not grow stronger precisely
as the square of the extent to which distance between emitter and
receiver lessened. It differed in this way from the electromagnetic and
the gravitational fields. Still, although mentalic fields varied less
with distance than the various physical fields did, it was not
altogether insensitive to distance, either. The response of Novi’s mind
should show a detectable increase as the warship approached—some
increase.</p>
<p>(How was it that no Second Foundationer in five centuries—from Hari
Seldon on—had ever thought of working out a mathematical relationship
between mentalic intensity and distance? This shrugging off of physics
must and would stop, Gendibal silently vowed.)</p>
<p>If the warship possessed mentalics and if it felt quite certain it
was approaching a Second Foundationer, would it not increase the
intensity of its field to maximum before advancing? And in that case,
would not Novi’s mind surely register an increased response of some
kind?</p>
<p>—Yet it did not!</p>
<p>Confidently Gendibal eliminated the possibility that the warship
possessed mentalics. It was advancing out of ignorance and, as a menace,
it could be downgraded.</p>
<p>The mentalic field, of course, still existed, but it had to originate
on Gaia. This was disturbing enough, but the immediate problem was the
ship. Let that be eliminated and he could then turn his attention to the
world of the Anti-Mules.</p>
<p>He waited. The warship would make some move or it would come close
enough to him to feel confident that he could pass over to an effective
offense.</p>
<p>The warship still approached—quite rapidly now—and still did nothing.
Finally Gendibal calculated that the strength of his push would be
sufficient. There would be no pain, scarcely any discomfort—all those on
board would merely find that the large muscles of their backs and limbs
would respond but sluggishly to their desires.</p>
<p>Gendibal narrowed the mentalic field controlled by his mind. It
intensified and leaped across the gap between the ships at the speed of
light. (The two ships were close enough to make hyperspatial
contact—with its inevitable loss of precision—unnecessary.)</p>
<p>And Gendibal then fell back in numbed surprise.</p>
<p>The Foundation warship was possessed of an efficient mentalic shield
that gained in density in proportion as his own field gained in
intensity. —The warship was not approaching out of ignorance after
all—and it had an unexpected if passive weapon.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>“Ah,” said Branno. “He has attempted an attack, Liono. See!”</p>
<p>The needle on the psychometer moved and trembled in its irregular
rise.</p>
<p>The development of the mentalic shield had occupied Foundation
scientists for a hundred and twenty years in the most secret of all
scientific projects, except perhaps for Hari Seldon’s lone development
of psychohistorical analysis. Five generations of human beings had
labored in the gradual improvement of a device backed by no satisfactory
theory.</p>
<p>But no advance would have been possible without the invention of the
psychometer that could act as a guide, indicating the direction and
amount of advance at every stage. No one could explain how it worked,
yet all indications were that it measured the immeasurable and gave
numbers to the indescribable. Branno had the feeling (shared by some of
the scientists themselves) that if ever the Foundation could explain the
workings of the psychometer, they would be the equal of the Second
Foundation in mind control.</p>
<p>But that was for the future. At present, the shield would have to be
enough, backed as it was by an overwhelming preponderance in physical
weapons.</p>
<p>Branno sent out the message, delivered in a male voice from which all
overtones of emotion had been removed, till it was flat and deadly.</p>
<p>“Calling the ship Bright Star and its occupants. You have forcibly
taken a ship of the Navy of the Foundation Federation in an act of
piracy. You are directed to surrender the ship and yourselves at once or
face attack.”</p>
<p>The answer came in natural voice: “Mayor Branno of Terminus, I know
you are on the ship. The Bright Star was not taken by piratical action.
I was freely invited on board by its legal captain, Munn Li Compor of
Terminus. I ask a period of truce that we may discuss matters of
importance to each of us alike.”</p>
<p>Kodell whispered to Branno, “Let me do the speaking, Mayor.”</p>
<p>She raised her arm contemptuously, “The responsibility is mine,
Liono.”</p>
<p>Adjusting the transmitter, she spoke in tones scarcely less forceful
and unemotional than the artificial voice that had spoken before:</p>
<p>“Man of the Second Foundation, understand your position. If you do
not surrender forthwith, we can blow your ship out of space in the time
it takes light to travel from our ship to yours—and we are ready to do
that. Nor will we lose by doing this, for you have no knowledge for
which we need keep you alive. We know you are from Trantor and, once we
have dealt with you, we will be ready to deal with Trantor. We are
willing to allow you a period in which to have your say, but since you
cannot have much of worth to tell us, we are not prepared to listen
long.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Gendibal, “let me speak quickly and to the
point. Your shield is not perfect and cannot be. You have overestimated
it and underestimated me. I can handle your mind and control it. Not as
easily, perhaps, as if there were no shield, but easily enough. The
instant you attempt to use any weapon, I will strike you—and there is
this for you to understand: Without a shield, I can handle your mind
smoothly and do it no harm. With the shield, however, I must smash
through, which I can do, and I will be unable then to handle you either
smoothly or deftly. Your mind will be smashed as the shield and the
effect will be irreversible. In other words, you cannot stop me and I,
on the other hand, can stop you by being forced to do worse than killing
you. I will leave you a mindless hulk. Do you wish to risk that?”</p>
<p>Branno said, “You know you cannot do as you say.”</p>
<p>“Do you, then, wish to risk the consequences I have described?” asked
Gendibal with an air of cool indifference.</p>
<p>Kodell leaned over and whispered, “For Seldon’s sake, Mayor—”</p>
<p>Gendibal said (not exactly at once, for it took light—and everything
at light-speed—a little over one second to travel from one vessel to the
other), “I follow your thoughts, Kodell. No need to whisper. I also
follow the Mayor’s thoughts. She is irresolute, so you have no need to
panic just yet. And the mere fact that I know this is ample evidence
that your shield leaks.”</p>
<p>“It can be strengthened,” said the Mayor defiantly.</p>
<p>“So can my mentalic force,” said Gendibal.</p>
<p>“But I sit here at my ease, consuming merely physical strength to
maintain the shield, and I have enough to maintain that shield for very
long periods of time. You must use mentalic energy to penetrate the
shield and you will tire.”</p>
<p>“I am not tired,” said Gendibal. “At the present moment, neither of
you is capable of giving any order to any member of the crew of your
ship or to any crewman on any other ship. I can manage so much without
any harm to you, but do not make any unusual effort to escape this
control, for if I match that by increasing my own force, as I will have
to do, you will be damaged as I have said.”</p>
<p>“I will wait,” said Branno, placing her hands in her lap with every
sign of solid patience. “You will tire and when you do, the orders that
will go out will not be to destroy you, for you will then be harmless.
The orders will be to send the main Foundation Fleet against Trantor. If
you wish to save your world—surrender. A second orgy of destruction will
not leave your organization untouched, as the first one did at the time
of the Great Sack.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you see that if I feel myself tiring, Mayor, which I won’t, I
can save my world very simply by destroying you before my strength to do
so is gone?”</p>
<p>“You won’t do that. Your main task is to maintain the Seldon Plan. To
destroy the Mayor of Terminus and thus to strike a blow at the prestige
and confidence of the First Foundation, producing a staggering setback
to its power and encouraging its enemies everywhere, will produce such a
disruption to the Plan that it will be almost as bad for you as the
destruction of Trantor. You might as well surrender.”</p>
<p>“Are you willing to gamble on my reluctance to destroy you?”</p>
<p>Branno’s chest heaved as she took a deep breath and let it out
slowly. She then said firmly, “Yes!”</p>
<p>Kodell, sitting at her side, paled.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Gendibal stared at the figure of Branno, superimposed upon the volume
of room just in front of the wall. It was a little flickery and hazy
thanks to the interference of the shield. The man next to her was almost
featureless with haze, for Gendibal had no energy to waste on him. He
had to concentrate on the Mayor.</p>
<p>To be sure, she had no image of him in return. She had no way of
knowing that he too had a companion, for instance. She could make no
judgment from his expressions, from his body language. In this respect,
she was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Everything he had said was true. He could smash her at the cost of an
enormous expenditure of mentalic force—and in so doing, he could
scarcely avoid disrupting her mind irreparably.</p>
<p>Yet everything she had said was true as well. Destroying her would
damage the Plan as much as the Mule himself had damaged it. Indeed, the
new damage might be more serious, since it was now later in the game and
there would be less time to retrieve the misstep.</p>
<p>Worse still, there was Gaia, which was still an unknown quantity—with
its mentalic field remaining at the faint and tantalizing edge of
detection.</p>
<p>For a moment, he touched Novi’s mind to make sure that the flow was
still there. It was, and it was unchanged.</p>
<p>She could not have sensed that touch in any way, but she turned to
him and in an awed whisper said, “Master, there is a faint mist there.
Is it to that you talk?”</p>
<p>She must have sensed the mist through the small connection between
their two minds. Gendibal put a finger to his lips. “Have no fear, Novi.
Close your eyes and rest.”</p>
<p>He raised his voice. “Mayor Branno, your gamble is a good one in this
respect. I do not wish to destroy you at once, since I think that if I
explain something to you, you will listen to reason and there will then
be no need to destroy in either direction.</p>
<p>“Suppose, Mayor, that you win out and that I surrender. What follows?
In an orgy of self-confidence and in undue reliance on your mentalic
shield, you and your successors will attempt to spread your power over
the Galaxy with undue haste. In doing so, you will actually postpone the
establishment of the Second Empire, because you will also destroy the
Seldon Plan.”</p>
<p>Branno said, “I am not surprised that you do not wish to destroy me
at once and I think that, as you sit there, you will be forced to
realize that you do not dare to destroy me at all.”</p>
<p>Gendibal said, “Do not deceive yourself with self-congratulatory
folly. Listen to me. The majority of the Galaxy is still non-Foundation
and, to a great extent, anti-Foundation. There are even portions of the
Foundation Federation itself that have not forgotten their days of
independence. If the Foundation moves too quickly in the wake of my
surrender, it will deprive the rest of the Galaxy of its greatest
weakness—its disunity and indecision. You will force them to unite by
fear and you will feed the tendency toward rebellion within.”</p>
<p>“You are threatening with clubs of straw,” said Branno. “We have the
power to win easily against all enemies, even if every world in the
non-Foundation Galaxy combined against us, and even if these were helped
by a rebellion in half the worlds of the Federation itself. There would
be no problem.”</p>
<p>“No immediate problem, Mayor. Do not make the mistake of seeing only
the results that appear at once. You can establish a Second Empire
merely by proclaiming it, but you will not be able to maintain it. You
will have to reconquer it every ten years.”</p>
<p>“Then we will do so until the worlds tire, as you are tiring.”</p>
<p>“They will not tire, any more than I will. Nor will the process
continue for a very long time, for there is a second and greater danger
to the Pseudo-Empire you would proclaim. Since it can be temporarily
maintained only by an ever-stronger military force which will be
ever-exercised, the generals of the Foundation will, for the first time,
become more important and more powerful than the civilian authorities.
The Pseudo-Empire will break up into military regions within which
individual commanders will be supreme. There will be anarchy—and a slide
back into a barbarism that may last longer than the thirty thousand
years forecast by Seldon before the Seldon Plan was implemented.”</p>
<p>“Childish threats. Even if the mathematics of the Seldon Plan
predicted all this, it predicts only probabilities—not
inevitabilities.”</p>
<p>“Mayor Branno,” said Gendibal earnestly. “Forget the Seldon Plan. You
do not understand its mathematics and you cannot visualize its pattern.
But you do not have to, perhaps. You are a tested politician; and a
successful one, to judge from the post you hold; even more so, a
courageous one, to judge from the gamble you are now taking. Therefore,
use your political acumen. Consider the political and military history
of humanity and consider it in the light of what you know of human
nature—of the manner in which people, politicians, and military officers
act, react, and interact—and see if I’m not right.”</p>
<p>Branno said, “Even if you were right, Second Foundationer, it is a
risk we must take. With proper leadership and with continuing
technological advance—in mentalics, as well as in physics—we can
overcome. Hari Seldon never calculated such advances properly. He
couldn’t. Where in the Plan does it allow for the development of a
mentalic shield by the First Foundation? Why should we want the Plan, in
any case? We will risk founding a new Empire without it. Failure without
it would, after all, be better than success with it. We do not want an
Empire in which we play puppets to the hidden manipulators of the Second
Foundation.”</p>
<p>“You say that only because you do not understand what failure will be
like for the people of the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps!” said Branno stonily. “Are you beginning to weary, Second
Foundationer?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. —Let me propose an alternative action that you have not
considered—one in which I need not surrender to you, nor you to me. —We
are in the vicinity of a planet called Gaia.”</p>
<p>“I am aware of that.”</p>
<p>“Are you aware that it is probably the birthplace of the Mule?”</p>
<p>“I would want more evidence than resides in your mere statement to
that effect.”</p>
<p>“The planet is surrounded by a mentalic field. It is the home of many
Mules. If you accomplish your dream of destroying the Second Foundation,
you will make yourselves the slaves of this planet of Mules. What harm
have Second Foundationers ever done you—specific, rather than imagined
or theorized harm? Now ask yourself what harm a single Mule has done
you.”</p>
<p>“I still have nothing more than your statements.”</p>
<p>“As long as we remain here, I can give you nothing more. —I propose a
truce, therefore. Keep your shield up, if you don’t trust me, but be
prepared to co-operate with me. Let us, together, approach this
planet—and when you are convinced that it is dangerous, then I will
nullify its mentalic field and you will order your ships to take
possession of it.”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“And then, at least, it will be the First Foundation against the
Second Foundation, with no outside forces to be considered. The fight
will then be clear whereas now, you see, we dare not fight, for both
Foundations are at bay.”</p>
<p>“Why did you not say this before?”</p>
<p>“I thought I might convince you that we were not enemies, so that we
might co-operate. Since I have apparently failed at that, I suggest
co-operation in any case.”</p>
<p>Branno paused, her head bent in thought. Then she said, “You are
trying to put me to sleep with lullabies. How will you, by yourself,
nullify the mentalic field of a whole planet of Mules? The thought is so
ludicrous that I cannot trust in the truth of your proposition.”</p>
<p>“I am not alone,” said Gendibal. “Behind me is the full force of the
Second Foundation—and that force, channeled through me, will take care
of Gaia. What’s more, it can, at any time, brush aside your shield as
though it were thin fog.”</p>
<p>“If so, why do you need my help?”</p>
<p>“First, because nullifying the field is not enough. The Second
Foundation cannot devote itself, now and forever, to the eternal task of
nullifying, any more than I can spend the rest of my life dancing this
conversational minuet with you. We need the physical action your ships
can supply. —And besides, if I cannot convince you by reason that the
two Foundations should look upon each other as allies, perhaps a
co-operative venture of the greatest importance can be convincing. Deeds
may do the job where words fail.”</p>
<p>A second silence and then Branno said, “I am willing to approach Gaia
more closely, if we can approach co-operatively. I make no promises
beyond that.”</p>
<p>“That will be enough,” said Gendibal, leaning toward his
computer.</p>
<p>Novi said, “No, Master, up to this point, it didn’t matter, but
please make no further move. We must wait for Councilman Trevize of
Terminus.”</p>
