<h4 id="section">31</h4>
<p>When Seldon woke, he found a new face looking at him solemnly. For a
moment he frowned owlishly and then he said, “Hummin?”</p>
<p>Hummin smiled very slightly. “You remember me, then?”</p>
<p>“It was only for a day, nearly two months ago, but I remember. You
were not arrested, then, or in any way—”</p>
<p>“As you see, I am here, quite safe and whole, but”—and he glanced at
Dors, who stood to one side—“it was not very easy for me to come
here.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’m glad to see you. —Do you mind, by the way?” He
jerked his thumb in the direction of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Take your time. Have breakfast.”</p>
<p>Hummin didn’t join him at breakfast. Neither did Dors. Nor did they
speak. Hummin scanned a book-film with an attitude of easy absorption.
Dors inspected her nails critically and then, taking out a
microcomputer, began making notes with a stylus.</p>
<p>Seldon watched them thoughtfully and did not try to start a
conversation. The silence now might be in response to some Trantorian
reserve customary at a sickbed. To be sure, he now felt perfectly
normal, but perhaps they did not realize that.</p>
<p>It was only when he was done with his last morsel and with the final
drop of milk (which he was obviously getting used to, for it no longer
tasted odd) that Hummin spoke.</p>
<p>He said, “How are you, Seldon?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly well, Hummin. Sufficiently well, certainly, for me to be
up and about.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” said Hummin dryly. “Dors Venabili was much to
blame in allowing this to happen.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “No. I insisted on going Upperside.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure, but she should, at all costs, have gone with you.”</p>
<p>“I told her I didn’t want her to go with me.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “That’s not so, Hari. Don’t defend me with gallant
lies.”</p>
<p>Seldon said angrily, “But don’t forget that Dors also came Upperside
after me, against strong resistance, and undoubtedly saved my life.
That’s not bending the truth at all. Have you added that to your
evaluation, Hummin?”</p>
<p>Dors interrupted again, obviously embarrassed. “Please, Hari. Chetter
Hummin is perfectly correct in feeling that I should either have kept
you from going Upperside or have gone up with you. As for my subsequent
actions, he has praised them.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” said Hummin, “that is past and we can let it go. Let
us talk about what happened Upperside, Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked about and said guardedly, “Is it safe to do so?”</p>
<p>Hummin smiled slightly. “Dors has placed this room in a Distortion
Field. I can be pretty sure that no Imperial agent at the University—if
there is one—has the expertise to penetrate it. You are a suspicious
person, Seldon.”</p>
<p>“Not by nature,” said Seldon. “Listening to you in the park and
afterward—You are a persuasive person, Hummin. By the time you were
through, I was ready to fear that Eto Demerzel was lurking in every
shadow.”</p>
<p>“I sometimes think he might be,” said Hummin gravely.</p>
<p>“If he was,” said Seldon, “I wouldn’t know it was he. What does he
look like?”</p>
<p>“That scarcely matters. You wouldn’t see him unless he wanted you to
and by then it would all be over, I imagine—which is what we must
prevent. Let’s talk about that jet-down you saw.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “As I told you, Hummin, you filled me with fears of
Demerzel. As soon as I saw the jet-down, I assumed he was after me, that
I had foolishly stepped outside the protection of Streeling University
by going Upperside, that I had been lured up there for the specific
purpose of being picked up without difficulty.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “On the other hand, Leggen—”</p>
<p>Seldon said quickly, “Was he here last night?”</p>
<p>“Yes, don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>“Vaguely. I was dead tired. It’s all a blur in my memory.”</p>
<p>“Well, when he was here last night, Leggen said that the jet-down was
merely a meteorological vessel from another station. Perfectly ordinary.
Perfectly harmless.”</p>
<p>“What?” Seldon was taken aback. “I don’t believe that.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Now the question is: Why don’t you believe that? Was
there anything about the jet-down that made you think it was dangerous?
Something specific, that is, and not just a pervasive suspicion placed
in your head by me.”</p>
<p>Seldon thought back, biting his lower lip. He said, “Its actions. It
seemed to push its forepart below the cloud deck, as though it were
looking for something, then it would appear in another spot just the
same way, then in another spot, and so on. It seemed to be searching
Upperside methodically, section by section, and homing in on me.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Perhaps you were personifying, Seldon. You may have
been treating the jet-down as though it was a strange animal looking for
you. It wasn’t, of course. It was simply a jet-down and if it was a
meteorological vessel, its actions were perfectly normal … and
harmless.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “It didn’t seem that way to me.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “I’m sure it didn’t, but we don’t actually know
anything. Your conviction that you were in danger is simply an
assumption. Leggen’s decision that it was a meteorological vessel is
also only an assumption.”</p>
<p>Seldon said stubbornly, “I can’t believe that it was an entirely
innocent event.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” said Hummin, “suppose we assume the worst—that the
vessel was looking for you. How would whoever sent that vessel know you
would be there to seek?”</p>
<p>Dors interjected, “I asked Dr. Leggen if he had, in his report of the
forthcoming meteorological work, included the information that Hari
would be with the group. There was no reason he should in the ordinary
course of events and he denied that he had, with considerable surprise
at the question. I believed him.”</p>
<p>Hummin said thoughtfully, “Don’t believe him too readily. Wouldn’t he
deny it, in any case? Now ask yourself why he allowed Seldon to come
along in the first place. We know he objected initially, but he did
relent, without much fight. And that, to me, seems rather out of
character for Leggen.”</p>
<p>Dors frowned and said, “I suppose that does make it a bit more likely
that he did arrange the entire affair. Perhaps he permitted Hari’s
company only in order to put him in the position of being taken. He
might have received orders to that effect. We might further argue that
he encouraged his young intern, Clowzia, to engage Hari’s attention and
draw him away from the group, isolating him. That would account for
Leggen’s odd lack of concern over Hari’s absence when it came time to go
below. He would insist that Hari had left earlier, something he would
have laid the groundwork for, since he had carefully showed him how to
go down by himself. It would also account for his reluctance to go back
up in search of him, since he would not want to waste time looking for
someone he assumed would not be found.”</p>
<p>Hummin, who had listened carefully, said, “You make an interesting
case against him, but let’s not accept that too readily either. After
all, he did come Upperside with you in the end.”</p>
<p>“Because footsteps had been detected. The Chief Seismologist had
borne witness to that.”</p>
<p>“Well, did Leggen show shock and surprise when Seldon was found? I
mean, beyond that of finding someone who had been brought into extreme
peril through Leggen’s own negligence. Did he act as though Seldon
wasn’t supposed to be there? Did he behave as though he were asking
himself: How is it they didn’t pick him up?”</p>
<p>Dors thought carefully, then said, “He was obviously shocked by the
sight of Hari lying there, but I couldn’t possibly tell if there was
anything to his feelings beyond the very natural horror of the
situation.”</p>
<p>“No, I suppose you couldn’t.”</p>
<p>But now Seldon, who had been looking from one to the other as they
spoke and who had been listening intently, said, “I don’t think it was
Leggen.”</p>
<p>Hummin transferred his attention to Seldon. “Why do you say
that?”</p>
<p>“For one thing, as you noted, he was clearly unwilling to have me
come along. It took a whole day of argument and I think he agreed only
because he had the impression that I was a clever mathematician who
could help him out with meteorological theory. I was anxious to go up
there and, if he had been under orders to see to it that I was taken
Upperside, there would have been no need to be so reluctant about
it.”</p>
<p>“Is it reasonable to suppose he wanted you only for your mathematics?
Did he discuss the mathematics with you? Did he make an attempt to
explain his theory to you?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon, “he didn’t. He did say something about going into
it later on, though. The trouble was, he was totally involved with his
instruments. I gathered he had expected sunshine that hadn’t showed up
and he was counting on his instruments having been at fault, but they
were apparently working perfectly, which frustrated him. I think this
was an unexpected development that both soured his temper and turned his
attention away from me. As for Clowzia, the young woman who preoccupied
me for a few minutes, I do not get the feeling, as I look back on it,
that she deliberately led me away from the scene. The initiative was
mine. I was curious about the vegetation on Upperside and it was I who
drew her away, rather than vice versa. Far from Leggen encouraging her
action, he called her back while I was still in sight and I moved
farther away and out of sight entirely on my own.”</p>
<p>“And yet,” said Hummin, who seemed intent on objecting to every
suggestion that was made, “if that ship was looking for you, those on
board must have known you’d be there. How would they know—if not from
Leggen?”</p>
<p>“The man I suspect,” said Seldon, “is a young psychologist named
Lisung Randa.”</p>
<p>“Randa?” said Dors. “I can’t believe that. I know him. He simply
would not be working for the Emperor. He’s anti-Imperialist to the
core.”</p>
<p>“He might pretend to be,” said Seldon. “In fact, he would have to be
openly, violently, and extremely anti-Imperialist if he was trying to
mask the fact that he is an Imperial agent.”</p>
<p>“But that’s exactly what he’s not like,” said Dors. “He is not
violent and extreme in anything. He’s quiet and good-natured and his
views are always expressed mildly, almost timidly. I’m convinced they’re
genuine.”</p>
<p>“And yet, Dors,” said Seldon earnestly, “it was he who first told me
of the meteorological project, it was he who urged me to go Upperside,
and it was he who persuaded Leggen to allow me to join him, rather
exaggerating my mathematical prowess in the process. One must wonder why
he was so anxious to get me up there, why he should labor so hard.”</p>
<p>“For your good, perhaps. He was interested in you, Hari, and must
have thought that meteorology might have been useful in psychohistory.
Isn’t that possible?”</p>
<p>Hummin said quietly, “Let’s consider another point. There was a
considerable lapse of time between the moment when Randa told you about
the meteorology project and the moment you actually went Upperside. If
Randa is innocent of anything underhanded, he would have no particular
reason to keep quiet about it. If he is a friendly and gregarious
person—”</p>
<p>“He is,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“—then he might very likely tell a number of friends about it. In
that case, we couldn’t really tell who the informer might be. In fact,
just to make another point, suppose Randa is anti-Imperialist. That
would not necessarily mean he is not an agent. We would have to ask:
Whom is he an agent for? On whose behalf does he work?”</p>
<p>Seldon was astonished. “Who else is there to work for but the Empire?
Who else but Demerzel?”</p>
<p>Hummin raised his hand. “You are far from understanding the whole
complexity of Trantorian politics, Seldon.” He turned toward Dors. “Tell
me again: Which were the four sectors that Dr. Leggen named as likely
sources for a meteorological vessel?”</p>
<p>“Hestelonia, Wye, Ziggoreth, and North Damiano.”</p>
<p>“And you did not ask the question in any leading way? You didn’t ask
if a particular sector might be the source?”</p>
<p>“No, definitely not. I simply asked if he could speculate as to the
source of the jet-down.”</p>
<p>“And you”—Hummin turned to Seldon—“may perhaps have seen some
marking, some insigne, on the jet-down?”</p>
<p>Seldon wanted to retort heatedly that the vessel could hardly be seen
through the clouds, that it emerged only briefly, that he himself was
not looking for markings, but only for escape—but he held back. Surely,
Hummin knew all that.</p>
<p>Instead, he said simply, “I’m afraid not.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “If the jet-down was on a kidnapping mission, might not
the insigne have been masked?”</p>
<p>“That is the rational assumption,” said Hummin, “and it may well have
been, but in this Galaxy rationality does not always triumph. However,
since Seldon seems to have taken no note of any details concerning the
vessel, we can only speculate. What I’m thinking is: Wye.”</p>
<p>“Why?” echoed Seldon. “I presume they wanted to take me because
whoever was on the ship wanted me for my knowledge of
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“No no.” Hummin lifted his right forefinger as if lecturing a young
student. “W-y-e. It is the name of a sector on Trantor. A very special
sector. It has been ruled by a line of Mayors for some three thousand
years. It has been a continuous line, a single dynasty. There was a
time, some five hundred years ago, when two Emperors and an Empress of
the House of Wye sat on the Imperial throne. It was a comparatively
short period and none of the Wye rulers were particularly distinguished
or successful, but the Mayors of Wye have never forgotten this Imperial
past.</p>
<p>“They have not been actively disloyal to the ruling houses that have
succeeded them, but neither have they been known to volunteer much on
behalf of those houses. During the occasional periods of civil war, they
maintained a kind of neutrality, making moves that seemed best
calculated to prolong the civil war and make it seem necessary to turn
to Wye as a compromise solution. That never worked out, but they never
stopped trying either.</p>
<p>“The present Mayor of Wye is particularly capable. He is old now, but
his ambition hasn’t cooled. If anything happens to Cleon—even a natural
death—the Mayor will have a chance at the succession over Cleon’s own
too-young son. The Galactic public will always be a little more partial
toward a claimant with an Imperial past.</p>
<p>“Therefore, if the Mayor of Wye has heard of you, you might serve as
a useful scientific prophet on behalf of his house. There would be a
traditional motive for Wye to try to arrange some convenient end for
Cleon, use you to predict the inevitable succession of Wye and the
coming of peace and prosperity for a thousand years after. Of course,
once the Mayor of Wye is on the throne and has no further use for you,
you might well follow Cleon to the grave.”</p>
<p>Seldon broke the grim silence that followed by saying, “But we don’t
know that it is this Mayor of Wye who is after me.”</p>
<p>“No, we don’t. Or that anyone at all is after you, at the moment. The
jet-down might, after all, have been an ordinary meteorological testing
vessel as Leggen has suggested. Still, as the news concerning
psychohistory and its potential spreads—and it surely must—more and more
of the powerful and semipowerful on Trantor or, for that matter,
elsewhere will want to make use of your services.”</p>
<p>“What, then,” said Dors, “shall we do?”</p>
<p>“That is the question, indeed.” Hummin ruminated for a while, then
said, “Perhaps it was a mistake to come here. For a professor, it is all
too likely that the hiding place chosen would be a University. Streeling
is one of many, but it is among the largest and most free, so it
wouldn’t be long before tendrils from here and there would begin feeling
their soft, blind way toward this place. I think that as soon as
possible—today, perhaps—Seldon should be moved to another and better
hiding place. But—”</p>
<p>“But?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“But I don’t know where.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Call up a gazeteer on the computer screen and choose a
place at random.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” said Hummin. “If we do that, we are as likely to
find a place that is less secure than average, as one that is more
secure. No, this must be reasoned out. —Somehow.”</p>
