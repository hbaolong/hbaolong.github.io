<h4 id="section">51</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon was perfectly willing to let Dors take the lead. She had
been out in the main roadways of Mycogen and was more at home with them
than he was.</p>
<p>Dors Venabili, brows knitted, was less delighted with the prospect.
She said, “We can easily get lost, you know.”</p>
<p>“Not with that booklet,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>She looked up at him impatiently. “Fix your mind on Mycogen, Hari.
What I should have is a computomap, something I can ask questions of.
This Mycogenian version is just a piece of folded plastic. I can’t tell
this thing where I am. I can’t tell it by word of mouth and I can’t even
tell it by pushing the necessary contacts. It can’t tell me anything
either way. It’s a print thing.”</p>
<p>“Then read what it says.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do, but it’s written for people who are
familiar with the system to begin with. We’ll have to ask.”</p>
<p>“No, Dors. That would be a last resort. I don’t want to attract
attention. I would rather we take our chances and try to find our own
way, even if it means making one or two wrong turns.”</p>
<p>Dors leafed through the booklet with great attention and then said
grudgingly, “Well, it gives the Sacratorium important mention. I suppose
that’s only natural. I presume everyone in Mycogen would want to get
there at one time or another.” Then, after additional concentration, she
said, “I’ll tell you what. There’s no way of taking a conveyance from
here to there.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t get excited. Apparently, there’s a way of getting from here to
another conveyance that will take us there. We’ll have to change from
one to another.”</p>
<p>Seldon relaxed. “Well, of course. You can’t take an Expressway to
half the places on Trantor without changing.”</p>
<p>Dors cast an impatient glance at Seldon. “I know that too. It’s just
that I’m used to having these things tell me so. When they expect you to
find out for yourself, the simplest things can escape you for a
while.”</p>
<p>“All right, dear. Don’t snap. If you know the way now, lead. I will
follow humbly.”</p>
<p>And follow her he did, until they came to an intersection, where they
stopped.</p>
<p>Three white-kirtled males and a pair of gray-kirtled females were at
the same intersection. Seldon tried a universal and general smile in
their direction, but they responded with a blank stare and looked
away.</p>
<p>And then the conveyance came. It was an outmoded version of what
Seldon, back on Helicon, would have called a gravi-bus. There were some
twenty upholstered benches inside, each capable of holding four people.
Each bench had its own doors on both sides of the bus. When it stopped,
passengers emerged on either side. (For a moment, Seldon was concerned
for those who got out on the traffic side of the gravi-bus, but then he
noticed that every vehicle approaching from either direction stopped as
it neared the bus. None passed it while it was not moving.)</p>
<p>Dors pushed Seldon impatiently and he moved on to a bench where two
adjoining seats were available. Dors followed after. (The men always got
on and got off first, he noticed.)</p>
<p>Dors muttered to him, “Stop studying humanity. Be aware of your
surroundings.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try.”</p>
<p>“For instance,” she said and pointed to a smooth boxed-off area on
the back of the bench directly before each of them. As soon as the
conveyance had begun to move, words lit up, naming the next stop and the
notable structures or crossways that were nearby.</p>
<p>“Now, that will probably tell us when we’re approaching the
changeover we want. At least the sector isn’t completely barbaric.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Seldon. Then, after a while, leaning toward Dors, he
whispered, “No one is looking at us. It seems that artificial boundaries
are set up to preserve individual privacy in any crowded place. Have you
noticed that?”</p>
<p>“I’ve always taken it for granted. If that’s going to be a rule of
your psychohistory, no one will be very impressed by it.”</p>
<p>As Dors had guessed, the direction plaque in front of them eventually
announced the approach to the changeover for the direct line to the
Sacratorium.</p>
<p>They exited and again had to wait. Some buses ahead had already left
this intersection, but another gravi-bus was already approaching. They
were on a well-traveled route, which was not surprising; the Sacratorium
was bound to be the center and heartbeat of the sector.</p>
<p>They got on the gravi-bus and Seldon whispered, “We’re not
paying.”</p>
<p>“According to the map, public transportation is a free service.”</p>
<p>Seldon thrust out his lower lip. “How civilized. I suppose that
nothing is all of a piece, not backwardness, not barbarism,
nothing.”</p>
<p>But Dors nudged him and whispered, “Your rule is broken. We’re being
watched. The man on your right.”</p>
