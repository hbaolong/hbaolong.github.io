<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>Lord Dorwin took snuff. He also had long hair, curled intricately
and, quite obviously, artificially, to which were added a pair of
fluffy, blond sideburns, which he fondled affectionately. Then, too, he
spoke in overprecise statements and left out all the r’s.</p>
<p>At the moment, Hardin had no time to think of more of the reasons for
the instant detestation in which he had held the noble chancellor. Oh,
yes, the elegant gestures of one hand with which he accompanied his
remarks and the studied condescension with which he accompanied even a
simple affirmative.</p>
<p>But, at any rate, the problem now was to locate him. He had
disappeared with Pirenne half an hour before—passed clean out of sight,
blast him.</p>
<p>Hardin was quite sure that his own absence during the preliminary
discussions would quite suit Pirenne.</p>
<p>But Pirenne had been seen in this wing and on this floor. It was
simply a matter of trying every door. Halfway down, he said, “Ah!” and
stepped into the darkened room. The profile of Lord Dorwin’s intricate
hairdo was unmistakable against the lighted screen.</p>
<p>Lord Dorwin looked up and said: “Ah, Hahdin. You ah looking foah us,
no doubt?” He held out his snuffbox—overadorned and poor workmanship at
that, noted Hardin—and was politely refused, whereat he helped himself
to a pinch and smiled graciously.</p>
<p>Pirenne scowled and Hardin met that with an expression of blank
indifference.</p>
<p>The only sound to break the short silence that followed was the
clicking of the lid of Lord Dorwin’s snuffbox. And then he put it away
and said:</p>
<p>“A gweat achievement, this Encyclopedia of yoahs, Hahdin. A feat,
indeed, to rank with the most majestic accomplishments of all time.”</p>
<p>“Most of us think so, milord. It’s an accomplishment not quite
accomplished as yet, however.”</p>
<p>“Fwom the little I have seen of the efficiency of yoah Foundation, I
have no feahs on that scoah.” And he nodded to Pirenne, who responded
with a delighted bow.</p>
<p>Quite a love feast, thought Hardin. “I wasn’t complaining about the
lack of efficiency, milord, as much as of the definite excess of
efficiency on the part of the Anacreonians—though in another and more
destructive direction.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, Anacweon.” A negligent wave of the hand. “I have just come
from theah. Most bahbawous planet. It is thowoughly inconceivable that
human beings could live heah in the Pewiphewy. The lack of the most
elementawy wequiahments of a cultuahed gentleman; the absence of the
most fundamental necessities foah comfoht and convenience—the uttah
desuetude into which they—”</p>
<p>Hardin interrupted dryly: “The Anacreonians, unfortunately, have all
the elementary requirements for warfare and all the fundamental
necessities for destruction.”</p>
<p>“Quite, quite.” Lord Dorwin seemed annoyed, perhaps at being stopped
midway in his sentence. “But we ahn’t to discuss business now, y’know.
Weally, I’m othahwise concuhned. Doctah Piwenne, ahn’t you going to show
me the second volume? Do, please.”</p>
<p>The lights clicked out and for the next half hour Hardin might as
well have been on Anacreon for all the attention they paid him. The book
upon the screen made little sense to him, nor did he trouble to make the
attempt to follow, but Lord Dorwin became quite humanly excited at
times. Hardin noticed that during these moments of excitement the
chancellor pronounced his r’s.</p>
<p>When the lights went on again, Lord Dorwin said: “Mahvelous. Twuly
mahvelous. You ah not, by chance, intewested in ahchaeology, ah you,
Hahdin?”</p>
<p>“Eh?” Hardin shook himself out of an abstracted reverie. “No, milord,
can’t say I am. I’m a psychologist by original intention and a
politician by final decision.”</p>
<p>“Ah! No doubt intewesting studies. I, myself, y’know”—he helped
himself to a giant pinch of snuff—“dabble in ahchaeology.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>“His lordship,” interrupted Pirenne, “is most thoroughly acquainted
with the field.”</p>
<p>“Well, p’haps I am, p’haps I am,” said his lordship complacently. “I
have done an awful amount of wuhk in the science. Extwemely well-wead,
in fact. I’ve gone thwough all of Jawdun, Obijasi, Kwomwill … oh, all of
them, y’know.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of them, of course,” said Hardin, “but I’ve never read
them.”</p>
<p>“You should some day, my deah fellow. It would amply wepay you. Why,
I cutainly considah it well wuhth the twip heah to the Pewiphewy to see
this copy of Lameth. Would you believe it, my Libwawy totally lacks a
copy. By the way, Doctah Piwenne, you have not fohgotten yoah pwomise to
twans-develop a copy foah me befoah I leave?”</p>
<p>“Only too pleased.”</p>
<p>“Lameth, you must know,” continued the chancellor, pontifically,
“pwesents a new and most intwesting addition to my pwevious knowledge of
the ‘Owigin Question.’ ”</p>
<p>“Which question?” asked Hardin.</p>
<p>“The ‘Owigin Question.’ The place of the owigin of the human species,
y’know. Suahly you must know that it is thought that owiginally the
human wace occupied only one planetawy system.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I know that.”</p>
<p>“Of cohse, no one knows exactly which system it is—lost in the mists
of antiquity. Theah ah theawies, howevah. Siwius, some say. Othahs
insist on Alpha Centauwi, oah on Sol, oah on 61 Cygni—all in the Siwius
sectah, you see.”</p>
<p>“And what does Lameth say?”</p>
<p>“Well, he goes off along a new twail completely. He twies to show
that ahchaeological wemains on the thuhd planet of the Ahctuwian System
show that humanity existed theah befoah theah wah any indications of
space-twavel.”</p>
<p>“And that means it was humanity’s birth planet?”</p>
<p>“P’haps. I must wead it closely and weigh the evidence befoah I can
say foah cuhtain. One must see just how weliable his obsuhvations
ah.”</p>
<p>Hardin remained silent for a short while. Then he said, “When did
Lameth write his book?”</p>
<p>“Oh—I should say about eight hundwed yeahs ago. Of cohse, he has
based it lahgely on the pwevious wuhk of Gleen.”</p>
<p>“Then why rely on him? Why not go to Arcturus and study the remains
for yourself?”</p>
<p>Lord Dorwin raised his eyebrows and took a pinch of snuff hurriedly.
“Why, whatevah foah, my deah fellow?”</p>
<p>“To get the information firsthand, of course.”</p>
<p>“But wheah’s the necessity? It seems an uncommonly woundabout and
hopelessly wigmawolish method of getting anywheahs. Look heah, now, I’ve
got the wuhks of all the old mastahs—the gweat ahchaeologists of the
past. I wigh them against each othah—balance the disagweements—analyze
the conflicting statements—decide which is pwobably cowwect—and come to
a conclusion. That is the scientific method. At least”—patronizingly—“as
I see it. How insuffewably cwude it would be to go to Ahctuwus, oah to
Sol, foah instance, and blundah about, when the old mastahs have covahed
the gwound so much moah effectually than we could possibly hope to
do.”</p>
<p>Hardin murmured politely, “I see.”</p>
<p>“Come, milord,” said Pirenne, “I think we had better be
returning.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. P’haps we had.”</p>
<p>As they left the room, Hardin said suddenly, “Milord, may I ask a
question?”</p>
<p>Lord Dorwin smiled blandly and emphasized his answer with a gracious
flutter of the hand. “Cuhtainly, my deah fellow. Only too happy to be of
suhvice. If I can help you in any way fwom my pooah stoah of
knowledge—”</p>
<p>“It isn’t exactly about archaeology, milord.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s this: Last year we received news here in Terminus about the
meltdown of a power plant on Planet V of Gamma Andromeda. We got the
barest outline of the accident—no details at all. I wonder if you could
tell me exactly what happened.”</p>
<p>Pirenne’s mouth twisted. “I wonder you annoy his lordship with
questions on totally irrelevant subjects.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, Doctah Piwenne,” interceded the chancellor. “It is quite
all wight. Theah isn’t much to say concuhning it in any case. The powah
plant did undergo meltdown and it was quite a catastwophe, y’know. I
believe wadiatsen damage. Weally, the govuhnment is sewiously
considewing placing seveah westwictions upon the indiscwiminate use of
nucleah powah—though that is not a thing for genewal publication,
y’know.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” said Hardin. “But what was wrong with the plant?”</p>
<p>“Well, weally,” replied Lord Dorwin indifferently, “who knows? It had
bwoken down some yeahs pweviously and it is thought that the
weplacements and wepaiah wuhk wuh most infewiah. It is so difficult
these days to find men who weally undahstand the moah technical details
of ouah powah systems.” And he took a sorrowful pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>“You realize,” said Hardin, “that the independent kingdoms of the
Periphery have lost nuclear power altogether?”</p>
<p>“Have they? I’m not at all suhpwised. Bahbawous planets—Oh, but my
deah fellow, don’t call them independent. They ahn’t, y’know. The
tweaties we’ve made with them ah pwoof positive of that. They
acknowledge the soveweignty of the Empewah. They’d have to, of cohse,
oah we wouldn’t tweat with them.”</p>
<p>“That may be so, but they have considerable freedom of action.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose so. Considewable. But that scahcely mattahs. The
Empiah is fah bettah off, with the Pewiphewy thwown upon its own
wesoahces—as it is, moah oah less. They ahn’t any good to us, y’know.
Most bahbawous planets. Scahcely civilized.”</p>
<p>“They were civilized in the past. Anacreon was one of the richest of
the outlying provinces. I understand it compared favorably with Vega
itself.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but, Hahdin, that was centuwies ago. You can scahcely dwaw
conclusion fwom that. Things wah diffewent in the old gweat days. We
ahn’t the men we used to be, y’know. But, Hahdin, come, you ah a most
puhsistent chap. I’ve told you I simply won’t discuss business today.
Doctah Piweme did pwepayah me foah you. He told me you would twy to
badgah me, but I’m fah too old a hand foah that. Leave it foah next
day.”</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
