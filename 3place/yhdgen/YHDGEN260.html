<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>Yet, even so, Hari Seldon could not repress the surge of satisfaction
that he felt as he entered his laboratory.</p>
<p>How things had changed.</p>
<p>It had begun twenty years earlier with his own doodlings on his
second-rate Heliconian computer. It was then that the first hint of what
was to become parachaotic math came to him in a cloudy fashion.</p>
<p>Then there were the years at Streeling University, when he and Yugo
Amaryl, working together, attempted to renormalize the equations, get
rid of the inconvenient infinities, and find a way around the worst of
the chaotic effects. They made very little progress, indeed.</p>
<p>But now, after ten years as First Minister, he had a whole floor of
the latest computers and a whole staff of people working on a large
variety of problems.</p>
<p>Of necessity, none of his staff—except for Yugo and himself, of
course—could really know much more than the immediate problem they were
dealing with. Each of them worked with only a small ravine or
outcropping on the gigantic mountain range of psychohistory that only
Seldon and Amaryl could see as a mountain range—and even they could see
it only dimly, its peaks hidden in clouds, its slopes veiled by
mist.</p>
<p>Dors Venabili was right, of course. He would have to begin initiating
his people into the entire mystery. The technique was getting well
beyond what only two men could handle. And Seldon was aging. Even if he
could look forward to some additional decades, the years of his most
fruitful breakthroughs were surely behind him.</p>
<p>Even Amaryl would be thirty-nine within a month and, though that was
still young, it was perhaps not overly young for a mathematician—and he
had been working on the problem almost as long as Seldon himself. His
capacity for new and tangential thinking might be dwindling, too.</p>
<p>Amaryl had seen him enter and was now approaching. Seldon watched him
fondly. Amaryl was as much a Dahlite as Seldon’s foster son, Raych, was,
and yet Amaryl, despite his muscular physique and short stature, did not
seem Dahlite at all. He lacked the mustache, he lacked the accent, he
lacked, it would seem, Dahlite consciousness of any kind. He had even
been impervious to the lure of Jo-Jo Joranum, who had appealed so
thoroughly to the people of Dahl.</p>
<p>It was as though Amaryl recognized no sectoral patriotism, no
planetary patriotism, not even Imperial patriotism. He
belonged—completely and entirely—to psychohistory.</p>
<p>Seldon felt a twinge of insufficiency. He himself remained conscious
of his first two decades on Helicon and there was no way he could keep
from thinking of himself as a Heliconian. He wondered if that
consciousness was not sure to betray him by causing him to skew his
thinking about psychohistory. Ideally, to use psychohistory properly,
one should be above worlds and sectors and deal only with humanity in
the faceless abstract—and this was what Amaryl did.</p>
<p>And Seldon didn’t, he admitted to himself, sighing silently.</p>
<p>Amaryl said, “We are making progress, Hari, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“You suppose, Yugo? Merely suppose?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to jump into outer space without a suit.” He said this
quite seriously (he did not have much of a sense of humor, Seldon knew)
and they moved into their private office. It was small, but it was also
well shielded.</p>
<p>Amaryl sat down and crossed his legs. He said, “Your latest scheme
for getting around chaos may be working in part—at the cost of
sharpness, of course.”</p>
<p>“Of course. What we gain in the straightaway, we lose in the
roundabouts. That’s the way the Universe works. We’ve just got to fool
it somehow.”</p>
<p>“We’ve fooled it a little bit. It’s like looking through frosted
glass.”</p>
<p>“Better than the years we spent trying to look through lead.”</p>
<p>Amaryl muttered something to himself, then said, “We can catch
glimmers of light and dark.”</p>
<p>“Explain!”</p>
<p>“I can’t, but I have the Prime Radiant, which I’ve been working on
like a—a—”</p>
<p>“Try lamec. That’s an animal—a beast of burden—we have on Helicon. It
doesn’t exist on Trantor.”</p>
<p>“If the lamec works hard, then that is what my work on the Prime
Radiant has been like.”</p>
<p>He pressed the security keypad on his desk and a drawer unsealed and
slid open noiselessly. He took out a dark opaque cube that Seldon
scrutinized with interest. Seldon himself had worked out the Prime
Radiant’s circuitry, but Amaryl had put it together—a clever man with
his hands was Amaryl.</p>
<p>The room darkened and equations and relationships shimmered in the
air. Numbers spread out beneath them, hovering just above the desk
surface, as if suspended by invisible marionette strings.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Wonderful. Someday, if we live long enough, we’ll have
the Prime Radiant produce a river of mathematical symbolism that will
chart past and future history. In it we can find currents and rivulets
and work out ways of changing them in order to make them follow other
currents and rivulets that we would prefer.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amaryl dryly, “if we can manage to live with the
knowledge that the actions we take, which we will mean for the best, may
turn out to be for the worst.”</p>
<p>“Believe me, Yugo, I never go to bed at night without that particular
thought gnawing at me. Still, we haven’t come to it yet. All we have is
this—which, as you say, is no more than seeing light and dark fuzzily
through frosted glass.”</p>
<p>“True enough.”</p>
<p>“And what is it you think you see, Yugo?” Seldon watched Amaryl
closely, a little grimly. He was gaining weight, getting just a bit
pudgy. He spent too much time bent over the computers (and now over the
Prime Radiant)—and not enough in physical activity. And, though he saw a
woman now and then, Seldon knew, he had never married. A mistake! Even a
workaholic is forced to take time off to satisfy a mate, to take care of
the needs of children.</p>
<p>Seldon thought of his own still-trim figure and of the manner in
which Dors strove to make him keep it that way.</p>
<p>Amaryl said, “What do I see? The Empire is in trouble.”</p>
<p>“The Empire is always in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s more specific. There’s a possibility that we may have
trouble at the center.”</p>
<p>“At Trantor?”</p>
<p>“I presume. Or at the Periphery. Either there will be a bad situation
here—perhaps civil war—or the outlying Outer Worlds will begin to break
away.”</p>
<p>“Surely it doesn’t take psychohistory to point out these
possibilities.”</p>
<p>“The interesting thing is that there seems a mutual exclusivity. One
or the other. The likelihood of both together is very small. Here! Look!
It’s your own mathematics. Observe!”</p>
<p>They bent over the Prime Radiant display for a long time.</p>
<p>Seldon said finally, “I fail to see why the two should be mutually
exclusive.”</p>
<p>“So do I, Hari, but where’s the value of psychohistory if it shows us
only what we would see anyway? This is showing us something we wouldn’t
see. What it doesn’t show us is, first, which alternative is better, and
second, what to do to make the better come to pass and depress the
possibility of the worse.”</p>
<p>Seldon pursed his lips, then said slowly, “I can tell you which
alternative is preferable. Let the Periphery go and keep Trantor.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“No question. We must keep Trantor stable, if for no other reason
than that we’re here.”</p>
<p>“Surely our own comfort isn’t the decisive point.”</p>
<p>“No, but psychohistory is. What good will it do us to keep the
Periphery intact if conditions on Trantor force us to stop work on
psychohistory? I don’t say that we’ll be killed, but we may be unable to
work. The development of psychohistory is on what our fate will depend.
As for the Empire, if the Periphery secedes it will only begin a
disintegration that may take a long time to reach the core.”</p>
<p>“Even if you’re right, Hari, what do we do to keep Trantor
stable?”</p>
<p>“To begin with, we have to think about it.”</p>
<p>A silence fell between them and then Seldon said, “Thinking doesn’t
make me happy. What if the Empire is altogether on the wrong track and
has been for all its history? I think of that every time I talk to
Gruber.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Gruber?”</p>
<p>“Mandell Gruber. A gardener.”</p>
<p>“Oh. The one who came running up with the rake to rescue you at the
time of the assassination attempt?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve always been grateful to him for that. He had only a rake
against possibly other conspirators with blasters. That’s loyalty.
Anyhow, talking to him is like a breath of fresh air. I can’t spend all
my time talking to court officials and to psychohistorians.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Come! You know what I mean. Gruber likes the open. He wants the wind
and the rain and the biting cold and everything else that raw weather
can bring to him. I miss it myself sometimes.”</p>
<p>“I don’t. I wouldn’t care if I never go out there.”</p>
<p>“You were brought up under the dome—but suppose the Empire consisted
of simple unindustrialized worlds, living by herding and farming, with
thin populations and empty spaces. Wouldn’t we all be better off?”</p>
<p>“It sounds horrible to me.”</p>
<p>“I found some spare time to check it as best I could. It seems to me
it’s a case of unstable equilibrium. A thinly populated world of the
type I describe either grows moribund and impoverished, falling off into
an uncultured near-animal level—or it industrializes. It is standing on
a narrow point and topples over in either direction and, as it just so
happens, almost every world in the Galaxy has fallen over into
industrialization.”</p>
<p>“Because that’s better.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But it can’t continue forever. We’re watching the results of
the overtoppling now. The Empire cannot exist for much longer because it
has—it has overheated. I can’t think of any other expression. What will
follow we don’t know. If, through psychohistory, we manage to prevent
the Fall or, more likely, force a recovery after the Fall, is that
merely to ensure another period of overheating? Is that the only future
humanity has, to push the boulder, like Sisyphus, up to the top of a
hill, only to see it roll to the bottom again?”</p>
<p>“Who’s Sisyphus?”</p>
<p>“A character in a primitive myth. Yugo, you must do more
reading.”</p>
<p>Amaryl shrugged. “So I can learn about Sisyphus? Not important.
Perhaps psychohistory will show us a path to an entirely new society,
one altogether different from anything we have seen, one that would be
stable and desirable.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” sighed Seldon. “I hope so, but there’s no sign of it
yet. For the near future, we will just have to labor to let the
Periphery go. That will mark the beginning of the Fall of the Galactic
Empire.”</p>
