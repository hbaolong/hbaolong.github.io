<p>Dors said, “That wasn’t a very long interview, Hari.”</p>
<p>“I know. The surroundings were terribly unpleasant and I felt I had
learned enough. Amazing how these folktales tend to magnify.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘magnify’?”</p>
<p>“Well, the Mycogenians fill their Aurora with human beings who lived
for centuries and the Dahlites fill their Earth with a humanity that
lived for millions of years. And both talk of a robot that lives
forever. Still, it makes one think.”</p>
<p>“As far as millions of years go, there’s room for—Where are we
going?”</p>
<p>“Mother Rittah said we go in this direction till we reach a rest
area, then follow the sign for CENTRAL WALKWAY, bearing left, and keep
on following the sign. Did we pass a rest area on the way in?”</p>
<p>“We may be leaving by a route different from the one we came in. I
don’t remember a rest area, but I wasn’t watching the route. I was
keeping my eye on the people we passed and—”</p>
<p>Her voice died away. Up ahead the alley swelled outward on both
sides.</p>
<p>Seldon remembered. They had passed that way. There had been a couple
of ratty couch pads resting on the walkway floor on either side.</p>
<p>There was, however, no need for Dors to watch passersby going out as
she had coming in. There were no passersby. But up ahead in the rest
area they spotted a group of men, rather large-sized for Dahlites,
mustaches bristling, bare upper arms muscular and glistening under the
yellowish indoor light of the walkway.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were waiting for the Outworlders and, almost
automatically, Seldon and Dors came to a halt. For a moment or two, the
tableau held. Then Seldon looked behind him hastily. Two or three
additional men had stepped into view.</p>
<p>Seldon said between his teeth, “We’re trapped. I should not have let
you come, Dors.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary. This is why I’m here, but was it worth your seeing
Mother Rittah?”</p>
<p>“If we get out of this, it was.”</p>
<p>Seldon then said in a loud and firm voice, “May we pass?”</p>
<p>One of the men ahead stepped forward. He was fully Seldon’s height of
1.73 meters, but broader in the shoulders and much more muscular. A bit
flabby at the waist, though, Seldon noted.</p>
<p>“I’m Marron,” he said with self-satisfied significance, as though the
name ought to have meaning, “and I’m here to tell you we don’t like
Outworlders in our district. You want to come in, all right—but if you
want to leave, you’ll have to pay.”</p>
<p>“Very well. How much?”</p>
<p>“All you’ve got. You rish Outworlders have credit tiles, right? Just
hand them over.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No point saying no. We’ll just take them.”</p>
<p>“You can’t take them without killing me or hurting me and they won’t
work without my voiceprint. My normal voiceprint.”</p>
<p>“That’s not so, Master—see, I’m being polite—we can take them away
from you without hurting you very much.”</p>
<p>“How many of you big strong men will it take? Nine? No.” Seldon
counted rapidly. “Ten.”</p>
<p>“Just one. Me.”</p>
<p>“With no help?”</p>
<p>“Just me.”</p>
<p>“If the rest of you will clear away and give us room, I would like to
see you try it, Marron.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have a knife, Master. You want one?”</p>
<p>“No, use yours to make the fight even. I’ll fight without one.”</p>
<p>Marron looked about at the others and said, “Hey, this puny guy is a
sport. He don’t even sound scared. That’s sort of nice. It would be a
shame to hurt him. —I tell you what, Master. I’ll take the girl. If you
want me to stop, hand over your credit tile and her tile and use your
right voices to activate them. If you say no, then after I’m through
with the girl … and that’ll take some time”—he laughed—“I’ll just have
to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon. “Let the woman go. I’ve challenged you to a
fight—one to one, you with a knife, me without. If you want bigger odds,
I’ll fight two of you, but let the woman go.”</p>
<p>“Stop, Hari!” cried out Dors. “If he wants me, let him come and get
me. You stay right where you are, Hari, and don’t move.”</p>
<p>“You hear that?” said Marron, grinning broadly. “ ‘You stay right
where you are, Hari, and don’t move.’ I think the little lady wants me.
You two, keep him still.”</p>
<p>Each of Seldon’s arms were caught in an iron grip and he felt the
sharp point of a knife in his back.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” said a harsh whisper in his ear, “and you can watch.
The lady will probably like it. Marron’s pretty good at this.”</p>
<p>Dors called out again. “Don’t move, Hari!” She turned to face Marron
watchfully, her half-closed hands poised near her belt.</p>
<p>He closed in on her purposefully and she waited till he had come
within arm’s length, when suddenly her own arms flashed and Marron found
himself facing two large knives.</p>
<p>For a moment, he leaned backward and then he laughed. “The little
lady has two knives—knives like the big boys have. And I’ve only got
one. But that’s fair enough.” His knife was swiftly out. “I hate to have
to cut you, little lady, because it will be more fun for both of us if I
don’t. Maybe I can just knock them out of your hands, huh?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I don’t want to kill you. I’ll do all I can to avoid
doing so. Just the same, I call on all to witness, that if I do kill
you, it is to protect my friend, as I am honor-bound to do.”</p>
<p>Marron pretended to be terrified. “Oh, please don’t kill me, little
lady.” Then he burst into laughter and was joined by the other Dahlites
present.</p>
<p>Marron lunged with his knife, quite wide of the mark. He tried it
again, then a third time, but Dors never budged. She made no attempt to
fend off any motion that was not truly aimed at her.</p>
<p>Marron’s expression darkened. He was trying to make her respond with
panic, but he was only making himself seem ineffectual. The next lunge
was directly at her and Dors’s left-hand blade moved flashingly and
caught his with a force that pushed his arm aside. Her right-hand blade
flashed inward and made a diagonal slit in his T-shirt. A thin bloody
line smeared the dark-haired skin beneath.</p>
<p>Marron looked down at himself in shock as the onlookers gasped in
surprise. Seldon felt the grip on him weaken slightly as the two who
held him were distracted by a duel not going quite as they had expected.
He tensed himself.</p>
<p>Now Marron lunged again and this time his left hand shot outward to
enclose Dors’s right wrist. Again Dors’s left-hand blade caught his
knife and held it motionless, while her right hand twisted agilely and
drew downward, even as Marron’s left hand closed upon it. It closed on
nothing but the blade and when he opened his hand there was a bloody
line down the palm.</p>
<p>Dors sprang back and Marron, aware of the blood on his chest and
hand, roared out chokingly, “Someone toss me another knife!”</p>
<p>There was hesitation and then one of the onlookers tossed his own
knife underhanded. Marron reached for it, but Dors was quicker. Her
right-hand blade struck the thrown knife and sent it flying backward,
whirling as it went.</p>
<p>Seldon felt the grips on his arms weaken further. He lifted them
suddenly, pushing up and forward, and was free. His two captors turned
toward him with a sudden shout, but he quickly kneed one in the groin
and elbowed the other in the solar plexus and both went down.</p>
<p>He knelt to draw the knives of each and rose as double-armed as Dors.
Unlike Dors, Seldon did not know how to handle the blades, but he knew
the Dahlites would scarcely be aware of that.</p>
<p>Dors said, “Just keep them off, Hari. Don’t attack yet. —Marron, my
next stroke will not be a scratch.”</p>
<p>Marron, totally enraged, roared incoherently and charged blindly,
attempting by sheer kinetic energy to overwhelm his opponent. Dors,
dipping and sidestepping, ducked under his right arm, kicked her foot
against his right ankle, and down he crashed, his knife flying.</p>
<p>She then knelt, placed one blade against the back of his neck and the
other against his throat, and said, “Yield!”</p>
<p>With another yell, Marron struck out against her with one arm, pushed
her to one side, then scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>He had not yet stood up completely when she was upon him, one knife
slashing downward and hacking away a section of his mustache. This time
he yowled like a large animal in agony, clapping his hand to his face.
When he drew it away, it was dripping blood.</p>
<p>Dors shouted, “It won’t grow again, Marron. Some of the lip went with
it. Attack once more and you’re dead meat.”</p>
<p>She waited, but Marron had had enough. He stumbled away, moaning,
leaving a trail of blood.</p>
<p>Dors turned toward the others. The two that Seldon had knocked down
were still lying there, unarmed and not anxious to get up. She bent
down, cut their belts with one of her knives and then slit their
trousers.</p>
<p>“This way, you’ll have to hold your pants up when you walk,” she
said.</p>
<p>She stared at the seven men still on their feet, who were watching
her with awestruck fascination. “And which of you threw the knife?”</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>She said, “It doesn’t matter to me. Come one at a time or all
together, but each time I slash, someone dies.”</p>
<p>And with one accord, the seven turned and scurried away.</p>
<p>Dors lifted her eyebrows and said to Seldon, “This time, at least,
Hummin can’t complain that I failed to protect you.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I still can’t believe what I saw. I didn’t know you
could do anything like that—or talk like that either.”</p>
<p>Dors merely smiled. “You have your talents too. We make a good pair.
Here, retract your knife blades and put them into your pouch. I think
the news will spread with enormous speed and we can get out of
Billibotton without fear of being stopped.”</p>
<p>She was quite right.</p>
<p>DAVAN—… In the unsettled times marking the final centuries of the
First Galactic Empire, the typical sources of unrest arose from the fact
that political and military leaders jockeyed for “supreme” power (a
supremacy that grew more worthless with each decade). Only rarely was
there anything that could be called a popular movement prior to the
advent of psychohistory. In this connection, one intriguing example
involves Davan, of whom little is actually known, but who may have met
with Hari Seldon at one time when …</p>
