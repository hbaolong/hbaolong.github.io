<h4 id="section">60</h4>
<p>They were finally back in a tunnel. Hummin and Seldon had traveled
through one when they went from the Imperial Sector to Streeling
University in the air-taxi. Now they were in another tunnel, going from
Mycogen to … Seldon did not know where. He hesitated to ask. Hummin’s
face seemed as if it was carved out of granite and it didn’t welcome
conversation.</p>
<p>Hummin sat in the front of the four-seater, with no one to his right.
Seldon and Dors shared the backseat.</p>
<p>Seldon chanced a smile at Dors, who looked glum. “It’s nice to be in
real clothes again, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I will never,” said Dors with enormous sincerity, “wear or look at
anything that resembles a kirtle. And I will never, under any
circumstances, wear a skincap. In fact, I’m going to feel odd if I ever
see a normally bald man.”</p>
<p>And it was Dors who finally asked the question that Seldon had been
reluctant to advance. “Chetter,” she said rather petulantly, “why won’t
you tell us where we’re going?”</p>
<p>Hummin hitched himself into a sideways position and he looked back at
Dors and Seldon gravely. “Somewhere,” he said, “where it may be
difficult for you to get into trouble—although I’m not sure such a place
exists.”</p>
<p>Dors was at once crestfallen. “Actually, Chetter, it’s my fault. At
Streeling, I let Hari go Upperside without accompanying him. In Mycogen,
I at least accompanied him, but I suppose I ought not to have let him
enter the Sacratorium at all.”</p>
<p>“I was determined,” said Seldon warmly. “It was in no way Dors’s
fault.”</p>
<p>Hummin made no effort to apportion blame. He simply said, “I gather
you wanted to see the robot. Was there a reason for that? Can you tell
me?”</p>
<p>Seldon could feel himself redden. “I was wrong in that respect,
Hummin. I did not see what I expected to see or what I hoped to see. If
I had known the content of the aerie, I would never have bothered going
there. Call it a complete fiasco.”</p>
<p>“But then, Seldon, what was it you hoped to see? Please tell me. Take
your time if you wish. This is a long trip and I am willing to
listen.”</p>
<p>“The thing is, Hummin, that I had the idea that there were humaniform
robots, that they were long-lived, that at least one might still be
alive, and that it might be in the aerie. There was a robot there, but
it was metallic, it was dead, and it was merely a symbol. Had I but
known—”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did we all but know, there would be no need for questions or
for research of any kind. Where did you get your information about
humaniform robots? Since no Mycogenian would have discussed that with
you, I can think of only one source. The Mycogenian Book—a powered
print-book in ancient Auroran and modern Galactic. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And how did you get a copy?”</p>
<p>Seldon paused, then muttered, “It’s somewhat embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“I am not easily embarrassed, Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon told him and Hummin allowed a very small smile to twitch
across his face.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Didn’t it occur to you that what occurred had to be a
charade? No Sister would do a thing like that—except under instruction
and with a great deal of persuading.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned and said with asperity, “That was not at all obvious.
People are perverted now and then. And it’s easy for you to grin. I
didn’t have the information you had and neither did Dors. If you did not
wish me to fall into traps, you might have warned me of those that
existed.”</p>
<p>“I agree. I withdraw my remark. In any case, you don’t have the Book
any longer, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“No. Sunmaster Fourteen took it from me.”</p>
<p>“How much of it did you read?”</p>
<p>“Only a small fraction. I didn’t have time. It’s a huge book and I
must tell you, Hummin, it is dreadfully dull.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know that, for I think I have read more of it than you have.
It is not only dull, it is totally unreliable. It is a one-sided,
official Mycogenian view of history that is more intent on presenting
that view than a reasoned objectivity. It is even deliberately unclear
in spots so that outsiders—even if they were to read the Book—would
never know entirely what they read. What was it, for instance, that you
thought you read about robots that interested you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve already told you. They speak of humaniform robots, robots that
could not be distinguished from human beings in outward appearance.”</p>
<p>“How many of these would exist?” asked Hummin.</p>
<p>“They don’t say. —At least, I didn’t come across a passage in which
they gave numbers. There may have been only a handful, but one of them,
the Book refers to as ‘Renegade.’ It seems to have an unpleasant
significance, but I couldn’t make out what.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell me anything about that,” interposed Dors. “If you
had, I would have told you that it’s not a proper name. It’s another
archaic word and it means, roughly, what ‘traitor’ would mean in
Galactic. The older word has a greater aura of fear about it. A traitor,
somehow, sneaks to his treason, but a renegade flaunts it.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “I’ll leave the fine points of archaic language to you,
Dors, but, in any case, if the Renegade actually existed and if it was a
humaniform robot, then, clearly, as a traitor and enemy, it would not be
preserved and venerated in the Elders’ aerie.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I didn’t know the meaning of ‘Renegade,’ but, as I
said, I did get the impression that it was an enemy. I thought it might
have been defeated and preserved as a reminder of the Mycogenian
triumph.”</p>
<p>“Was there any indication in the Book that the Renegade was
defeated?”</p>
<p>“No, but I might have missed that portion—”</p>
<p>“Not likely. Any Mycogenian victory would be announced in the Book
unmistakably and referred to over and over again.”</p>
<p>“There was another point the Book made about the Renegade,” said
Seldon, hesitating, “but I can’t be at all sure I understood it.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “As I told you … They are deliberately obscure at
times.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, they seemed to say that the Renegade could somehow tap
human emotions … influence them—”</p>
<p>“Any politician can,” said Hummin with a shrug. “It’s called
charisma—when it works.”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed. “Well, I wanted to believe. That was it. I would have
given a great deal to find an ancient humaniform robot that was still
alive and that I could question.”</p>
<p>“For what purpose?” asked Hummin.</p>
<p>“To learn the details of the primordial Galactic society when it
still consisted of only a handful of worlds. From so small a Galaxy
psychohistory could be deduced more easily.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Are you sure you could trust what you heard? After many
thousands of years, would you be willing to rely on the robot’s early
memories? How much distortion would have entered into them?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Dors suddenly. “It would be like the
computerized records I told you of, Hari. Slowly, those robot memories
would be discarded, lost, erased, distorted. You can only go back so far
and the farther you go back, the less reliable the information
becomes—no matter what you do.”</p>
<p>Hummin nodded. “I’ve heard it referred to as a kind of uncertainty
principle in information.”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t it be possible,” said Seldon thoughtfully, “that some
information, for special reasons, would be preserved? Parts of the
Mycogenian Book may well refer to events of twenty thousand years ago
and yet be very largely as it had been originally. The more valued and
the more carefully preserved particular information is, the more
long-lasting and accurate it may be.”</p>
<p>“The key word is ‘particular.’ What the Book may care to preserve may
not be what you wish to have preserved and what a robot may remember
best may be what you wish him to remember least.”</p>
<p>Seldon said in despair, “In whatever direction I turn to seek a way
of working out psychohistory, matters so arrange themselves as to make
it impossible. Why bother trying?”</p>
<p>“It might seem hopeless now,” said Hummin unemotionally, “but given
the necessary genius, a route to psychohistory may be found that none of
us would at this moment expect. Give yourself more time. —But we’re
coming to a rest area. Let us pull off and have dinner.”</p>
<p>Over the lamb patties on rather tasteless bread (most unpalatable
after the fare at Mycogen), Seldon said, “You seem to assume, Hummin,
that I am the possessor of ‘the necessary genius.’ I may not be, you
know.”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “That’s true. You may not be. However, I know of no
alternate candidate for the post, so I must cling to you.”</p>
<p>And Seldon sighed and said, “Well, I’ll try, but I’m out of any spark
of hope. Possible but not practical, I said to begin with, and I’m more
convinced of that now than I ever was before.”</p>
<p>AMARYL, YUGO—… A mathematician who, next to Hari Seldon himself, may
be considered most responsible for working out the details of
psychohistory. It was he who …</p>
<p>… Yet the conditions under which he began life are almost more
dramatic than his mathematical accomplishments. Born into the hopeless
poverty of the lower classes of Dahl, a sector of ancient Trantor, he
might have passed his life in utter obscurity were it not for the fact
that Seldon, quite by accident, encountered him in the course of …</p>
