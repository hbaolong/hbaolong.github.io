<p>BEGINNING OF WAR</p>
<p>For reason or reasons unknown to members of the Galaxy at the time of
the era under discussion, Intergalactic Standard Time defines its
fundamental unit, the second, as the time in which light travels 299,776
kilometers. 86,400 seconds are arbitrarily set equal to one
Intergalactic Standard Day; and 365 of these days to one Intergalactic
Standard Year.</p>
<p>Why 299,776?— Or 86,400?— Or 365?</p>
<p>Tradition, says the historian, begging the question. Because of
certain and various mysterious numerical relationships, say the mystics,
cultists, numerologists, metaphysicists. Because the original
home-planet of humanity had certain natural periods of rotation and
revolution from which those relationships could be derived, say a very
few.</p>
<p>No one really knew.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the date on which the Foundation cruiser the Hober
Mallow met the Kalganian squadron headed by the Fearless, and, upon
refusing to allow a search party to board, was blasted into smoldering
wreckage was 185; 11692 G.E. That is, it was the 185th day of the
11,692nd year of the Galactic Era which dated from the accession of the
first Emperor of the traditional Kamble dynasty. It was also 185; 455
S.E.—dating from the birth of Seldon—or 185; 376 F.E.—dating from the
establishment of the Foundation. On Kalgan it was 185; 76 F.C.—dating
from the establishment of the First Citizenship by the Mule. In each
case, of course, for convenience, the year was so arranged as to yield
the same day number regardless of the actual day upon which the era
began.</p>
<p>And, in addition to all the millions of worlds of the Galaxy, there
were millions of local times, based on the motions of their own
particular heavenly neighbors.</p>
<p>But whichever you choose: 185; 11692-455-376-76—or anything—it was
this day which historians later pointed to when they spoke of the start
of the Stettinian war.</p>
<p>Yet to Dr. Darell, it was none of these at all. It was simply and
quite precisely the thirty-second day since Arcadia had left
Terminus.</p>
<p>What it cost Darell to maintain stolidity through these days was not
obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>But Elvett Semic thought he could guess. He was an old man and fond
of saying that his neuronic sheaths had calcified to the point where his
thinking processes were stiff and unwieldy. He invited and almost
welcomed the universal underestimation of his decaying powers by being
the first to laugh at them. But his eyes were none the less seeing for
being faded; his mind none the less experienced and wise for being no
longer agile.</p>
<p>He merely twisted his pinched lips and said, “Why don’t you do
something about it?”</p>
<p>The sound was a physical jar to Darell, under which he winced. He
said, gruffly, “Where were we?”</p>
<p>Semic regarded him with grave eyes. “You’d better do something about
the girl.” His sparse, yellow teeth showed in a mouth that was open in
inquiry.</p>
<p>But Darell replied coldly, “The question is: Can you get a
Symes-Molff Resonator in the range required?”</p>
<p>“Well, I said I could and you weren’t listening—”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Elvett. It’s like this. What we’re doing now can be more
important to everyone in the Galaxy than the question of whether Arcadia
is safe. At least, to everyone but Arcadia and myself, and I’m willing
to go along with the majority. How big would the Resonator be?”</p>
<p>Semic looked doubtful, “I don’t know. You can find it somewheres in
the catalogues.”</p>
<p>“About how big? A ton? A pound? A block long?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought you meant exactly. It’s a little jigger.” He indicated
the first joint of his thumb. “About that.”</p>
<p>“All right, can you do something like this?” He sketched rapidly on
the pad he held in his lap, then passed it over to the old physicist,
who peered at it doubtfully, then chuckled.</p>
<p>“Y’know, the brain gets calcified when you get as old as I am. What
are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>Darell hesitated. He longed desperately, at the moment, for the
physical knowledge locked in the other’s brain, so that he need not put
his thought into words. But the longing was useless, and he
explained.</p>
<p>Semic was shaking his head. “You’d need hyper-relays. The only things
that would work fast enough. A thundering lot of them.”</p>
<p>“But it can be built?”</p>
<p>“Well, sure.”</p>
<p>“Can you get all the parts? I mean, without causing comment? In line
with your general work.”</p>
<p>Semic lifted his upper lip. “Can’t get fifty hyper-relays. I wouldn’t
use that many in my whole life.”</p>
<p>“We’re on a defense project, now. Can’t you think of something
harmless that would use them? We’ve got the money.”</p>
<p>“Hm-m-m. Maybe I can think of something.”</p>
<p>“How small can you make the whole gadget?”</p>
<p>“Hyper-relays can be had micro-size … wiring … chips—Space, you’ve
got a few hundred circuits there.”</p>
<p>“I know. How big?”</p>
<p>Semic indicated with his hands.</p>
<p>“Too big,” said Darell. “I’ve got to swing it from my belt.”</p>
<p>Slowly, he was crumpling his sketch into a tight ball. When it was a
hard, yellow grape, he dropped it into the ash tray and it was gone with
the tiny white flare of molecular decomposition.</p>
<p>He said, “Who’s at your door?”</p>
<p>Semic leaned over his desk to the little milky screen above the door
signal. He said, “The young fellow, Anthor. Someone with him, too.”</p>
<p>Darell scraped his chair back. “Nothing about this, Semic, to the
others yet. It’s deadly knowledge, if they find out, and two lives are
enough to risk.”</p>
<p>Pelleas Anthor was a pulsing vortex of activity in Semic’s office,
which, somehow, managed to partake of the age of its occupant. In the
slow turgor of the quiet room, the loose, summery sleeves of Anthor’s
tunic seemed still a-quiver with the outer breezes.</p>
<p>He said, “Dr. Darell, Dr. Semic—Orum Dirige.”</p>
<p>The other man was tall. A long straight nose that lent his thin face
a saturnine appearance. Dr. Darell held out a hand.</p>
<p>Anthor smiled slightly. “Police Lieutenant Dirige,” he amplified.
Then, significantly, “Of Kalgan.”</p>
<p>And Darell turned to stare with force at the young man. “Police
Lieutenant Dirige of Kalgan,” he repeated, distinctly. “And you bring
him here. Why?”</p>
<p>“Because he was the last man on Kalgan to see your daughter. Hold,
man.”</p>
<p>Anthor’s look of triumph was suddenly one of concern, and he was
between the two, struggling violently with Darell. Slowly, and not
gently, he forced the older man back into the chair.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?” Anthor brushed a lock of brown hair from
his forehead, tossed a hip lightly upon the desk, and swung a leg,
thoughtfully. “I thought I was bringing you good news.”</p>
<p>Darell addressed the policeman directly. “What does he mean by
calling you the last man to see my daughter? Is my daughter dead? Please
tell me without preliminary.” His face was white with apprehension.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dirige said expressionlessly, “ ‘Last man on Kalgan’ was
the phrase. She’s not on Kalgan now. I have no knowledge past that.”</p>
<p>“Here,” broke in Anthor, “let me put it straight. Sorry if I
overplayed the drama a bit, doc. You’re so inhuman about this, I forget
you have feelings. In the first place, Lieutenant Dirige is one of us.
He was born on Kalgan, but his father was a Foundation man brought to
that planet in the service of the Mule. I answer for the lieutenant’s
loyalty to the Foundation.</p>
<p>“Now I was in touch with him the day after we stopped getting the
daily report from Munn—”</p>
<p>“Why?” broke in Darell, fiercely. “I thought it was quite decided
that we were not to make a move in the matter. You were risking their
lives and ours.”</p>
<p>“Because,” was the equally fierce retort, “I’ve been involved in this
game for longer than you. Because I know of certain contacts on Kalgan
of which you know nothing. Because I act from deeper knowledge, do you
understand?”</p>
<p>“I think you’re completely mad.”</p>
<p>“Will you listen?”</p>
<p>A pause, and Darell’s eyes dropped.</p>
<p>Anthor’s lips quirked into a half smile. “All right, doc. Give me a
few minutes. Tell him, Dirige.”</p>
<p>Dirige spoke easily: “As far as I know, Dr. Darell, your daughter is
at Trantor. At least, she had a ticket to Trantor at the Eastern
Spaceport. She was with a trading representative from that planet who
claimed she was his niece. Your daughter seems to have a queer
collection of relatives, doctor. That was the second uncle she had in a
period of two weeks, eh? The Trantorian even tried to bribe me—probably
thinks that’s why they got away.” He smiled grimly at the thought.</p>
<p>“How was she?”</p>
<p>“Unharmed, as far as I could see. Frightened. I don’t blame her for
that. The whole department was after her. I still don’t know why.”</p>
<p>Darell drew a breath for what seemed the first time in several
minutes. He was conscious of the trembling of his hands and controlled
them with an effort. “Then she’s all right. This trading representative,
who was he? Go back to him. What part does he play in it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Do you know anything about Trantor?”</p>
<p>“I lived there once.”</p>
<p>“It’s an agricultural world, now. Exports animal fodder and grains,
mostly. High quality! They sell them all over the Galaxy. There are a
dozen or two farm co-operatives on the planet and each has its
representatives overseas. Shrewd sons of guns, too—I knew this one’s
record. He’d been on Kalgan before, usually with his wife. Perfectly
honest. Perfectly harmless.”</p>
<p>“Um-m-m,” said Anthor. “Arcadia was born on Trantor, wasn’t she,
doc?”</p>
<p>Darell nodded.</p>
<p>“It hangs together, you see. She wanted to go away—quickly and
far—and Trantor would suggest itself. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>Darell said: “Why not back here?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps she was being pursued and felt that she had to double off in
a new angle, eh?”</p>
<p>Dr. Darell lacked the heart to question further. Well, then, let her
be safe on Trantor, or as safe as one could be anywhere in this dark and
horrible Galaxy. He groped toward the door, felt Anthor’s light touch on
his sleeve, and stopped, but did not turn.</p>
<p>“Mind if I go home with you, doc?”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” was the automatic response.</p>
<p>By evening, the exteriormost reaches of Dr. Darell’s personality, the
ones that made immediate contact with other people, had solidified once
more. He had refused to eat his evening meal and had, instead, with
feverish insistence, returned to the inchwise advance into the intricate
mathematics of encephalographic analysis.</p>
<p>It was not till nearly midnight that he entered the living room
again.</p>
<p>Pelleas Anthor was still there, twiddling at the controls of the
video. The footsteps behind him caused him to glance over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hi. Aren’t you in bed yet? I’ve been spending hours on the video,
trying to get something other than bulletins. It seems the F.S. Hober
Mallow is delayed in course and hasn’t been heard from.”</p>
<p>“Really? What do they suspect?”</p>
<p>“What do you think? Kalganian skulduggery? There are reports that
Kalganian vessels were sighted in the general space sector in which the
Hober Mallow was last heard from.”</p>
<p>Darell shrugged, and Anthor rubbed his forehead doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Look, doc,” he said, “why don’t you go to Trantor?”</p>
<p>“Why should I?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re no good to us here. You’re not yourself. You can’t
be. And you could accomplish a purpose by going to Trantor, too. The old
Imperial Library with the complete records of the Proceedings of the
Seldon Commission are there—”</p>
<p>“No! The Library has been picked clean and it hasn’t helped
anyone.”</p>
<p>“It helped Ebling Mis once.”</p>
<p>“How do you know? Yes, he said he found the Second Foundation, and my
mother killed him five seconds later as the only way to keep him from
unwittingly revealing its location to the Mule. But in doing so, she
also, you realize, made it impossible ever to tell whether Mis really
did know the location. After all, no one else has ever been able to
deduce the truth from those records.”</p>
<p>“Ebling Mis, if you’ll remember, was working under the driving
impetus of the Mule’s mind.”</p>
<p>“I know that, too, but Mis’ mind was, by that very token, in an
abnormal state. Do you and I know anything about the properties of a
mind under the emotional control of another; about its abilities and
shortcomings? In any case, I will not go to Trantor.”</p>
<p>Anthor frowned, “Well, why the vehemence? I merely suggested it
as—well, by Space, I don’t understand you. You look ten years older.
You’re obviously having a hellish time of it. You’re not doing anything
of value here. If I were you, I’d go and get the girl.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! It’s what I want to do, too. That’s why I won’t do it.
Look, Anthor, and try to understand. You’re playing—we’re both
playing—with something completely beyond our powers to fight. In cold
blood, if you have any, you know that, whatever you may think in your
moments of quixoticism.</p>
<p>“For fifty years, we’ve known that the Second Foundation is the real
descendant and pupil of Seldonian mathematics. What that means, and you
know that, too, is that nothing in the Galaxy happens which does not
play a part in their reckoning. To us, all life is a series of
accidents, to be met with by improvisations. To them, all life is
purposive and should be met by precalculation.</p>
<p>“But they have their weakness. Their work is statistical and only the
mass action of humanity is truly inevitable. Now how I play a part, as
an individual, in the foreseen course of history, I don’t know. Perhaps
I have no definite part, since the Plan leaves individuals to
indeterminacy and free will. But I am important and they—they, you
understand—may at least have calculated my probable reaction. So I
distrust my impulses, my desires, my probable reactions.</p>
<p>“I would rather present them with an improbable reaction. I will stay
here, despite the fact that I yearn very desperately to leave. No!
Because I yearn very desperately to leave.”</p>
<p>The younger man smiled sourly. “You don’t know your own mind as well
as they might. Suppose that—knowing you—they might count on what you
think, merely think, is the improbable reaction, simply by knowing in
advance what your line of reasoning would be.”</p>
<p>“In that case, there is no escape. For if I follow the reasoning you
have just outlined and go to Trantor, they may have foreseen that, too.
There is an endless cycle of double-double-double-double-crosses. No
matter how far I follow that cycle, I can only either go or stay. The
intricate act of luring my daughter halfway across the Galaxy cannot be
meant to make me stay where I am, since I would most certainly have
stayed if they had done nothing. It can only be to make me move, and so
I will stay.</p>
<p>“And besides, Anthor, not everything bears the breath of the Second
Foundation; not all events are the results of their puppeting. They may
have had nothing to do with Arcadia’s leave-taking, and she may be safe
on Trantor when all the rest of us are dead.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Anthor, sharply, “now you are off the track.”</p>
<p>“You have an alternative interpretation?”</p>
<p>“I have—if you’ll listen.”</p>
<p>“Oh, go ahead. I don’t lack patience.”</p>
<p>“Well, then—how well do you know your own daughter?”</p>
<p>“How well can any individual know any other? Obviously, my knowledge
is inadequate.”</p>
<p>“So is mine on that basis, perhaps even more so—but at least, I
viewed her with fresh eyes. Item one: She is a ferocious little
romantic, the only child of an ivory-tower academician, growing up in an
unreal world of video and book-film adventure. She lives in a weird
self-constructed fantasy of espionage and intrigue. Item two: She’s
intelligent about it; intelligent enough to outwit us, at any rate. She
planned carefully to overhear our first conference and succeeded. She
planned carefully to go to Kalgan with Munn and succeeded. Item three:
She has an unholy hero-worship of her grandmother—your mother—who
defeated the Mule.</p>
<p>“I’m right so far, I think? All right, then. Now, unlike you, I’ve
received a complete report from Lieutenant Dirige and, in addition, my
sources of information on Kalgan are rather complete, and all sources
check. We know, for instance, that Homir Munn, in conference with the
Lord of Kalgan, was refused admission to the Mule’s palace, and that
this refusal was suddenly abrogated after Arcadia had spoken to Lady
Callia, the First Citizen’s very good friend.”</p>
<p>Darell interrupted. “And how do you know all this?”</p>
<p>“For one thing, Munn was interviewed by Dirige as part of the police
campaign to locate Arcadia. Naturally, we have a complete transcript of
the questions and answers.</p>
<p>“And take Lady Callia herself. It is rumored that she has lost
Stettin’s interest, but the rumor isn’t borne out by facts. She not only
remains unreplaced; is not only able to mediate the lord’s refusal to
Munn into an acceptance; but can even engineer Arcadia’s escape openly.
Why, a dozen of the soldiers about Stettin’s executive mansion testified
that they were seen together on the last evening. Yet she remains
unpunished. This despite the fact that Arcadia was searched for with
every appearance of diligence.”</p>
<p>“But what is your conclusion from all this torrent of
ill-connection?”</p>
<p>“That Arcadia’s escape was arranged.”</p>
<p>“As I said.”</p>
<p>“With this addition. That Arcadia must have known it was arranged;
that Arcadia, the bright little girl who saw cabals everywhere, saw this
one and followed your own type of reasoning. They wanted her to return
to the Foundation, and so she went to Trantor, instead. But why
Trantor?”</p>
<p>“Well, why?”</p>
<p>“Because that is where Bayta, her idolized grandmother, escaped when
she was in flight. Consciously or unconsciously, Arcadia imitated that.
I wonder, then, if Arcadia was fleeing the same enemy.”</p>
<p>“The Mule?” asked Darell with polite sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Of course not. I mean, by the enemy, a mentality that she could not
fight. She was running from the Second Foundation, or such influence
thereof as could be found on Kalgan.”</p>
<p>“What influence is this you speak of?”</p>
<p>“Do you expect Kalgan to be immune from that ubiquitous menace? We
both have come to the conclusion, somehow, that Arcadia’s escape was
arranged. Right? She was searched for and found, but deliberately
allowed to slip away by Dirige. By Dirige, do you understand? But how
was that? Because he was our man. But how did they know that? Surely
they could not have been counting on him to be a traitor? Eh, doc?”</p>
<p>“Now you’re saying that they honestly meant to recapture her.
Frankly, you’re tiring me a bit, Anthor. Finish your say; I want to go
to bed.”</p>
<p>“My say is quickly finished.” Anthor reached for a small group of
photo-records in his inner pocket. It was the familiar wigglings of the
encephalograph. “Dirige’s brainwaves,” Anthor said, casually, “taken
since he returned.”</p>
<p>It was quite visible to Darell’s naked eye, and his face was gray
when he looked up. “He is Controlled.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. He allowed Arcadia to escape not because he was our man but
because he was the Second Foundation’s.”</p>
<p>“Even after he knew she was going to Trantor, and not to
Terminus.”</p>
<p>Anthor shrugged. “He had been geared to let her go. There was no way
he could modify that. He was only a tool, you see. It was just that
Arcadia followed the least probable course, and is probably safe. Or at
least safe until such time as the Second Foundation can modify the plans
to take into account this changed state of affairs—”</p>
<p>He paused. The little signal light on the video set was flashing. On
an independent circuit, it signified the presence of emergency news.
Darell saw it, too, and with the mechanical movement of long habit
turned on the video. They broke in upon the middle of a sentence but
before its completion, they knew that the Hober Mallow, or the wreck
thereof, had been found and that, for the first time in nearly half a
century, the Foundation was again at war.</p>
<p>Anthor’s jaw was set in a hard line. “All right, doc, you heard that.
Kalgan has attacked; and Kalgan is under the control of the Second
Foundation. Will you follow your daughter’s lead and move to
Trantor?”</p>
<p>“No. I will risk it. Here.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Darell. You are not as intelligent as your daughter. I wonder
how far you can be trusted.” His long level stare held Darell for a
moment, and then without a word, he left.</p>
<p>And Darell was left in uncertainty and—almost—despair.</p>
<p>Unheeded, the video was a medley of excited sight-sound, as it
described in nervous detail the first hour of the war between Kalgan and
the Foundation.</p>
