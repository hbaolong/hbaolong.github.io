<h4 id="section">44</h4>
<p>Seldon said, “I come from a world which lies out in the open, Sister,
as all worlds do but Trantor. Rain comes or doesn’t come, the rivers
trickle or are in flood, temperature is high or low. That means harvests
are good or bad. Here, however, the environment is truly controlled.
Harvests have no choice but to be good. How fortunate Mycogen is.”</p>
<p>He waited. There were different possible answers and his course of
action would depend on which answer came.</p>
<p>She was speaking quite freely now and seemed to have no inhibitions
concerning his masculinity, so this long tour had served its purpose.
Raindrop Forty-Three said, “The environment is not that easy to control.
There are, occasionally, viral infections and there are sometimes
unexpected and undesirable mutations. There are times when whole vast
batches wither or are worthless.”</p>
<p>“You astonish me. And what happens then?”</p>
<p>“There is usually no recourse but to destroy the spoiled batches,
even those that are merely suspected of spoilage. Trays and tanks must
be totally sterilized, sometimes disposed of altogether.”</p>
<p>“It amounts to surgery, then,” said Seldon. “You cut out the diseased
tissue.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And what do you do to prevent such things from happening?”</p>
<p>“What can we do? We test constantly for any mutations that may spring
up, any new viruses that may appear, any accidental contamination or
alteration of the environment. It rarely happens that we detect anything
wrong, but if we do, we take drastic action. The result is that bad
years are very few and even bad years affect only fractional bits here
and there. The worst year we’ve ever had fell short of the average by
only 12 percent—though that was enough to produce hardship. The trouble
is that even the most careful forethought and the most cleverly designed
computer programs can’t always predict what is essentially
unpredictable.”</p>
<p>(Seldon felt an involuntary shudder go through him. It was as though
she was speaking of psychohistory—but she was only speaking of the
microfarm produce of a tiny fraction of humanity, while he himself was
considering all the mighty Galactic Empire in every one of all its
activities.)</p>
<p>Unavoidably disheartened, he said, “Surely, it’s not all
unpredictable. There are forces that guide and that care for us
all.”</p>
<p>The Sister stiffened. She turned around toward him, seeming to study
him with her penetrating eyes.</p>
<p>But all she said was, “What?”</p>
<p>Seldon felt uneasy. “It seems to me that in speaking of viruses and
mutations, we’re talking about the natural, about phenomena that are
subject to natural law. That leaves out of account the supernatural,
doesn’t it? It leaves out that which is not subject to natural law and
can, therefore, control natural law.”</p>
<p>She continued to stare at him, as though he had suddenly begun
speaking some distant, unknown dialect of Galactic Standard. Again she
said, in half a whisper this time, “What?”</p>
<p>He continued, stumbling over unfamiliar words that half-embarrassed
him. “You must appeal to some great essence, some great spirit, some … I
don’t know what to call it.”</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three said in a voice that rose into higher registers
but remained low, “I thought so. I thought that was what you meant, but
I couldn’t believe it. You’re accusing us of having religion. Why didn’t
you say so? Why didn’t you use the word?”</p>
<p>She waited for an answer and Seldon, a little confused at the
onslaught, said, “Because that’s not a word I use. I call it
‘supernaturalism.’”</p>
<p>“Call it what you will. It’s religion and we don’t have it. Religion
is for the tribesmen, for the swarming sc—”</p>
<p>The Sister paused to swallow as though she had come near to choking
and Seldon was certain the word she had choked over was “scum.”</p>
<p>She was in control again. Speaking slowly and somewhat below her
normal soprano, she said, “We are not a religious people. Our kingdom is
of this Galaxy and always has been. If you have a religion—”</p>
<p>Seldon felt trapped. Somehow he had not counted on this. He raised a
hand defensively. “Not really. I’m a mathematician and my kingdom is
also of this Galaxy. It’s just that I thought, from the rigidity of your
customs, that your kingdom—”</p>
<p>“Don’t think it, tribesman. If our customs are rigid, it is because
we are mere millions surrounded by billions. Somehow we must mark
ourselves off so that we precious few are not lost among your swarms and
hordes. We must be marked off by our hairlessness, our clothing, our
behavior, our way of life. We must know who we are and we must be sure
that you tribesmen know who we are. We labor in our farms so that we can
make ourselves valuable in your eyes and thus make certain that you
leave us alone. That’s all we ask of you … to leave us alone.”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of harming you or any of your people. I seek
only knowledge, here as everywhere.”</p>
<p>“So you insult us by asking about our religion, as though we have
ever called on a mysterious, insubstantial spirit to do for us what we
cannot do for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“There are many people, many worlds who believe in supernaturalism in
one form or another … religion, if you like the word better. We may
disagree with them in one way or another, but we are as likely to be
wrong in our disbelief as they in their belief. In any case, there is no
disgrace in such belief and my questions were not intended as
insults.”</p>
<p>But she was not reconciled. “Religion!” she said angrily. “We have no
need of it.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s spirits, having sunk steadily in the course of this
exchange, reached bottom. This whole thing, this expedition with
Raindrop Forty-Three, had come to nothing.</p>
<p>But she went on to say, “We have something far better. We have
history.”</p>
<p>And Seldon’s feelings rebounded at once and he smiled.</p>
<p>HAND-ON-THIGH STORY—… An occasion cited by Hari Seldon as the first
turning point in his search for a method to develop psychohistory.
Unfortunately, his published writings give no indication as to what that
“story” was and speculations concerning it (there have been many) are
futile. It remains one of the many intriguing mysteries concerning
Seldon’s career.</p>
