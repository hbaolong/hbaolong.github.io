<h4 id="section">2</h4>
<p>MAYOR</p>
<ol type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Branno had been waiting for an hour, thinking wearily. Technically
speaking, she was guilty of breaking and entering. What’s more, she had
violated, quite unconstitutionally, the rights of a Councilman. By the
strict laws that held Mayors to account—since the days of Indbur III and
the Mule, nearly two centuries before—she was impeachable.</p>
<p>On this one day, however, for twenty-four hours she could do no
wrong.</p>
<p>But it would pass. She stirred restlessly.</p>
<p>The first two centuries had been the Golden Age of the Foundation,
the Heroic Era—at least in retrospect, if not to the unfortunates who
had lived in that insecure time. Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow had been
the two great heroes, semideified to the point of rivaling the
incomparable Hari Seldon himself. The three were a tripod on which all
Foundation legend (and even Foundation history) rested.</p>
<p>In those days, though, the Foundation had been one puny world, with a
tenuous hold on the Four Kingdoms and with only a dim awareness of the
extent to which the Seldon Plan was holding its protective hand over it,
caring for it even against the remnant of the mighty Galactic
Empire.</p>
<p>And the more powerful the Foundation grew as a political and
commercial entity, the less significant its rulers and fighters had come
to seem. Lathan Devers was almost forgotten. If he was remembered at
all, it was for his tragic death in the slave mines, rather than for his
unnecessary but successful fight against Bel Riose.</p>
<p>As for Bel Riose, the noblest of the Foundation’s adversaries, he too
was nearly forgotten, overshadowed by the Mule, who alone among enemies
had broken the Seldon Plan and defeated and ruled the Foundation. He
alone was the Great Enemy—indeed, the last of the Greats.</p>
<p>It was little remembered that the Mule had been, in essence, defeated
by one person—a woman, Bayta Darell—and that she had accomplished the
victory without the help of anyone, without even the support of the
Seldon Plan. So, too, was it almost forgotten that her son and
granddaughter, Toran and Arkady Darell, had defeated the Second
Foundation, leaving the Foundation, the First Foundation, supreme.</p>
<p>These latter-day victors were no longer heroic figures. The times had
become too expansive to do anything but shrink heroes into ordinary
mortals. Then, too, Arkady’s biography of her grandmother had reduced
her from a heroine to a figure of romance.</p>
<p>And since then there had been no heroes—not even figures of romance.
The Kalganian war had been the last moment of violence engulfing the
Foundation and that had been a minor conflict. Nearly two centuries of
virtual peace! A hundred and twenty years without so much as a ship
scratched.</p>
<p>It had been a good peace—Branno would not deny that—a profitable
peace. The Foundation had not established a Second Galactic Empire—it
was only halfway there by the Seldon Plan—but, as the Foundation
Federation, it held a strong economic grip on over a third of the
scattered political units of the Galaxy, and influenced what it didn’t
control. There were few places where “I am of the Foundation” was not
met with respect. There was no one who ranked higher in all the millions
of inhabited worlds than the Mayor of Terminus.</p>
<p>That was still the title. It was inherited from the leader of a
single small and almost disregarded city on a lonely world on the far
edge of civilization, some five centuries before, but no one would dream
of changing it or of giving it one atom more glory-in-sound. As it was,
only the all-forgotten title of Imperial Majesty could rival it in
awe.</p>
<p>—Except on Terminus itself, where the powers of the Mayor were
carefully limited. The memory of the Indburs still remained. It was not
their tyranny that people could not forget but the fact that they had
lost to the Mule.</p>
<p>And here she was, Harla Branno, the strongest to rule since the
Mule’s death (she knew that) and only the fifth woman to do so. On this
day only had she been able to use her strength openly.</p>
<p>She had fought for her interpretation of what was right and what
should be—against the dogged opposition of those who longed for the
prestige-filled Interior of the Galaxy and for the aura of Imperial
power—and she had won.</p>
<p>Not yet, she had said. Not yet! Jump too soon for the Interior and
you will lose for this reason and for that. And Seldon had appeared and
had supported her in language almost identical with her own.</p>
<p>It made her, for a time, in the eyes of all the Foundation, as wise
as Seldom himself. She knew they could forget that any hour,
however.</p>
<p>And this young man dared to challenge her on this day of days.</p>
<p>And he dared to be right!</p>
<p>That was the danger of it. He was right! And by being right, he might
destroy the Foundation!</p>
<p>And now she faced him and they were alone.</p>
<p>She said sadly, “Could you not have come to see me privately? Did you
have to shout it all out in the Council Chamber in your idiotic desire
to make a fool of me? What have you done, you mindless boy?”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Trevize felt himself flushing and fought to control his anger. The
Mayor was an aging woman who would be sixty-three on her next birthday.
He hesitated to engage in a shouting match with someone nearly twice his
age.</p>
<p>Besides, she was well practiced in the political wars and knew that
if she could place her opponent off-balance at the start then the battle
was half-won. But it took an audience to make such a tactic effective
and there was no audience before whom one might be humiliated. There
were just the two of them.</p>
<p>So he ignored her words and did his best to survey her
dispassionately. She was an old woman wearing the unisex fashions which
had prevailed for two generations now. They did not become her. The
Mayor, the leader of the Galaxy—if leader there could be—was just a
plain old woman who might easily have been mistaken for an old man,
except that her iron-gray hair was tied tightly back, instead of being
worn free in the traditional male style.</p>
<p>Trevize smiled engagingly. However much an aged opponent strove to
make the epithet “boy” sound like an insult, this particular “boy” had
the advantage of youth and good looks—and the full awareness of
both.</p>
<p>He said, “It’s true. I’m thirty-two and, therefore, a boy—in a manner
of speaking. And I’m a Councilman and, therefore, ex officio, mindless.
The first condition is unavoidable. For the second, I can only say I’m
sorry.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what you’ve done? Don’t stand there and strive for wit.
Sit down. Put your mind into gear, if you can, and answer me
rationally.”</p>
<p>“I know what I’ve done. I’ve told the truth as I’ve seen it.”</p>
<p>“And on this day you try to defy me with it? On this one day when my
prestige is such that I could pluck you out of the Council Chamber and
arrest you, with no one daring to protest?”</p>
<p>“The Council will recover its breath and it will protest. They may be
protesting now. And they will listen to me all the more for the
persecution to which you are subjecting me.”</p>
<p>“No one will listen to you, because if I thought you would continue
what you have been doing, I would continue to treat you as a traitor to
the full extent of the law.”</p>
<p>“I would then have to be tried. I’d have my day in court.”</p>
<p>“Don’t count on that. A Mayor’s emergency powers are enormous, even
if they are rarely used.”</p>
<p>“On what grounds would you declare an emergency?”</p>
<p>“I’ll invent the grounds. I have that much ingenuity left, and I do
not fear taking the political risk. Don’t push me, young man. We are
going to come to an agreement here or you will never be free again. You
will be imprisoned for the rest of your life. I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>They stared at each other: Branno in gray, Trevize in multishade
brown.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “What kind of an agreement?”</p>
<p>“Ah. You’re curious. That’s better. Then we can engage in
conversation instead of confrontation. What is your point of view?”</p>
<p>“You know it well. You have been crawling in the mud with Councilman
Compor, have you not?”</p>
<p>“I want to hear it from you—in the light of the Seldon Crisis just
passed.”</p>
<p>“Very well, if that’s what you want—Madam Mayor!” (He had been on the
brink of saying “old woman.”) “The image of Seldon was too correct, too
impossibly correct after five hundred years. It’s the eighth time he has
appeared, I believe. On some occasions, no one was there to hear him. On
at least one occasion, in the time of Indbur III, what he had to say was
utterly out of synchronization with reality—but that was in the time of
the Mule, wasn’t it? But when, on any of those occasions, was he as
correct as he was now?”</p>
<p>Trevize allowed himself a small smile. “Never before, Madam Mayor, as
far as our recordings of the past are concerned, has Seldon managed to
describe the situation so perfectly, in all its smallest details.”</p>
<p>Branno said, “Is it your suggestion that the Seldon appearance, the
holographic image, is faked; that the Seldon recordings have been
prepared by a contemporary such as myself, perhaps; that an actor was
playing the Seldon role?”</p>
<p>“Not impossible, Madam Mayor, but that’s not what I mean. The truth
is far worse. I believe that it is Seldon’s image we see, and that his
description of the present moment in history is the description he
prepared five hundred years ago. I have said as much to your man,
Kodell, who carefully guided me through a charade in which I seemed to
support the superstitions of the unthinking Foundationer.”</p>
<p>“Yes. The recording will be used, if necessary, to allow the
Foundation to see that you were never really in the opposition.”</p>
<p>Trevize spread his arms. “But I am. There is no Seldon Plan in the
sense that we believe there is, and there hasn’t been for perhaps two
centuries. I have suspected that for years now, and what we went through
in the Time Vault twelve hours ago proves it.”</p>
<p>“Because Seldon was too accurate?”</p>
<p>“Precisely. Don’t smile. That is the final proof.”</p>
<p>“I’m not smiling, as you can see. Go on.”</p>
<p>“How could he have been so accurate? Two centuries ago, Seldon’s
analysis of what was then the present was completely wrong. Three
hundred years had passed since the Foundation was set up and he was wide
of the mark. Completely!”</p>
<p>“That, Councilman, you yourself explained a few moments ago. It was
because of the Mule. The Mule was a mutant with intense mental power and
there had been no way of allowing for him in the Plan.”</p>
<p>“But he was there just the same—allowed or not. The Seldon Plan was
derailed. The Mule didn’t rule for long and he had no successor. The
Foundation regained its independence and its domination, but how could
the Seldon Plan have gotten back on target after so enormous a tearing
of its fabric?”</p>
<p>Branno looked grim and her aging hands clasped together tightly. “You
know the answer to that. We were one of two Foundations. You’ve read the
history books.”</p>
<p>“I’ve read Arkady’s biography of her grandmother—required reading in
school, after all—and I’ve read her novels, too. I’ve read the official
view of the history of the Mule and afterward. Am I to be allowed to
doubt them?”</p>
<p>“In what way?”</p>
<p>“Officially we, the First Foundation, were to retain the knowledge of
the physical sciences and to advance them. We were to operate openly,
our historical development following—whether we knew it or not—the
Seldon Plan. There was, however, also the Second Foundation, which was
to preserve and further develop the psychological sciences, including
psychohistory, and their existence was to be a secret even from us. The
Second Foundation was the fine-tuning agency of the Plan, acting to
adjust the currents of Galactic history, when they turned from the paths
outlined by the Plan.”</p>
<p>“Then you answer yourself,” said the Mayor. “Bayta Darell defeated
the Mule, perhaps under the inspiration of the Second Foundation,
although her granddaughter insists that was not so. It was the Second
Foundation without doubt, however, which labored to bring Galactic
history back to the Plan after the Mule died and, quite obviously, they
succeeded. —What on Terminus, then, are you talking about,
Councilman?”</p>
<p>“Madam Mayor, if we follow Arkady Darell’s account, it is clear that
the Second Foundation, in making the attempt to correct Galactic
history, undermined Seldon’s entire scheme, since in their attempt to
correct they destroyed their own secrecy. We, the First Foundation,
realized that our mirror image, the Second Foundation, existed, and we
could not live with the knowledge that we were being manipulated. We
therefore labored to find the Second Foundation and to destroy it.”</p>
<p>Branno nodded. “And we succeeded, according to Arkady Darell’s
account, but quite obviously, not until the Second Foundation had placed
Galactic history firmly on track again after its disruption by the Mule.
It is still on track.”</p>
<p>“Can you believe that? The Second Foundation, according to the
account, was located and its various members dealt with. That was in 378
F.E., a hundred twenty years ago. For five generations, we have
supposedly been operating without the Second Foundation, and yet have
remained so close to target where the Plan is concerned that you and the
image of Seldon spoke almost identically.”</p>
<p>“This might be interpreted to mean that I have seen into the
significance of developing history with keen insight.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me. I do not intend to cast doubt upon your keen insight,
but to me it seems that the more obvious explanation is that the Second
Foundation was never destroyed. It still rules us. It still manipulates
us. —And that is why we have returned to the track of the Seldon
Plan.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the mayor was shocked by the statement, she showed no sign of
it.</p>
<p>It was past 1 A.M. and she wanted desperately to bring an end to it,
and yet could not hasten. The young man had to be played and she did not
want to have him break the fishing line. She did not want to have to
dispose of him uselessly, when he might first be made to serve a
function.</p>
<p>She said, “Indeed? You say then that Arkady’s tale of the Kalganian
war and the destruction of the Second Foundation was false? Invented? A
game? A lie?”</p>
<p>Trevize shrugged. “It doesn’t have to be. That’s beside the point.
Suppose Arkady’s account was completely true, to the best of her
knowledge. Suppose all took place exactly as Arkady said it did; that
the nest of Second Foundationers was discovered, and that they were
disposed of. How can we possibly say, though, that we got every last one
of them? The Second Foundation was dealing with the entire Galaxy. They
were not manipulating the history of Terminus alone or even of the
Foundation alone. Their responsibilities involved more than our capital
world or our entire Federation. There were bound to be some Second
Foundationers that were a thousand—or more—parsecs away. Is it likely we
would have gotten them all?</p>
<p>“And if we failed to get them all, could we say we had won? Could the
Mule have said it in his time? He took Terminus, and with it all the
worlds it directly controlled—but the Independent Trading Worlds still
stood. He took the Trading Worlds—yet three fugitives remained: Ebling
Mis, Bayta Darell, and her husband. He kept both men under control and
left Bayta—only Bayta—uncontrolled. He did this out of sentiment, if we
are to believe Arkady’s romance. And that was enough. According to
Arkady’s account, one person—only Bayta—was left to do as she pleased,
and because of her actions the Mule was not able to locate the Second
Foundation and was therefore defeated.</p>
<p>“One person left untouched, and all was lost! That’s the importance
of one person, despite all the legends that surround Seldon’s Plan to
the effect that the individual is nothing and the mass is all.</p>
<p>“And if we left not just one Second Foundationer behind, but several
dozen, as seems perfectly likely, what then? Would they not gather
together, rebuild their fortunes, take up their careers again, multiply
their numbers by recruitment and training, and once more make us all
pawns?”</p>
<p>Branno said gravely, “Do you believe that?”</p>
<p>“I am sure of it.”</p>
<p>“But tell me, Councilman? Why should they bother? Why should the
pitiful remnant continue to cling desperately to a duty no one welcomes?
What drives them to keep the Galaxy along its path to the Second
Galactic Empire? And if the small band insists on fulfilling its
mission, why should we care? Why not accept the path of the Plan and be
thankful that they will see to it that we do not stray or lose our
way?”</p>
<p>Trevize put his hand over his eyes and rubbed them. Despite his
youth, he seemed the more tired of the two. He stared at the Mayor and
said, “I can’t believe you. Are you under the impression that the Second
Foundation is doing this for us? That they are some sort of idealists?
Isn’t it clear to you from your knowledge of politics—of the practical
issues of power and manipulation—that they are doing it for
themselves?</p>
<p>“We are the cutting edge. We are the engine, the force. We labor and
sweat and bleed and weep. They merely control—adjusting an amplifier
here, closing a contact there, and doing it all with ease and without
risk to themselves. Then, when it is all done and when, after a thousand
years of heaving and straining, we have set up the Second Galactic
Empire, the people of the Second Foundation will move in as the ruling
elite.”</p>
<p>Branno said, “Do you want to eliminate the Second Foundation then?
Having moved halfway to the Second Empire, do you want to take the
chance of completing the task on our own and serving as our own elite?
Is that it?”</p>
<p>“Certainly! Certainly! Shouldn’t that be what you want, too? You and
I won’t live to see it, but you have grandchildren and someday I may,
and they will have grandchildren, and so on. I want them to have the
fruit of our labors and I want them to look back to us as the source,
and to praise us for what we have accomplished. I don’t want it all to
fall to a hidden conspiracy devised by Seldon—who is no hero of mine. I
tell you he is a greater threat than the Mule—if we allow his Plan to go
through. By the Galaxy, I wish the Mule had disrupted the Plan
altogether—and forever. We would have survived him. He was one of a kind
and very mortal. The Second Foundation seems to be immortal.”</p>
<p>“But you would like to destroy the Second Foundation, is that not
so?”</p>
<p>“If I knew how!”</p>
<p>“Since you don’t know how, don’t you think it quite likely they will
destroy you?”</p>
<p>Trevize looked contemptuous. “I have had the thought that even you
might be under their control. Your accurate guess as to what Seldon’s
image would say and your subsequent treatment of me could be all Second
Foundation. You could be a hollow shell with a Second Foundation
content.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you talking to me as you are?”</p>
<p>“Because if you are under Second Foundation control, I am lost in any
case and I might as well expel some of the anger within me—and because,
in actual fact, I am gambling that you are not under their control, that
you are merely unaware of what you do.”</p>
<p>Branno said, “You win that gamble, at any rate. I am not under
anyone’s control but my own. Still, can you be sure I am telling the
truth? Were I under control of the Second Foundation, would I admit it?
Would I even myself know that I was under their control?</p>
<p>“But there is no profit in such questions. I believe I am not under
control and you have no choice but to believe it, too. Consider this,
however. If the Second Foundation exists, it is certain that their
biggest need is to make sure that no one in the Galaxy knows they exist.
The Seldon Plan only works well if the pawns—we—are not aware of how the
Plan works and of how we are manipulated. It was because the Mule
focused the attention of the Foundation on the Second Foundation that
the Second Foundation was destroyed in Arkady’s time. —Or should I say
nearly destroyed, Councilman?</p>
<p>“From this we can deduce two corollaries. First, we can reasonably
suppose that they interfere grossly as little as they can. We can assume
it would be impossible to take us all over. Even the Second Foundation,
if it exists, must have limits to its power. To take over some and allow
others to guess the fact would introduce distortions to the Plan.
Consequently, we come to the conclusion that their interference is as
delicate, as indirect, as sparse as is possible—and therefore I am not
controlled. Nor are you.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “That is one corollary and I tend to accept it—out of
wishful thinking, perhaps. What is the other?”</p>
<p>“A simpler and more inevitable one. If the Second Foundation exists
and wishes to guard the secret of that existence, then one thing is
sure. Anyone who thinks it still exists, and talks about it, and
announces it, and shouts it to all the Galaxy must, in some subtle way,
be removed by them at once, wiped out, done away with. Wouldn’t that be
your conclusion, too?”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Is that why you have taken me into custody, Madam
Mayor? To protect me from the Second Foundation?”</p>
<p>“In a way. To an extent. Liono Kodell’s careful recording of your
beliefs will be publicized not only in order to keep the people of
Terminus and the Foundation from being unduly disturbed by your silly
talk—but to keep the Second Foundation from being disturbed. If it
exists, I do not want to have its attention drawn to you.”</p>
<p>“Imagine that,” said Trevize with heavy irony. “For my sake? For my
lovely brown eyes?”</p>
<p>Branno stirred and then, quite without warning, laughed quietly. She
said, “I am not so old, Councilman, that I am not unaware that you have
lovely brown eyes and, thirty years ago, that might have been motive
enough. At this time, however, I wouldn’t move a millimeter to save
them—or all the rest of you—if only your eyes were involved. But if the
Second Foundation exists, and if their attention is drawn to you, they
may not stop with you. There’s my life to consider, and that of a number
of others far more intelligent and valuable than you—and all the plans
we have made.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Do you believe the Second Foundation exists, then, that you
react so carefully to the possibility of their response?”</p>
<p>Branno brought her fist down upon the table before her. “Of course I
do, you consummate fool! If I didn’t know the Second Foundation exists,
and if I weren’t fighting them as hard and as effectively as I could,
would I care what you say about such a subject? If the Second Foundation
did not exist, would it matter that you are announcing they do? I’ve
wanted for months to shut you up before you went public, but lacked the
political power to deal roughly with a Councilman. Seldon’s appearance
made me look good and gave me the power—if only temporarily—and at that
moment, you did go public. I moved at once, and now I will have you
killed without a twinge of conscience or a microsecond of hesitation—if
you don’t do exactly as you’re told.</p>
<p>“Our entire conversation now, at an hour in which I would much rather
be in bed and asleep, was designed to bring you to the point of
believing me when I tell you this. I want you to know that the problem
of the Second Foundation, which I was careful to have you outline, gives
me reason enough and inclination to have you brainstopped without
trial.”</p>
<p>Trevize half-rose from his seat.</p>
<p>Branno said, “Oh, don’t make any moves. I’m only an old woman, as
you’re undoubtedly telling yourself, but before you could place a hand
on me, you’d be dead. We are under observation, foolish young man, by my
people.”</p>
<p>Trevize sat down. He said, just a bit shakily, “You make no sense. If
you believed the Second Foundation existed, you wouldn’t be speaking of
it so freely. You wouldn’t expose yourself to the dangers to which you
say I am exposing myself.”</p>
<p>“You recognize, then, that I have a bit more good sense than you do.
In other words, you believe the Second Foundation exists, yet you speak
freely about it, because you are foolish. I believe it exists, and I
speak freely, too—but only because I have taken precautions. Since you
seem to have read Arkady’s history carefully, you may recall that she
speaks of her father having invented what she called a ‘Mental Static
Device.’ It serves as a shield to the kind of mental power the Second
Foundation has. It still exists and has been improved on, too, under
conditions of the greatest secrecy. This house is, for the moment,
reasonably safe against their prying. With that understood, let me tell
you what you are to do.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“You are to find out whether what you and I think is so is indeed so.
You are to find out if the Second Foundation still exists and, if so,
where. That means you will have to leave Terminus and go I know not
where—even though it may in the end turn out, as in Arkady’s day, that
the Second Foundation exists among us. It means you will not return till
you have something to tell us; and if you have nothing to tell us, you
will never return, and the population of Terminus will be less one
fool.”</p>
<p>Trevize found himself stammering. “How on Terminus can I look for
them without giving away the fact? They will simply arrange a death for
me, and you will be none the wiser.”</p>
<p>“Then don’t look for them, you naïve child. Look for something else.
Look for something else with all your heart and mind, and if, in the
process, you come across them because they have not bothered to pay you
any attention, then good! You may, in that case, send us the information
by shielded and coded hyperwave, and you may then return as a
reward.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you have something in mind that I should look for.”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Do you know Janov Pelorat?”</p>
<p>“Never heard of him.”</p>
<p>“You will meet him tomorrow. He will tell you what you are looking
for and he will leave with you in one of our most advanced ships. There
will be just the two of you, for two are quite enough to risk. And if
you ever try to return without satisfying us that you have the knowledge
we want, then you will be blown out of space before you come within a
parsec of Terminus. That’s all. This conversation is over.”</p>
<p>She arose, looked at her bare hands, then slowly drew on her gloves.
She turned toward the door, and through it came two guards, weapons in
hand. They stepped apart to let her pass.</p>
<p>At the doorway she turned. “There are other guards outside. Do
nothing that disturbs them or you will save us all the trouble of your
existence.”</p>
<p>“You will also then lose the benefits I might bring you,” said
Trevize and, with an effort, he managed to say it lightly.</p>
<p>“We’ll chance that,” said Branno with an unamused smile.</p>

<p>Outside Liono Kodell was waiting for her. He said, “I listened to the
whole thing, Mayor. You were extraordinarily patient.”</p>
<p>“And I am extraordinarily tired. I think the day has been seventy-two
hours long. You take over now.”</p>
<p>“I will, but tell me—Was there really a Mental Static Device about
the house?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Kodell,” said Branno wearily. “You know better than that. What
was the chance anyone was watching? Do you imagine the Second Foundation
is watching everything, everywhere, always? I’m not the romantic young
Trevize is; he might think that, but I don’t. And even if that were the
case, if Second Foundational eyes and ears were everywhere, would not
the presence of an MSD have given us away at once? For that matter,
would not its use have shown the Second Foundation a shield against its
powers existed—once they detected a region that was mentally opaque?
Isn’t the secret of such a shield’s existence—until we are quite ready
to use it to the full—something worth not only more than Trevize, but
more than you and I together? And yet—”</p>
<p>They were in the ground-car, with Kodell driving. “And yet—” said
Kodell.</p>
<p>“And yet what?” said Branno. “—Oh yes. And yet that young man is
intelligent. I called him a fool in various ways half a dozen times just
to keep him in his place, but he isn’t one. He’s young and he’s read too
many of Arkady Darell’s novels, and they have made him think that that’s
the way the Galaxy is—but he has a quick insight about him and it will
be a pity to lose him.”</p>
<p>“You are sure then that he will be lost?”</p>
<p>“Quite sure,” said Branno sadly. “Just the same, it is better that
way. We don’t need young romantics charging about blindly and smashing
in an instant, perhaps, what it has taken us years to build. Besides, he
will serve a purpose. He will surely attract the attention of the Second
Foundationers—always assuming they exist and are indeed concerning
themselves with us. And while they are attracted to him, they will,
perchance, ignore us. Perhaps we can gain even more than the good
fortune of being ignored. They may, we can hope, unwittingly give
themselves away to us in their concern with Trevize, and let us have an
opportunity and time to devise countermeasures.”</p>
<p>“Trevize, then, draws the lightning.”</p>
<p>Branno’s lips twitched. “Ah, the metaphor I’ve been looking for. He
is our lightning rod, absorbing the stroke and protecting us from
harm.”</p>
<p>“And this Pelorat, who will also be in the path of the lightning
bolt?”</p>
<p>“He may suffer, too. That can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>Kodell nodded. “Well, you know what Salvor Hardin used to say— ‘Never
let your sense of morals keep you from doing what is right.’”</p>
<p>“At the moment, I haven’t got a sense of morals,” muttered Branno. “I
have a sense of boneweariness. And yet—I could name a number of people I
would sooner lose than Golan Trevize. He is a handsome young man. —And,
of course, he knows it.” Her last words slurred as she closed her eyes
and fell into a light sleep.</p>
