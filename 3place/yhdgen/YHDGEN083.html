<p>SELDON’S PLAN</p>
<p>Consider a room!</p>
<p>The location of the room is not in question at the moment. It is
merely sufficient to say that in that room, more than anywhere, the
Second Foundation existed.</p>
<p>It was a room which, through the centuries, had been the abode of
pure science—yet it had none of the gadgets with which, through
millennia of association, science has come to be considered equivalent.
It was a science, instead, which dealt with mathematical concepts only,
in a manner similar to the speculation of ancient, ancient races in the
primitive, prehistoric days before technology had come to be; before Man
had spread beyond a single, now-unknown world.</p>
<p>For one thing, there was in that room—protected by a mental science
as yet unassailable by the combined physical might of the rest of the
Galaxy—the Prime Radiant, which held in its vitals the Seldon
Plan—complete.</p>
<p>For another, there was a man, too, in that room—the First
Speaker.</p>
<p>He was the twelfth in the line of chief guardians of the Plan, and
his title bore no deeper significance than the fact that at the
gatherings of the leaders of the Second Foundation, he spoke first.</p>
<p>His predecessor had beaten the Mule, but the wreckage of that
gigantic struggle still littered the path of the Plan— For twenty-five
years, he, and his administration, had been trying to force a Galaxy of
stubborn and stupid human beings back to the path—It was a terrible
task.</p>
<p>The First Speaker looked up at the opening door. Even while, in the
loneliness of the room, he considered his quarter century of effort,
which now so slowly and inevitably approached its climax; even while he
had been so engaged, his mind had been considering the newcomer with a
gentle expectation. A youth, a student, one of those who might take
over, eventually.</p>
<p>The young man stood uncertainly at the door, so that the First
Speaker had to walk to him and lead him in, with a friendly hand upon
the shoulder.</p>
<p>The Student smiled shyly, and the First Speaker responded by saying,
“First, I must tell you why you are here.”</p>
<p>They faced each other now, across the desk. Neither was speaking in
any way that could be recognized as such by any man in the Galaxy who
was not himself a member of the Second Foundation.</p>
<p>Speech, originally, was the device whereby Man learned, imperfectly,
to transmit the thoughts and emotions of his mind. By setting up
arbitrary sounds and combinations of sounds to represent certain mental
nuances, he developed a method of communication—but one which in its
clumsiness and thick-thumbed inadequacy degenerated all the delicacy of
the mind into gross and guttural signaling.</p>
<p>Down—down—the results can be followed; and all the suffering that
humanity ever knew can be traced to the one fact that no man in the
history of the Galaxy, until Hari Seldon, and very few men thereafter,
could really understand one another. Every human being lived behind an
impenetrable wall of choking mist within which no other but he existed.
Occasionally there were the dim signals from deep within the cavern in
which another man was located—so that each might grope toward the other.
Yet because they did not know one another, and could not understand one
another, and dared not trust one another, and felt from infancy the
terrors and insecurity of that ultimate isolation—there was the hunted
fear of man for man, the savage rapacity of man toward man.</p>
<p>Feet, for tens of thousands of years, had clogged and shuffled in the
mud—and held down the minds which, for an equal time, had been fit for
the companionship of the stars.</p>
<p>Grimly, Man had instinctively sought to circumvent the prison bars of
ordinary speech. Semantics, symbolic logic, psychoanalysis—they had all
been devices whereby speech could either be refined or bypassed.</p>
<p>Psychohistory had been the development of mental science, the
mathematicization thereof, rather, which had finally succeeded. Through
the development of the mathematics necessary to understand the facts of
neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous system, which
themselves had to be, had to be, traced down to nuclear forces, it first
became possible to truly develop psychology. And through the
generalization of psychological knowledge from the individual to the
group, sociology was also mathematicized.</p>
<p>The larger groups; the billions that occupied planets; the trillions
that occupied Sectors; the quadrillions that occupied the whole Galaxy,
became, not simply human beings, but gigantic forces amenable to
statistical treatment—so that to Hari Seldon, the future became clear
and inevitable, and the Plan could be set up.</p>
<p>The same basic developments of mental science that had brought about
the development of the Seldon Plan thus made it also unnecessary for the
First Speaker to use words in addressing the Student.</p>
<p>Every reaction to a stimulus, however slight, was completely
indicative of all the trifling changes, of all the flickering currents
that went on in another’s mind. The First Speaker could not sense the
emotional content of the Student’s instinctively, as the Mule would have
been able to do—since the Mule was a mutant with powers not ever likely
to become completely comprehensible to any ordinary man, even a Second
Foundationer—rather he deduced them, as the result of intensive
training.</p>
<p>Since, however, it is inherently impossible in a society based on
speech to indicate truly the method of communication of Second
Foundationers among themselves, the whole matter will be hereafter
ignored. The First Speaker will be represented as speaking in ordinary
fashion, and if the translation is not always entirely valid, it is at
least the best that can be done under the circumstances.</p>
<p>It will be pretended therefore, that the First Speaker did actually
say, “First, I must tell you why you are here,” instead of smiling just
so and lifting a finger exactly thus.</p>
<p>The First Speaker said, “You have studied mental science hard and
well for most of your life. You have absorbed all your teachers could
give you. It is time for you and a few others like yourself to begin
your apprenticeship for Speakerhood.”</p>
<p>Agitation from the other side of the desk.</p>
<p>“No—now you must take this phlegmatically. You had hoped you would
qualify. You had feared you would not. Actually, both hope and fear are
weaknesses. You knew you would qualify and you hesitate to admit the
fact because such knowledge might stamp you as cocksure and therefore
unfit. Nonsense! The most hopelessly stupid man is he who is not aware
that he is wise. It is part of your qualification that you knew you
would qualify.”</p>
<p>Relaxation on the other side of the desk.</p>
<p>“Exactly. Now you feel better and your guard is down. You are fitter
to concentrate and fitter to understand. Remember, to be truly
effective, it is not necessary to hold the mind under a tight,
controlling barrier which to the intelligent probe is as informative as
a naked mentality. Rather, one should cultivate an innocence, an
awareness of self, and an unselfconsciousness of self which leaves one
nothing to hide. My mind is open to you. Let this be so for both of
us.”</p>
<p>He went on. “It is not an easy thing to be a Speaker. It is not an
easy thing to be a Psychohistorian in the first place; and not even the
best Psychohistorian need necessarily qualify to be a Speaker. There is
a distinction here. A Speaker must not only be aware of the mathematical
intricacies of the Seldon Plan; he must have a sympathy for it and for
its ends. He must love the Plan; to him it must be life and breath. More
than that, it must even be as a living friend.</p>
<p>“Do you know what this is?”</p>
<p>The First Speaker’s hand hovered gently over the black, shining cube
in the middle of the desk. It was featureless.</p>
<p>“No, Speaker, I do not.”</p>
<p>“You have heard of the Prime Radiant?”</p>
<p>“This?”—Astonishment.</p>
<p>“You expected something more noble and awe-inspiring? Well, that is
natural. It was created in the days of the Empire, by men of Seldon’s
time. For nearly four hundred years, it has served our needs perfectly,
without requiring repairs or adjustment. And fortunately so, since none
of the Second Foundation is qualified to handle it in any technical
fashion.” He smiled gently. “Those of the First Foundation might be able
to duplicate this, but they must never know, of course.”</p>
<p>He depressed a lever on his side of the desk and the room was in
darkness. But only for a moment, since with a gradually livening flush,
the two long walls of the room glowed to life. First, a pearly white,
unrelieved, then a trace of faint darkness here and there, and finally,
the fine neatly printed equations in black, with an occasional red
hairline that wavered through the darker forest like a staggering
rillet.</p>
<p>“Come, my boy, step here before the wall. You will not cast a shadow.
This light does not radiate from the Radiant in an ordinary manner. To
tell you the truth, I do not know even faintly by what medium this
effect is produced, but you will not cast a shadow. I know that.”</p>
<p>They stood together in the light. Each wall was thirty feet long, and
ten high. The writing was small and covered every inch.</p>
<p>“This is not the whole Plan,” said the First Speaker. “To get it all
upon both walls, the individual equations would have to be reduced to
microscopic size—but that is not necessary. What you now see represents
the main portions of the Plan till now. You have learned about this,
have you not?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker, I have.”</p>
<p>“Do you recognize any portion?”</p>
<p>A slow silence. The student pointed a finger and as he did so, the
line of equations marched down the wall, until the single series of
functions he had thought of—one could scarcely consider the quick,
generalized gesture of the finger to have been sufficiently precise—was
at eye-level.</p>
<p>The First Speaker laughed softly, “You will find the Prime Radiant to
be attuned to your mind. You may expect more surprises from the little
gadget. What were you about to say about the equation you have
chosen?”</p>
<p>“It,” faltered the Student, “is a Rigellian integral, using a
planetary distribution of a bias indicating the presence of two chief
economic classes on the planet, or maybe a Sector, plus an unstable
emotional pattern.”</p>
<p>“And what does it signify?”</p>
<p>“It represents the limit of tension, since we have here”—he pointed,
and again the equations veered—“a converging series.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said the First Speaker. “And tell me, what do you think of
all this. A finished work of art, is it not?”</p>
<p>“Definitely!”</p>
<p>“Wrong! It is not.” This, with sharpness. “It is the first lesson you
must unlearn. The Seldon Plan is neither complete nor correct. Instead,
it is merely the best that could be done at the time. Over a dozen
generations of men have pored over these equations, worked at them,
taken them apart to the last decimal place, and put them together again.
They’ve done more than that. They’ve watched nearly four hundred years
pass and against the predictions and equations, they’ve checked reality,
and they have learned.</p>
<p>“They have learned more than Seldon ever knew, and if with the
accumulated knowledge of the centuries we could repeat Seldon’s work, we
could do a better job. Is that perfectly clear to you?”</p>
<p>The Student appeared a little shocked.</p>
<p>“Before you obtain your Speakerhood,” continued the First Speaker,
“you yourself will have to make an original contribution to the Plan. It
is not such great blasphemy. Every red mark you see on the wall is the
contribution of a man among us who lived since Seldon. Why … why—” He
looked upward, “There!”</p>
<p>The whole wall seemed to whirl down upon him.</p>
<p>“This,” he said, “is mine.” A fine red line encircled two forking
arrows and included six square feet of deductions along each path.
Between the two were a series of equations in red.</p>
<p>“It does not,” said the Speaker, “seem to be much. It is at a point
in the Plan which we will not reach yet for a time as long as that which
has already passed. It is at the period of coalescence, when the Second
Empire that is to be is in the grip of rival personalities who will
threaten to pull it apart if the fight is too even, or clamp it into
rigidity, if the fight is too uneven. Both possibilities are considered
here, followed, and the method of avoiding either indicated.</p>
<p>“Yet it is all a matter of probabilities and a third course can
exist. It is one of comparatively low likelihood—twelve point six four
percent, to be exact—but even smaller chances have already come to pass
and the Plan is only forty percent complete. This third probability
consists of a possible compromise between two or more of the conflicting
personalities being considered. This, I showed, would first freeze the
Second Empire into an unprofitable mold, and then, eventually, inflict
more damage through civil wars than would have taken place had a
compromise never been made in the first place. Fortunately, that could
be prevented, too. And that was my contribution.”</p>
<p>“If I may interrupt, Speaker—How is a change made?”</p>
<p>“Through the agency of the Radiant. You will find in your own case,
for instance, that your mathematics will be checked rigorously by five
different boards; and that you will be required to defend it against a
concerted and merciless attack. Two years will then pass, and your
development will be reviewed again. It has happened more than once that
a seemingly perfect piece of work has uncovered its fallacies only after
an induction period of months or years. Sometimes, the contributor
himself discovers the flaw.</p>
<p>“If, after two years, another examination, not less detailed than the
first, still passes it, and—better still—if in the interim the young
scientist has brought to light additional details, subsidiary evidence,
the contribution will be added to the Plan. It was the climax of my
career; it will be the climax of yours.</p>
<p>“The Prime Radiant can be adjusted to your mind, and all corrections
and additions can be made through mental rapport. There will be nothing
to indicate that the correction or addition is yours. In all the history
of the Plan there has been no personalization. It is rather a creation
of all of us together. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker!”</p>
<p>“Then, enough of that.” A stride to the Prime Radiant, and the walls
were blank again save for the ordinary room-lighting region along the
upper borders. “Sit down here at my desk, and let me talk to you. It is
enough for a Psychohistorian, as such, to know his Biostatistics and his
Neurochemical Electromathematics. Some know nothing else and are fit
only to be statistical technicians. But a Speaker must be able to
discuss the Plan without mathematics. If not the Plan itself, at least
its philosophy and its aims.</p>
<p>“First of all, what is the aim of the Plan? Please tell me in your
own words—and don’t grope for fine sentiment. You won’t be judged on
polish and suavity, I assure you.”</p>
<p>It was the Student’s first chance at more than a sentence, and he
hesitated before plunging into the expectant space cleared away for him.
He said, diffidently: “As a result of what I have learned, I believe
that it is the intention of the Plan to establish a human civilization
based on an orientation entirely different from anything that ever
before existed. An orientation which, according to the findings of
Psychohistory, could never spontaneously come into being—”</p>
<p>“Stop!” The First Speaker was insistent. “You must not say ‘never.’
That is a lazy slurring-over of the facts. Actually, Psychohistory
predicts only probabilities. A particular event may be infinitesimally
probable, but the probability is always greater than zero.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker. The orientation desired, if I may correct myself,
then, is well known to possess no significant probability of
spontaneously coming to pass.”</p>
<p>“Better. What is the orientation?”</p>
<p>“It is that of a civilization based on mental science. In all the
known history of Mankind, advances have been made primarily in physical
technology; in the capacity of handling the inanimate world about Man.
Control of self and society has been left to chance or to the vague
gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and emotion.
As a result, no culture of greater stability than about fifty-five
percent has ever existed, and these only as the result of great human
misery.”</p>
<p>“And why is the orientation we speak of a non-spontaneous one?”</p>
<p>“Because a large minority of human beings are mentally equipped to
take part in the advance of physical science, and all receive the crude
and visible benefits thereof. Only an insignificant minority, however,
are inherently able to lead Man through the greater involvements of
Mental Science; and the benefits derived therefrom, while longer
lasting, are more subtle and less apparent. Furthermore, since such an
orientation would lead to the development of a benevolent dictatorship
of the mentally best—virtually a higher subdivision of Man—it would be
resented and could not be stable without the application of a force
which would depress the rest of Mankind to brute level. Such a
development is repugnant to us and must be avoided.”</p>
<p>“What, then, is the solution?”</p>
<p>“The solution is the Seldon Plan. Conditions have been so arranged
and so maintained that in a millennium from its beginnings—six hundred
years from now—a Second Galactic Empire will have been established in
which Mankind will be ready for the leadership of Mental Science. In
that same interval, the Second Foundation, in its development, will have
brought forth a group of Psychologists ready to assume leadership. Or,
as I have myself often thought, the First Foundation supplies the
physical framework of a single political unit, and the Second Foundation
supplies the mental framework of a ready-made ruling class.”</p>
<p>“I see. Fairly adequate. Do you think that any Second Empire, even if
formed in the time set by Seldon, would do as a fulfillment of his
Plan?”</p>
<p>“No, Speaker, I do not. There are several possible Second Empires
that may be formed in the period of time stretching from nine hundred to
seventeen hundred years after the inception of the Plan, but only one of
these is the Second Empire.”</p>
<p>“And in view of all this, why is it necessary that the existence of
the Second Foundation be hidden—above all, from the First
Foundation?”</p>
<p>The Student probed for a hidden meaning to the question and failed to
find it. He was troubled in his answer, “For the same reason that the
details of the Plan as a whole must be hidden from Mankind in general.
The laws of Psychohistory are statistical in nature and are rendered
invalid if the actions of individual men are not random in nature. If a
sizable group of human beings learned of key details of the Plan, their
actions would be governed by that knowledge and would no longer be
random in the meaning of the axioms of Psychohistory. In other words,
they would no longer be perfectly predictable. Your pardon, Speaker, but
I feel that the answer is not satisfactory.”</p>
<p>“It is well that you do. Your answer is quite incomplete. It is the
Second Foundation itself which must be hidden, not simply the Plan. The
Second Empire is not yet formed. We have still a society which would
resent a ruling class of psychologists, and which would fear its
development and fight against it. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker, I do. The point has never been stressed—”</p>
<p>“Don’t minimize. It has never been made—in the classroom, though you
should be capable of deducing it yourself. This and many other points we
will make now and in the near future during your apprenticeship. You
will see me again in a week. By that time, I would like to have comments
from you as to a certain problem which I now set before you. I don’t
want complete and rigorous mathematical treatment. That would take a
year for an expert, and not a week for you. But I do want an indication
as to trends and directions—</p>
<p>“You have here a fork in the Plan at a period in time of about half a
century ago. The necessary details are included. You will note that the
path followed by the assumed reality diverges from all the plotted
predictions; its probability being under one percent. You will estimate
for how long the divergence may continue before it becomes
uncorrectable. Estimate also the probable end if uncorrected, and a
reasonable method of correction.”</p>
<p>The Student flipped the Viewer at random and looked stonily at the
passages presented on the tiny, built-in screen.</p>
<p>He said: “Why this particular problem, Speaker? It obviously has
significance other than purely academic.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my boy. You are as quick as I had expected. The problem
is not suppositious. Nearly half a century ago, the Mule burst into
Galactic history and for ten years was the largest single fact in the
universe. He was unprovided for; uncalculated for. He bent the Plan
seriously, but not fatally.</p>
<p>“To stop him before he did become fatal, however, we were forced to
take active part against him. We revealed our existence, and, infinitely
worse, a portion of our power. The First Foundation has learned of us,
and their actions are now predicated on that knowledge. Observe in the
problem presented. Here. And here.</p>
<p>“Naturally, you will not speak of this to anyone.”</p>
<p>There was an appalled pause, as realization seeped into the Student.
He said: “Then the Seldon Plan has failed!”</p>
<p>“Not yet. It merely may have failed. The probabilities of success are
