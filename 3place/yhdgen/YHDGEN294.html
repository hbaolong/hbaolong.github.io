<h4 id="section">12</h4>
<p>For ten years the Galactic Empire had been without an Emperor, but
there was no indication of that fact in the way the Imperial Palace
grounds were operated. Millennia of custom made the absence of an
Emperor meaningless.</p>
<p>It meant, of course, that there was no figure in Imperial robes to
preside over formalities of one sort or another. No Imperial voice gave
orders; no Imperial wishes made themselves known; no Imperial
gratifications or annoyances made themselves felt; no Imperial pleasures
warmed either Palace; no Imperial sicknesses cast them in gloom. The
Emperor’s own quarters in the Small Palace were empty—the Imperial
family did not exist.</p>
<p>And yet the army of gardeners kept the grounds in perfect condition.
An army of service people kept the buildings in top shape. The Emperor’s
bed—never slept in—was made with fresh sheets every day; the rooms were
cleaned; everything worked as it always worked; and the entire Imperial
staff, from top to bottom, worked as they had always worked. The top
officials gave commands as they would have done if the Emperor had
lived, commands that they knew the Emperor would have given. In many
cases, in particular in the higher echelons, the personnel were the same
as those who had been there on Cleon’s last day of life. The new
personnel who had been taken on were carefully molded and trained into
the traditions they would have to serve.</p>
<p>It was as though the Empire, accustomed to the rule of an Emperor,
insisted on this “ghost rule” to hold the Empire together.</p>
<p>The junta knew this—or, if they didn’t, they felt it vaguely. In ten
years none of those military men who had commanded the Empire had moved
into the Emperor’s private quarters in the Small Palace. Whatever these
men were, they were not Imperial and they knew they had no rights there.
A populace that endured the loss of liberty would not endure any sign of
irreverence to the Emperor—alive or dead.</p>
<p>Even General Tennar had not moved into the graceful structure that
had housed the Emperors of a dozen different dynasties for so long. He
had made his home and office in one of the structures built on the
outskirts of the grounds—eyesores, but eyesores that were built like
fortresses, sturdy enough to withstand a siege, with outlying buildings
in which an enormous force of guards was housed.</p>
<p>Tennar was a stocky man, with a mustache. It was not a vigorous
overflowing Dahlite mustache but one that was carefully clipped and
fitted to the upper lip, leaving a strip of skin between the hair and
the line of the lip. It was a reddish mustache and Tennar had cold blue
eyes. He had probably been a handsome man in his younger days, but his
face was pudgy now and his eyes were slits that expressed anger more
often than any other emotion.</p>
<p>So he said angrily—as one would, who felt himself to be absolute
master of millions of worlds and yet who dared not call himself an
Emperor—to Hender Linn, “I can establish a dynasty of my own.” He looked
around with a scowl. “This is not a fitting place for the master of the
Empire.”</p>
<p>Linn said softly, “To be master is what is important. Better to be a
master in a cubicle than a figurehead in a palace.”</p>
<p>“Best yet, to be master in a palace. Why not?”</p>
<p>Linn bore the title of colonel, but it is quite certain that he had
never engaged in any military action. His function was that of telling
Tennar what he wanted to hear—and of carrying his orders, unchanged, to
others. On occasion—if it seemed safe—he might try to steer Tennar into
more prudent courses.</p>
<p>Linn was well known as “Tennar’s lackey” and knew that was how he was
known. It did not bother him. As lackey, he was safe—and he had seen the
downfall of those who had been too proud to be lackeys.</p>
<p>The time might, of course, come when Tennar himself would be buried
in the ever-changing junta panorama, but Linn felt, with a certain
amount of philosophy, that he would be aware of it in time and save
himself. —Or he might not. There was a price for everything.</p>
<p>“No reason why you can’t found a dynasty, General,” said Linn. “Many
others have done it in the long Imperial history. Still, it takes time.
The people are slow to adapt. It is usually only the second or even
third of the dynasty who is fully accepted as Emperor.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that. I need merely announce myself as new Emperor.
Who will dare quarrel with that? My grip is tight.”</p>
<p>“So it is, General. Your power is unquestioned on Trantor and in most
of the Inner Worlds, yet it is possible that many in the farther Outer
Worlds will not—just yet—accept a new Imperial dynasty.”</p>
<p>“Inner Worlds or Outer Worlds, military force rules all. That is an
old Imperial maxim.”</p>
<p>“And a good one,” said Linn, “but many of the provinces have armed
forces of their own, nowadays, that they may not use on your behalf.
These are difficult times.”</p>
<p>“You counsel caution, then.”</p>
<p>“I always counsel caution, General.”</p>
<p>“And someday you may counsel it once too often.”</p>
<p>Linn bent his head. “I can only counsel what seems to me to be good
and useful to you, General.”</p>
<p>“As in your constant harping to me about this Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>“He is your greatest danger, General.”</p>
<p>“So you keep saying, but I don’t see it. He’s just a college
professor.”</p>
<p>Linn said, “So he is, but he was once First Minister.”</p>
<p>“I know, but that was in Cleon’s time. Has he done anything since?
With times being difficult and with the governors of the provinces being
fractious, why is a professor my greatest danger?”</p>
<p>“It is sometimes a mistake,” said Linn carefully (for one had to be
careful in educating the General), “to suppose that a quiet unobtrusive
man can be harmless. Seldon has been anything but harmless to those he
has opposed. Twenty years ago the Joranumite movement almost destroyed
Cleon’s powerful First Minister, Eto Demerzel.”</p>
<p>Tennar nodded, but the slight frown on his face betrayed his effort
to remember the matter.</p>
<p>“It was Seldon who destroyed Joranum and who succeeded Demerzel as
First Minister. The Joranumite movement survived, however, and Seldon
engineered its destruction, too, but not before it succeeded in bringing
about the assassination of Cleon.”</p>
<p>“But Seldon survived that, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“You are perfectly correct. Seldon survived.”</p>
<p>“That is strange. To have permitted an Imperial assassination should
have meant death for a First Minister.”</p>
<p>“So it should have. Nevertheless, the junta has allowed him to live.
It seemed wiser to do so.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Linn sighed internally. “There is something called psychohistory,
General.”</p>
<p>“I know nothing about that,” said Tennar flatly.</p>
<p>Actually he had a vague memory of Linn trying to talk to him on a
number of occasions concerning this strange collection of syllables. He
had never wanted to listen and Linn had known better than to push the
matter. Tennar didn’t want to listen now, either, but there seemed to be
a hidden urgency in Linn’s words. Perhaps, Tennar thought, he had now
better listen.</p>
<p>“Almost no one knows anything about it,” said Linn, “yet there are a
few—uh—intellectuals, who find it of interest.”</p>
<p>“And what is it?”</p>
<p>“It is a complex system of mathematics.”</p>
<p>Tennar shook his head. “Leave me out of that, please. I can count my
military divisions. That’s all the mathematics I need.”</p>
<p>“The story is,” said Linn, “that psychohistory may make it possible
to predict the future.”</p>
<p>The General’s eyes bulged. “You mean this Seldon is a
fortune-teller?”</p>
<p>“Not in the usual fashion. It is a matter of science.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it.”</p>
<p>“It is hard to believe, but Seldon has become something of a cult
figure here on Trantor—and in certain places in the Outer Worlds. Now
psychohistory—if it can be used to predict the future or if even people
merely think it can be so used—can be a powerful tool with which to
uphold the regime. I’m sure you have already seen this, General. One
need merely predict our regime will endure and bring forth peace and
prosperity for the Empire. People, believing this, will help make it a
self-fulfilling prophecy. On the other hand, if Seldon wishes the
reverse, he can predict civil war and ruin. People will believe that,
too, and that would destabilize the regime.”</p>
<p>“In that case, Colonel, we simply make sure that the predictions of
psychohistory are what we want them to be.”</p>
<p>“It would be Seldon who would have to make them and he is not a
friend of the regime. It is important, General, that we differentiate
between the Project that is working at Streeling University to perfect
psychohistory and Hari Seldon. Psychohistory can be extremely useful to
us, but it will be so only if someone other than Seldon were in
charge.”</p>
<p>“Are there others who could be?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. It is only necessary to get rid of Seldon.”</p>
<p>“What is so difficult with that? An order of execution—and it is
done.”</p>
<p>“It would be better, General, if the government was not seen to be
directly involved in such a thing.”</p>
<p>“Explain!”</p>
<p>“I have arranged to have him meet with you, so that you can use your
skill to probe his personality. You would then be able to judge whether
certain suggestions I have in mind are worthwhile or not.”</p>
<p>“When is the meeting to take place?”</p>
<p>“It was to take place very soon, but his representatives at the
Project asked for a few days leeway, because they were in the process of
celebrating his birthday—his sixtieth, apparently. It seemed wise to
allow that and to permit a week’s delay.”</p>
<p>“Why?” demanded Tennar. “I dislike any display of weakness.”</p>
<p>“Quite right, General. Quite right. Your instincts are, as always,
correct. However, it seemed to me that the needs of the state might
require us to know what and how the birthday celebration—which is taking
place right now—might involve.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“All knowledge is useful. Would you care to see some of the
festivities?”</p>
<p>General Tennar’s face remained dark. “Is that necessary?”</p>
<p>“I think you will find it interesting, General.”</p>
<p>The reproduction—sight and sound—was excellent and for quite a while
the hilarity of the birthday celebration filled the rather stark room in
which the General sat.</p>
<p>Linn’s low voice served as commentary. “Most of this, General, is
taking place in the Project complex, but the rest of the University is
involved. We will have an air view in a few moments and you will see
that the celebration covers a wide area. In fact, though I don’t have
the evidence available right now, there are corners of the planet here
and there, in various University and sectoral settings mostly, where
what we might call ‘sympathy celebrations’ of one sort or another are
taking place. The celebrations are still continuing and will endure for
another day at least.”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me that this is a Trantor-wide celebration?”</p>
<p>“In a specialized way. It affects mostly the intellectual classes,
but it is surprisingly widespread. It may even be that there is some
shouting on worlds other than Trantor.”</p>
<p>“Where did you get this reproduction?”</p>
<p>Linn smiled. “Our facilities in the Project are quite good. We have
reliable sources of information, so that little can happen that doesn’t
come our way at once.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Linn, what are all your conclusions about this?”</p>
<p>“It seems to me, General, and I’m sure that it seems so to you, that
Hari Seldon is the focus of a personality cult. He has so identified
himself with psychohistory that if we were to get rid of him in too open
a manner, we would entirely destroy the credibility of the science. It
would be useless to us.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, General, Seldon is growing old and it is not
difficult to imagine him being replaced by another man: someone we could
choose and who would be friendly to our great aims and hopes for the
Empire. If Seldon could be removed in such a way that it is made to seem
natural, then that is all we need.”</p>
<p>The General said, “And you think I ought to see him?”</p>
<p>“Yes, in order to weigh his quality and decide what we ought to do.
But we must be cautious, for he is a popular man.”</p>
<p>“I have dealt with popular people before,” said Tennar darkly.</p>
