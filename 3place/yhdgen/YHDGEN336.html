<h4 id="section">27</h4>
<p>It was a lovely day, neither too warm nor too cold, not too bright
nor too gray. Even though the groundskeeping budget had given out years
ago, the few straggly perennials lining the steps leading up to the
Galactic Library managed to add a cheerful note to the morning. (The
Library, having been built in the classical style of antiquity, was
fronted with one of the grandest stairways to be found in the entire
Empire, second only to the steps at the Imperial Palace itself. Most
Library visitors, however, preferred to enter via the gliderail) Seldon
had high hopes for the day.</p>
<p>Since he and Stettin Palver had been cleared of all charges in their
recent assault and battery case, Hari Seldon felt like a new man.
Although the experience had been painful, its very public nature had
advanced Seldon’s cause. Judge Tejan Popjens Lih, who was considered one
of, if not the most influential judge on Trantor, had been quite
vociferous in her opinion, delivered the day following Rial Nevas’s
emotional testimony.</p>
<p>“When we come to such a crossroads in our ‘civilized’ society,” the
judge intoned from her bench, “that a man of Professor Hari Seldon’s
standing is made to bear the humiliation, abuse, and lies of his peers
simply because of who he is and what he stands for, it is truly a dark
day for the Empire. I admit that I, too, was taken in—at first. ‘Why
wouldn’t Professor Seldon,’ I reasoned, ‘resort to such trickery in an
attempt to prove his predictions?’ But, as I came to see, I was most
grievously wrong.” Here the judge’s brow furrowed, a dark blue flush
began creeping up her neck and into her cheeks. “For I was ascribing to
Professor Seldon motives born of our new society, a society in which
honesty, decency, and goodwill are likely to get one killed, a society
in which it appears one must resort to dishonesty and trickery merely to
survive.</p>
<p>“How far we have strayed from our founding principles. We were lucky
this time, fellow citizens of Trantor. We owe a debt of thanks to
Professor Hari Seldon for showing us our true selves; let us take his
example to heart and resolve to be vigilant against the baser forces of
our human nature.”</p>
<p>Following the hearing, the Emperor had sent Seldon a congratulatory
holo-disc. On it he expressed the hope that perhaps now Seldon would
find renewed funding for his Project.</p>
<p>As Seldon slid up the entrance gliderail, he reflected on the current
status of his Psychohistory Project. His good friend—the former Chief
Librarian Las Zenow—had retired. During his tenure, Zenow had been a
strong proponent of Seldon and his work. More often than not, however,
Zenow’s hands had been tied by the Library Board. But, he had assured
Seldon, the affable new Chief Librarian, Tryma Acarnio, was as
progressive as he himself, and was popular with many factions among the
Board membership.</p>
<p>“Hari, my friend,” Zenow had said before leaving Trantor for his home
world of Wencory, “Acarnio is a good man, a person of deep intellect and
an open mind. I’m sure he’ll do all that he can to help you and the
Project. I’ve left him the entire data file on you and your
Encyclopedia; I know he’ll be as excited as I about the contribution to
humanity it represents. Take care, my friend—I’ll remember you
fondly.”</p>
<p>And so today Hari Seldon was to have his first official meeting with
the new Chief Librarian. He was cheered by the reassurances Las Zenow
had left with him and he was looking forward to sharing his plans for
the future of the Project and the Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Tryma Acarnio stood as Hari entered the Chief Librarian’s office.
Already he had made his mark on the place; whereas Zenow had stuffed
every nook and cranny of the room with holo-discs and tridijournals from
the different sectors of Trantor, and a dizzying array of visiglobes
representing various worlds of the Empire had spun in midair, Acarnio
had swept clear the mounds of data and images that Zenow had liked to
keep at his fingertips. A large holoscreen now dominated one wall on
which, Seldon presumed, Acarnio could view any publication or broadcast
that he desired.</p>
<p>Acarnio was short and stocky, with a slightly distracted look—from a
childhood corneal correction that had gone awry—that belied a fearsome
intelligence and constant awareness of everything going on around him at
all times.</p>
<p>“Well, well. Professor Seldon. Come in. Sit down.” Acarnio gestured
to a straight-backed chair facing the desk at which he sat. “It was, I
felt, quite fortuitous that you requested this meeting. You see, I had
intended to get in touch with you as soon as I settled in.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded, pleased that the new Chief Librarian had considered
him enough of a priority to plan to seek him out in the hectic early
days of his tenure.</p>
<p>“But, first, Professor, please let me know why you wanted to see me
before we move on to my, most likely, more prosaic concerns.”</p>
<p>Seldon cleared his throat and leaned forward. “Chief Librarian, Las
Zenow has no doubt told you of my work here and of my idea for an
Encyclopedia Galactica. Las was quite enthusiastic, and a great help,
providing a private office for me here and unlimited access to the
Library’s vast resources. In fact, it was he who located the eventual
home of the Encyclopedia Project, a remote Outer World called
Terminus.</p>
<p>“There was one thing, however, that Las could not provide. In order
to keep the Project on schedule, I must have office space and unlimited
access granted to a number of my colleagues, as well. It is an enormous
undertaking, just gathering the information to be copied and transferred
to Terminus before we can begin the actual work of compiling the
Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>“Las was not popular with the Library Board, as you undoubtedly are
aware. You, however, are. And so I ask you, Chief Librarian: Will you
see to it that my colleagues are granted insiders’ privileges so that we
may continue our most vital work?”</p>
<p>Here Hari stopped, almost out of breath. He was sure that his speech,
which he had gone over and over in his mind the night before, would have
the desired effect. He waited, confident in Acarnio’s response.</p>
<p>“Professor Seldon,” Acarnio began. Seldon’s expectant smile faded.
There was an edge to the Chief Librarian’s voice that Seldon had not
expected. “My esteemed predecessor provided me—in exhaustive detail—an
explication of your work here at the Library. He was quite enthusiastic
about your research and committed to the idea of your colleagues joining
you here. As was I, Professor Seldon”—at Acarnio’s pause, Seldon looked
up sharply—“at first. I was prepared to call a special meeting of the
Board to propose that a larger suite of offices be prepared for you and
your Encyclopedists. But, Professor Seldon, all that has now
changed.”</p>
<p>“Changed! But why?”</p>
<p>“Professor Seldon, you have just finished serving as principal
defendant in a most sensational assault and battery case.”</p>
<p>“But I was acquitted,” Seldon broke in. “The case never even made it
to trial.”</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, Professor, your latest foray into the public eye has
given you an undeniable—how shall I say it?—tinge of ill repute. Oh yes,
you were acquitted of all charges. But in order to get to that
acquittal, your name, your past, your beliefs, and your work were
paraded before the eyes of all the worlds. And even if one progressive
right-thinking judge has proclaimed you faultless, what of the
millions—perhaps billions—of other average citizens who see not a
pioneering psychohistorian striving to preserve his civilization’s glory
but a raving lunatic shouting doom and gloom for the great and mighty
Empire?</p>
<p>“You, by the very nature of your work, are threatening the essential
fabric of the Empire. I don’t mean the huge, nameless, faceless,
monolithic Empire. No, I am referring to the heart and soul of the
Empire—its people. When you tell them the Empire is failing, you are
saying that they are failing. And this, my dear Professor, the average
citizen cannot face.</p>
<p>“Seldon, like it or not, you have become an object of derision, a
subject of ridicule, a laughingstock.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Chief Librarian, but for years now I have been, to some
circles, a laughingstock.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but only to some circles. But this latest incident—and the very
public forum in which it was played out—has opened you up to ridicule
not only here on Trantor but throughout the worlds. And, Professor, if,
by providing you an office, we, the Galactic Library, give tacit
approval to your work, then, by inference, we, the Library, also become
a laughingstock throughout the worlds. And no matter how strongly I may
personally believe in your theory and your Encyclopedia, as Chief
Librarian of the Galactic Library on Trantor, I must think of the
Library first.</p>
<p>“And so, Professor Seldon, your request to bring in your colleagues
is denied.”</p>
<p>Hari Seldon jerked back in his chair as if struck.</p>
<p>“Further,” Acarnio continued, “I must advise you of a two-week
temporary suspension of all Library privileges—effective immediately.
The Board has called that special meeting, Professor Seldon. In two
weeks’ time we will notify you whether or not we’ve decided that our
association with you must be terminated.”</p>
<p>Here, Acarnio stopped speaking and, placing his palms on the glossy,
spotless surface of his desk, stood up. “That is all, Professor
Seldon—for now.”</p>
<p>Hari Seldon stood as well, although his upward movement was not as
smooth, nor as quick, as Tryma Acarnio’s.</p>
<p>“May I be permitted to address the Board?” asked Seldon. “Perhaps if
I were able to explain to them the vital importance of psychohistory and
the Encyclopedia—”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not, Professor,” said Acarnio softly and Seldon caught a
brief glimmer of the man Las Zenow had told him about. But, just as
quickly, the icy bureaucrat was back as Acarnio guided Seldon to the
door.</p>
<p>As the portals slid open, Acarnio said, “Two weeks, Professor Seldon.
Till then.” Hari stepped through to his waiting skitter and the doors
slid shut.</p>
<p>What am I going to do now? wondered Seldon disconsolately. Is this
the end of my work?</p>
