<p>THE FAVORITE</p>
<p>The tiny ships had appeared out of the vacant depths and darted into
the midst of the Armada. Without a shot or a burst of energy, they
weaved through the ship-swollen area, then blasted on and out, while the
Imperial wagons turned after them like lumbering beasts. There were two
noiseless flares that pinpointed space as two of the tiny gnats
shriveled in atomic disintegration, and the rest were gone.</p>
<p>The great ships searched, then returned to their original task, and
world by world, the great web of the Enclosure continued.</p>
<p>Brodrig’s uniform was stately; carefully tailored and as carefully
worn. His walk through the gardens of the obscure planet Wanda, now
temporary Imperial headquarters, was leisurely; his expression was
somber.</p>
<p>Bel Riose walked with him, his field uniform open at the collar, and
doleful in its monotonous gray-black.</p>
<p>Riose indicated the smooth black bench under the fragrant tree-fern
whose large spatulate leaves lifted flatly against the white sun. “See
that, sir. It is a relic of the Imperium. The ornamented benches, built
for lovers, linger on, fresh and useful, while the factories and the
palaces collapse into unremembered ruin.”</p>
<p>He seated himself, while Cleon II’s Privy Secretary stood erect
before him and clipped the leaves above neatly with precise swings of
his ivory staff.</p>
<p>Riose crossed his legs and offered a cigarette to the other. He
fingered one himself as he spoke, “It is what one would expect from the
enlightened wisdom of His Imperial Majesty to send so competent an
observer as yourself. It relieves any anxiety I might have felt that the
press of more important and more immediate business might perhaps force
into the shadows a small campaign on the Periphery.”</p>
<p>“The eyes of the Emperor are everywhere,” said Brodrig, mechanically.
“We do not underestimate the importance of the campaign; yet still it
would seem that too great an emphasis is being placed upon its
difficulty. Surely their little ships are no such barrier that we must
move through the intricate preliminary maneuver of an Enclosure.”</p>
<p>Riose flushed, but he maintained his equilibrium. “I cannot risk the
lives of my men, who are few enough, or the destruction of my ships,
which are irreplaceable, by a too-rash attack. The establishment of an
Enclosure will quarter my casualties in the ultimate attack, howsoever
difficult it be. The military reasons for that I took the liberty to
explain yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, I am not a military man. In this case, you assure me
that what seems patently and obviously right is, in reality, wrong. We
will allow that. Yet your caution shoots far beyond that. In your second
communication, you requested reinforcements. And these, against an enemy
poor, small, and barbarous, with whom you have had not one skirmish at
the time. To desire more forces under the circumstances would savor
almost of incapacity or worse, had not your earlier career given
sufficient proof of your boldness and imagination.”</p>
<p>“I thank you,” said the general, coldly, “but I would remind you that
there is a difference between boldness and blindness. There is a place
for a decisive gamble when you know your enemy and can calculate the
risks at least roughly; but to move at all against an unknown enemy is
boldness in itself. You might as well ask why the same man sprints
safely across an obstacle course in the day, and falls over the
furniture in his room at night.”</p>
<p>Brodrig swept away the other’s words with a neat flirt of the
fingers. “Dramatic, but not satisfactory. You have been to this
barbarian world yourself. You have in addition this enemy prisoner you
coddle, this Trader. Between yourself and the prisoner you are not in a
night fog.”</p>
<p>“No? I pray you to remember that a world which has developed in
isolation for two centuries cannot be interpreted to the point of
intelligent attack by a month’s visit. I am a soldier, not a
cleft-chinned, barrel-chested hero of a subetheric trimensional
thriller. Nor can a single prisoner, and one who is an obscure member of
an economic group which has no close connection with the enemy world
introduce me to all the inner secrets of enemy strategy.”</p>
<p>“You have questioned him?”</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“It has been useful, but not vitally so. His ship is tiny, of no
account. He sells little toys which are amusing if nothing else. I have
a few of the cleverest which I intend sending to the Emperor as
curiosities. Naturally, there is a good deal about the ship and its
workings which I do not understand, but then I am not a tech-man.”</p>
<p>“But you have among you those who are,” pointed out Brodrig.</p>
<p>“I, too, am aware of that,” replied the general in faintly caustic
tones. “But the fools have far to go before they could meet my needs. I
have already sent for clever men who can understand the workings of the
odd nuclear field-circuits the ship contains. I have received no
answer.”</p>
<p>“Men of that type cannot be spared, general. Surely there must be one
man of your vast province who understands nucleics.”</p>
<p>“Were there such a one, I would have him heal the limping, invalid
motors that power two of my small fleet of ships. Two ships of my meager
ten that cannot fight a major battle for lack of sufficient power
supply. One-fifth of my force condemned to the carrion activity of
consolidating positions behind the lines.”</p>
<p>The secretary’s fingers fluttered impatiently. “Your position is not
unique in that respect, general. The Emperor has similar troubles.”</p>
<p>The general threw away his shredded, never-lit cigarette, lit
another, and shrugged. “Well, it is beside the immediate point, this
lack of first-class tech-men. Except that I might have made more
progress with my prisoner were my Psychic Probe in proper order.”</p>
<p>The secretary’s eyebrows lifted. “You have a Probe?”</p>
<p>“An old one. A superannuated one which fails me the one time I needed
it. I set it up during the prisoner’s sleep, and received nothing. So
much for the Probe. I have tried it on my own men and the reaction is
quite proper, but again there is not one among my staff of tech-men who
can tell me why it fails upon the prisoner. Ducem Barr, who is a
theoretician of parts, though no mechanic, says the psychic structure of
the prisoner may be unaffected by the Probe since from childhood he has
been subjected to alien environments and neural stimuli. I don’t know.
But he may yet be useful. I save him in that hope.”</p>
<p>Brodrig leaned on his staff. “I shall see if a specialist is
available in the capital. In the meanwhile, what of this other man you
just mentioned, this Siwennian? You keep too many enemies in your good
graces.”</p>
<p>“He knows the enemy. He, too, I keep for future reference and the
help he may afford me.”</p>
<p>“But he is a Siwennian and the son of a proscribed rebel.”</p>
<p>“He is old and powerless, and his family acts as hostage.”</p>
<p>“I see. Yet I think that I should speak to this Trader myself.”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“Alone,” the secretary added coldly, making his point.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” repeated Riose, blandly. “As a loyal subject of the
Emperor, I accept his personal representative as my superior. However,
since the Trader is at the permanent base, you will have to leave the
front areas at an interesting moment.”</p>
<p>“Yes? Interesting in what way?”</p>
<p>“Interesting in that the Enclosure is complete today. Interesting in
that within the week, the Twentieth Fleet of the Border advances inward
toward the core of resistance.” Riose smiled and turned away.</p>
<p>In a vague way, Brodrig felt punctured.</p>
