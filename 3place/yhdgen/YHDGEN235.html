<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>She wasn’t.</p>
<p>Dors was waiting for him at the door of their apartment in an easy
stance, hand on one hip, looking very much as she had when he had first
met her at this very University eight years before: slim, shapely, with
curly reddish-gold hair—very beautiful in his eyes but not very
beautiful in any objective sense, though he had never been able to
assess her objectively after the first few days of their friendship.</p>
<p>Dors Venabili! That’s what he thought when he saw her calm face.
There were many worlds, even many sectors on Trantor where it would have
been common to call her Dors Seldon, but that, he always thought, would
put the mark of ownership on her and he did not wish it, even though the
custom was sanctioned by existence back into the vague mists of the
pre-Imperial past.</p>
<p>Dors said, softly and with a sad shake of her head that barely
disturbed her loose curls, “I’ve heard, Hari. Just what am I going to do
with you?”</p>
<p>“A kiss would not be amiss.”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps, but only after we probe this a little. Come in.” The
door closed behind them. “You know, dear, I have my course and my
research. I’m still doing that dreadful history of the Kingdom of
Trantor, which you tell me is essential to your own work. Shall I drop
it all and take to wandering around with you, protecting you? It’s still
my job, you know. It’s more than ever my job, now that you’re making
progress with psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“Making progress? I wish I were. But you needn’t protect me.”</p>
<p>“Needn’t I? I sent Raych out looking for you. After all, you were
late and I was concerned. You usually tell me when you’re going to be
late. I’m sorry if that makes me sound as though I’m your keeper, Hari,
but I am your keeper.”</p>
<p>“Does it occur to you, Keeper Dors, that every once in a while I like
to slip my leash?”</p>
<p>“And if something happens to you, what do I tell Demerzel?”</p>
<p>“Am I too late for dinner? Have we clicked for kitchen service?”</p>
<p>“No. I was waiting for you. And as long as you’re here, you click it.
You’re a great deal pickier than I am when it comes to food. And don’t
change the subject.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t Raych tell you that I was all right? So what’s there to talk
about?”</p>
<p>“When he found you, you were in control of the situation and he got
back here first, but not by much. I didn’t hear any details. Tell me—
What—were—you—doing?”</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged. “There was an illegal gathering, Dors, and I broke
it up. The University could have gotten a good deal of trouble it didn’t
need if I hadn’t.”</p>
<p>“And it was up to you to prevent it? Hari, you’re not a Twister
anymore. You’re an—”</p>
<p>He put in hastily, “An old man?”</p>
<p>“For a Twister, yes. You’re forty. How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Well— A little stiff.”</p>
<p>“I can well imagine. And one of these days, when you try to pretend
you’re a young Heliconian athlete, you’ll break a rib. —Now tell me
about it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I told you how Amaryl warned me that Demerzel was in trouble
because of the demagoguery of Jo-Jo Joranum.”</p>
<p>“Jo-Jo. Yes, I know that much. What don’t I know? What happened
today?”</p>
<p>“There was a rally at the Field. A Jo-Jo partisan named Namarti was
addressing the crowd—”</p>
<p>“Namarti is Gambol Deen Namarti, Joranum’s right-hand man.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know more about it than I do. In any case, he was
addressing a large crowd and he had no permit and I think he was hoping
there would be some sort of riot. They feed on these disorders and if he
could close down the University even temporarily, he would charge
Demerzel with the destruction of academic freedom. I gather they blame
him for everything. So I stopped them. —Sent them off without a
riot.”</p>
<p>“You sound proud.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Not bad for a man of forty.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you did it? To test your status at forty?”</p>
<p>Seldon thoughtfully clicked the dinner menu. Then he said, “No. I
really was concerned that the University would get into needless
trouble. And I was concerned about Demerzel. I’m afraid that Yugo’s
tales of danger had impressed me more than I realized. That was stupid,
Dors, because I know that Demerzel can take care of himself. I couldn’t
explain that to Yugo or to anyone but you.”</p>
<p>He drew in a deep breath. “It’s amazing what a pleasure it is that I
can at least talk to you about it. You know and I know and Demerzel
knows and no one else knows—at least, that I know of—that Demerzel is
untouchable.”</p>
<p>Dors touched a contact on a recessed wall panel and the dining
section of their living quarters lit up with a soft peach-colored glow.
Together, she and Hari walked to the table, which was already set with
linen, crystal, and utensils. As they sat, the dinner began to
arrive—there was never any long delay at this time of evening—and Seldon
accepted it quite casually. He had long since grown accustomed to the
social position that made it unnecessary for them to patronize the
faculty dinners.</p>
<p>Seldon savored the seasonings they had learned to enjoy during their
stay at Mycogen—the only thing about that strange, male-dominated,
religion-permeated, living-in-the-past sector they had not detested.</p>
<p>Dors said softly, “How do you mean, ‘untouchable’?”</p>
<p>“Come, dear, he can alter emotions. You haven’t forgotten that. If
Joranum really became dangerous, he could be”—he made a vague gesture
with his hands—“altered; made to change his mind.”</p>
<p>Dors looked uncomfortable and the meal proceeded in an unusual
silence. It wasn’t until it was over and the remains—dishes, cutlery,
and all—swirled down the disposal chute in the center of the table
(which then smoothly covered itself over) that she said, “I’m not sure I
want to talk about this, Hari, but I can’t let you be fooled by your own
innocence.”</p>
<p>“Innocence?” He frowned.</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ve never talked about this. I never thought it would come
up, but Demerzel has shortcomings. He is not untouchable, he may be
harmed, and Joranum is indeed a danger to him.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am. You don’t understand robots—certainly not one as
complex as Demerzel. And I do.”</p>
