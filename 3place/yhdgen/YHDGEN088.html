<h4 id="section">13</h4>
<p>LADY</p>
<p>Arcadia felt triumphant. How life had changed since Pelleas Anthor
had stuck his silly face up against her window—and all because she had
the vision and courage to do what needed to be done.</p>
<p>Here she was on Kalgan. She had been to the great Central Theater—the
largest in the Galaxy—and seen in person some of the singing stars who
were famous even in the distant Foundation. She had shopped all on her
own along the Flowered Path, fashion center of the gayest world in
space. And she had made her own selections because Homir just didn’t
know anything about it at all. The saleswomen raised no objections at
all to long, shiny dresses with those vertical sweeps that made her look
so tall—and Foundation money went a long, long way. Homir had given her
a ten-credit bill and when she changed it to Kalganian “Kalganids,” it
made a terribly thick sheaf.</p>
<p>She had even had her hair redone—sort of half-short in back, with two
glistening curls over each temple. And it was treated so that it looked
goldier than ever; it just shone.</p>
<p>But this; this was best of all. To be sure, the Palace of Lord
Stettin wasn’t as grand and lavish as the theaters, or as mysterious and
historical as the old palace of the Mule—of which, so far they had only
glimpsed the lonely towers in their air flight across the planet—but,
imagine, a real Lord. She was rapt in the glory of it.</p>
<p>And not only that. She was actually face to face with his Mistress.
Arcadia capitalized the word in her mind, because she knew the role such
women had played in history; knew their glamour and power. In fact, she
had often thought of being an all-powerful and glittering creature
herself, but somehow mistresses weren’t in fashion at the Foundation
just then and besides, her father probably wouldn’t let her, if it came
to that.</p>
<p>Of course, the Lady Callia didn’t quite come up to Arcadia’s notion
of the part. For one thing, she was rather plump, and didn’t look at all
wicked and dangerous. Just sort of faded and near-sighted. Her voice was
high, too, instead of throaty, and—</p>
<p>Callia said, “Would you like more tea, child?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have another cup, thank you, your grace,”—or was it your
highness?</p>
<p>Arcadia continued with a connoisseur’s condescension, “Those are
lovely pearls you are wearing, my lady.” (On the whole, “my lady” seemed
best.)</p>
<p>“Oh? Do you think so?” Callia seemed vaguely pleased. She removed
them and let them swing milkily to and fro. “Would you like them? You
can have them, if you like.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my— You really mean—” She found them in her hand, then,
repelling them mournfully, she said, “Father wouldn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t like the pearls? But they’re quite nice pearls.”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t like my taking them, I mean. You’re not supposed to take
expensive presents from other people, he says.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t? But … I mean, this was a present to me from Poo … from
the First Citizen. Was that wrong, do you suppose?”</p>
<p>Arcadia reddened. “I didn’t mean—”</p>
<p>But Callia had tired of the subject. She let the pearls slide to the
ground and said, “You were going to tell me about the Foundation. Please
do so right now.”</p>
<p>And Arcadia was suddenly at a loss. What does one say about a world
dull to tears? To her, the Foundation was a suburban town, a comfortable
house, the annoying necessities of education, the uninteresting
eternities of a quiet life. She said, uncertainly, “It’s just like you
view in the book-films, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do you view book-films? They give me such a headache when I try.
But do you know, I always love video stories about your Traders—such
big, savage men. It’s always so exciting. Is your friend, Mr. Munn, one
of them? He doesn’t seem nearly savage enough. Most of the Traders had
beards and big bass voices, and were so domineering with women—don’t you
think so?”</p>
<p>Arcadia smiled, glassily. “That’s just part of history, my lady. I
mean, when the Foundation was young, the Traders were the pioneers
pushing back the frontiers and bringing civilization to the rest of the
Galaxy. We learned all about that in school. But that time has passed.
We don’t have Traders anymore; just corporations and things.”</p>
<p>“Really? What a shame. Then what does Mr. Munn do? I mean, if he’s
not a Trader.”</p>
<p>“Uncle Homir’s a librarian.”</p>
<p>Callia put a hand to her lips and tittered. “You mean he takes care
of book-films. Oh, my! It seems like such a silly thing for a grown man
to do.”</p>
<p>“He’s a very good librarian, my lady. It is an occupation that is
very highly regarded at the Foundation.” She put down the little,
iridescent teacup upon the milky-metaled table surface.</p>
<p>Her hostess was all concern. “But my dear child. I’m sure I didn’t
mean to offend you. He must be a very intelligent man. I could see it in
his eyes as soon as I looked at him. They were so … so intelligent. And
he must be brave, too, to want to see the Mule’s palace.”</p>
<p>“Brave?” Arcadia’s internal awareness twitched. This was what she was
waiting for. Intrigue! Intrigue! With great indifference, she asked,
staring idly at her thumbtip: “Why must one be brave to wish to see the
Mule’s palace?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know?” Her eyes were round, and her voice sank. “There’s
a curse on it. When he died, the Mule directed that no one ever enter it
until the Empire of the Galaxy is established. Nobody on Kalgan would
dare even to enter the grounds.”</p>
<p>Arcadia absorbed that. “But that’s superstition—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” Callia was distressed. “Poochie always says that.
He says it’s useful to say it isn’t though, in order to maintain his
hold over the people. But I notice he’s never gone in himself. And
neither did Thallos, who was First Citizen before Poochie.” A thought
struck her and she was all curiosity again: “But why does Mr. Munn want
to see the palace?”</p>
<p>And it was here that Arcadia’s careful plan could be put into action.
She knew well from the books she had read that a ruler’s mistress was
the real power behind the throne, that she was the very wellspring of
influence. Therefore, if Uncle Homir failed with Lord Stettin—and she
was sure he would—she must retrieve that failure with Lady Callia. To be
sure, Lady Callia was something of a puzzle. She didn’t seem at all
bright. But, well, all history proved—</p>
<p>She said, “There’s a reason, my lady—but will you keep it in
confidence?”</p>
<p>“Cross my heart,” said Callia, making the appropriate gesture on the
soft, billowing whiteness of her breast.</p>
<p>Arcadia’s thoughts kept a sentence ahead of her words. “Uncle Homir
is a great authority on the Mule, you know. He’s written books and books
about it, and he thinks that all of Galactic history has been changed
since the Mule conquered the Foundation.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my.”</p>
<p>“He thinks the Seldon Plan—”</p>
<p>Callia clapped her hands. “I know about the Seldon Plan. The videos
about the Traders were always all about the Seldon Plan. It was supposed
to arrange to have the Foundation win all the time. Science had
something to do with it, though I could never quite see how. I always
get so restless when I have to listen to explanations. But you go right
ahead, my dear. It’s different when you explain. You make everything
seem so clear.”</p>
<p>Arcadia continued, “Well, don’t you see then, that when the
Foundation was defeated by the Mule, the Seldon Plan didn’t work and it
hasn’t worked since. So who will form the Second Empire?”</p>
<p>“The Second Empire?”</p>
<p>“Yes, one must be formed someday, but how? That’s the problem, you
see. And there’s the Second Foundation.”</p>
<p>“The Second Foundation?” She was quite completely lost.</p>
<p>“Yes, they’re the planners of history that are following in the
footsteps of Seldon. They stopped the Mule because he was premature, but
now, they may be supporting Kalgan.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because Kalgan may now offer the best chance of being the nucleus
for a new Empire.”</p>
<p>Dimly, Lady Callia seemed to grasp that. “You mean Poochie is going
to make a new Empire.”</p>
<p>“We can’t tell for sure. Uncle Homir thinks so, but he’ll have to see
the Mule’s records to find out.”</p>
<p>“It’s all very complicated,” said Lady Callia, doubtfully.</p>
<p>Arcadia gave up. She had done her best.</p>
<p>Lord Stettin was in a more or less savage humor. The session with the
milksop from the Foundation had been quite unrewarding. It had been
worse; it had been embarrassing. To be absolute ruler of twenty-seven
worlds, master of the Galaxy’s greatest military machine, owner of the
universe’s most vaulting ambition—and left to argue nonsense with an
antiquarian.</p>
<p>Damnation!</p>
<p>He was to violate the customs of Kalgan, was he? To allow the Mule’s
palace to be ransacked so that a fool could write another book? The
cause of science! The sacredness of knowledge! Great Galaxy! Were these
catchwords to be thrown in his face in all seriousness? Besides—and his
flesh prickled slightly—there was the matter of the curse. He didn’t
believe in it; no intelligent man could. But if he was going to defy it,
it would have to be for a better reason than any the fool had
advanced.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” he snapped, and Lady Callia cringed visibly in
the doorway.</p>
<p>“Are you busy?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am busy.”</p>
<p>“But there’s nobody here, Poochie. Couldn’t I even speak to you for a
minute?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Galaxy! What do you want? Now hurry.”</p>
<p>Her words stumbled. “The little girl told me they were going into the
Mule’s palace. I thought we could go with her. It must be gorgeous
inside.”</p>
<p>“She told you that, did she? Well, she isn’t and we aren’t. Now go
tend your own business. I’ve had about enough of you.”</p>
<p>“But, Poochie, why not? Aren’t you going to let them? The little girl
said that you were going to make an Empire!”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what she said— What was that?” He strode to Callia and
caught her firmly above the elbow, so that his fingers sank deeply into
the soft flesh, “What did she tell you?”</p>
<p>“You’re hurting me. I can’t remember what she said, if you’re going
to look at me like that.”</p>
<p>He released her, and she stood there for a moment, rubbing vainly at
the red marks. She whimpered, “The little girl made me promise not to
tell.”</p>
<p>“That’s too bad. Tell me! Now!”</p>
<p>“Well, she said the Seldon Plan was changed and that there was
another Foundation somewheres that was arranging to have you make an
Empire. That’s all. She said Mr. Munn was a very important scientist and
that the Mule’s palace would have proof of all that. That’s every bit of
what she said. Are you angry?”</p>
<p>But Stettin did not answer. He left the room, hurriedly, with
Callia’s cowlike eyes staring mournfully after him. Two orders were sent
out over the official seal of the First Citizen before the hour was up.
One had the effect of sending five hundred ships of the line into space
on what were officially to be termed as “war games.” The other had the
effect of throwing a single man into confusion.</p>
<p>Homir Munn ceased his preparations to leave when that second order
reached him. It was, of course, official permission to enter the palace
of the Mule. He read and reread it, with anything but joy.</p>
<p>But Arcadia was delighted. She knew what had happened.</p>
<p>Or, at any rate, she thought she did.</p>
