<h4 id="section">30</h4>
<p>That evening Jenarr Leggen came to visit. It was after dinner and he
looked from Dors to Seldon several times, as though wondering what to
say. Neither offered to help him, but both waited patiently. He had not
impressed either of them as being a master of small talk.</p>
<p>Finally he said to Seldon, “I’ve come to see how you are.”</p>
<p>“Perfectly well,” said Seldon, “except that I’m a little sleepy.
Dr. Venabili tells me that the treatment will keep me tired for a few
days, presumably so I’m sure of getting needed rest.” He smiled.
“Frankly, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>Leggen breathed in deeply, let it out, hesitated, and then, almost as
though he was forcing the words out of himself, said, “I won’t keep you
long. I perfectly understand you need to rest. I do want to say, though,
that I am sorry it all happened. I should not have assumed—so
casually—that you had gone down by yourself. Since you were a tyro, I
should have felt more responsible for you. After all, I had agreed to
let you come up. I hope you can find it in your heart to … forgive me.
That’s really all I wish to say.”</p>
<p>Seldon yawned, putting his hand over his mouth. “Pardon me. —Since it
seems to have turned out well, there need be no hard feelings. In some
ways, it was not your fault. I should not have wandered away and,
besides, what happened was—”</p>
<p>Dors interrupted. “Now, Hari, please, no conversation. Just relax.
Now, I want to talk to Dr. Leggen just a bit before he goes. In the
first place, Dr. Leggen, I quite understand you are concerned about how
repercussions from this affair will affect you. I told you there would
be no follow-up if Dr. Seldon recovered without ill effects. That seems
to be taking place, so you may relax—for now. I would like to ask you
about something else and I hope that this time I will have your free
cooperation.”</p>
<p>“I will try, Dr. Venabili,” said Leggen stiffly.</p>
<p>“Did anything unusual happen during your stay Upperside?”</p>
<p>“You know it did. I lost Dr. Seldon, something for which I have just
apologized.”</p>
<p>“Obviously I’m not referring to that. Did anything else unusual
happen?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing. Nothing at all.”</p>
<p>Dors looked at Seldon and Seldon frowned. It seemed to him that Dors
was trying to check on his story and get an independent account. Did she
think he was imagining the search vessel? He would have liked to object
heatedly, but she had raised a quieting hand at him, as though she was
preventing that very eventuality. He subsided, partly because of this
and partly because he really wanted to sleep. He hoped that Leggen would
not stay long.</p>
<p>“Are you certain?” said Dors. “Were there no intrusions from
outside?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not. Oh—”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dr. Leggen?”</p>
<p>“There was a jet-down.”</p>
<p>“Did that strike you as peculiar?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“This sounds very much as though I’m being cross-examined,
Dr. Venabili. I don’t much like it.”</p>
<p>“I can appreciate that, Dr. Leggen, but these questions have
something to do with Dr. Seldon’s misadventure. It may be that this
whole affair is more complicated than I had thought.”</p>
<p>“In what way?” A new edge entered his voice. “Do you intend to raise
new questions, requiring new apologies? In that case, I may find it
necessary to withdraw.”</p>
<p>“Not, perhaps, before you explain how it is you do not find a
hovering jet-down a bit peculiar.”</p>
<p>“Because, my dear woman, a number of meteorological stations on
Trantor possess jet-downs for the direct study of clouds and the upper
atmosphere. Our own meteorological station does not.”</p>
<p>“Why not? It would be useful.”</p>
<p>“Of course. But we’re not competing and we’re not keeping secrets. We
will report on our findings; they will report on theirs. It makes sense,
therefore, to have a scattering of differences and specializations. It
would be foolish to duplicate efforts completely. The money and manpower
we might spend on jet-downs can be spent on mesonic refractometers,
while others will spend on the first and save on the latter. After all,
there may be a great deal of competitiveness and ill feeling among the
sectors, but science is one thing—the only thing—that holds us together.
You know that, I presume,” he added ironically.</p>
<p>“I do, but isn’t it rather coincidental that someone should be
sending a jet-down right to your station on the very day you were going
to use the station?”</p>
<p>“No coincidence at all. We announced that we were going to make
measurements on that day and, consequently, some other station thought,
very properly, that they might make simultaneous nephelometric
measurements—clouds, you know. The results, taken together, would make
more sense and be more useful than either taken separately.”</p>
<p>Seldon said suddenly in a rather blurred voice, “They were just
measuring, then?” He yawned again.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Leggen. “What else could they possibly be doing?”</p>
<p>Dors blinked her eyes, as she sometimes did when she was trying to
think rapidly. “That all makes sense. To which station did this
particular jet-down belong?”</p>
<p>Leggen shook his head. “Dr. Venabili, how can you possibly expect me
to tell?”</p>
<p>“I thought that each meteorological jet-down might possibly have its
station’s markings on it.”</p>
<p>“Surely, but I wasn’t looking up and studying it, you know. I had my
own work to do and I let them do theirs. When they report, I’ll know
whose jet-down it was.”</p>
<p>“What if they don’t report?”</p>
<p>“Then I would suppose their instruments failed. That happens
sometimes.” His right fist was clenched. “Is that all, then?”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Where do you suppose the jet-down might have come
from?”</p>
<p>“It might be any station with jet-downs. On a day’s notice—and they
got more than that—one of those vessels can reach us handily from
anyplace on the planet.”</p>
<p>“But who most likely?”</p>
<p>“Hard to say: Hestelonia, Wye, Ziggoreth, North Damiano. I’d say one
of these four was the most likely, but it might be any of forty others
at least.”</p>
<p>“Just one more question, then. Just one. Dr. Leggen, when you
announced that your group would be Upperside, did you by any chance say
that a mathematician, Dr. Hari Seldon, would be with you?”</p>
<p>A look of apparently deep and honest surprise crossed Leggen’s face,
a look that quickly turned contemptuous. “Why should I list names? Of
what interest would that be to anyone?”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Dors. “The truth of the matter, then, is that
Dr. Seldon saw the jet-down and it disturbed him. I am not certain why
and apparently his memory is a bit fuzzy on the matter. He more or less
ran away from the jet-down, got himself lost, didn’t think of trying to
return—or didn’t dare to—till it was well into twilight, and didn’t
quite make it back in the dark. You can’t be blamed for that, so let’s
forget the whole incident on both sides. Agreed?”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” said Leggen. “Good-bye!” He turned on his heel and
left.</p>
<p>When he was gone, Dors rose, pulled off Seldon’s slippers gently,
straightened him in his bed, and covered him. He was sleeping, of
course.</p>
<p>Then she sat down and thought. How much of what Leggen had said was
true and what might possibly exist under the cover of his words? She did
not know.</p>
<p>MYCOGEN—… A sector of ancient Trantor … Buried in the past of its own
legends, Mycogen made little impact on the planet. Self-satisfied and
self-separated to a degree …</p>
