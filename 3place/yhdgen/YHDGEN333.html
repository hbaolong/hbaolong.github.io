<h4 id="section">24</h4>
<p>The young man arrived at precisely 4 T.S.T. (Trantorian Standard
Time) and Seldon smiled. He loved punctual people. He placed his hands
on his desk and made ready to heave to his feet, but the young man said,
“Please, Professor, I know you have a bad leg. You needn’t stand
up.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Thank you, young man. However, that does not mean that
you cannot sit down. Please do.”</p>
<p>The young man removed his jacket and sat down.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You must forgive me … when we met and set up this
appointment, I neglected to learn your name—which is …?</p>
<p>“Stettin Palver,” said the young man.</p>
<p>“Ah. Palver! Palver! The name sounds familiar.”</p>
<p>“It should, Professor. My grandfather boasted frequently of having
known you.”</p>
<p>“Your grandfather. Of course. Joramis Palver. He was two years
younger than I was, as I recall. I tried to get him to join me in
psychohistory, but he refused. He said there was no chance of his ever
learning enough mathematics to make it possible. Too bad! How is
Joramis, by the way?”</p>
<p>Palver said solemnly, “I’m afraid that Joramis has gone the way of
old men generally. He’s dead.”</p>
<p>Seldon winced. Two years younger than he himself was—and dead. An old
friend and they had lost touch to such a degree that, when death came,
it did so unknowingly.</p>
<p>Seldon sat there for a while and finally muttered, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The young man shrugged. “He had a good life.”</p>
<p>“And you, young man, where did you have your schooling?”</p>
<p>“Langano University.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “Langano? Stop me if I’m wrong, but that’s not on
Trantor, is it?”</p>
<p>“No. I wanted to try a different world. The Universities on Trantor,
as you undoubtedly know very well, are all overcrowded. I wanted to find
a place where I could study in peace.”</p>
<p>“And what did you study?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much. History. Not the sort of thing that would lead one to
a good job.”</p>
<p>(Another wince, even worse than the first. Dors Venabili had been a
historian.) Seldon said, “But you’re back here on Trantor. Why is
that?”</p>
<p>“Credits. Jobs.”</p>
<p>“As an historian?”</p>
<p>Palver laughed. “Not a chance. I run a device that pulls and hauls.
Not exactly a professional occupation.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked at Palver with a twinge of envy. The contours of
Palver’s arms and chest were highlighted by the thin fabric of his
shirt. He was well muscled. Seldon had never himself been quite that
muscular.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I presume that when you were at the University, you
were on the boxing team.”</p>
<p>“Who, me? Never. I’m a Twister.”</p>
<p>“A Twister!” Seldon’s spirits jumped. “Are you from Helicon?”</p>
<p>Palver said with a certain contempt, “You don’t have to come from
Helicon to be a good Twister.”</p>
<p>No, thought Seldon, but that’s where the best ones come from.</p>
<p>However, he said nothing.</p>
<p>He did say, though, “Well, your grandfather would not join me. How
about you?”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory?”</p>
<p>“I heard you talking to the others when I first encountered you and
it seemed to me that you were talking quite intelligently about
psychohistory. Would you like to join me, then?”</p>
<p>“As I said, Professor, I have a job.”</p>
<p>“Pushing and hauling. Come, come.”</p>
<p>“It pays well.”</p>
<p>“Credits aren’t everything.”</p>
<p>“They’re quite a bit. Now you, on the other hand, can’t pay me much.
I’m quite certain that you’re short of credits.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>“I’m guessing, in a way, I suppose. —But am I wrong?”</p>
<p>Seldon’s lips pressed together hard, then he said, “No, you’re not
wrong and I can’t pay you much. I’m sorry. I suppose that ends our
little interview.”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, wait.” Palver held up his hands. “Not quite so fast,
please. We’re still talking about psychohistory. If I work for you, I
will be taught psychohistory, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“In that case, credits aren’t everything, after all. I’ll make you a
deal. You teach me all the psychohistory you can and you pay me whatever
you can and I’ll get by somehow. How about it?”</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” said Seldon joyously. “That sounds great. Now, one more
thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve been attacked twice in recent weeks. The first time my son
came to my defense, but he has since gone to Santanni. The second time I
made use of my lead-filled walking stick. It worked, but I was dragged
before a magistrate and accused of assault and battery—”</p>
<p>“Why the attacks?” interjected Palver.</p>
<p>“I am not popular. I have been preaching the Fall of the Empire for
so long that, now that it is coming, I am blamed for it.”</p>
<p>“I see. Now then, what does all that have to do with the one more
thing you mentioned?”</p>
<p>“I want you to be my bodyguard. You’re young, you’re strong, and,
most of all, you’re a Twister. You’re exactly what I need.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it can be managed,” Palver said with a smile.</p>
