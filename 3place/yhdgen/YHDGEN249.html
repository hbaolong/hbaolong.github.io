<h4 id="section">17</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon watched the raindrops form on the wrap-around windows of
the Imperial ground-car and a sense of nostalgia stabbed at him
unbearably.</p>
<p>It was only the second time in his eight years on Trantor that he had
been ordered to visit the Emperor in the only open land on the
planet—and both times the weather had been bad. The first time, shortly
after he had arrived on Trantor, the bad weather had merely irritated
him. He had found no novelty in it. His home world of Helicon had its
share of storms, after all, particularly in the area where he had been
brought up.</p>
<p>But now he had lived for eight years in make-believe weather, in
which storms consisted of computerized cloudiness at random intervals,
with regular light rains during the sleeping hours. Raging winds were
replaced by zephyrs and there were no extremes of heat and cold—merely
little changes that made you unzip the front of your shirt once in a
while or throw on a light jacket. And he had heard complaints about even
so mild a deviation.</p>
<p>But now Hari was seeing real rain coming down drearily from a cold
sky—and he had not seen such a thing in years—and he loved it; that was
the thing. It reminded him of Helicon, of his youth, of relatively
carefree days, and he wondered if he might persuade the driver to take
the long way to the Palace.</p>
<p>Impossible! The Emperor wanted to see him and it was a long enough
trip by ground-car, even if one went in a straight line with no
interfering traffic. The Emperor, of course, would not wait.</p>
<p>It was a different Cleon from the one Seldon had seen eight years
before. He had put on about ten pounds and there was a sulkiness about
his face. Yet the skin around his eyes and cheeks looked pinched and
Hari recognized the results of one too many microadjustments. In a way,
Seldon felt sorry for Cleon—for all his might and Imperial sway, the
Emperor was powerless against the passage of time.</p>
<p>Once again Cleon met Hari Seldon alone—in the same lavishly furnished
room of their first encounter. As was the custom, Seldon waited to be
addressed.</p>
<p>After briefly assessing Seldon’s appearance, the Emperor said in an
ordinary voice, “Glad to see you, Professor. Let us dispense with
formalities, as we did on the former occasion on which I met you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire,” said Seldon stiffly. It was not always safe to be
informal, merely because the Emperor ordered you to be so in an effusive
moment.</p>
<p>Cleon gestured imperceptibly and at once the room came alive with
automation as the table set itself and dishes began to appear. Seldon,
confused, could not follow the details.</p>
<p>The Emperor said casually, “You will dine with me, Seldon?”</p>
<p>It had the formal intonation of a question but the force, somehow, of
an order.</p>
<p>“I would be honored, Sire,” said Seldon. He looked around cautiously.
He knew very well that one did not (or, at any rate, should not) ask
questions of the Emperor, but he saw no way out of it. He said, rather
quietly, trying to make it not sound like a question, “The First
Minister will not dine with us?”</p>
<p>“He will not,” said Cleon. “He has other tasks at this moment and I
wish, in any case, to speak to you privately.”</p>
<p>They ate quietly for a while, Cleon gazing at him fixedly and Seldon
smiling tentatively. Cleon had no reputation for cruelty or even for
irresponsibility, but he could, in theory, have Seldon arrested on some
vague charge and, if the Emperor wished to exert his influence, the case
might never come to trial. It was always best to avoid notice and at the
moment Seldon couldn’t manage it.</p>
<p>Surely it had been worse eight years ago, when he had been brought to
the Palace under armed guard. —This fact did not make Seldon feel
relieved, however.</p>
<p>Then Cleon spoke. “Seldon,” he said. “The First Minister is of great
use to me, yet I feel that, at times, people may think I do not have a
mind of my own. Do you think that?”</p>
<p>“Never, Sire,” said Seldon calmly. No use protesting too much.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you. However, I do have a mind of my own and I
recall that when you first came to Trantor you had this psychohistory
thing you were playing with.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you also remember, Sire,” said Seldon softly, “that I
explained at the time it was a mathematical theory without practical
application.”</p>
<p>“So you said. Do you still say so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire.”</p>
<p>“Have you been working on it since?”</p>
<p>“On occasion I toy with it, but it comes to nothing. Chaos
unfortunately interferes and predictability is not—”</p>
<p>The Emperor interrupted. “There is a specific problem I wish you to
tackle. —Do help yourself to the dessert, Seldon. It is very good.”</p>
<p>“What is the problem, Sire?”</p>
<p>“This man Joranum. Demerzel tells me—oh, so politely—that I cannot
arrest this man and I cannot use armed force to crush his followers. He
says it will simply make the situation worse.”</p>
<p>“If the First Minister says so, I presume it is so.”</p>
<p>“But I do not want this man Joranum.… At any rate, I will not be his
puppet. Demerzel does nothing.”</p>
<p>“I am sure that he is doing what he can, Sire.”</p>
<p>“If he is working to alleviate the problem, he certainly is not
keeping me informed.”</p>
<p>“That may be, Sire, out of a natural desire to keep you above the
fray. The First Minister may feel that if Joranum should—if he
should—”</p>
<p>“Take over,” said Cleon with a tone of infinite distaste.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire. It would not be wise to have it appear that you were
personally opposed to him. You must remain untouched for the sake of the
stability of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“I would much rather assure the stability of the Empire without
Joranum. What do you suggest, Seldon?”</p>
<p>“I, Sire?”</p>
<p>“You, Seldon,” said Cleon impatiently. “Let me say that I don’t
believe you when you say that psychohistory is just a game. Demerzel
stays friendly with you. Do you think I am such an idiot as not to know
that? He expects something from you. He expects psychohistory from you
and since I am no fool, I expect it, too. —Seldon, are you for Joranum?
The truth!”</p>
<p>“No, Sire, I am not for him. I consider him an utter danger to the
Empire.”</p>
<p>“Very well, I believe you. You stopped a potential Joranumite riot at
your University grounds single-handedly, I understand.”</p>
<p>“It was pure impulse on my part, Sire.”</p>
<p>“Tell that to fools, not to me. You had worked it out by
psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“Sire!”</p>
<p>“Don’t protest. What are you doing about Joranum? You must be doing
something if you are on the side of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Sire,” said Seldon cautiously, uncertain as to how much the Emperor
knew. “I have sent my son to meet with Joranum in the Dahl Sector.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“My son is a Dahlite—and shrewd. He may discover something of use to
us.”</p>
<p>“May?”</p>
<p>“Only may, Sire.”</p>
<p>“You’ll keep me informed?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire.”</p>
<p>“And, Seldon, do not tell me that psychohistory is just a game, that
it does not exist. I do not want to hear that. I expect you to do
something about Joranum. What it might be, I can’t say, but you must do
something. I will not have it otherwise. You may go.”</p>
<p>Seldon returned to Streeling University in a far darker mood than
when he had left. Cleon had sounded as though he would not accept
failure.</p>
<p>It all depended on Raych now.</p>
