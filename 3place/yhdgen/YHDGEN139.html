<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>Suppressing a small yawn, Cleon said, “Demerzel, have you by any
chance ever heard of a man named Hari Seldon?”</p>
<p>Cleon had been Emperor for just over ten years and there were times
at state occasions when, dressed in the necessary robes and regalia, he
could manage to look stately. He did so, for instance, in the holograph
of himself that stood in the niche in the wall behind him. It was placed
so that it clearly dominated the other niches holding the holographs of
several of his ancestors.</p>
<p>The holograph was not a totally honest one, for though Cleon’s hair
was light brown in hologram and reality alike, it was a bit thicker in
the holograph. There was a certain asymmetry to his real face, for the
left side of his upper lip raised itself a bit higher than the right
side, and this was somehow not evident in the holograph. And if he had
stood up and placed himself beside the holograph, he would have been
seen to be 2 centimeters under the 1.83-meter height that the image
portrayed—and perhaps a bit stouter.</p>
<p>Of course, the holograph was the official coronation portrait and he
had been younger then. He still looked young and rather handsome, too,
and when he was not in the pitiless grip of official ceremony, there was
a kind of vague good nature about his face.</p>
<p>Demerzel said, with the tone of respect that he carefully cultivated,
“Hari Seldon? It is an unfamiliar name to me, Sire. Ought I to know of
him?”</p>
<p>“The Minister of Science mentioned him to me last night. I thought
you might.”</p>
<p>Demerzel frowned slightly, but only very slightly, for one does not
frown in the Imperial presence. “The Minister of Science, Sire, should
have spoken of this man to me as Chief of Staff. If you are to be
bombarded from every side—”</p>
<p>Cleon raised his hand and Demerzel stopped at once. “Please,
Demerzel, one can’t stand on formality at all times. When I passed the
Minister at last night’s reception and exchanged a few words with him,
he bubbled over. I could not refuse to listen and I was glad I had, for
it was interesting.”</p>
<p>“In what way interesting, Sire?”</p>
<p>“Well, these are not the old days when science and mathematics were
all the rage. That sort of thing seems to have died down somehow,
perhaps because all the discoveries have been made, don’t you think?
Apparently, however, interesting things can still happen. At least I was
told it was interesting.”</p>
<p>“By the Minister of Science, Sire?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He said that this Hari Seldon had attended a convention of
mathematicians held here in Trantor—they do this every ten years, for
some reason—and he said that he had proved that one could foretell the
future mathematically.”</p>
<p>Demerzel permitted himself a small smile. “Either the Minister of
Science, a man of little acumen, is mistaken or the mathematician is.
Surely, the matter of foretelling the future is a children’s dream of
magic.”</p>
<p>“Is it, Demerzel? People believe in such things.”</p>
<p>“People believe in many things, Sire.”</p>
<p>“But they believe in such things. Therefore, it doesn’t matter
whether the forecast of the future is true or not. If a mathematician
should predict a long and happy reign for me, a time of peace and
prosperity for the Empire— Eh, would that not be well?”</p>
<p>“It would be pleasant to hear, certainly, but what would it
accomplish, Sire?”</p>
<p>“But surely if people believe this, they would act on that belief.
Many a prophecy, by the mere force of its being believed, is transmuted
to fact. These are ‘self-fulfilling prophecies.’ Indeed, now that I
think of it, it was you who once explained this to me.”</p>
<p>Demerzel said, “I believe I did, Sire.” His eyes were watching the
Emperor carefully, as though to see how far he might go on his own.
“Still, if that be so, one could have any person make the prophecy.”</p>
<p>“Not all persons would be equally believed, Demerzel. A
mathematician, however, who could back his prophecy with mathematical
formulas and terminology, might be understood by no one and yet believed
by everyone.”</p>
<p>Demerzel said, “As usual, Sire, you make good sense. We live in
troubled times and it would be worthwhile to calm them in a way that
would require neither money nor military effort—which, in recent
history, have done little good and much harm.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Demerzel,” said the Emperor with excitement. “Reel in this
Hari Seldon. You tell me you have your strings stretching to every part
of this turbulent world, even where my forces dare not go. Pull on one
of those strings, then, and bring in this mathematician. Let me see
him.”</p>
<p>“I will do so, Sire,” said Demerzel, who had already located Seldon
and who made a mental note to commend the Minister of Science for a job
well done.</p>
