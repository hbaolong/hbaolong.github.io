<h4 id="section">43</h4>
<p>Seldon passed a restless night. To begin with, Dors had announced
that she must accompany him on the tour of the microfarm and he had
objected strenuously.</p>
<p>“The whole purpose,” he said, “is to make her talk freely, to present
her with an unusual environment—alone with a male, even if a tribesman.
Having broken custom so far, it will be easier to break it further. If
you’re along, she will talk to you and I will only get the
leavings.”</p>
<p>“And if something happens to you in my absence, as it did
Upperside?”</p>
<p>“Nothing will happen. Please! If you want to help me, stay away. If
not, I will have nothing further to do with you. I mean it, Dors. This
is important to me. Much as I’ve grown fond of you, you cannot come
ahead of this.”</p>
<p>She agreed with enormous reluctance and said only, “Promise me you’ll
at least be nice to her, then.”</p>
<p>And Seldon said, “Is it me you must protect or her? I assure you that
I didn’t treat her harshly for pleasure and I won’t do so in the
future.”</p>
<p>The memory of this argument with Dors—their first—helped keep him
awake a large part of the night; that, together with the nagging thought
that the two Sisters might not arrive in the morning, despite Raindrop
Forty-Three’s promise.</p>
<p>They did arrive, however, not long after Seldon had completed a spare
breakfast (he was determined not to grow fat through overindulgence) and
had put on a kirtle that fitted him precisely. He had carefully
organized the belt so that it hung perfectly.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three, still with a touch of ice in her eye, said, “If
you are ready, Tribesman Seldon, my sister will remain with Tribeswoman
Venabili.” Her voice was neither twittery nor hoarse. It was as though
she had steadied herself through the night, practicing, in her mind, how
to speak to one who was a male but not a Brother.</p>
<p>Seldon wondered if she had lost sleep and said, “I am quite
ready.”</p>
<p>Together, half an hour later, Raindrop Forty-Three and Hari Seldon
were descending level upon level. Though it was daytime by the clock,
the light was dusky and dimmer than it had been elsewhere on
Trantor.</p>
<p>There was no obvious reason for this. Surely, the artificial daylight
that slowly progressed around the Trantorian sphere could include the
Mycogen Sector. The Mycogenians must want it that way, Seldon thought,
clinging to some primitive habit. Slowly Seldon’s eyes adjusted to the
dim surroundings.</p>
<p>Seldon tried to meet the eyes of passersby, whether Brothers or
Sisters, calmly. He assumed he and Raindrop Forty-Three would be taken
as a Brother and his woman and that they would be given no notice as
long as he did nothing to attract attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seemed as if Raindrop Forty-Three wanted to be
noticed. She talked to him in few words and in low tones out of a
clenched mouth. It was clear that the company of an unauthorized male,
even though only she knew this fact, ravaged her self-confidence. Seldon
was quite sure that if he asked her to relax, he would merely make her
that much more uneasy. (Seldon wondered what she would do if she met
someone who knew her. He felt more relaxed once they reached the lower
levels, where human beings were fewer.)</p>
<p>The descent was not by elevators either, but by moving staired ramps
that existed in pairs, one going up and one going down. Raindrop
Forty-Three referred to them as “escalators.” Seldon wasn’t sure he had
caught the word correctly, never having heard it before.</p>
<p>As they sank to lower and lower levels, Seldon’s apprehension grew.
Most worlds possessed microfarms and most worlds produced their own
varieties of microproducts. Seldon, back on Helicon, had occasionally
shopped for seasonings in the microfarms and was always aware of an
unpleasant stomach-turning stench.</p>
<p>The people who worked at the microfarms didn’t seem to mind. Even
when casual visitors wrinkled their noses, they seemed to acclimate
themselves to it. Seldon, however, was always peculiarly susceptible to
the smell. He suffered and he expected to suffer now. He tried soothing
himself with the thought that he was nobly sacrificing his comfort to
his need for information, but that didn’t keep his stomach from turning
itself into knots in apprehension.</p>
<p>After he had lost track of the number of levels they had descended,
with the air still seeming reasonably fresh, he asked, “When do we get
to the microfarm levels?”</p>
<p>“We’re there now.”</p>
<p>Seldon breathed deeply. “It doesn’t smell as though we are.”</p>
<p>“Smell? What do you mean?” Raindrop Forty-Three was offended enough
to speak quite loudly.</p>
<p>“There was always a putrid odor associated with microfarms, in my
experience. You know, from the fertilizer that bacteria, yeast, fungi,
and saprophytes generally need.”</p>
<p>“In your experience?” Her voice lowered again. “Where was that?”</p>
<p>“On my home world.”</p>
<p>The Sister twisted her face into wild repugnance. “And your people
wallow in gabelle?”</p>
<p>Seldon had never heard the word before, but from the look and the
intonation, he knew what it meant.</p>
<p>He said, “It doesn’t smell like that, you understand, once it is
ready for consumption.”</p>
<p>“Ours doesn’t smell like that at any time. Our biotechnicians have
worked out perfect strains. The algae grow in the purest light and the
most carefully balanced electrolyte solutions. The saprophytes are fed
on beautifully combined organics. The formulas and recipes are something
no tribespeople will ever know. —Come on, here we are. Sniff all you
want. You’ll find nothing offensive. That is one reason why our food is
in demand throughout the Galaxy and why the Emperor, we are told, eats
nothing else, though it is far too good for a tribesman if you ask me,
even if he calls himself Emperor.”</p>
<p>She said it with an anger that seemed directly aimed at Seldon. Then,
as though afraid he might miss that, she added, “Or even if he calls
himself an honored guest.”</p>
<p>They stepped out into a narrow corridor, on each side of which were
large thick glass tanks in which roiled cloudy green water full of
swirling, growing algae, moving about through the force of the gas
bubbles that streamed up through it. They would be rich in carbon
dioxide, he decided.</p>
<p>Rich, rosy light shone down into the tanks, light that was much
brighter than that in the corridors. He commented thoughtfully on
that.</p>
<p>“Of course,” she said. “These algae work best at the red end of the
spectrum.”</p>
<p>“I presume,” said Seldon, “that everything is automated.”</p>
<p>She shrugged, but did not respond.</p>
<p>“I don’t see quantities of Brothers and Sisters in evidence,” Seldon
said, persisting.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, there is work to be done and they do it, even if you
don’t see them at work. The details are not for you. Don’t waste your
time by asking about it.”</p>
<p>“Wait. Don’t be angry with me. I don’t expect to be told state
secrets. Come on, dear.” (The word slipped out.)</p>
<p>He took her arm as she seemed on the point of hurrying away. She
remained in place, but he felt her shudder slightly and he released her
in embarrassment.</p>
<p>He said, “It’s just that it seems automated.”</p>
<p>“Make what you wish of the seeming. Nevertheless, there is room here
for human brains and human judgment. Every Brother and Sister has
occasion to work here at some time. Some make a profession of it.”</p>
<p>She was speaking more freely now but, to his continuing
embarrassment, he noticed her left hand move stealthily toward her right
arm and gently rub the spot where he had touched her, as though he had
stung her.</p>
<p>“It goes on for kilometers and kilometers,” she said, “but if we turn
here there’ll be a portion of the fungal section you can see.”</p>
<p>They moved along. Seldon noted how clean everything was. The glass
sparkled. The tiled floor seemed moist, though when he seized a moment
to bend and touch it, it wasn’t. Nor was it slippery—unless his sandals
(with his big toe protruding in approved Mycogenian fashion) had nonslip
soles.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three was right in one respect. Here and there a
Brother or a Sister worked silently, studying gauges, adjusting
controls, sometimes engaged in something as unskilled as polishing
equipment—always absorbed in whatever they were doing.</p>
<p>Seldon was careful not to ask what they were doing, since he did not
want to cause the Sister humiliation in having to answer that she did
not know or anger in her having to remind him there were things he must
not know.</p>
<p>They passed through a lightly swinging door and Seldon suddenly
noticed the faintest touch of the odor he remembered. He looked at
Raindrop Forty-Three, but she seemed unconscious of it and soon he too
became used to it.</p>
<p>The character of the light changed suddenly. The rosiness was gone
and the brightness too. All seemed to be in a twilight except where
equipment was spotlighted and wherever there was a spotlight there
seemed to be a Brother or a Sister. Some wore lighted headbands that
gleamed with a pearly glow and, in the middle distance, Seldon could
see, here and there, small sparks of light moving erratically.</p>
<p>As they walked, he cast a quick eye on her profile. It was all he
could really judge by. At all other times, he could not cease being
conscious of her bulging bald head, her bare eyes, her colorless face.
They drowned her individuality and seemed to make her invisible. Here in
profile, however, he could see something. Nose, chin, full lips,
regularity, beauty. The dim light somehow smoothed out and softened the
great upper desert.</p>
<p>He thought with surprise: She could be very beautiful if she grew her
hair and arranged it nicely.</p>
<p>And then he thought that she couldn’t grow her hair. She would be
bald her whole life.</p>
<p>Why? Why did they have to do that to her? Sunmaster said it was so
that a Mycogenian would know himself (or herself) for a Mycogenian all
his (or her) life. Why was that so important that the curse of
hairlessness had to be accepted as a badge or mark of identity?</p>
<p>And then, because he was used to arguing both sides in his mind, he
thought: Custom is second nature. Be accustomed to a bald head,
sufficiently accustomed, and hair on it would seem monstrous, would
evoke nausea. He himself had shaved his face every morning, removing all
the facial hair, uncomfortable at the merest stubble, and yet he did not
think of his face as bald or as being in any way unnatural. Of course,
he could grow his facial hair at any time he wished—but he didn’t wish
to do so.</p>
<p>He knew that there were worlds on which the men did not shave; in
some, they did not even clip or shape the facial hair but let it grow
wild. What would they say if they could see his own bald face, his own
hairless chin, cheek, and lips?</p>
<p>And meanwhile, he walked with Raindrop Forty-Three—endlessly, it
seemed—and every once in a while she guided him by the elbow and it
seemed to him that she had grown accustomed to that, for she did not
withdraw her hand hastily. Sometimes it remained for nearly a
minute.</p>
<p>She said, “Here! Come here!”</p>
<p>“What is that?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>They were standing before a small tray filled with little spheres,
each about two centimeters in diameter. A Brother who was tending the
area and who had just placed the tray where it was looked up in mild
inquiry.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three said to Seldon in a low voice, “Ask for a
few.”</p>
<p>Seldon realized she could not speak to a Brother until spoken to and
said uncertainly, “May we have a few, B-brother?”</p>
<p>“Have a handful, Brother,” said the other heartily.</p>
<p>Seldon plucked out one of the spheres and was on the point of handing
it to Raindrop Forty-Three when he noticed that she had accepted the
invitation as applying to herself and reached in for two handfuls.</p>
<p>The sphere felt glossy, smooth. Seldon said to Raindrop Forty-Three
as they moved away from the vat and from the Brother who was in
attendance, “Are these supposed to be eaten?” He lifted the sphere
cautiously to his nose.</p>
<p>“They don’t smell,” she said sharply.</p>
<p>“What are they?”</p>
<p>“Dainties. Raw dainties. For the outside market they’re flavored in
different ways, but here in Mycogen we eat them unflavored—the only
way.”</p>
<p>She put one in her mouth and said, “I never have enough.”</p>
<p>Seldon put his sphere into his mouth and felt it dissolve and
disappear rapidly. His mouth, for a moment, ran liquid and then it slid,
almost of its own accord, down his throat.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment, amazed. It was slightly sweet and, for that
matter, had an even fainter bitter aftertaste, but the main sensation
eluded him.</p>
<p>“May I have another?” he said.</p>
<p>“Have half a dozen,” said Raindrop Forty-Three, holding out her hand.
“They never have quite the same taste twice and have practically no
calories. Just taste.”</p>
<p>She was right. He tried to have the dainty linger in his mouth; he
tried licking it carefully; tried biting off a piece. However, the most
careful lick destroyed it. When a bit was crunched off a piece, the rest
of it disappeared at once. And each taste was undefinable and not quite
like the one before.</p>
<p>“The only trouble is,” said the Sister happily, “that every once in a
while you have a very unusual one and you never forget it, but you never
have it again either. I had one when I was nine—” Her expression
suddenly lost its excitement and she said, “It’s a good thing. It
teaches you the evanescence of things of the world.”</p>
<p>It was a signal, Seldon thought. They had wandered about aimlessly
long enough. She had grown used to him and was talking to him. And now
the conversation had to come to its point. Now!</p>
