<p>THE NATURE OF EARTH</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Trevize felt almost drugged, and wondered how much time had
elapsed.</p>
<p>Beside him lay Mitza Lizalor, Minister of Transportation. She was on
her stomach, head to one side, mouth open, snoring distinctly. Trevize
was relieved that she was asleep. Once she woke up, he hoped she would
be quite aware that she had been asleep.</p>
<p>Trevize longed to sleep himself, but he felt it important that he not
do so. She must not wake to find him asleep. She must realize that while
she had been ground down to unconsciousness, he had endured. She would
expect such endurance from a Foundation-reared immoralist and, at this
point, it was better she not be disappointed.</p>
<p>In a way, he had done well. He had guessed, correctly, that Lizalor,
given her physical size and strength, her political power, her contempt
for the Comporellian men she had encountered, her mingled horror and
fascination with tales (what had she heard? Trevize wondered) of the
sexual feats of the decadents of Terminus, would want to be dominated.
She might even expect to be, without being able to express her desire
and expectation.</p>
<p>He had acted on that belief and, to his good fortune, found he was
correct. (Trevize, the ever-right, he mocked himself.) It pleased the
woman and it enabled Trevize to steer activities in a direction that
would tend to wear her out while leaving himself relatively
untouched.</p>
<p>It had not been easy. She had a marvelous body (forty-six, she had
said, but it would not have shamed a twenty-five-year-old athlete) and
enormous stamina—a stamina exceeded only by the careless zest with which
she had spent it.</p>
<p>Indeed, if she could be tamed and taught moderation; if practice (but
could he himself survive the practice?) brought her to a better sense of
her own capacities, and, even more important, his, it might be pleasant
to—</p>
<p>The snoring stopped suddenly and she stirred. He placed his hand on
the shoulder nearest him and stroked it lightly—and her eyes opened.
Trevize was leaning on his elbow, and did his best to look unworn and
full of life.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you were sleeping, dear,” he said. “You needed your
rest.”</p>
<p>She smiled at him sleepily and, for one queasy moment, Trevize
thought she might suggest renewed activity, but she merely heaved
herself about till she was resting on her back. She said, in a soft and
satisfied voice, “I had you judged correctly from the start. You are a
king of sexuality.”</p>
<p>Trevize tried to look modest. “I must be more moderate.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. You were just right. I was afraid that you had been kept
active and drained by that young woman, but you assured me you had not.
That is true, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Have I acted like someone who was half-sated to begin with?”</p>
<p>“No, you did not,” and her laughter boomed.</p>
<p>“Are you still thinking of Psychic Probes?”</p>
<p>She laughed again. “Are you mad? Would I want to lose you now?”</p>
<p>“Yet it would be better if you lost me temporarily—”</p>
<p>“What!” She frowned.</p>
<p>“If I were to stay here permanently, my—my dear, how long would it be
before eyes would begin to watch, and mouths would begin to whisper? If
I went off on my mission, however, I would naturally return periodically
to report, and it would then be only natural that we should be closeted
together for a while—and my mission is important.”</p>
<p>She thought about that, scratching idly at her right hip. Then she
said, “I suppose you’re right. I hate the thought but—I suppose you’re
right.”</p>
<p>“And you need not think I would not come back,” said Trevize. “I am
not so witless as to forget what I would have waiting for me here.”</p>
<p>She smiled at him, touched his cheek gently, and said, looking into
his eyes, “Did you find it pleasant, love?”</p>
<p>“Much more than pleasant, dear.”</p>
<p>“Yet you are a Foundationer. A man in the prime of youth from
Terminus itself. You must be accustomed to all sorts of women with all
sorts of skills—”</p>
<p>“I have encountered nothing—nothing—in the least like you,” said
Trevize, with a forcefulness that came easily to someone who was but
telling the truth, after all.</p>
<p>Lizalor said complacently, “Well, if you say so. Still, old habits
die hard, you know, and I don’t think I could bring myself to trust a
man’s word without some sort of surety. You and your friend, Pelorat,
might conceivably go on this mission of yours once I hear about it and
approve, but I will keep the young woman here. She will be well treated,
never fear, but I presume your Dr. Pelorat will want her, and he will
see to it that there are frequent returns to Comporellon, even if your
enthusiasm for this mission might tempt you to stay away too long.”</p>
<p>“But, Lizalor, that’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?” Suspicion at once seeped into her eyes. “Why impossible?
For what purpose would you need the woman?”</p>
<p>“Not for sex. I told you that, and I told you truthfully. She is
Pelorat’s and I have no interest in her. Besides, I’m sure she’d break
in two if she attempted what you so triumphantly carried through.”</p>
<p>Lizalor almost smiled, but repressed it and said severely, “What is
it to you, then, if she remains on Comporellon?”</p>
<p>“Because she is of essential importance to our mission. That is why
we must have her.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, what is your mission? It is time you told me.”</p>
<p>Trevize hesitated very briefly. It would have to be the truth. He
could think of no lie as effective.</p>
<p>“Listen to me,” he said. “Comporellon may be an old world, even among
the oldest, but it can’t be the oldest. Human life did not originate
here. The earliest human beings reached here from some other world, and
perhaps human life didn’t originate there either, but came from still
another and still older world. Eventually, though, those probings back
into time must stop, and we must reach the first world, the world of
human origins. I am seeking Earth.”</p>
<p>The change that suddenly came over Mitza Lizalor staggered him.</p>
<p>Her eyes had widened, her breathing took on a sudden urgency, and
every muscle seemed to stiffen as she lay there in bed. Her arms shot
upward rigidly, and the first two fingers of both hands crossed.</p>
<p>“You named it,” she whispered hoarsely.</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>She didn’t say anything after that; she didn’t look at him. Her arms
slowly came down, her legs swung over the side of the bed, and she sat
up, back to him. Trevize lay where he was, frozen.</p>
<p>He could hear, in memory, the words of Munn Li Compor, as they stood
there in the empty tourist center at Sayshell. He could hear him saying
of his own ancestral planet—the one that Trevize was on now—“They’re
superstitious about it. Every time they mention the word, they lift up
both hands with first and second fingers crossed to ward off
misfortune.”</p>
<p>How useless to remember after the fact.</p>
<p>“What should I have said, Mitza?” he muttered.</p>
<p>She shook her head slightly, stood up, stalked toward and then
through a door. It closed behind her and, after a moment, there was the
sound of water running.</p>
<p>He had no recourse but to wait, bare, undignified, wondering whether
to join her in the shower, and then quite certain he had better not. And
because, in a way, he felt the shower denied him, he at once experienced
a growing need for one.</p>
<p>She emerged at last and silently began to select clothing.</p>
<p>He said, “Do you mind if I—”</p>
<p>She said nothing, and he took silence for consent. He tried to stride
into the room in a strong and masculine way but he felt uncommonly as he
had in those days when his mother, offended by some misbehavior on his
part, offered him no punishment but silence, causing him to shrivel in
discomfort.</p>
<p>He looked about inside the smoothly walled cubicle that was
bare—completely bare. He looked more minutely. —There was nothing.</p>
<p>He opened the door again, thrust his head out, and said, “Listen, how
are you supposed to start the shower?”</p>
<p>She put down the deodorant (at least, Trevize guessed that was its
function), strode to the shower-room and, still without looking at him,
pointed. Trevize followed the finger and noted a spot on the wall that
was round and faintly pink, barely colored, as though the designer
resented having to spoil the starkness of the white, for no reason more
important than to give a hint of function.</p>
<p>Trevize shrugged lightly, leaned toward the wall, and touched the
spot. Presumably that was what one had to do, for in a moment a deluge
of fine-sprayed water struck him from every direction. Gasping, he
touched the spot again and it stopped.</p>
<p>He opened the door, knowing he looked several degrees more
undignified still as he shivered hard enough to make it difficult to
articulate words. He croaked, “How do you get hot water?”</p>
<p>Now she looked at him and, apparently, his appearance overcame her
anger (or fear, or whatever emotion was victimizing her) for she
snickered and then, without warning, boomed her laughter at him.</p>
<p>“What hot water?” she said. “Do you think we’re going to waste the
energy to heat water for washing? That’s good mild water you had, water
with the chill taken off. What more do you want? You sludge-soft
Terminians! —Get back in there and wash!”</p>
<p>Trevize hesitated, but not for long, since it was clear he had no
choice in the matter.</p>
<p>With remarkable reluctance he touched the pink spot again and this
time steeled his body for the icy spray. Mild water? He found suds
forming on his body and he rubbed hastily here, there, everywhere,
judging it to be the wash cycle and suspecting it would not last
long.</p>
<p>Then came the rinse cycle. Ah, warm— Well, perhaps not warm, but not
quite as cold, and definitely feeling warm to his thoroughly chilled
body. Then, even as he was considering touching the contact spot again
to stop the water, and was wondering how Lizalor had come out dry when
there was absolutely no towel or towel-substitute in the place—the water
stopped. It was followed by a blast of air that would have certainly
bowled him over if it had not come from various directions equally.</p>
<p>It was hot; almost too hot. It took far less energy, Trevize knew, to
heat air than to heat water. The hot air steamed the water off him and,
in a few minutes, he was able to step out as dry as though he had never
encountered water in his life.</p>
<p>Lizalor seemed to have recovered completely. “Do you feel well?”</p>
<p>“Pretty well,” said Trevize. Actually, he felt astonishingly
comfortable. “All I had to do was prepare myself for the temperature.
You didn’t tell me—”</p>
<p>“Sludge-soft,” said Lizalor, with mild contempt.</p>
<p>He borrowed her deodorant, then began to dress, conscious of the fact
that she had fresh underwear and he did not. He said, “What should I
have called—that world?”</p>
<p>She said, “We refer to it as the Oldest.”</p>
<p>He said, “How was I to know the name I used was forbidden? Did you
tell me?”</p>
<p>“Did you ask?”</p>
<p>“How was I to know to ask?”</p>
<p>“You know now.”</p>
<p>“I’m bound to forget.”</p>
<p>“You had better not.”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?” Trevize felt his temper rising. “It’s just a
word, a sound.”</p>
<p>Lizalor said darkly, “There are words one doesn’t say. Do you say
every word you know under all circumstances?”</p>
<p>“Some words are vulgar, some are inappropriate, some under particular
circumstances would be hurtful. Which is—that word I used?”</p>
<p>Lizalor said, “It’s a sad word, a solemn word. It represents a world
that was ancestor to us all and that now doesn’t exist. It’s tragic, and
we feel it because it was near to us. We prefer not to speak of it or,
if we must, not to use its name.”</p>
<p>“And the crossing of fingers at me? How does that relieve the hurt
and sadness?”</p>
<p>Lizalor’s face flushed. “That was an automatic reaction, and I don’t
thank you for forcing it on me. There are people who believe that the
word, even the thought, brings on misfortune—and that is how they ward
it off.”</p>
<p>“Do you, too, believe crossing fingers wards off misfortune?”</p>
<p>“No. —Well, yes, in a way. It makes me uneasy if I don’t do it.” She
didn’t look at him. Then, as though eager to shift the subject, she said
quickly, “And how is that black-haired woman of yours of the essence
with respect to your mission to reach—that world you mentioned.”</p>
<p>“Say ‘the Oldest.’ Or would you rather not even say that?”</p>
<p>“I would rather not discuss it at all, but I asked you a
question.”</p>
<p>“I believe that her people reached their present world as emigrants
from the Oldest.”</p>
<p>“As we did,” said Lizalor proudly.</p>
<p>“But her people have traditions of some sort which she says are the
key to understanding the Oldest, but only if we reach it and can study
its records.”</p>
<p>“She is lying.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but we must check it out.”</p>
<p>“If you have this woman with her problematical knowledge, and if you
want to reach the Oldest with her, why did you come to Comporellon?”</p>
<p>“To find the location of the Oldest. I had a friend once, who, like
myself, was a Foundationer. He, however, was descended from Comporellian
ancestors and he assured me that much of the history of the Oldest was
well known on Comporellon.”</p>
<p>“Did he indeed? And did he tell you any of its history?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize, reaching for the truth again. “He said that the
Oldest was a dead world, entirely radioactive. He did not know why, but
he thought that it might be the result of nuclear explosions. In a war,
perhaps.”</p>
<p>“No!” said Lizalor explosively.</p>
<p>“No, there was no war? Or no, the Oldest is not radioactive?”</p>
<p>“It is radioactive, but there was no war.”</p>
<p>“Then how did it become radioactive? It could not have been
radioactive to begin with since human life began on the Oldest. There
would have been no life on it ever.”</p>
<p>Lizalor seemed to hesitate. She stood erect, and was breathing
deeply, almost gasping. She said, “It was a punishment. It was a world
that used robots. Do you know what robots are?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“They had robots and for that they were punished. Every world that
has had robots has been punished and no longer exists.”</p>
<p>“Who punished them, Lizalor?”</p>
<p>“He Who Punishes. The forces of history. I don’t know.” She looked
away from him, uncomfortable, then said, in a lower voice, “Ask
others.”</p>
<p>“I would like to, but whom do I ask? Are there those on Comporellon
who have studied primeval history?”</p>
<p>“There are. They are not popular with us—with the average
Comporellian—but the Foundation, your Foundation, insists on
intellectual freedom, as they call it.”</p>
<p>“Not a bad insistence, in my opinion,” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“All is bad that is imposed from without,” said Lizalor.</p>
<p>Trevize shrugged. There was no purpose in arguing the matter. He
said, “My friend, Dr. Pelorat, is himself a primeval historian of a
sort. He would, I am sure, like to meet his Comporellian colleagues. Can
you arrange that, Lizalor?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “There is a historian named Vasil Deniador, who is based
at the University here in the city. He does not teach class, but he may
be able to tell you what you want to know.”</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t he teach class?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that he is forbidden; it’s just that students do not elect
his course.”</p>
<p>“I presume,” said Trevize, trying not to say it sardonically, “that
the students are encouraged not to elect it.”</p>
<p>“Why should they want to? He is a Skeptic. We have them, you know.
There are always individuals who pit their minds against the general
modes of thought and who are arrogant enough to feel that they alone are
right and that the many are wrong.”</p>
<p>“Might it not be that that could actually be so in some cases?”</p>
<p>“Never!” snapped Lizalor, with a firmness of belief that made it
quite clear that no further discussion in that direction would be of any
use. “And for all his Skepticism, he will be forced to tell you exactly
what any Comporellian would tell you.”</p>
<p>“And that is?”</p>
<p>“That if you search for the Oldest, you will not find it.”</p>
<ol start="24" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In the private quarters assigned them, Pelorat listened to Trevize
thoughtfully, his long solemn face expressionless, then said, “Vasil
Deniador? I do not recall having heard of him, but it may be that back
on the ship I will find papers by him in my library.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you haven’t heard of him? Think!” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall, at the moment, having heard of him,” said Pelorat
cautiously, “but after all, my dear chap, there must be hundreds of
estimable scholars I haven’t heard of; or have, but can’t remember.”</p>
<p>“Still, he can’t be first-class, or you would have heard of him.”</p>
<p>“The study of Earth—”</p>
<p>“Practice saying ‘the Oldest,’ Janov. It would complicate matters
otherwise.”</p>
<p>“The study of the Oldest,” said Pelorat, “is not a well-rewarded
niche in the corridors of learning, so that first-class scholars, even
in the field of primeval history, would not tend to find their way
there. Or, if we put it the other way around, those who are already
there do not make enough of a name for themselves in an uninterested
world to be considered first-class, even if they were. —I am not
first-class in anyone’s estimation, I am sure.”</p>
<p>Bliss said tenderly, “In mine, Pel.”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly in yours, my dear,” said Pelorat, smiling slightly,
“but you are not judging me in my capacity as scholar.”</p>
<p>It was almost night now, going by the clock, and Trevize felt himself
grow slightly impatient, as he always did when Bliss and Pelorat traded
endearments.</p>
<p>He said, “I’ll try to arrange our seeing this Deniador tomorrow, but
if he knows as little about the matter as the Minister does, we’re not
going to be much better off than we are now.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “He may be able to lead us to someone more useful.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it. This world’s attitude toward Earth—but I had better
practice speaking of it elliptically, too. This world’s attitude toward
the Oldest is a foolish and superstitious one.” He turned away. “But
it’s been a rough day and we ought to think of an evening meal—if we can
face their uninspired cookery—and then begin thinking of getting some
sleep. Have you two learned how to use the shower?”</p>
<p>“My dear fellow,” said Pelorat, “we have been very kindly treated.
We’ve received all sorts of instructions, most of which we didn’t
need.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Listen, Trevize. What about the ship?”</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>“Is the Comporellian government confiscating it?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think they will.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Very pleasant. Why aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“Because I persuaded the Minister to change her mind.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Astonishing. She didn’t seem a particularly
persuadable individual to me.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “I don’t know. It was clear from the texture of her mind
that she was attracted to Trevize.”</p>
<p>Trevize looked at Bliss with sudden exasperation. “Did you do that,
Bliss?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Trevize?”</p>
<p>“I mean tamper with her—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t tamper. However, when I noted that she was attracted to
you, I couldn’t resist just snapping an inhibition or two. It was a very
small thing to do. Those inhibitions might have snapped anyway, and it
seemed to be important to make certain that she was filled with good
will toward you.”</p>
<p>“Good will? It was more than that! She softened, yes, but
post-coitally.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “Surely you don’t mean, old man—”</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Trevize testily. “She may be past her first youth,
but she knew the art well. She was no beginner, I assure you. Nor will I
play the gentleman and lie on her behalf. It was her idea—thanks to
Bliss’s fiddling with her inhibitions—and I was not in a position to
refuse, even if that thought had occurred to me, which it didn’t. —Come,
Janov, don’t stand there looking puritanical. It’s been months since
I’ve had an opportunity. You’ve—” And he waved his hand vaguely in
Bliss’s direction.</p>
<p>“Believe me, Golan,” said Pelorat, embarrassed, “if you are
interpreting my expression as puritanical, you mistake me. I have no
objection.”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “But she is puritanical. I meant to make her warm toward
you; I did not count on a sexual paroxysm.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “But that is exactly what you brought on, my little
interfering Bliss. It may be necessary for the Minister to play the
puritan in public, but if so, that seems merely to stoke the fires.”</p>
<p>“And so, provided you scratch the itch, she will betray the
Foundation—”</p>
<p>“She would have done that in any case,” said Trevize. “She wanted the
ship—” He broke off, and said in a whisper, “Are we being
overheard?”</p>
<p>Bliss said, “No!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“It is certain. It is impossible to impinge upon the mind of Gaia in
any unauthorized fashion without Gaia being aware of it.”</p>
<p>“In that case, Comporellon wants the ship for itself—a valuable
addition to its fleet.”</p>
<p>“Surely, the Foundation would not allow that.”</p>
<p>“Comporellon does not intend to have the Foundation know.”</p>
<p>Bliss sighed. “There are your Isolates. The Minister intends to
betray the Foundation on behalf of Comporellon and, in return for sex,
will promptly betray Comporellon, too. —And as for Trevize, he will
gladly sell his body’s services as a way of inducing the betrayal. What
anarchy there is in this Galaxy of yours. What chaos.”</p>
<p>Trevize said coldly, “You are wrong, young woman—”</p>
<p>“In what I have just said, I am not a young woman, I am Gaia. I am
all of Gaia.”</p>
<p>“Then you are wrong, Gaia. I did not sell my body’s services. I gave
them gladly. I enjoyed it and did no one harm. As for the consequences,
they turned out well from my standpoint and I accept that. And if
Comporellon wants the ship for its own purposes, who is to say who is
right in this matter? It is a Foundation ship, but it was given to me to
search for Earth. It is mine then until I complete the search and I feel
that the Foundation has no right to go back on its agreement. As for
Comporellon, it does not enjoy Foundation domination, so it dreams of
independence. In its own eyes, it is correct to do so and to deceive the
Foundation, for that is not an act of treason to them but an act of
patriotism. Who knows?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Who knows? In a Galaxy of anarchy, how is it possible to
sort out reasonable actions from unreasonable ones? How decide between
right and wrong, good and evil, justice and crime, useful and useless?
And how do you explain the Minister’s betrayal of her own government,
when she lets you keep the ship? Does she long for personal independence
from an oppressive world? Is she a traitor or a personal one-woman
self-patriot?”</p>
<p>“To be truthful,” said Trevize, “I don’t know that she was willing to
let me have my ship simply because she was grateful to me for the
pleasure I gave her. I believe she made that decision only when I told
her I was searching for the Oldest. It is a world of ill-omen to her and
we and the ship that carries us, by searching for it, have become
ill-omened, too. It is my feeling that she feels she incurred the
ill-omen for herself and her world by attempting to take the ship, which
she may, by now, be viewing with horror. Perhaps she feels that by
allowing us and our ship to leave and go about our business, she is
averting the misfortune from Comporellon and is, in that way, performing
a patriotic act.”</p>
<p>“If that were so, which I doubt, Trevize, superstition is the spring
of the action. Do you admire that?”</p>
<p>“I neither admire nor condemn. Superstition always directs action in
the absence of knowledge. The Foundation believes in the Seldon Plan,
though no one in our realm can understand it, interpret its details, or
use it to predict. We follow blindly out of ignorance and faith, and
isn’t that superstition?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it might be.”</p>
<p>“And Gaia, too. You believe I have given the correct decision in
judging that Gaia should absorb the Galaxy into one large organism, but
you do not know why I should be right, or how safe it would be for you
to follow that decision. You are willing to go along only out of
ignorance and faith, and are even annoyed with me for trying to find
evidence that will remove the ignorance and make mere faith unnecessary.
Isn’t that superstition?”</p>
<p>“I think he has you there, Bliss,” said Pelorat.</p>
<p>Bliss said, “Not so. He will either find nothing at all in this
search, or he will find something that confirms his decision.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “And to back up that belief, you have only ignorance
and faith. In other words, superstition!”</p>

<p>Vasil Deniador was a small man, little of feature, with a way of
looking up by raising his eyes without raising his head. This, combined
with the brief smiles that periodically lit his face, gave him the
appearance of laughing silently at the world.</p>
<p>His office was long and narrow, filled with tapes that seemed to be
in wild disorder, not because there was any definite evidence for that,
but because they were not evenly placed in their recesses so that they
gave the shelves a snaggle-toothed appearance. The three seats he
indicated for his visitors were not matched and showed signs of having
been recently, and imperfectly, dusted.</p>
<p>He said, “Janov Pelorat, Golan Trevize, and Bliss. —I do not have
your second name, madam.”</p>
<p>“Bliss,” she said, “is all I am usually called,” and sat down.</p>
<p>“It is enough after all,” said Deniador, twinkling at her. “You are
attractive enough to be forgiven if you had no name at all.”</p>
<p>All were sitting now. Deniador said, “I have heard of you,
Dr. Pelorat, though we have never corresponded. You are a Foundationer,
are you not? From Terminus?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dr. Deniador.”</p>
<p>“And you, Councilman Trevize. I seem to have heard that recently you
were expelled from the Council and exiled. I don’t think I have ever
understood why.”</p>
<p>“Not expelled, sir. I am still a member of the Council although I
don’t know when I will take up my duties again. Nor exiled, quite. I was
assigned a mission, concerning which we wish to consult you.”</p>
<p>“Happy to try to help,” said Deniador. “And the blissful lady? Is she
from Terminus, too.”</p>
<p>Trevize interposed quickly. “She is from elsewhere, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“Ah, a strange world, this Elsewhere. A most unusual collection of
human beings are native to it. —But since two of you are from the
Foundation’s capital at Terminus, and the third is an attractive young
woman, and Mitza Lizalor is not known for her affection for either
category, how is it that she recommends you to my care so warmly?”</p>
<p>“I think,” said Trevize, “to get rid of us. The sooner you help us,
you see, the sooner we will leave Comporellon.”</p>
<p>Deniador eyed Trevize with interest (again the twinkling smile) and
said, “Of course, a vigorous young man such as yourself might attract
her whatever his origin. She plays the role of cold vestal well, but not
perfectly.”</p>
<p>“I know nothing about that,” said Trevize stiffly.</p>
<p>“And you had better not. In public, at least. But I am a Skeptic and
I am professionally unattuned to believing in surfaces. So come,
Councilman, what is your mission? Let me find out if I can help
you.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “In this, Dr. Pelorat is our spokesman.”</p>
<p>“I have no objection to that,” said Deniador. “Dr. Pelorat?”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “To put it at the simplest, dear Doctor, I have all my
mature life attempted to penetrate to the basic core of knowledge
concerning the world on which the human species originated, and I was
sent out along with my good friend, Golan Trevize—although, to be sure,
I did not know him at the time—to find, if we could, the—uh—Oldest, I
believe you call it.”</p>
<p>“The Oldest?” said Deniador. “I take it you mean Earth.”</p>
<p>Pelorat’s jaw dropped. Then he said, with a slight stutter, “I was
under the impression—that is, I was given to understand—that one did
not—”</p>
<p>He looked at Trevize, rather helplessly.</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Minister Lizalor told me that that word was not used
on Comporellon.”</p>
<p>“You mean she did this?” Deniador’s mouth turned downward, his nose
screwed up, and he thrust his arms vigorously forward, crossing the
first two fingers on each hand.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize. “That’s what I mean.”</p>
<p>Deniador relaxed and laughed. “Nonsense, gentlemen. We do it as a
matter of habit, and in the backwoods they may be serious about it but,
on the whole, it doesn’t matter. I don’t know any Comporellian who
wouldn’t say ‘Earth’ when annoyed or startled. It’s the most common
vulgarism we have.”</p>
<p>“Vulgarism?” said Pelorat faintly.</p>
<p>“Or expletive, if you prefer.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” said Trevize, “the Minister seemed quite upset when I
used the word.”</p>
<p>“Oh well, she’s a mountain woman.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean, sir?”</p>
<p>“What it says. Mitza Lizalor is from the Central Mountain Range. The
children out there are brought up in what is called the good
old-fashioned way, which means that no matter how well educated they
become you can never knock those crossed fingers out of them.”</p>
<p>“Then the word ‘Earth’ doesn’t bother you at all, does it, Doctor?”
said Bliss.</p>
<p>“Not at all, dear lady. I am a Skeptic.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “I know what the word ‘skeptic’ means in Galactic, but
how do you use the word?”</p>
<p>“Exactly as you do, Councilman. I accept only what I am forced to
accept by reasonably reliable evidence, and keep that acceptance
tentative pending the arrival of further evidence. That doesn’t make us
popular.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Trevize.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t be popular anywhere. Where is the world whose people
don’t prefer a comfortable, warm, and well-worn belief, however
illogical, to the chilly winds of uncertainty? —Consider how you believe
in the Seldon Plan without evidence.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize, studying his finger ends. “I put that forward
yesterday as an example, too.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “May I return to the subject, old fellow? What is known
about Earth that a Skeptic would accept?”</p>
<p>Deniador said, “Very little. We can assume that there is a single
planet on which the human species developed, because it is unlikely in
the extreme that the same species, so nearly identical as to be
interfertile, would develop on a number of worlds, or even on just two,
independently. We can choose to call this world of origin Earth. The
belief is general, here, that Earth exists in this corner of the Galaxy,
for the worlds here are unusually old and it is likely that the first
worlds to be settled were close to Earth rather than far from it.”</p>
<p>“And has the Earth any unique characteristics aside from being the
planet of origin?” asked Pelorat eagerly.</p>
<p>“Do you have something in mind?” said Deniador, with his quick
smile.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of its satellite, which some call the moon. That would
be unusual, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That’s a leading question, Dr. Pelorat. You may be putting thoughts
into my mind.”</p>
<p>“I do not say what it is that would make the moon unusual.”</p>
<p>“Its size, of course. Am I right? —Yes, I see I am. All the legends
of Earth speak of its vast array of living species and of its vast
satellite—one that is some three thousand to three thousand five hundred
kilometers in diameter. The vast array of life is easy to accept since
it would naturally have come about through biological evolution, if what
we know of the process is accurate. A giant satellite is more difficult
to accept. No other inhabited world in the Galaxy has such a satellite.
Large satellites are invariably associated with the uninhabited and
uninhabitable gas-giants. As a Skeptic, then, I prefer not to accept the
existence of the moon.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “If Earth is unique in its possession of millions of
species, might it not also be unique in its possession of a giant
satellite? One uniqueness might imply the other.”</p>
<p>Deniador smiled. “I don’t see how the presence of millions of species
on Earth could create a giant satellite out of nothing.”</p>
<p>“But the other way around— Perhaps a giant satellite could help
create the millions of species.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how that could be either.”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “What about the story of Earth’s radioactivity?”</p>
<p>“That is universally told; universally believed.”</p>
<p>“But,” said Trevize, “Earth could not have been so radioactive as to
preclude life in the billions of years when it supported life. How did
it become radioactive? A nuclear war?”</p>
<p>“That is the most common opinion, Councilman Trevize.”</p>
<p>“From the manner in which you say that, I gather you don’t believe
it.”</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that such a war took place. Common belief, even
universal belief, is not, in itself, evidence.”</p>
<p>“What else might have happened?”</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that anything happened. The radioactivity might
be as purely invented a legend as the large satellite.”</p>
<p>Pelorat said, “What is the generally accepted story of Earth’s
history? I have, during my professional career, collected a large number
of origin-legends, many of them involving a world called Earth, or some
name very much like that. I have none from Comporellon, nothing beyond
the vague mention of a Benbally who might have come from nowhere for all
that Comporellian legends say.”</p>
<p>“That’s not surprising. We don’t usually export our legends and I’m
astonished you have found references even to Benbally. Superstition,
again.”</p>
<p>“But you are not superstitious and you would not hesitate to talk
about it, would you?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct,” said the small historian, casting his eyes upward
at Pelorat. “It would certainly add greatly, perhaps even dangerously,
to my unpopularity if I did, but you three are leaving Comporellon soon
and I take it you will never quote me as a source.”</p>
<p>“You have our word of honor,” said Pelorat quickly.</p>
<p>“Then here is a summary of what is supposed to have happened, shorn
of any supernaturalism or moralizing. Earth existed as the sole world of
human beings for an immeasurable period and then, about twenty to
twenty-five thousand years ago, the human species developed interstellar
travel by way of the hyperspatial Jump and colonized a group of
planets.</p>
<p>“The Settlers on these planets made use of robots, which had first
been devised on Earth before the days of hyperspatial travel and—do you
know what robots are, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Trevize. “We have been asked that more than once. We know
what robots are.”</p>
<p>“The Settlers, with a thoroughly roboticized society, developed a
high technology and unusual longevity and despised their ancestral
world. According to more dramatic versions of their story, they
dominated and oppressed the ancestral world.</p>
<p>“Eventually, then, Earth sent out a new group of Settlers, among whom
robots were forbidden. Of the new worlds, Comporellon was among the
first. Our own patriots insist it was the first, but there is no
evidence of that that a Skeptic can accept. The first group of Settlers
died out, and—”</p>
<p>Trevize said, “Why did the first set die out, Dr. Deniador?”</p>
<p>“Why? Usually they are imagined by our romantics as having been
punished for their crimes by He Who Punishes, though no one bothers to
say why He waited so long. But one doesn’t have to resort to fairy
tales. It is easy to argue that a society that depends totally on robots
becomes soft and decadent, dwindling and dying out of sheer boredom or,
more subtly, by losing the will to live.</p>
<p>“The second wave of Settlers, without robots, lived on and took over
the entire Galaxy, but Earth grew radioactive and slowly dropped out of
sight. The reason usually given for this is that there were robots on
Earth, too, since the first wave had encouraged that.”</p>
<p>Bliss, who had listened to the account with some visible impatience,
said, “Well, Dr. Deniador, radioactivity or not, and however many waves
of Settlers there might have been, the crucial question is a simple one.
Exactly where is Earth? What are its co-ordinates?”</p>
<p>Deniador said, “The answer to that question is: I don’t know. —But
come, it is time for lunch. I can have one brought in, and we can
discuss Earth over it for as long as you want.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know?” said Trevize, the sound of his voice rising in
pitch and intensity.</p>
<p>“Actually, as far as I know, no one knows.”</p>
<p>“But that is impossible.”</p>
<p>“Councilman,” said Deniador, with a soft sigh, “if you wish to call
the truth impossible, that is your privilege, but it will get you
nowhere.”</p>
