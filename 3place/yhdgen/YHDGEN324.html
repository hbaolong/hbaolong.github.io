<h4 id="section">15</h4>
<p>It had been a long time since Hari Seldon had smiled. He had
conducted the Project in the same fashion that he always did: pushing
always forward in the development of psychohistory, making plans for the
Foundation, studying the Prime Radiant.</p>
<p>But he did not smile. All he did was to force himself through his
work without any feeling of impending success. Rather, there was a
feeling of impending failure about everything.</p>
<p>And now, as he sat in his office at Streeling University, Wanda
entered. He looked up at her and his heart lifted. Wanda had always been
special. Seldon couldn’t put his finger on just when he and the others
had started accepting her pronouncements with more than the usual
enthusiasm; it just seemed always to have been that way. As a little
girl, she had saved his life with her uncanny knowledge of “lemonade
death” and all through her childhood she had somehow just known
things.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Endelecki had asserted that Wanda’s genome was perfectly
normal in every way, Seldon was still positive that his granddaughter
possessed mental abilities far beyond those of average humans. And he
was just as sure that there were others like her in the Galaxy—on
Trantor, even. If only he could find them, these mentalics, what a great
contribution they could make to the Foundation. The potential for such
greatness all centered in his beautiful granddaughter. Seldon gazed at
her, framed in his office doorway, and he felt as if his heart would
break. In a few days, she would be gone.</p>
<p>How could he hear it? She was such a beautiful girl—eighteen. Long
blond hair, face a little broad but with a tendency to smile. She was
even smiling now and Seldon thought, Why not? She’s heading for Santanni
and for a new life.</p>
<p>He said, “Well, Wanda, just a few more days.”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think so, Grandpa.”</p>
<p>He stared at her. “What?”</p>
<p>Wanda approached him and put her arms around him. “I’m not going to
Santanni.”</p>
<p>“Have your father and mother changed their minds?”</p>
<p>“No, they’re going.”</p>
<p>“And you’re not? Why? Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to stay here, Grandpa. With you.” She hugged him. “Poor
Grandpa!”</p>
<p>“But I don’t understand. Why? Are they allowing this?”</p>
<p>“You mean Mom and Dad. Not really. We’ve been arguing over this for
weeks, but I’ve won out. Why not, Grandpa? They’ll go to Santanni and
they’ll have each other—and they’ll have little Bellis, too. But if I go
with them and leave you here, you’ll have no one. I don’t think I could
stand that.”</p>
<p>“But how did you get them to agree?”</p>
<p>“Well, you know—I pushed.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s my mind. I can see what you have in yours and in theirs and, as
time goes on, I can see more clearly. And I can push them to do what I
want.”</p>
<p>“How do you do that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But after a while, they get tired of being pushed and
they’re willing to let me have my way. So I’m going to stay with
you.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up at her with helpless love. “This is wonderful,
Wanda. But Bellis—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about Bellis. She doesn’t have a mind like mine.”</p>
<p>“Are you certain?” Seldon chewed at his lower lip.</p>
<p>“Quite certain. Besides, Mom and Dad have to have someone, too.”</p>
<p>Seldon wanted to rejoice, but he couldn’t do so openly. There were
Raych and Manella. What of them?</p>
<p>He said, “Wanda, what about your parents? Can you be so cold-blooded
about them?”</p>
<p>“I’m not cold-blooded. They understand. They realize I must be with
you.”</p>
<p>“How did you manage that?”</p>
<p>“I pushed,” said Wanda simply, “and eventually they came to see it my
way.”</p>
<p>“You can do that?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t easy.”</p>
<p>“And you did it because—” Seldon paused.</p>
<p>Wanda said, “Because I love you. Of course. And because—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I must learn psychohistory. I know quite a bit of it already.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“From your mind. From the minds of others at the Project, especially
from Uncle Yugo before he died. But it’s in rags and tatters, so far. I
want the real thing. Grandpa, I want a Prime Radiant of my own.” Her
face lit up and her words came quickly, with passion. “I want to study
psychohistory in great detail. Grandpa, you’re quite old and quite
tired. I’m young and eager. I want to learn all I can, so I can carry on
when—”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Well, that would be wonderful—if you could do it—but
there is no funding anymore. I’ll teach you all I can, but—we can’t do
anything.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see, Grandpa. We’ll see.”</p>
