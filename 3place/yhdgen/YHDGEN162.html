<h4 id="section">24</h4>
<p>Seldon panted, facing a tree, holding it closely, embracing it. He
watched for the flying object to make its appearance again so that he
could back about the tree and hide on the far side, like a squirrel.</p>
<p>The tree was cold, its bark was rough, it gave no comfort—but it
offered cover. Of course, that might be insufficient, if he was being
searched for with a heat-seeker, but, on the other hand, the cold trunk
of a tree might blur even that.</p>
<p>Below him was hard-packed soil. Even in this moment of hiding, of
attempting to see his pursuer while remaining unseen, he could not help
wondering how thick the soil might be, how long it had taken to
accumulate, how many domes in the warmer areas of Trantor carried
forests on their back, and whether the trees were always confined to the
creases between domes, leaving the higher regions to moss, grass, and
underbrush.</p>
<p>He saw it again. It was not a hypership, nor even an ordinary
air-jet. It was a jet-down. He could see the faint glow of the ion
trails coming out at the vertices of a hexagon, neutralizing the
gravitational pull and allowing the wings to keep it aloft like a large
soaring bird. It was a vehicle that could hover and explore a planetary
terrain.</p>
<p>It was only the clouds that had saved him. Even if they were using
heat-seekers, that would only indicate there were people below. The
jet-down would have to make a tentative dive below the banked ceiling
before it could hope to know how many human beings there were and
whether any of them might be the particular person the parties aboard
were seeking.</p>
<p>The jet-down was closer now, but it couldn’t hide from him either.
The rumble of the engine gave it away and they couldn’t turn that off,
not as long as they wished to continue their search. Seldon knew the
jet-downs, for on Helicon or on any undomed world with skies that
cleared now and then, they were common, with many in private hands.</p>
<p>Of what possible use would jet-downs be on Trantor, with all the
human life of the world under domes, with low cloud ceilings all but
perpetual—except for a few government vehicles designed for just this
purpose, that of picking up a wanted person who had been lured above the
domes?</p>
<p>Why not? Government forces could not enter the grounds of the
University, but perhaps Seldon was no longer on the grounds. He was on
top of the domes, which might be outside the jurisdiction of any local
government. An Imperial vehicle might have every right to land on any
part of the dome and question or remove any person found upon it. Hummin
had not warned him of this, but perhaps he had merely not thought of
doing so.</p>
<p>The jet-down was even closer now, nosing about like a blind beast
sniffing out its prey. Would it occur to them to search this group of
trees? Would they land and send out an armed soldier or two to beat
through the copse?</p>
<p>And if so, what could he do? He was unarmed and all his quick-twist
agility would be useless against the agonizing pain of a neuronic
whip.</p>
<p>It was not attempting to land. Either they missed the significance of
the trees—</p>
<p>Or—</p>
<p>A new thought suddenly hit him. What if this wasn’t a pursuit vessel
at all? What if it was part of the meteorological testing? Surely,
meteorologists would want to test the upper reaches of the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Was he a fool to hide from it?</p>
<p>The sky was getting darker. The clouds were getting thicker or, much
more likely, night was falling.</p>
<p>And it was getting colder and would get colder still. Was he going to
stay out here freezing because a perfectly harmless jet-down had made an
appearance and had activated a sense of paranoia that he had never felt
before? He had a strong impulse to leave the copse and get back to the
meteorological station.</p>
<p>After all, how would the man Hummin feared so much—Demerzel—know that
Seldon would, at this particular time, be Upperside and ready to be
taken?</p>
<p>For a moment, that seemed conclusive and, shivering with the cold, he
moved out from behind the tree.</p>
<p>And then he scurried back as the vessel reappeared even closer than
before. He hadn’t seen it do anything that would seem to be
meteorological. It did nothing that might be considered sampling,
measuring, or testing. Would he see such things if they took place? He
did not know the precise sort of instruments the jet-down carried or how
they worked. If they were doing meteorological work, he might not be
able to tell. —Still, could he take the chance of coming into the
open?</p>
<p>After all, what if Demerzel did know of his presence Upperside,
simply because an agent of his, working in the University, knew about it
and had reported the matter. Lisung Randa, that cheerful, smiling little
Easterner, had suggested he go Upperside. He had suggested it quite
forcefully and the subject had not arisen naturally out of the
conversation; at least, not naturally enough. Was it possible that he
was a government agent and had alerted Demerzel somehow?</p>
<p>Then there was Leggen, who had given him the sweater. The sweater was
useful, but why hadn’t Leggen told him he would need one earlier so he
could get his own? Was there something special about the one he was
wearing? It was uniformly purple, while all the others’ indulged in the
Trantorian fashion of bright patterns. Anyone looking down from a height
would see a moving dull blotch in among others that were bright and know
immediately whom they wanted.</p>
<p>And Clowzia? She was supposedly Upperside to learn meteorology and
help the meteorologists. How was it possible that she could come to him,
talk to him at ease, and quietly walk him away from the others and
isolate him so that he could easily be picked up?</p>
<p>For that matter, what about Dors Venabili? She knew he was going
Upperside. She did not stop it. She might have gone with him, but she
was conveniently busy.</p>
<p>It was a conspiracy. Surely, it was a conspiracy.</p>
<p>He had convinced himself now and there was no further thought of
getting out from the shelter of the trees. (His feet felt like lumps of
ice and stamping them against the ground seemed to do no good.) Would
the jet-down never leave?</p>
<p>And even as he thought that, the pitch of the engine’s rumble
heightened and the jet-down rose into the clouds and faded away.</p>
<p>Seldon listened eagerly, alert to the smallest sound, making sure it
was finally gone. And then, even after he was sure it was gone, he
wondered if that was just a device to flush him out of hiding. He
remained where he was while the minutes slowly crawled on and night
continued to fall.</p>
<p>And finally, when he felt that the true alternative to taking the
chance of coming out in the open was that of freezing into
insensibility, he stepped out and moved cautiously beyond the shelter of
the trees.</p>
<p>It was dusky twilight, after all. They couldn’t detect him except by
a heat-seeker, but, if so, he would hear the jet-down return. He waited
just beyond the trees, counting to himself, ready to hide in the copse
again at the smallest sound—though what good that would do him once he
was spotted, he couldn’t imagine.</p>
<p>Seldon looked about. If he could find the meteorologists, they would
surely have artificial light, but except for that, there would be
nothing.</p>
<p>He could still just make out his surroundings, but in a matter of a
quarter of an hour, half an hour at the outside, he would not. With no
lights and a cloudy sky above, it would be dark—completely dark.</p>
<p>Desperate at the prospect of being enveloped in total darkness,
Seldon realized that he would have to find his way back to the crease
that had brought him there as quickly as possible and retrace his steps.
Folding his arms tightly around himself for warmth, he set off in what
he thought was the direction of the crease between the domes.</p>
<p>There might, of course, be more than one crease leading away from the
copse, but he dimly made out some of the sprigs of berries he had seen
coming in, which now looked almost black rather than bright red. He
could not delay. He had to assume he was right. He moved up the crease
as fast as he might, guided by failing sight and by the vegetation
underfoot.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t stay in the crease forever. He had come over what had
seemed to him to be the tallest dome in sight and had found a crease
that cut at right angles across his line of approach. By his reckoning,
he should now turn right, then sharp left, and that would put him on the
path toward the meteorologists’ dome.</p>
<p>Seldon made the left turn and, lifting his head, he could just make
out the curve of a dome against the fractionally lighter sky. That had
to be it!</p>
<p>Or was that only wishful thinking?</p>
<p>He had no choice but to assume it wasn’t. Keeping his eye on the peak
so that he could move in a reasonably straight line, he headed for it as
quickly as he could. As he got closer, he could make out the line of
dome against sky with less and less certainty as it loomed larger and
larger. Soon, if he was correct, he would be going up a gentle slope and
when that slope became level he would be able to look down the other
side and see the lights of the meteorologists.</p>
<p>In the inky dark, he could not tell what lay in his path. Wishing
there were at least a few stars to shed some light, he wondered if this
was how it felt to be blind. He waved his arms before him as if they
were antennae.</p>
<p>It was growing colder by the minute and he paused occasionally to
blow on his hands and hold them under his armpits. He wished earnestly
he could do the same for his feet. By now, he thought, if it started to
precipitate, it would be snow—or, worse yet, sleet.</p>
<p>On … on. There was nothing else to do.</p>
<p>Eventually, it seemed to him that he was moving downward. That was
either wishful thinking or he had topped the dome.</p>
<p>He stopped. If he had topped the dome, he should be able to see the
artificial light of the meteorological station. He would see the lights
carried by the meteorologists themselves, sparkling or dancing like
fireflies.</p>
<p>Seldon closed his eyes as though to accustom them to dark and then
try again, but that was a foolish effort. It was no darker with his eyes
closed than with them open and when he opened them it was no lighter
than when he had had them closed.</p>
<p>Possibly Leggen and the others were gone, had taken their lights with
them and had turned off any lights on the instruments. Or possibly
Seldon had climbed the wrong dome. Or he had followed a curved path
along the dome so that he was now facing in the wrong direction. Or he
had followed the wrong crease and had moved away from the copse in the
wrong direction altogether.</p>
<p>What should he do?</p>
<p>If he was facing the wrong direction, there was a chance that light
would be visible right or left—and it wasn’t. If he had followed the
wrong crease, there was no possible way he could return to the copse and
locate a different crease.</p>
<p>His only chance lay in the assumption that he was facing the right
direction and that the meteorological station was more or less directly
ahead of him, but that the meteorologists had gone and had left it in
darkness.</p>
<p>Move forward, then. The chances of success might be small, but it was
the only chance he had.</p>
<p>He estimated that it had taken him half an hour to move from the
meteorological station to the top of the dome, having gone partway with
Clowzia and sauntering with her rather than striding. He was moving at
little better than a saunter now in the daunting darkness.</p>
<p>Seldon continued to slog forward. It would have been nice to know the
time and he had a timeband, of course, but in the dark—</p>
<p>He stopped. He wore a Trantorian timeband, which gave Galactic
Standard time (as all timebands did) and which also gave Trantorian
local time. Timebands were usually visible in the dark, phosphorescing
so that one could tell time in the quiet dark of a bedchamber. A
Heliconian timeband certainly would; why not a Trantorian one?</p>
<p>He looked at his timeband with reluctant apprehension and touched the
contact that would draw upon the power source for light. The timeband
gleamed feebly and told him the time was 1847. For it to be nighttime
already, Seldon knew that it must be the winter season. —How far past
the solstice was it? What was the degree of axial tipping? How long was
the year? How far from the equator was he at this moment? There was no
hint of an answer to any of these things, but what counted was that the
spark of light was visible.</p>
<p>He was not blind! Somehow the feeble glow of his timeband gave him
renewed hope.</p>
<p>His spirits rose. He would move on in the direction he was going. He
would move for half an hour. If he encountered nothing, he would move on
five minutes more—no further—just five minutes. If he still encountered
nothing, he would stop and think. That, however, would be thirty-five
minutes from now. Till then, he would concentrate only on walking and on
willing himself to feel warmer. (He wiggled his toes, vigorously. He
could still feel them.)</p>
<p>Seldon trudged onward and the half hour passed.</p>
<p>He paused, then hesitantly, he moved on for five more minutes.</p>
<p>Now he had to decide. There was nothing. He might be nowhere, far
removed from any opening into the dome. He might, on the other hand, be
standing three meters to the left—or right—or short—of the
meteorological station. He might be two arms’ lengths from the opening
into the dome, which would not, however, be open.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Was there any point in shouting? He was enveloped by utter silence
but for the whistling of the wind. If there were birds, beasts, or
insects in among the vegetation on the domes, they were not here during
this season or at this time of night or at this particular place. The
wind continued to chill him.</p>
<p>Perhaps he should have been shouting all the way. The sound might
have carried a good distance in the cold air. But would there have been
anyone to hear him?</p>
<p>Would they hear him inside the dome? Were there instruments to detect
sound or movement from above? Might there not be sentinels just
inside?</p>
<p>That seemed ridiculous. They would have heard his footsteps, wouldn’t
they?</p>
<p>Still—</p>
<p>He called out. “Help! Help! Can someone hear me?”</p>
<p>His cry was strangled, half-embarrassed. It seemed silly shouting
into vast black nothingness.</p>
<p>But then, he felt it was even sillier to hesitate in such a situation
as this. Panic was welling up in him. He took in a deep, cold breath and
screamed for as long as he could. Another breath and another scream,
changing pitch. And another.</p>
<p>Seldon paused, breathless, turning his head every which way, even
though there was nothing to see. He could not even detect an echo. There
was nothing left to do but wait for the dawn. But how long was the night
at this season of the year? And how cold would it get?</p>
<p>He felt a tiny cold touch sting his face. After a while, another.</p>
<p>It was sleeting invisibly in the pitch blackness. And there was no
way to find shelter.</p>
<p>He thought: It would have been better if that jet-down had seen me
and picked me up. I would be a prisoner at this moment, perhaps, but I’d
be warm and comfortable, at least.</p>
<p>Or, if Hummin had never interfered, I might have been back in Helicon
long ago. Under surveillance, but warm and comfortable. Right now that
was all he wanted—to be warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>But at the moment he could only wait. He huddled down, knowing that
however long the night, he dared not sleep. He slipped off his shoes and
rubbed his icy feet. Quickly, he put his shoes back on.</p>
<p>He knew he would have to repeat this, as well as rubbing his hands
and ears all night long to keep his circulation flowing. But most
important to remember was that he must not let himself fall asleep. That
would mean certain death.</p>
<p>And, having carefully thought all this out, his eyes closed and he
nodded off to sleep with the sleet coming down.</p>
<p>RESCUE</p>
<p>LEGGEN, JENARR—… His contributions to meteorology, however, although
considerable, pale before what has ever since been known as the Leggen
Controversy. That his actions helped to place Hari Seldon in jeopardy is
undisputable, but argument rages—and has always raged—as to whether
those actions were the result of unintentional circumstance or part of a
deliberate conspiracy. Passions have been raised on both sides and even
the most elaborate studies have come to no definite conclusions.
Nevertheless, the suspicions that were raised helped poison Leggen’s
career and private life in the years that followed …</p>
