<h4 id="section">21</h4>
<p>Gleb Andorin gazed at Namarti through half-closed eyes. He never
liked the man, but there were times when he liked him less than he
usually did and this was one of those times. Why should Andorin, a Wyan
of royal birth (that’s what it amounted to, after all) have to work with
this parvenu, this near-psychotic paranoid?</p>
<p>Andorin knew why and he had to endure, even when Namarti was once
again in the process of telling the story of how he had built up the
movement during a period of ten years to its present pitch of
perfection. Did he tell this to everyone, over and over? Or was it just
Andorin who was his chosen vessel?</p>
<p>Namarti’s face seemed to shine with malignant glee as he said, in an
odd singsong, as though it were a matter of rote, “Year after year, I
worked on those lines, even through hopelessness and uselessness,
building an organization, chipping away at confidence in the government,
creating and intensifying dissatisfaction. When there was the banking
crisis and the week of the moratorium, I—”</p>
<p>He paused suddenly. “I’ve told you this many times and you’re sick of
hearing it, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Andorin’s lips twitched in a brief dry smile. Namarti was not such an
idiot as not to know what a bore he was; he just couldn’t help it.
Andorin said, “You’ve told me this many times.” He allowed the remainder
of the question to hang in the air, unanswered. The answer, after all,
was an obvious affirmative. There was no need to face him with it.</p>
<p>A slight flush crossed Namarti’s sallow face. He said, “But it could
have gone on forever—the building, the chipping, without ever coming to
a point—if I hadn’t had the proper tool in my hands. And without any
effort on my part, the tool came to me.”</p>
<p>“The gods brought you Planchet,” said Andorin neutrally.</p>
<p>“You’re right. There will be a group of gardeners entering the
Imperial Palace grounds soon.” He paused and seemed to savor the
thought. “Men and women. Enough to serve as a mask for the handful of
our operatives who will accompany them. Among them will be you—and
Planchet. And what will make you and Planchet unusual is that you will
be carrying blasters.”</p>
<p>“Surely,” said Andorin with deliberate malice behind a polite
expression, “we’ll be stopped at the gates and held for questioning.
Bringing an illicit blaster onto the Palace grounds—”</p>
<p>“You won’t be stopped,” said Namarti, missing the malice. “You won’t
be searched. That’s been arranged. You will all be greeted as a matter
of course by some Palace official. I don’t know who would ordinarily be
in charge of that task—the Third Assistant Chamberlain in Charge of
Grass and Leaves, for all I know—but in this case, it will be Seldon
himself. The great mathematician will hurry out to greet the new
gardeners and welcome them to the grounds.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure of that, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I am. It’s all been arranged. He will learn, at more or
less the last minute, that his foster son is among those listed as new
gardeners and it will be impossible for him to refrain from coming out
to see him. And when Seldon appears, Planchet will raise his blaster.
Our people will raise the cry of ‘Treason!’ In the confusion and
hurly-burly, Planchet will kill Seldon and then you will kill Planchet.
You will then drop your blaster and leave. There are those who will help
you leave. It’s been arranged.”</p>
<p>“Is it absolutely necessary to kill Planchet?”</p>
<p>Namarti frowned. “Why? Do you object to one killing and not to
another? When Planchet recovers, do you wish him to tell the authorities
all he knows about us? Besides, this is a family feud we are arranging.
Don’t forget that Planchet is, in actual fact, Raych Seldon. It will
look as though the two had fired simultaneously—or as though Seldon had
given orders that if his son made any hostile move, he was to be shot
down. We will see to it that the family angle will be given full
publicity. It will be reminiscent of the bad old days of the Bloody
Emperor Manowell. The people of Trantor will surely be repelled by the
sheer wickedness of the deed. That, piled on top of all the
inefficiencies and breakdowns they’ve been witnessing and living
through, will raise the cry for a new government—and no one will be able
to refuse them, least of all the Emperor. And then we’ll step in.”</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>“No, not just like that. I don’t live in a dream world. There is
likely to be some interim government, but it will fail. We’ll see to it
that it fails and we’ll come out in the open and revive the old
Joranumite arguments that the Trantorians have never forgotten. And in
time—in not too much time—I will be First Minister.”</p>
<p>“And I?”</p>
<p>“Will eventually be the Emperor.”</p>
<p>Andorin said, “The chance of all this working is small. —This is
arranged. That is arranged. The other thing is arranged. All of it has
to come together and mesh perfectly or it will fail. Somewhere, someone
is bound to mess up. It’s an unacceptable risk.”</p>
<p>“Unacceptable? For whom? For you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. You expect me to make certain that Planchet will kill his
father and you expect me to then kill Planchet. Why me? Aren’t there
tools worth less than I who might more easily be risked?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but to choose anyone else would make failure certain. Who but
you has so much riding on this mission that there is no chance you will
turn back in a fit of vapors at the last minute?”</p>
<p>“The risk is enormous.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it worth it to you? You’re playing for the Imperial
throne.”</p>
<p>“And what risk are you taking, Chief? You will remain here, quite
comfortable, and wait to hear the news.”</p>
<p>Namarti’s lip curled. “What a fool you are, Andorin! What an Emperor
you will make! Do you suppose I take no risk because I will be here? If
the gambit fails, if the plot miscarries, if some of our people are
taken, do you think they won’t tell everything they know? If you were
somehow caught, would you face the tender treatment of the Imperial
Guard without ever telling them about me?</p>
<p>“And with a failed assassination attempt at hand, do you suppose they
won’t comb Trantor to find me? Do you suppose that in the end they will
fail to find me? And when they do find me, what do you suppose I will
have to face at their hands? —Risk? I run a worse risk than any of you,
just sitting here doing nothing. It boils down to this, Andorin. Do you
or do you not wish to be Emperor?”</p>
<p>Andorin said in a low voice, “I wish to be Emperor.”</p>
<p>And so things were set in motion.</p>
