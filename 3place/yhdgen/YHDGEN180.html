<h4 id="section">42</h4>
<p>The Sisters returned about two hours after Hari and Dors had finished
lunch. They were smiling, both of them, and Raindrop Forty-Three, the
graver one, held up a gray kirtle for Dors’s inspection.</p>
<p>“It is very attractive,” said Dors, smiling widely and nodding her
head with a certain sincerity. “I like the clever embroidery here.”</p>
<p>“It is nothing,” twittered Raindrop Forty-Five. “It is one of my old
things and it won’t fit very well, for you are taller than I am. But it
will do for a while and we will take you out to the very best kirtlery
to get a few that will fit you and your tastes perfectly. You will
see.”</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three, smiling a little nervously but saying nothing
and keeping her eyes fixed on the ground, handed a white kirtle to Dors.
It was folded neatly. Dors did not attempt to unfold it, but passed it
on to Seldon. “From the color I should say it’s yours, Hari.”</p>
<p>“Presumably,” said Seldon, “but give it back. She did not give it to
me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hari,” mouthed Dors, shaking her head slightly.</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon firmly. “She did not give it to me. Give it back to
her and I’ll wait for her to give it to me.”</p>
<p>Dors hesitated, then made a halfhearted attempt to pass the kirtle
back to Raindrop Forty-Three.</p>
<p>The Sister put her hands behind her back and moved away, all life
seeming to drain from her face. Raindrop Forty-Five stole a glance at
Seldon, a very quick one, then took a quick step toward Raindrop
Forty-Three and put her arms about her.</p>
<p>Dors said, “Come, Hari, I’m sure that Sisters are not permitted to
talk to men who are not related to them. What’s the use of making her
miserable? She can’t help it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Seldon harshly. “If there is such a rule,
it applies only to Brothers. I doubt very much that she’s ever met a
tribesman before.”</p>
<p>Dors said to Raindrop Forty-Three in a soft voice, “Have you ever met
a tribesman before, Sister, or a tribeswoman?”</p>
<p>A long hesitation and then a slow negative shake of the head.</p>
<p>Seldon threw out his arms. “Well, there you are. If there is a rule
of silence, it applies only to the Brothers. Would they have sent these
young women—these Sisters—to deal with us if there was any rule against
speaking to tribesmen?”</p>
<p>“It might be, Hari, that they were meant to speak only to me and I to
you.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. I don’t believe it and I won’t believe it. I am not merely
a tribesman, I am an honored guest in Mycogen, asked to be treated as
such by Chetter Hummin and escorted here by Sunmaster Fourteen himself.
I will not be treated as though I do not exist. I will be in
communication with Sunmaster Fourteen and I will complain bitterly.”</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Five began to sob and Raindrop Forty-Three, retaining
her comparative impassivity, nevertheless flushed faintly.</p>
<p>Dors made as though to appeal to Seldon once again, but he stopped
her with a brief and angry outward thrust of his right arm and then
stared loweringly at Raindrop Forty-Three.</p>
<p>And finally she spoke and did not twitter. Rather, her voice trembled
hoarsely, as though she had to force it to sound in the direction of a
male being and was doing so against all her instincts and desires.</p>
<p>“You must not complain of us, tribesman. That would be unjust. You
force me to break the custom of our people. What do you want of me?”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled disarmingly at once and held out his hand. “The garment
you brought me. The kirtle.”</p>
<p>Silently, she stretched out her arm and deposited the kirtle in his
hand.</p>
<p>He bowed slightly and said in a soft warm voice, “Thank you, Sister.”
He then cast a very brief look in Dors’s direction, as though to say:
You see? But Dors looked away angrily.</p>
<p>The kirtle was featureless, Seldon saw as he unfolded it (embroidery
and decorativeness were for women, apparently), but it came with a
tasseled belt that probably had some particular way of being worn. No
doubt he could work it out.</p>
<p>He said, “I’ll step into the bathroom and put this thing on. It won’t
take but a minute, I suppose.”</p>
<p>He stepped into the small chamber and found the door would not close
behind him because Dors was forcing her way in as well. Only when the
two of them were in the bathroom together did the door close.</p>
<p>“What were you doing?” Dors hissed angrily. “You were an absolute
brute, Hari. Why did you treat the poor woman that way?”</p>
<p>Seldon said impatiently, “I had to make her talk to me. I’m counting
on her for information. You know that. I’m sorry I had to be cruel, but
how else could I have broken down her inhibitions?” And he motioned her
out.</p>
<p>When he emerged, he found Dors in her kirtle too.</p>
<p>Dors, despite the bald head the skincap gave her and the inherent
dowdiness of the kirtle, managed to look quite attractive. The stitching
on the robe somehow suggested a figure without revealing it in the
least. Her belt was wider than his own and was a slightly different
shade of gray from her kirtle. What’s more, it was held in front by two
glittering blue stone snaps. (Women did manage to beautify themselves
even under the greatest difficulty, Seldon thought.)</p>
<p>Looking over at Hari, Dors said, “You look quite the Mycogenian now.
The two of us are fit to be taken to the stores by the Sisters.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Seldon, “but afterward I want Raindrop Forty-Three to
take me on a tour of the microfarms.”</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three’s eyes widened and she took a rapid step
backward.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see them,” said Seldon calmly.</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three looked quickly at Dors. “Tribeswoman—”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Perhaps you know nothing of the farms, Sister.”</p>
<p>That seemed to touch a nerve. She lifted her chin haughtily as she
still carefully addressed Dors. “I have worked on the microfarms. All
Brothers and Sisters do at some point in their lives.”</p>
<p>“Well then, take me on the tour,” said Seldon, “and let’s not go
through the argument again. I am not a Brother to whom you are forbidden
to speak and with whom you may have no dealings. I am a tribesman and an
honored guest. I wear this skincap and this kirtle so as not to attract
undue attention, but I am a scholar and while I am here I must learn. I
cannot sit in this room and stare at the wall. I want to see the one
thing you have that the rest of the Galaxy does not have … your
microfarms. I should think you’d be proud to show them.”</p>
<p>“We are proud,” said Raindrop Forty-Three, finally facing Seldon as
she spoke, “and I will show you and don’t think you will learn any of
our secrets if that is what you are after. I will show you the
microfarms tomorrow morning. It will take time to arrange a tour.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I will wait till tomorrow morning. But do you promise?
Do I have your word of honor?”</p>
<p>Raindrop Forty-Three said with clear contempt, “I am a Sister and I
will do as I say. I will keep my word, even to a tribesman.”</p>
<p>Her voice grew icy at the last words, while her eyes widened and
seemed to glitter. Seldon wondered what was passing through her mind and
felt uneasy.</p>
