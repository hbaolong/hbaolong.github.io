<h4 id="section">54</h4>
<p>It was over breakfast the next morning, not sooner, that Dors took up
the subject—and in a way that Seldon found most wounding.</p>
<p>She said, “Well, that was a pretty fiasco yesterday.”</p>
<p>Seldon, who had honestly thought he had gotten away with it without
comment, looked sullen. “What made it a fiasco?”</p>
<p>“Driven out is what we were. And for what? What did we gain?”</p>
<p>“Only the knowledge that there is a robot in there.”</p>
<p>“Mycelium Seventy-Two said there wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Of course he said that. He’s a scholar—or thinks he is—and what he
doesn’t know about the Sacratorium would probably fill that library he
goes to. You saw the Elder’s reaction.”</p>
<p>“I certainly did.”</p>
<p>“He would not have reacted like that if there was no robot inside. He
was horrified we knew.”</p>
<p>“That’s just your guess, Hari. And even if there was, we couldn’t get
in.”</p>
<p>“We could certainly try. After breakfast, we go out and buy a sash
for me, one of those obiahs. I put it on, keep my eyes devoutly
downward, and walk right in.”</p>
<p>“Skincap and all? They’ll spot you in a microsecond.”</p>
<p>“No, they won’t. We’ll go into the library where all the tribespeople
data is kept. I’d like to see it anyway. From the library, which is a
Sacratorium annex, I gather, there will probably be an entrance into the
Sacratorium—”</p>
<p>“Where you will be picked up at once.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. You heard what Mycelium Seventy-Two had to say. Everyone
keeps his eyes down and meditates on their great Lost World, Aurora. No
one looks at anyone else. It would probably be a grievous breach of
discipline to do so. Then I’ll find the Elders’ aerie—”</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>“At one point, Mycelium Seventy-Two said he would advise me not to
try to get up into the Elders’ aerie. Up. It must be somewhere in that
tower of the Sacratorium, the central tower.”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “I don’t recall the man’s exact words and I
don’t think you do either. That’s a terribly weak foundation to—Wait.”
She stopped suddenly and frowned.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“There is an archaic word ‘aerie’ that means ‘a dwelling place on
high.’”</p>
<p>“Ah! There you are. You see, we’ve learned some vital things as the
result of what you call a fiasco. And if I can find a living robot
that’s twenty thousand years old and if it can tell me—”</p>
<p>“Suppose that such a thing exists, which passes belief, and that you
find it, which is not very likely, how long do you think you will be
able to talk to it before your presence is discovered?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but if I can prove it exists and if I can find it,
then I’ll think of some way to talk to it. It’s too late for me to back
out now under any circumstances. Hummin should have left me alone when I
thought there was no way of achieving psychohistory. Now that it seems
there may be, I won’t let anything stop me—short of being killed.”</p>
<p>“The Mycogenians may oblige, Hari, and you can’t run that risk.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can. I’m going to try.”</p>
<p>“No, Hari. I must look after you and I can’t let you.”</p>
<p>“You must let me. Finding a way to work out psychohistory is more
important than my safety. My safety is only important because I may work
out psychohistory. Prevent me from doing so and your task loses its
meaning. —Think about it.”</p>
<p>Hari felt himself infused with a renewed sense of purpose.
Psychohistory—his nebulous theory that he had, such a short while ago,
despaired ever of proving—loomed larger, more real. Now he had to
believe that it was possible; he could feel it in his gut. The pieces
seemed to be falling together and although he couldn’t see the whole
pattern yet, he was sure the Sacratorium would yield another piece to
the puzzle.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go in with you so I can pull you out, you idiot, when the
time comes.”</p>
<p>“Women can’t enter.”</p>
<p>“What makes me a woman? Only this gray kirtle. You can’t see my
breasts under it. I don’t have a woman’s style hairdo with the skincap
on. I have the same washed, unmarked face a man has. The men here don’t
have stubble. All I need is a white kirtle and a sash and I can enter.
Any Sister could do it if she wasn’t held back by a taboo. I am not held
back by one.”</p>
<p>“You’re held back by me. I won’t let you. It’s too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“No more dangerous for me than for you.”</p>
<p>“But I must take the risk.”</p>
<p>“Then so must I. Why is your imperative greater than mine?”</p>
<p>“Because—” Seldon paused in thought.</p>
<p>“Just tell yourself this,” said Dors, her voice hard as rock. “I
won’t let you go there without me. If you try, I will knock you
unconscious and tie you up. If you don’t like that, then give up any
thought of going alone.”</p>
<p>Seldon hesitated and muttered darkly. He gave up the argument, at
least for now.</p>
