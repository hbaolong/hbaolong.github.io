<h4 id="section">14</h4>
<p>Dors Venabili had lived on the Imperial Palace grounds for ten years.
As wife of the First Minister, she had entry to the grounds and could
pass freely from the dome to the open, with her fingerprints as the
pass.</p>
<p>In the confusion that followed Cleon’s assassination, her pass had
never been removed and now when, for the first time since that dreadful
day, she wanted to move from the dome into the open spaces of the
grounds, she could do so.</p>
<p>She had always known that she could do so easily only once, for, upon
discovery, the pass would be canceled—but this was the one time to do
it.</p>
<p>There was a sudden darkening of the sky as she moved into the open
and she felt a distinct lowering of the temperature. The world under the
dome was always kept a little lighter during the night period than
natural night would require and was kept a little dimmer during the day
period. And, of course, the temperature beneath the dome was always a
bit milder than the outdoors.</p>
<p>Most Trantorians were unaware of this, for they spent their entire
lives under the dome. To Dors it was expected, but it didn’t really
matter.</p>
<p>She took the central roadway, into which the dome opened at the site
of the Dome’s Edge Hotel. It was, of course, brightly lit, so that the
darkness of the sky didn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>Dors knew that she would not advance a hundred meters along the
roadway without being stopped, less perhaps in the present paranoid days
of the junta. Her alien presence would be detected at once.</p>
<p>Nor was she disappointed. A small ground-car skittered up and the
guardsman shouted out the window, “What are you doing here? Where are
you going?”</p>
<p>Dors ignored the question and continued to walk.</p>
<p>The guardsman called out, “Halt!” Then he slammed on the brakes and
stepped out of the car, which was exactly what Dors had wanted him to
do.</p>
<p>The guardsman was holding a blaster loosely in his hand—not
threatening to use it, merely demonstrating its existence. He said,
“Your reference number.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I want your car.”</p>
<p>“What!” The guardsman sounded outraged. “Your reference number.
Immediately!” And now the blaster came up.</p>
<p>Dors said quietly, “You don’t need my reference number,” then she
walked toward the guardsman.</p>
<p>The guardsman took a backward step. “If you don’t stop and present
your reference number, I’ll blast you.”</p>
<p>“No! Drop your blaster.”</p>
<p>The guardsman’s lips tightened. His finger began to edge toward the
contact, but before he could reach it, he was lost.</p>
<p>He could never describe afterward what happened in any accurate way.
All he could say was “How was I to know it was The Tiger Woman?” (The
time came when he would be proud of the encounter.) “She moved so fast,
I didn’t see exactly what she did or what happened. One moment I was
going to shoot her down—I was sure she was some sort of madwoman—and the
next thing I knew, I was completely overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Dors held the guardsman in a firm grip, the hand with the blaster
forced high. She said, “Either drop the blaster at once or I will break
your arm.”</p>
<p>The guardsman felt a kind of death grip around his chest that all but
prevented him from breathing. Realizing he had no choice, he dropped the
blaster.</p>
<p>Dors Venabili released him, but before the guardsman could make a
move to recover, he found himself facing his own blaster in Dors’s
hand.</p>
<p>Dors said, “I hope you’ve left your detectors in place. Don’t try to
report what’s happened too quickly. You had better wait and decide what
it is you plan to tell your superiors. The fact that an unarmed woman
took your blaster and your car may well put an end to your usefulness to
the junta.”</p>
<p>Dors started the car and began to speed down the central roadway. A
ten-year stay on the grounds told her exactly where she was going. The
car she was in—an official ground-car—was not an alien intrusion into
the grounds and would not be picked up as a matter of course. However,
she had to take a chance on speed, for she wanted to reach her
destination rapidly. She pushed the car to a speed of two hundred
kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>The speed, at least, eventually did attract attention. She ignored
radioed cries, demanding to know why she was speeding, and before long
the car’s detectors told her that another ground-car was in hot
pursuit.</p>
<p>She knew that there would be a warning sent up ahead and that there
would be other ground-cars waiting for her to arrive, but there was
little any of them could do, short of trying to blast her out of
existence—something apparently no one was willing to try, pending
further investigation.</p>
<p>When she reached the building she had been heading for, two
ground-cars were waiting for her. She climbed serenely out of her own
car and walked toward the entrance.</p>
<p>Two men at once stood in her way, obviously astonished that the
driver of the speeding car was not a guardsman but a woman dressed in
civilian clothes.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here? What was the rush?”</p>
<p>Dors said quietly, “Important message for Colonel Hender Linn.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” said the guardsman harshly. There were now four men
between her and the entrance. “Reference number, please.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Don’t delay me.”</p>
<p>“Reference number, I said.”</p>
<p>“You’re wasting my time.”</p>
<p>One of the guardsmen said suddenly, “You know who she looks like? The
old First Minister’s wife. Dr. Venabili. The Tiger Woman.”</p>
<p>There was an odd backward step on the part of all four, but one of
them said, “You’re under arrest.”</p>
<p>“Am I?” said Dors. “If I’m The Tiger Woman, you must know that I am
considerably stronger than any of you and that my reflexes are
considerably faster. Let me suggest that all four of you accompany me
quietly inside and we’ll see what Colonel Linn has to say.”</p>
<p>“You’re under arrest” came the repetition and four blasters were
aimed at Dors.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Dors. “If you insist.”</p>
<p>She moved rapidly and two of the guardsmen were suddenly on the
ground, groaning, while Dors was standing with a blaster in each
hand.</p>
<p>She said, “I have tried not to hurt them, but it is quite possible
that I have broken their wrists. That leaves two of you and I can shoot
faster than you can. If either of you makes the slightest move—the
slightest—I will have to break the habit of a lifetime and kill you. It
will sicken me to do so and I beg you not to force me into it.”</p>
<p>There was absolute silence from the two guardsmen still standing—no
motion.</p>
<p>“I would suggest,” said Dors, “that you two escort me into the
colonel’s presence and that you then seek medical help for your
comrades.”</p>
<p>The suggestion was not necessary. Colonel Linn emerged from his
office. “What is going on here? What is—”</p>
<p>Dors turned to him. “Ah! Let me introduce myself. I am Dr. Dors
Venabili, the wife of Professor Hari Seldon. I have come to see you on
important business. These four tried to stop me and, as a result, two
are badly hurt. Send them all about their business and let me talk to
you. I mean you no harm.”</p>
<p>Linn stared at the four guardsmen, then at Dors. He said calmly, “You
mean me no harm? Though four guardsmen have not succeeded in stopping
you, I have four thousand at my instant call.”</p>
<p>“Then call them,” said Dors. “However quickly they come, it will not
be in time to save you, should I decide to kill you. Dismiss your
guardsmen and let us talk civilly.”</p>
<p>Linn dismissed the guardsmen and said, “Well, come in and we will
talk. Let me warn you, though, Dr. Venabili—I have a long memory.”</p>
<p>“And I,” said Dors. They walked into Linn’s quarters together.</p>
