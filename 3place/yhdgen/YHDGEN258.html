<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>Mandell Gruber was a happy man. he seemed so to Hari Seldon,
certainly. Seldon stopped his morning constitutional to watch him.</p>
<p>Gruber, perhaps in his late forties, a few years younger than Seldon,
was a bit gnarled from his continuing work in the Imperial Palace
grounds, but he had a cheerful, smoothly shaven face, topped by a pink
skull, not much of which was hidden by his thin sandy hair. He whistled
softly to himself as he inspected the leaves of the bushes for any signs
of insect infestation.</p>
<p>He was not the Chief Gardener, of course. The Chief Gardener of the
Imperial Palace grounds was a high functionary who had a palatial office
in one of the buildings of the enormous Imperial complex, with an army
of men and women under him. The chances are he did not inspect the
Palace grounds more often than once or twice a year.</p>
<p>Gruber was but one of that army. His title, Seldon knew, was Gardener
First-Class and it had been well earned, with thirty years of faithful
service.</p>
<p>Seldon called to him as he paused on the perfectly level crushed
gravel walk, “Another marvelous day, Gruber.”</p>
<p>Gruber looked up and his eyes twinkled. “Yes, indeed, First Minister,
and it’s sorry I am for those who be cooped up indoors.”</p>
<p>“You mean as I am about to be.”</p>
<p>“There’s not much about you, First Minister, for people to sorrow
over, but if you’re disappearing into those buildings on a day like
this, it’s a bit of sorrow that we fortunate few can feel for you.”</p>
<p>“I thank you for your sympathy, Gruber, but you know we have forty
billion Trantorians under the dome. Are you sorry for all of them?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I am. I am grateful I am not of Trantorian extraction myself
so that I could qualify as a gardener. There be few of us on this world
that work in the open, but here I be, one of the fortunate few.”</p>
<p>“The weather isn’t always this ideal.”</p>
<p>“That is true. And I have been out here in the sluicing rains and the
whistling winds. Still, as long as you dress fittingly.… Look—” And
Gruber spread his arms open, wide as his smile, as if to embrace the
vast expanse of the Palace grounds. “I have my friends—the trees and the
lawns and all the animal life forms to keep me company—and growth to
encourage in geometric form, even in the winter. Have you ever seen the
geometry of the grounds, First Minister?”</p>
<p>“I am looking at it right now, am I not?”</p>
<p>“I mean the plans spread out so you can really appreciate it all—and
marvelous it is, too. It was planned by Tapper Savand, over a hundred
years ago, and it has been little changed since. Tapper was a great
horticulturist, the greatest—and he came from my planet.”</p>
<p>“That was Anacreon, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. A far-off world near the edge of the Galaxy, where there is
still wilderness and life can be sweet. I came here when I was still an
ear-wet lad, when the present Chief Gardener took power under the old
Emperor. Of course, now they’re talking of redesigning the grounds.”
Gruber sighed deeply and shook his head. “That would be a mistake. They
are just right as they are now properly proportioned, well balanced,
pleasing to the eye and spirit. But it is true that in history, the
grounds have occasionally been redesigned. Emperors grow tired of the
old and are always seeking the new, as if new is somehow always better.
Our present Emperor, may he live long, has been planning the redesign
with the Chief Gardener. At least, that is the word that runs from
gardener to gardener.” This last he added quickly, as if abashed at
spreading Palace gossip.</p>
<p>“It might not happen soon.”</p>
<p>“I hope not, First Minister. Please, if you have the chance to take
some time from all the heart-stopping work you must be after doing,
study the design of the grounds. It is a rare beauty and, if I have my
way, there should not be a leaf moved out of place, nor a flower, nor a
rabbit, anywhere in all these hundreds of square kilometers.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “You are a dedicated man, Gruber. I would not be
surprised if someday you were Chief Gardener.”</p>
<p>“May Fate protect me from that. The Chief Gardener breathes no fresh
air, sees no natural sights, and forgets all he has learned of nature.
He lives there”—Gruber pointed scornfully—“and I think he no longer
knows a bush from a stream unless one of his underlings leads him out
and places his hand on one or dips it into the other.”</p>
<p>For a moment it seemed as though Gruber would expectorate his scorn,
but he could not find any place on which he could bear to spit.</p>
<p>Seldon laughed quietly. “Gruber, it’s good to talk to you. When I am
overcome with the duties of the day, it is pleasant to take a few
moments to listen to your philosophy of life.”</p>
<p>“Ah, First Minister, it is no philosopher I am. My schooling was very
sketchy.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need schooling to be a philosopher. Just an active mind
and experience with life. Take care, Gruber. I just might have you
promoted.”</p>
<p>“If you but leave me as I am, First Minister, you will have my total
gratitude.”</p>
<p>Seldon was smiling as he moved on, but the smile faded as his mind
turned once more to his current problems. Ten years as First
Minister—and if Gruber knew how heartily sick Seldon was of his
position, his sympathy would rise to enormous heights. Could Gruber
grasp the fact that Seldon’s progress in the techniques of psychohistory
showed the promise of facing him with an unbearable dilemma?</p>
