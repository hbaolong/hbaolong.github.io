<h4 id="section">73</h4>
<p>Raych entered, looking about, clearly intimidated. The forefinger of
his right hand reached for his upper lip as though wondering when he
would begin to feel the first downy hairs there.</p>
<p>He turned to the clearly outraged Mistress Tisalver and bowed
clumsily. “Thank ya, Missus. Ya got a lovely place.”</p>
<p>Then, as the door slammed behind him, he turned to Seldon and Dors
with an air of easy connoisseurship. “Nice place, guys.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like it,” said Seldon solemnly. “How did you know we
were here?”</p>
<p>“Followed ya. How’d ya think? Hey, lady”—he turned to Dors—“you don’t
fight like no dame.”</p>
<p>“Have you watched many dames fight?” asked Dors, amused.</p>
<p>Raych rubbed his nose, “No, never seen none whatever. They don’t
carry knives, except little ones to scare kids with. Never scared
me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure they didn’t. What do you do to make dames draw their
knives?”</p>
<p>“Nothin’. You just kid around a little. You holler, ‘Hey, lady,
lemme—’”</p>
<p>He thought about it for a moment and said, “Nothin’.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Well, don’t try that on me.”</p>
<p>“Ya kiddin’? After what ya did to Marron? Hey, lady, where’d you
learn to fight that way?”</p>
<p>“On my own world.”</p>
<p>“Could ya teach me?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you came here to see me about?”</p>
<p>“Akchaly, no. I came to bring ya a kind of message.”</p>
<p>“From someone who wants to fight me?”</p>
<p>“No one wants to fight ya, lady. Listen, lady, ya got a reputation
now. Everybody knows ya. You just walk down anywhere in old Billibotton
and all the guys will step aside and let ya pass and grin and make sure
they don’t look cross-eyed at ya. Oh, lady, ya got it made. That’s why
he wants to see ya.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Raych, just exactly who wants to see us?”</p>
<p>“Guy called Davan.”</p>
<p>“And who is he?”</p>
<p>“Just a guy. He lives in Billibotton and don’t carry no knife.”</p>
<p>“And he stays alive, Raych?”</p>
<p>“He reads a lot and he helps the guys there when they get in trouble
with the gov’ment. They kinda leave him alone. He don’t need no
knife.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he come himself, then?” said Dors. “Why did he send
you?”</p>
<p>“He don’t like this place. He says it makes him sick. He says all the
people here, they lick the gov’ment’s—” He paused, looked dubiously at
the two Outworlders, and said, “Anyway, he won’t come here. He said
they’d let me in cause I was only a kid.” He grinned. “They almost
didn’t, did they? I mean that lady there who looked like she was
smellin’ somethin’?”</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly, abashed, and looked down at himself. “Ya don’t
get much chance to wash where I come from.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” said Dors, smiling. “Where are we supposed to meet,
then, if he won’t come here? After all—if you don’t mind—we don’t feel
like going to Billibotton.”</p>
<p>“I told ya,” said Raych indignantly. “Ya get free run of Billibotton,
I swear. Besides, where he lives no one will bother ya.”</p>
<p>“Where is it?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>“I can take ya there. It ain’t far.”</p>
<p>“And why does he want to see us?” asked Dors.</p>
<p>“Dunno. But he says like this—” Raych half-closed his eyes in an
effort to remember. “ ‘Tell them I wanna see the man who talked to a
Dahlite heatsinker like he was a human being and the woman who beat
Marron with knives and didn’t kill him when she mighta done so.’ I think
I got it right.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled. “I think you did. Is he ready for us now?”</p>
<p>“He’s waiting.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll come with you.” He looked at Dors with a trace of doubt
in his eyes.</p>
<p>She said, “All right. I’m willing. Perhaps it won’t be a trap of some
sort. Hope springs eternal—”</p>
