<h4 id="section">1</h4>
<p>“I tell you again, Hari,” said Yugo Amaryl, “that your friend
Demerzel is in deep trouble.” He emphasized the word “friend” very
lightly and with an unmistakable air of distaste.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon detected the sour note and ignored it. He looked up from
his tricomputer and said, “I tell you again, Yugo, that that’s
nonsense.” And then—with a trace of annoyance, just a trace—he added,
“Why are you taking up my time by insisting?”</p>
<p>“Because I think it’s important.” Amaryl sat down defiantly. It was a
gesture that indicated he was not going to be moved easily. Here he was
and here he would stay.</p>
<p>Eight years before, he had been a heatsinker in the Dahl Sector—as
low on the social scale as it was possible to be. He had been lifted out
of that position by Seldon, made into a mathematician and an
intellectual—more than that, into a psychohistorian.</p>
<p>Never for one minute did he forget what he had been and who he was
now and to whom he owed the change. That meant that if he had to speak
harshly to Hari Seldon—for Seldon’s own good—no consideration of respect
and love for the older man and no regard for his own career would stop
him. He owed such harshness—and much more—to Seldon.</p>
<p>“Look, Hari,” he said, chopping at the air with his left hand, “for
some reason that is beyond my understanding, you think highly of this
Demerzel, but I don’t. No one whose opinion I respect—except you—thinks
well of him. I don’t care what happens to him personally, Hari, but as
long as I think you do, I have no choice but to bring this to your
attention.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled, as much at the other’s earnestness as at what he
considered to be the uselessness of his concern. He was fond of Yugo
Amaryl—more than fond. Yugo was one of the four people he had
encountered during that short period of his life when he was in flight
across the face of the planet Trantor—Eto Demerzel, Dors Venabili, Yugo
Amaryl, and Raych—four, the likes of which he had not found since.</p>
<p>In a particular and, in each case, different way, these four were
indispensable to him—Yugo Amaryl, because of his quick understanding of
the principles of psychohistory and of his imaginative probings into new
areas. It was comforting to know that if anything happened to Seldon
himself before the mathematics of the field could be completely worked
out—and how slowly it proceeded, and how mountainous the obstacles—there
would at least remain one good mind that would continue the
research.</p>
<p>He said, “I’m sorry, Yugo. I don’t mean to be impatient with you or
to reject out of hand whatever it is you are so anxious to make me
understand. It’s just this job of mine; it’s this business of being a
department head—”</p>
<p>Amaryl found it his turn to smile and he repressed a slight chuckle.
“I’m sorry, Hari, and I shouldn’t laugh, but you have no natural
aptitude for the position.”</p>
<p>“As well I know, but I’ll have to learn. I have to seem to be doing
something harmless and there is nothing—nothing—more harmless than being
the head of the Mathematics Department at Streeling University. I can
fill my day with unimportant tasks, so that no one need know or ask
about the course of our psychohistorical research, but the trouble is, I
do fill my day with unimportant tasks and I have insufficient time to—”
His eyes glanced around his office at the material stored in computers
to which only he and Amaryl had the key and which, even if anyone else
stumbled upon them, had been carefully phrased in an invented symbology
that no one else would understand.</p>
<p>Amaryl said, “Once you work your way further into your duties, you’ll
begin to delegate and then you’ll have more time.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” said Seldon dubiously. “But tell me, what is it about
Eto Demerzel that is so important?”</p>
<p>“Simply that Eto Demerzel, our great Emperor’s First Minister, is
busily creating an insurrection.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “Why would he want to do that?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say he wants to. He’s simply doing it—whether he knows it
or not—and with considerable help from some of his political enemies.
That’s all right with me, you understand. I think that, under ideal
conditions, it would be a good thing to have him out of the Palace, off
Trantor … beyond the Empire, for that matter. But you think highly of
him, as I’ve said, and so I’m warning you, because I suspect that you
are not following the recent political course of events as closely as
you should.”</p>
<p>“There are more important things to do,” said Seldon mildly.</p>
<p>“Like psychohistory. I agree. But how are we going to develop
psychohistory with any hope of success if we remain ignorant of
politics? I mean, present-day politics. Now—now—is the time when the
present is turning into the future. We can’t just study the past. We
know what happened in the past. It’s against the present and the near
future that we can check our results.”</p>
<p>“It seems to me,” said Seldon, “that I have heard this argument
before.”</p>
<p>“And you’ll hear it again. It doesn’t seem to do me any good to
explain this to you.”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed, sat back in his chair, and regarded Amaryl with a
smile. The younger man could be abrasive, but he took psychohistory
seriously—and that repaid all.</p>
<p>Amaryl still had the mark of his early years as a heatsinker. He had
the broad shoulders and the muscular build of one who had been used to
hard physical labor. He had not allowed his body to turn flabby and that
was a good thing, for it inspired Seldon to resist the impulse to spend
all of his time at the desk as well. He did not have Amaryl’s sheer
physical strength, but he still had his own talents as a Twister—for all
that he had just turned forty and could not keep it up forever. But for
now, he would continue. Thanks to his daily workouts, his waist was
still trim, his legs and arms firm.</p>
<p>He said, “This concern for Demerzel cannot be purely a matter of his
being a friend of mine. You must have some other motive.”</p>
<p>“There’s no puzzle to that. As long as you’re a friend of Demerzel,
your position here at the University is secure and you can continue to
work on psychohistorical research.”</p>
<p>“There you are. So I do have a reason to be friends with him. It
isn’t beyond your understanding at all.”</p>
<p>“You have an interest in cultivating him. That, I understand. But as
for friendship—that, I don’t understand. However—if Demerzel lost power,
quite apart from the effect it might have on your position, then Cleon
himself would be running the Empire and the rate of its decline would
increase. Anarchy might then be upon us before we have worked out all
the implications of psychohistory and made it possible for the science
to save all humanity.”</p>
<p>“I see. —But, you know, I honestly don’t think that we’re going to
work out psychohistory in time to prevent the Fall of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Even if we could not prevent the Fall, we could cushion the effects,
couldn’t we?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.”</p>
<p>“There you are, then. The longer we have to work in peace, the
greater the chance we will have to prevent the Fall or, at least,
ameliorate the effects. Since that is the case, working backward, it may
be necessary to save Demerzel, whether we—or, at least, I—like it or
not.”</p>
<p>“Yet you just said that you would like to see him out of the Palace
and away from Trantor and beyond the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Yes, under ideal conditions, I said. But we are not living under
ideal conditions and we need our First Minister, even if he is an
instrument of repression and despotism.”</p>
<p>“I see. But why do you think the Empire is so close to dissolution
that the loss of a First Minister will bring it about?”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory.”</p>
<p>“Are you using it for predictions? We haven’t even gotten the
framework in place. What predictions can you make?”</p>
<p>“There’s intuition, Hari.”</p>
<p>“There’s always been intuition. We want something more, don’t we? We
want a mathematical treatment that will give us probabilities of
specific future developments under this condition or that. If intuition
suffices to guide us, we don’t need psychohistory at all.”</p>
<p>“It’s not necessarily a matter of one or the other, Hari. I’m talking
about both: the combination, which may be better than either—at least
until psychohistory is perfected.”</p>
<p>“If ever,” said Seldon. “But tell me, where does this danger to
Demerzel arise? What is it that is likely to harm him or overthrow him?
Are we talking about Demerzel’s overthrow?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amaryl and a grim look settled on his face.</p>
<p>“Then tell me. Have pity on my ignorance.”</p>
<p>Amaryl flushed. “You’re being condescending, Hari. Surely you’ve
heard of Jo-Jo Joranum.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. He’s a demagogue— Wait, where’s he from? Nishaya, right?
A very unimportant world. Goat herding, I think. High-quality
cheeses.”</p>
<p>“That’s it. Not just a demagogue, however. He commands a strong
following and it’s getting stronger. He aims, he says, for social
justice and greater political involvement by the people.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Seldon. “I’ve heard that much. His slogan is: ‘Government
belongs to the people.’”</p>
<p>“Not quite, Hari. He says: ‘Government is the people.’”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “Well, you know, I rather sympathize with the
thought.”</p>
<p>“So do I. I’m all for it—if Joranum meant it. But he doesn’t, except
as a stepping-stone. It’s a path, not a goal. He wants to get rid of
Demerzel. After that it will be easy to manipulate Cleon. Then Joranum
will take the throne himself and he will be the people. You’ve told me
yourself that there have been a number of episodes of this sort in
Imperial history—and these days the Empire is weaker and less stable
than it used to be. A blow which, in earlier centuries, merely staggered
it might now shatter it. The Empire will welter in civil war and never
recover and we won’t have psychohistory in place to teach us what must
be done.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I see your point, but surely it’s not going to be that easy to
get rid of Demerzel.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know how strong Joranum is growing.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how strong he’s growing.” A shadow of thought
seemed to pass over Seldon’s brow. “I wonder that his parents came to
name him Jo-Jo. There’s something juvenile about that name.”</p>
<p>“His parents had nothing to do with it. His real name is Laskin, a
very common name on Nishaya. He chose Jo-Jo himself, presumably from the
first syllable of his last name.”</p>
<p>“The more fool he, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p>“No, I wouldn’t. His followers shout it—‘Jo … Jo … Jo … Jo’—over and
over. It’s hypnotic.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon, making a move to return to his tricomputer and
adjust the multidimensional simulation it had created, “we’ll see what
happens.”</p>
<p>“Can you be that casual about it? I’m telling you the danger is
imminent.”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Seldon, eyes steely, his voice suddenly
hardening. “You don’t have all the facts.”</p>
<p>“What facts don’t I have?”</p>
<p>“We’ll discuss that another time, Yugo. For now, continue with your
work and let me worry about Demerzel and the state of the Empire.”</p>
<p>Amaryl’s lips tightened, but the habit of obedience to Seldon was
strong. “Yes, Hari.”</p>
<p>But not overwhelmingly strong. He turned at the door and said,
“You’re making a mistake, Hari.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled slightly. “I don’t think so, but I have heard your
warning and I will not forget. Still, all will be well.”</p>
<p>And as Amaryl left, Seldon’s smile faded. —Would, indeed, all be
well?</p>
