<h4 id="section">88</h4>
<p>It was their fifth day in Wye and in the morning Dors was helping
Raych into a formal costume that neither was quite familiar with.</p>
<p>Raych looked at himself dubiously in the holomirror and saw a
reflected image that faced him with precision, imitating all his motions
but without any inversion of left and right. Raych had never used a
holomirror before and had been unable to keep from trying to feel it,
then laughing, almost with embarrassment, when his hand passed through
it while the image’s hand poked ineffectually at his real body.</p>
<p>He said at last, “I look funny.”</p>
<p>He studied his tunic, which was made of a very pliant material, with
a thin filigreed belt, then passed his hands up a stiff collar that rose
like a cup past his ears on either side.</p>
<p>“My head looks like a ball inside a bowl.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “But this is the sort of thing rich children wear in Wye.
Everyone who sees you will admire you and envy you.”</p>
<p>“With my hair all stuck down?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. You’ll wear this round little hat.”</p>
<p>“It’ll make my head more like a ball.”</p>
<p>“Then don’t let anyone kick it. Now, remember what I told you. Keep
your wits about you and don’t act like a kid.”</p>
<p>“But I am a kid,” he said, looking up at her with a wide-eyed
innocent expression.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised to hear you say that,” said Dors. “I’m sure you think
of yourself as a twelve-year-old adult.”</p>
<p>Raych grinned. “Okay. I’ll be a good spy.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I’m telling you to be. Don’t take chances. Don’t
sneak behind doors to listen. If you get caught at it, you’re no good to
anyone—especially not to yourself.”</p>
<p>“Aw, c’mon, Missus, what do ya think I am? A kid or somethin’?”</p>
<p>“You just said you were, didn’t you, Raych? You just listen to
everything that’s said without seeming to. And remember what you hear.
And tell us. That’s simple enough.”</p>
<p>“Simple enough for you to say, Missus Venabili,” said Raych with a
grin, “and simple enough for me to do.”</p>
<p>“And be careful.”</p>
<p>Raych winked. “You bet.”</p>
<p>A flunky (as coolly impolite as only an arrogant flunky can be) came
to take Raych to where Rashelle was awaiting him.</p>
<p>Seldon looked after them and said thoughtfully, “He probably won’t
see the zoo, he’ll be listening so carefully. I’m not sure it’s right to
thrust a boy into danger like that.”</p>
<p>“Danger? I doubt it. Raych was brought up in the slums of
Billibotton, remember. I suspect he has more alley smarts than you and I
put together. Besides, Rashelle is fond of him and will interpret
everything he does in his favor. —Poor woman.”</p>
<p>“Are you actually sorry for her, Dors?”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that she’s not worth sympathy because she’s a Mayor’s
daughter and considers herself a Mayor in her own right—and because
she’s intent on destroying the Empire? Perhaps you’re right, but even so
there are some aspects of her for which one might show some sympathy.
For instance, she’s had an unhappy love affair. That’s pretty evident.
Undoubtedly, her heart was broken—for a time, at least.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Have you ever had an unhappy love affair, Dors?”</p>
<p>Dors considered for a moment or two, then said, “Not really. I’m too
involved with my work to get a broken heart.”</p>
<p>“I thought as much.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you ask?”</p>
<p>“I might have been wrong.”</p>
<p>“How about you?”</p>
<p>Seldon seemed uneasy. “As a matter of fact, yes. I have spared the
time for a broken heart. Badly cracked, anyway.”</p>
<p>“I thought as much.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you ask?”</p>
<p>“Not because I thought I might be wrong, I promise you. I just wanted
to see if you would lie. You didn’t and I’m glad.”</p>
<p>There was a pause and then Seldon said, “Five days have passed and
nothing has happened.”</p>
<p>“Except that we are being treated well, Hari.”</p>
<p>“If animals could think, they’d think they were being treated well
when they were only being fattened for the slaughter.”</p>
<p>“I admit she’s fattening the Empire for the slaughter.”</p>
<p>“But when?”</p>
<p>“I presume when she’s ready.”</p>
<p>“She boasted she could complete the coup in a day and the impression
I got was that she could do that on any day.”</p>
<p>“Even if she could, she would want to make sure that she could
cripple the Imperial reaction and that might take time.”</p>
<p>“How much time? She plans to cripple the reaction by using me, but
she is making no effort to do so. There is no sign that she’s trying to
build up my importance. Wherever I go in Wye I’m unrecognized. There are
no Wyan crowds gathering to cheer me. There’s nothing on the news
holocasts.”</p>
<p>Dors smiled. “One would almost suppose that your feelings are hurt at
not being made famous. You’re naïve, Hari. Or not a historian, which is
the same thing. I think you had better be more pleased that the study of
psychohistory will be bound to make a historian of you than that it may
save the Empire. If all human beings understood history, they might
cease making the same stupid mistakes over and over.”</p>
<p>“In what way am I naïve?” asked Seldon, lifting his head and staring
down his nose at her.</p>
<p>“Don’t be offended, Hari. I think it’s one of your attractive
features, actually.”</p>
<p>“I know. It arouses your maternal instincts and you have been asked
to take care of me. But in what way am I naïve?”</p>
<p>“In thinking that Rashelle would try to propagandize the population
of the Empire, generally, into accepting you as seer. She would
accomplish nothing in that way. Quadrillions of people are hard to move
quickly. There is social and psychological inertia, as well as physical
inertia. And, by coming out into the open, she would simply alert
Demerzel.”</p>
<p>“Then what is she doing?”</p>
<p>“My guess is that the information about you—suitably exaggerated and
glorified—is going out to a crucial few. It is going to those Viceroys
of sectors, those admirals of fleets, those people of influence she
feels look kindly upon her—or grimly upon the Emperor. A hundred or so
of those who might rally to her side will manage to confuse the
Loyalists just long enough to allow Rashelle the First to set up her New
Order firmly enough to beat off whatever resistance might develop. At
least, I imagine that is how she reasons.”</p>
<p>“And yet we haven’t heard from Hummin.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he must be doing something just the same. This is too
important to ignore.”</p>
<p>“Has it occurred to you that he might be dead?”</p>
<p>“That’s a possibility, but I don’t think so. If he was, the news
would reach me.”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>“Even here.”</p>
<p>Seldon raised his eyebrows, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Raych came back in the late afternoon, happy and excited, with
descriptions of monkeys and of Bakarian demoires and he dominated the
conversation during dinner.</p>
<p>It was not until after dinner when they were in their own quarters
that Dors said, “Now, tell me what happened with Madam Mayor, Raych.
Tell me anything she did or said that you think we ought to know.”</p>
<p>“One thing,” said Raych, his face lighting up. “That’s why she didn’t
show at dinner, I bet.”</p>
<p>“What was it?”</p>
<p>“The zoo was closed except for us, you know. There were lots of
us—Rashelle and me and all sorts of guys in uniforms and dames in fancy
clothes and like that. Then this guy in a uniform—a different guy, who
wasn’t there to begin with—came in toward the end and he said something
in a low voice and Rashelle turned to all the people and made with her
hand like they shouldn’t move and they didn’t. And she went a little
ways away with this new guy, so she could talk to him and no one could
hear her. Except I kept paying no attention and kept looking at the
different cages and sort of moved near to Rashelle so I could hear
her.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘How dare they?’ like she was real mad. And the guy in the
uniform, he looked nervous—I just got quick looks because I was trying
to make out like I was watching the animals—so mostly I just heard the
words. He said somebody—I don’t remember the name, but he was a general
or somethin’. He said this general said the officers had sworn religious
to Rashelle’s old man—”</p>
<p>“Sworn allegiance,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“Somethin’ like that and they was nervous about havin’ to do what a
dame says. He said they wanted the old man or else, if he was kind of
sick, he should pick some guy to be Mayor, not a dame.”</p>
<p>“Not a dame? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“That’s what he said. He like whispered it. He was so nervous and
Rashelle was so mad she could hardly speak. She said, ‘I’ll have his
head. They will all swear allegiance to me tomorrow and whoever refuses
will have cause to regret it before an hour has passed.’ That’s exactly
what she said. She broke up the whole party and we all came back and she
didn’t say one word to me all the time. Just sat there, looking kinda
mean and angry.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Good. Don’t you mention this to anyone, Raych.”</p>
<p>“Course not. Is it what you wanted?”</p>
<p>“Very much what I wanted. You did well, Raych. Now, go to your room
and forget the whole thing. Don’t even think about it.”</p>
<p>Once he was gone, Dors turned to Seldon and said, “This is very
interesting. Daughters have succeeded fathers—or mothers, for that
matter—and held Mayoralties or other high offices on any number of
occasions. There have even been reigning Empresses, as you undoubtedly
know, and I can’t recall that there was ever in Imperial history any
serious question of serving under one. It makes one wonder why such a
thing should now arise in Wye.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Why not? We’ve only recently been in Mycogen, where
women are held in a total lack of esteem and couldn’t possibly hold
positions of power, however minor.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, but that’s an exception. There are other places
where women dominate. For the most part, though, government and power
have been more or less equisexual. If more men tend to hold high
positions, it is usually because women tend to be more
bound—biologically—to children.”</p>
<p>“But what is the situation in Wye?”</p>
<p>“Equisexual, as far as I know. Rashelle didn’t hesitate to assume
Mayoral power and I imagine old Mannix didn’t hesitate to grant it to
her. And she was surprised and furious at encountering male dissent. She
can’t have expected it.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You’re clearly pleased at this. Why?”</p>
<p>“Simply because it’s so unnatural that it must be contrived and I
imagine Hummin is doing the contriving.”</p>
<p>Seldon said thoughtfully, “You think so?”</p>
<p>“I do,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“You know,” said Seldon, “so do I.”</p>
