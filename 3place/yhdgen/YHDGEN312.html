<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon surveyed the comfortable suite that had been his personal
office at the Galactic Library these past few years. It, like the rest
of the Library, had a vague air of decay about it, a kind of
weariness—something that had been too long in one place. And yet Seldon
knew it might remain here, in the same place, for centuries more—with
judicious rebuildings—for millennia even.</p>
<p>How did he come to be here?</p>
<p>Over and over again, he felt the past in his mind, ran his mental
tendrils along the line of development of his life. It was part of
growing older, no doubt. There was so much more in the past, so much
less in the future, that the mind turned away from the looming shadow
ahead to contemplate the safety of what had gone before.</p>
<p>In his case, though, there was that change. For over thirty years
psychohistory had developed in what might almost be considered a
straight line—progress creepingly slow but moving straight ahead. Then
six years ago there had been a right-angled turn—totally unexpected.</p>
<p>And Seldon knew exactly how it had happened, how a concatenation of
events came together to make it possible.</p>
<p>It was Wanda, of course, Seldon’s granddaughter. Hari closed his eyes
and settled into his chair to review the events of six years before.</p>
<p>Twelve-year-old Wanda was bereft. Her mother, Manella, had had
another child, another little girl, Bellis, and for a time the new baby
was a total preoccupation.</p>
<p>Her father, Raych, having finished his book on his home sector of
Dahl, found it to be a minor success and himself a minor celebrity. He
was called upon to talk on the subject, something he accepted with
alacrity, for he was fiercely absorbed in the subject and, as he said to
Hari with a grin, “When I talk about Dahl, I don’t have to hide my
Dahlite accent. In fact, the public expects it of me.”</p>
<p>The net result, though, was that he was away from home a considerable
amount of time and when he wasn’t, it was the baby he wanted to see.</p>
<p>As for Dors—Dors was gone—and to Hari Seldon that wound was
ever-fresh, ever-painful. And he had reacted to it in an unfortunate
manner. It had been Wanda’s dream that had set in motion the current of
events that had ended with the loss of Dors.</p>
<p>Wanda had had nothing to do with it—Seldon knew that very well. And
yet he found himself shrinking from her, so that he also failed her in
the crisis brought about by the birth of the new baby.</p>
<p>And Wanda wandered disconsolately to the one person who always seemed
glad to see her, the one person she could always count on. That was Yugo
Amaryl, second only to Hari Seldon in the development of psychohistory
and first in his absolute round-the-clock devotion to it. Hari had had
Dors and Raych, but psychohistory was Yugo’s life; he had no wife and
children. Yet whenever Wanda came into his presence, something within
him recognized her as a child and he dimly felt—for just that moment—a
sense of loss that seemed to be assuaged only by showing the child
affection. To be sure, he tended to treat her as a rather undersized
adult, but Wanda seemed to like that.</p>
<p>It was six years ago that she had wandered into Yugo’s office. Yugo
looked up at her with his owlish reconstituted eyes and, as usual, took
a moment or two to recognize her.</p>
<p>Then he said, “Why, it’s my dear friend Wanda. —But why do you look
so sad? Surely an attractive young woman like you should never feel
sad.”</p>
<p>And Wanda, her lower lip trembling, said, “Nobody loves me.”</p>
<p>“Oh come, that’s not true.”</p>
<p>“They just love that new baby. They don’t care about me anymore.”</p>
<p>“I love you, Wanda.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re the only one then, Uncle Yugo.” And even though she
could no longer crawl onto his lap as she had when she was younger, she
cradled her head on his shoulder and wept.</p>
<p>Amaryl, totally unaware of what he should do, could only hug the girl
and say, “Don’t cry. Don’t cry.” And out of sheer sympathy and because
he had so little in his own life to weep about, he found that tears were
trickling down his own cheeks as well.</p>
<p>And then he said with sudden energy, “Wanda, would you like to see
something pretty?”</p>
<p>“What?” sniffled Wanda.</p>
<p>Amaryl knew only one thing in life and the Universe that was pretty.
He said, “Did you ever see the Prime Radiant?”</p>
<p>“No. What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s what your grandfather and I use to do our work. See? It’s right
here.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the black cube on his desk and Wanda looked at it
woefully. “That’s not pretty,” she said.</p>
<p>“Not now,” agreed Amaryl. “But watch when I turn it on.”</p>
<p>He did so. The room darkened and filled with dots of light and
flashes of different colors. “See? Now we can magnify it so all the dots
become mathematical symbols.”</p>
<p>And so they did. There seemed a rush of material toward them and
there, in the air, were signs of all sorts, letters, numbers, arrows,
and shapes that Wanda had never seen before.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it pretty?” asked Amaryl.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is,” said Wanda, staring carefully at the equations that
(she didn’t know) represented possible futures. “I don’t like that part,
though. I think it’s wrong.” She pointed at a colorful equation to her
left.</p>
<p>“Wrong? Why do you say it’s wrong?” said Amaryl, frowning.</p>
<p>“Because it’s not … pretty. I’d do it a different way.”</p>
<p>Amaryl cleared his throat. “Well, I’ll try to fix it up.” And he
moved closer to the equation in question, staring at it in his owlish
fashion.</p>
<p>Wanda said, “Thank you very much, Uncle Yugo, for showing me your
pretty lights. Maybe someday I’ll understand what they mean.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Amaryl. “I hope you feel better.”</p>
<p>“A little, thanks,” and, after flashing the briefest of smiles, she
left the room.</p>
<p>Amaryl stood there, feeling a trifle hurt. He didn’t like having the
Prime Radiant’s product criticized—not even by a twelve-year-old girl
who knew no better.</p>
<p>And as he stood there, he had no idea whatsoever that the
psychohistorical revolution had begun.</p>
