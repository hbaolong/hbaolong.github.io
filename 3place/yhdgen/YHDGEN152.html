<h4 id="section">14</h4>
<p>The journey came to its end and the air-taxi moved into a much larger
lot than the one at which they had eaten. (Seldon still remembered the
taste of the sandwich and made a wry face.)</p>
<p>Hummin turned in his taxi and came back, placing his credit slip in a
small pocket on the inner surface of his shirt. He said, “You’re
completely safe here from anything outright and open. This is the
Streeling Sector.”</p>
<p>“Streeling?”</p>
<p>“It’s named for someone who first opened up the area to settlement, I
imagine. Most of the sectors are named for someone or other, which means
that most of the names are ugly and some are hard to pronounce. Just the
same, if you try to have the inhabitants here change Streeling to
Sweetsmell or something like that, you’ll have a fight on your
hands.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Seldon, sniffing loudly, “it isn’t exactly
Sweetsmell.”</p>
<p>“Hardly anywhere in Trantor is, but you’ll get used to it.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad we’re here,” said Seldon. “Not that I like it, but I got
quite tired sitting in the taxi. Getting around Trantor must be a
horror. Back on Helicon, we can get from any one place to any other by
air, in far less time than it took us to travel less than two thousand
kilometers here.”</p>
<p>“We have air-jets too.”</p>
<p>“But in that case—”</p>
<p>“I could arrange an air-taxi ride more or less anonymously. It would
have been much more difficult with an air-jet. And regardless of how
safe it is here, I’d feel better if Demerzel didn’t know exactly where
you were.</p>
<p>—As a matter of fact, we’re not done yet. We’re going to take the
Expressway for the final stage.”</p>
<p>Seldon knew the expression. “One of those open monorails moving on an
electromagnetic field, right?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have them on Helicon. Actually, we don’t need them there. I
rode on an Expressway the first day I was on Trantor. It took me from
the airport to the hotel. It was rather a novelty, but if I were to use
it all the time, I imagine the noise and crowds would become
overpowering.”</p>
<p>Hummin looked amused. “Did you get lost?”</p>
<p>“No, the signs were useful. There was trouble getting on and off, but
I was helped. Everyone could tell I was an Outworlder by my clothes, I
now realize. They seemed eager to help, though; I guess because it was
amusing to watch me hesitate and stumble.”</p>
<p>“As an expert in Expressway travel by now, you will neither hesitate
nor stumble.” Hummin said it pleasantly enough, though there was a
slight twitch to the corners of his mouth. “Come on, then.”</p>
<p>They sauntered leisurely along the walkway, which was lit to the
extent one might expect of an overcast day and that brightened now and
then as though the sun occasionally broke through the clouds.
Automatically, Seldon looked upward to see if that were indeed the case,
but the “sky” above was blankly luminous.</p>
<p>Hummin saw this and said, “This change in brightness seems to suit
the human psyche. There are days when the street seems to be in bright
sunlight and days when it is rather darker than it is now.”</p>
<p>“But no rain or snow?”</p>
<p>“Or hail or sleet. No. Nor high humidity nor bitter cold. Trantor has
its points, Seldon, even now.”</p>
<p>There were people walking in both directions and there were a
considerable number of young people and also some children accompanying
the adults, despite what Hummin had said about the birthrate. All seemed
reasonably prosperous and reputable. The two sexes were equally
represented and the clothing was distinctly more subdued than it had
been in the Imperial Sector. His own costume, as chosen by Hummin, fit
right in. Very few were wearing hats and Seldon thankfully removed his
own and swung it at his side.</p>
<p>There was no deep abyss separating the two sides of the walkway and
as Hummin had predicted in the Imperial Sector, they were walking at
what seemed to be ground level. There were no vehicles either and Seldon
pointed this out to Hummin.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “There are quite a number of them in the Imperial Sector
because they’re used by officials. Elsewhere, private vehicles are rare
and those that are used have separate tunnels reserved for them. Their
use is not really necessary, since we have Expressways and, for shorter
distances, moving corridors. For still shorter distances, we have
walkways and we can use our legs.”</p>
<p>Seldon heard occasional muted sighs and creaks and saw, some distance
off, the endless passing of Expressway cars.</p>
<p>“There it is,” he said, pointing.</p>
<p>“I know, but let us move on to a boarding station. There are more
cars there and it is easier to get on.”</p>
<p>Once they were safely ensconced in an Expressway car, Seldon turned
to Hummin and said, “What amazes me is how quiet the Expressways are. I
realize that they are mass-propelled by an electromagnetic field, but it
seems quiet even for that.” He listened to the occasional metallic groan
as the car they were on shifted against its neighbors.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a marvelous network,” said Hummin, “but you don’t see it
at its peak. When I was younger, it was quieter than it is now and there
are those who say that there wasn’t as much as a whisper fifty years
ago—though I suppose we might make allowance for the idealization of
nostalgia.”</p>
<p>“Why isn’t it that way now?”</p>
<p>“Because it isn’t maintained properly. I told you about decay.”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “Surely, people don’t sit around and say, ‘We’re
decaying. Let’s let the Expressways fall apart.’”</p>
<p>“No, they don’t. It’s not a purposeful thing. Bad spots are patched,
decrepit coaches refurbished, magnets replaced. However, it’s done in
more slapdash fashion, more carelessly, and at greater intervals. There
just aren’t enough credits available.”</p>
<p>“Where have the credits gone?”</p>
<p>“Into other things. We’ve had centuries of unrest.</p>
<p>The navy is much larger and many times more expensive than it once
was. The armed forces are much better-paid, in order to keep them quiet.
Unrest, revolts, and minor blazes of civil war all take their toll.”</p>
<p>“But it’s been quiet under Cleon. And we’ve had fifty years of
peace.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but soldiers who are well-paid would resent having that pay
reduced just because there is peace. Admirals resist mothballing ships
and having themselves reduced in rank simply because there is less for
them to do. So the credits still go—unproductively—to the armed forces
and vital areas of the social good are allowed to deteriorate. That’s
what I call decay. Don’t you? Don’t you think that eventually you would
fit that sort of view into your psychohistorical notions?”</p>
<p>Seldon stirred uneasily. Then he said, “Where are we going, by the
way?”</p>
<p>“Streeling University.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s why the sector’s name was familiar. I’ve heard of the
University.”</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised. Trantor has nearly a hundred thousand
institutions of higher learning and Streeling is one of the thousand or
so at the top of the heap.”</p>
<p>“Will I be staying there?”</p>
<p>“For a while. University campuses are unbreachable sanctuaries, by
and large. You will be safe there.”</p>
<p>“But will I be welcome there?”</p>
<p>“Why not? It’s hard to find a good mathematician these days. They
might be able to use you. And you might be able to use them too—and for
more than just a hiding place.”</p>
<p>“You mean, it will be a place where I can develop my notions.”</p>
<p>“You have promised,” said Hummin gravely.</p>
<p>“I have promised to try,” said Seldon and thought to himself that it
was about like promising to try to make a rope out of sand.</p>
