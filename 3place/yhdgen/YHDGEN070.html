<h4 id="section">21</h4>
<p>INTERLUDE IN SPACE</p>
<p>The blockade was run successfully. In the vast volume of space, not
all the navies ever in existence could keep their watch in tight
proximity. Given a single ship, a skillful pilot, and a moderate degree
of luck, and there are holes and to spare.</p>
<p>With cold-eyed calm, Toran drove a protesting vessel from the
vicinity of one star to that of another. If the neighborhood of great
mass made an interstellar jump erratic and difficult, it also made the
enemy detection devices useless or nearly so.</p>
<p>And once the girdle of ships had been passed, the inner sphere of
dead space, through whose blockaded sub-ether no message could be
driven, was passed as well. For the first time in over three months
Toran felt unisolated.</p>
<p>A week passed before the enemy news programs dealt with anything more
than the dull, self-laudatory details of growing control over the
Foundation. It was a week in which Toran’s armored trading ship fled
inward from the Periphery in hasty jumps.</p>
<p>Ebling Mis called out to the pilot room and Toran rose blink-eyed
from his charts.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Toran stepped down into the small central
chamber which Bayta had inevitably devised into a living room.</p>
<p>Mis shook his head, “Bescuppered if I know. The Mule’s newsmen are
announcing a special bulletin. Thought you might want to get in on
it.”</p>
<p>“Might as well. Where’s Bayta?”</p>
<p>“Setting the table in the diner and picking out a menu—or some such
frippery.”</p>
<p>Toran sat down upon the cot that served as Magnifico’s bed, and
waited. The propaganda routine of the Mule’s “special bulletins” were
monotonously similar. First the martial music, and then the buttery
slickness of the announcer. The minor news items would come, following
one another in patient lockstep. Then the pause. Then the trumpets and
the rising excitement and the climax.</p>
<p>Toran endured it. Mis muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The newscaster spilled out, in conventional war-correspondent
phraseology, the unctuous words that translated into sound the molten
metal and blasted flesh of a battle in space.</p>
<p>“Rapid cruiser squadrons under Lieutenant General Sammin hit back
hard today at the task force striking out from Iss—” The carefully
expressionless face of the speaker upon the screen faded into the
blackness of a space cut through by the quick swaths of ships reeling
across emptiness in deadly battle. The voice continued through the
soundless thunder—</p>
<p>“The most striking action of the battle was the subsidiary combat of
the heavy cruiser Cluster against three enemy ships of the ‘Nova’
class—”</p>
<p>The screen’s view veered and closed in. A great ship sparked and one
of the frantic attackers glowed angrily, twisted out of focus, swung
back and rammed. The Cluster bowed wildly and survived the glancing blow
that drove the attacker off in twisting reflection.</p>
<p>The newsman’s smooth unimpassioned delivery continued to the last
blow and the last hulk.</p>
<p>Then a pause, and a large similar voice-and-picture of the fight off
Mnemon, to which the novelty was added of a lengthy description of a
hit-and-run landing—the picture of a blasted city—huddled and weary
prisoners—and off again.</p>
<p>Mnemon had not long to live.</p>
<p>The pause again—and this time the raucous sound of the expected
brasses. The screen faded into the long, impressively soldier-lined
corridor up which the government spokesman in councilor’s uniform strode
quickly.</p>
<p>The silence was oppressive.</p>
<p>The voice that came at last was solemn, slow and hard:</p>
<p>“By order of our sovereign, it is announced that the planet Haven,
hitherto in warlike opposition to his will, has submitted to the
acceptance of defeat. At this moment, the forces of our sovereign are
occupying the planet. Opposition was scattered, unco-ordinated, and
speedily crushed.”</p>
<p>The scene faded out, the original newsman returned to state
importantly that other developments would be transmitted as they
occurred.</p>
<p>Then there was dance music, and Ebling Mis threw the shield that cut
the power.</p>
<p>Toran rose and walked unsteadily away, without a word. The
psychologist made no move to stop him.</p>
<p>When Bayta stepped out of the kitchen, Mis motioned silence.</p>
<p>He said, “They’ve taken Haven.”</p>
<p>And Bayta said, “Already?” Her eyes were round, and sick with
disbelief.</p>
<p>“Without a fight. Without an unprin—” He stopped and swallowed.
“You’d better leave Toran alone. It’s not pleasant for him. Suppose we
eat without him this once.”</p>
<p>Bayta looked once toward the pilot room, then turned hopelessly.
“Very well!”</p>
<p>Magnifico sat unnoticed at the table. He neither spoke nor ate but
stared ahead with a concentrated fear that seemed to drain all the
vitality out of his thread of a body.</p>
<p>Ebling Mis pushed absently at his iced-fruit dessert and said,
harshly, “Two Trading worlds fight. They fight, and bleed, and die and
don’t surrender. Only at Haven—Just as at the Foundation—”</p>
<p>“But why? Why?”</p>
<p>The psychologist shook his head. “It’s of a piece with all the
problem. Every queer facet is a hint at the nature of the Mule. First,
the problem of how he could conquer the Foundation, with little blood,
and at a single blow essentially—while the Independent Trading Worlds
held out. The blanket on nuclear reactions was a puny weapon—we’ve
discussed that back and forth till I’m sick of it—and it did not work on
any but the Foundation.</p>
<p>“Randu suggested,” and Ebling’s grizzly eyebrows pulled together, “it
might have been a radiant Will-Depresser. It’s what might have done the
work on Haven. But then why wasn’t it used on Mnemon and Iss—which even
now fight with such demonic intensity that it is taking half the
Foundation fleet in addition to the Mule’s forces to beat them down.
Yes, I recognized Foundation ships in the attack.”</p>
<p>Bayta whispered, “The Foundation, then Haven. Disaster seems to
follow us, without touching. We always seem to get out by a hair. Will
it last forever?”</p>
<p>Ebling Mis was not listening. To himself, he was making a point. “But
there’s another problem—another problem. Bayta, you remember the news
item that the Mule’s clown was not found on Terminus; that it was
suspected he had fled to Haven, or been carried there by his original
kidnapers. There is an importance attached to him, Bayta, that doesn’t
fade, and we have not located it yet. Magnifico must know something that
is fatal to the Mule. I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>Magnifico, white and stuttering, protested, “Sire … noble lord …
indeed, I swear it is past my poor reckoning to penetrate your wants. I
have told what I know to the utter limits, and with your probe, you have
drawn out of my meager wit that which I knew, but knew not that I
knew.”</p>
<p>“I know … I know. It is something small. A hint so small that neither
you nor I recognize it for what it is. Yet I must find it—for Mnemon and
Iss will go soon, and when they do, we are the last remnants, the last
droplets of the independent Foundation.”</p>
<p>The stars begin to cluster closely when the core of the Galaxy is
penetrated. Gravitational fields begin to overlap at intensities
sufficient to introduce perturbations in an interstellar jump that
cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Toran became aware of that when a jump landed their ship in the full
glare of a red giant which clutched viciously, and whose grip was
loosed, then wrenched apart, only after twelve sleepless, soul-battering
hours.</p>
<p>With charts limited in scope, and an experience not at all fully
developed, either operationally or mathematically, Toran resigned
himself to days of careful plotting between jumps.</p>
<p>It became a community project of a sort. Ebling Mis checked Toran’s
mathematics and Bayta tested possible routes, by the various generalized
methods, for the presence of real solutions. Even Magnifico was put to
work on the calculating machine for routine computations, a type of
work, which, once explained, was a source of great amusement to him and
at which he was surprisingly proficient.</p>
<p>So at the end of a month, or nearly, Bayta was able to survey the red
line that wormed its way through the ship’s trimensional model of the
Galactic Lens halfway to its center, and say with satiric relish, “You
know what it looks like. It looks like a ten-foot earthworm with a
terrific case of indigestion. Eventually, you’ll land us back in
Haven.”</p>
<p>“I will,” growled Toran, with a fierce rustle of his chart, “if you
don’t shut up.”</p>
<p>“And at that,” continued Bayta, “there is probably a route right
through, straight as a meridian of longitude.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Well, in the first place, dimwit, it probably took five
hundred ships five hundred years to work out that route by hit-and-miss,
and my lousy half-credit charts don’t give it. Besides, maybe those
straight routes are a good thing to avoid. They’re probably choked up
with ships. And besides—”</p>
<p>“Oh, for Galaxy’s sake, stop driveling and slavering so much
righteous indignation.” Her hands were in his hair.</p>
<p>He yowled, “Ouch! Let go!”, seized her wrists, and whipped downward,
whereupon Toran, Bayta, and chair formed a tangled threesome on the
floor. It degenerated into a panting wrestling match, composed mostly of
choking laughter and various foul blows.</p>
<p>Toran broke loose at Magnifico’s breathless entrance.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The lines of anxiety puckered the clown’s face and tightened the skin
whitely over the enormous bridge of his nose. “The instruments are
behaving queerly, sir. I have not, in the knowledge of my ignorance,
touched anything—”</p>
<p>In two seconds, Toran was in the pilot room. He said quietly to
Magnifico, “Wake up Ebling Mis. Have him come down here.”</p>
<p>He said to Bayta, who was trying to get a basic order back to her
hair by use of her fingers, “We’ve been detected, Bay.”</p>
<p>“Detected?” And Bayta’s arms dropped. “By whom?”</p>
<p>“Galaxy knows,” muttered Toran, “but I imagine by someone with
blasters already ranged and trained.”</p>
<p>He sat down and in a low voice was already sending into the sub-ether
the ship’s identification code.</p>
<p>And when Ebling Mis entered, bathrobed and blear-eyed, Toran said
with a desperate calm, “It seems we’re inside the borders of a local
Inner Kingdom which is called the Autarchy of Filia.”</p>
<p>“Never heard of it,” said Mis, abruptly.</p>
<p>“Well, neither did I,” replied Toran, “but we’re being stopped by a
Filian ship just the same, and I don’t know what it will involve.”</p>
<p>The captain-inspector of the Filian ship crowded aboard with six
armed men following him. He was short, thin-haired, thin-lipped, and
dry-skinned. He coughed a sharp cough as he sat down and threw open the
folio under his arm to a blank page.</p>
<p>“Your passports and ship’s clearance, please.”</p>
<p>“We have none,” said Toran.</p>
<p>“None, hey?” he snatched up a microphone suspended from his belt and
spoke into it quickly, “Three men and one woman. Papers not in order.”
He made an accompanying notation in the folio.</p>
<p>He said, “Where are you from?”</p>
<p>“Siwenna,” said Toran warily.</p>
<p>“Where is that?”</p>
<p>“Thirty thousand parsecs, eighty degrees west Trantor, forty
degrees—”</p>
<p>“Never mind, never mind!” Toran could see that his inquisitor had
written down: “Point of origin—Periphery.”</p>
<p>The Filian continued, “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Toran said, “Trantor sector.”</p>
<p>“Purpose?”</p>
<p>“Pleasure trip.”</p>
<p>“Carrying any cargo?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Hm-m-m. We’ll check on that.” He nodded and two men jumped to
activity. Toran made no move to interfere.</p>
<p>“What brings you into Filian territory?” The Filian’s eyes gleamed
unamiably.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know we were. I lack a proper chart.”</p>
<p>“You will be required to pay a hundred credits for that lack—and, of
course, the usual fees required for tariff duties, et cetera.”</p>
<p>He spoke again into the microphone—but listened more than he spoke.
Then, to Toran, “Know anything about nuclear technology?”</p>
<p>“A little,” replied Toran, guardedly.</p>
<p>“Yes?” The Filian closed his folio, and added, “The men of the
Periphery have a knowledgeable reputation that way. Put on a suit and
come with me.”</p>
<p>Bayta stepped forward. “What are you going to do with him?”</p>
<p>Toran put her aside gently, and asked coldly, “Where do you want me
to come?”</p>
<p>“Our power plant needs minor adjustments. He’ll come with you.” His
pointing finger aimed directly at Magnifico, whose brown eyes opened
wide in a blubbery dismay.</p>
<p>“What’s he got to do with it?” demanded Toran fiercely.</p>
<p>The official looked up coldly. “I am informed of pirate activities in
this vicinity. A description of one of the known thugs tallies roughly.
It is a purely routine matter of identification.”</p>
<p>Toran hesitated, but six men and six blasters are eloquent arguments.
He reached into the cupboard for the suits.</p>
<p>An hour later, he rose upright in the bowels of the Filian ship and
raged, “There’s not a thing wrong with the motors that I can see. The
busbars are true, the L-tubes are feeding properly, and the reaction
analysis checks. Who’s in charge here?”</p>
<p>The head engineer said quietly, “I am.”</p>
<p>“Well, get me out of here—”</p>
<p>He was led to the officers’ level and the small anteroom held only an
indifferent ensign.</p>
<p>“Where’s the man who came with me?”</p>
<p>“Please wait,” said the ensign.</p>
<p>It was fifteen minutes later that Magnifico was brought in.</p>
<p>“What did they do to you?” asked Toran quickly.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Nothing at all.” Magnifico’s head shook a slow
negative.</p>
<p>It took two hundred and fifty credits to fulfill the demands of
Filia—fifty credits of it for instant release—and they were in free
space again.</p>
<p>Bayta said with a forced laugh, “Don’t we rate an escort? Don’t we
get the usual figurative boot over the border?”</p>
<p>And Toran replied, grimly, “That was no Filian ship—and we’re not
leaving for a while. Come in here.”</p>
<p>They gathered about him.</p>
<p>He said, whitely, “That was a Foundation ship, and those were the
Mule’s men aboard.”</p>
<p>Ebling bent to pick up the cigar he had dropped. He said, “Here?
We’re fifteen thousand parsecs from the Foundation.”</p>
<p>“And we’re here. What’s to prevent them from making the same trip?
Galaxy, Ebling, don’t you think I can tell ships apart? I saw their
engines, and that’s enough for me. I tell you it was a Foundation engine
in a Foundation ship.”</p>
<p>“And how did they get here?” asked Bayta, logically. “What are the
chances of a random meeting of two given ships in space?”</p>
<p>“What’s that to do with it?” demanded Toran, hotly. “It would only
show we’ve been followed.”</p>
<p>“Followed?” hooted Bayta. “Through hyper-space?”</p>
<p>Ebling Mis interposed wearily, “That can be done—given a good ship
and a great pilot. But the possibility doesn’t impress me.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been masking my trail,” insisted Toran. “I’ve been
building up take-off speed on the straight. A blind man could have
calculated our route.”</p>
<p>“The blazes he could,” cried Bayta. “With the cockeyed jumps you are
making, observing our initial direction didn’t mean a thing. We came out
of the jump wrong-end forwards more than once.”</p>
<p>“We’re wasting time,” blazed Toran, with gritted teeth. “It’s a
Foundation ship under the Mule. It’s stopped us. It’s searched us. It’s
had Magnifico—alone—with me as hostage to keep the rest of you quiet, in
case you suspected. And we’re going to burn it out of space right
now.”</p>
<p>“Hold on now,” and Ebling Mis clutched at him. “Are you going to
destroy us for one ship you think is an enemy? Think, man, would those
scuppers chase us over an impossible route half through the bestinkered
Galaxy, look us over, and then let us go?”</p>
<p>“They’re still interested in where we’re going.”</p>
<p>“Then why stop us and put us on our guard? You can’t have it both
ways, you know.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have it my way. Let go of me, Ebling, or I’ll knock you
down.”</p>
<p>Magnifico leaned forward from his balanced perch on his favorite
chair back. His long nostrils flared with excitement. “I crave your
pardon for my interruption, but my poor mind is of a sudden plagued with
a queer thought.”</p>
<p>Bayta anticipated Toran’s gesture of annoyance, and added her grip to
Ebling’s. “Go ahead and speak, Magnifico. We will all listen
faithfully.”</p>
<p>Magnifico said, “In my stay in their ship what addled wits I have
were bemazed and bemused by a chattering fear that befell men. Of a
truth I have a lack of memory of most that happened. Many men staring at
me, and talk I did not understand. But towards the last—as though a beam
of sunlight had dashed through a cloud rift—there was a face I knew. A
glimpse, the merest glimmer—and yet it glows in my memory ever stronger
and brighter.”</p>
<p>Toran said, “Who was it?”</p>
<p>“That captain who was with us so long a time ago, when first you
saved me from slavery.”</p>
<p>It had obviously been Magnifico’s intention to create a sensation,
and the delighted smile that curled broadly in the shadow of his
proboscis, attested to his realization of the intention’s success.</p>
<p>“Captain … Han … Pritcher?” demanded Mis, sternly. “You’re sure of
that? Certain sure now?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I swear,” and he laid a bone-thin hand upon his narrow chest.
“I would uphold the truth of it before the Mule and swear it in his
teeth, though all his power were behind him to deny it.”</p>
<p>Bayta said in pure wonder, “Then what’s it all about?”</p>
<p>The clown faced her eagerly, “My lady, I have a theory. It came upon
me, ready made, as though the Galactic Spirit had gently laid it in my
mind.” He actually raised his voice above Toran’s interrupting
objection.</p>
<p>“My lady,” he addressed himself exclusively to Bayta, “if this
captain had, like us, escaped with a ship; if he, like us, were on a
trip for a purpose of his own devising; if he blundered upon us—he would
suspect us of following and waylaying him, as we suspect him of the
like. What wonder he played this comedy to enter our ship?”</p>
<p>“Why would he want us in his ship, then?” demanded Toran. “That
doesn’t fit.”</p>
<p>“Why, yes, it does,” clamored the clown, with a flowing inspiration.
“He sent an underling who knew us not, but who described us into his
microphone. The listening captain would be struck at my own poor
likeness—for, of a truth, there are not many in this great Galaxy who
bear a resemblance to my scantiness. I was the proof of the identity of
the rest of you.”</p>
<p>“And so he leaves us?”</p>
<p>“What do we know of his mission, and the secrecy thereof? He has
spied us out for not an enemy and having it done so, must he needs think
it wise to risk his plan by widening the knowledge thereof?”</p>
<p>Bayta said slowly, “Don’t be stubborn, Torie. It does explain
things.”</p>
<p>“It could be,” agreed Mis.</p>
<p>Toran seemed helpless in the face of united resistance. Something in
the clown’s fluent explanations bothered him. Something was wrong. Yet
