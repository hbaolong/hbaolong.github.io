<h4 id="section">11</h4>
<p>The Emperor Agis XIV had no real right to the name. He had adopted it
upon succeeding to the throne with the deliberate purpose of connecting
himself with the Agises who had ruled two thousand years ago, most of
them quite ably—particularly Agis VI, who had ruled for forty-two years
and who had kept order in a prosperous Empire with a firm but
nontyrannical hand.</p>
<p>Agis XIV did not look like any of the old Agises—if the holographic
records had any value. But, then again, truth be told, Agis XIV did not
look much like the official holograph that was distributed to the
public.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Hari Seldon thought, with a twinge of nostalgia,
that Emperor Cleon, for all his flaws and weaknesses, had certainly
looked Imperial.</p>
<p>Agis XIV did not. Seldon had never seen him at close quarters and the
few holographs he had seen were outrageously inaccurate. The Imperial
holographer knew his job and did it well, thought Seldon wryly.</p>
<p>Agis XIV was short, with an unattractive face and slightly bulging
eyes that did not seem alight with intelligence. His only qualification
for the throne was that he was a collateral relative of Cleon.</p>
<p>To do him credit, however, he did not try to play the role of the
mighty Emperor. It was understood that he rather liked to be called the
“Citizen Emperor” and that only Imperial protocol and the outraged
outcry of the Imperial Guard prevented him from exiting the dome and
wandering the walkways of Trantor. Apparently, the story went, he wished
to shake hands with the citizens and hear their complaints in
person.</p>
<p>(Score one for him, thought Seldon, even if it could never come to
pass.)</p>
<p>With a murmur and a bow, Seldon said, “I thank you, Sire, for
consenting to see me.”</p>
<p>Agis XIV had a clear and rather attractive voice, quite out of
keeping with his appearance. He said, “An ex-First Minister must surely
have his privileges, although I must give myself credit for amazing
courage in agreeing to see you.”</p>
<p>There was humor in his words and Seldon found himself suddenly
realizing that a man might not look intelligent and yet might be
intelligent just the same.</p>
<p>“Courage, Sire?”</p>
<p>“Why, of course. Don’t they call you Raven Seldon?”</p>
<p>“I heard the expression, Sire, the other day for the first time.”</p>
<p>“Apparently the reference is to your psychohistory, which seems to
predict the Fall of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“It points out the possibility only, Sire—”</p>
<p>“So that you are coupled with a mythic bird of ill omen. Except that
I think you yourself are the bird of ill omen.”</p>
<p>“I hope not, Sire.”</p>
<p>“Come, come. The record is clear. Eto Demerzel, Cleon’s old First
Minister, was impressed with your work and look what happened—he was
forced out of his position and into exile. The Emperor Cleon himself was
impressed with your work and look what happened—he was assassinated. The
military junta was impressed with your work and look what happened—they
were swept away. Even the Joranumites, it is said, were impressed with
your work and, behold, they were destroyed. And now, O Raven Seldon, you
come to see me. What may I expect?”</p>
<p>“Why, nothing evil, Sire.”</p>
<p>“I imagine not, because unlike all these others I have mentioned, I
am not impressed with your work. Now tell me why you are here.”</p>
<p>He listened carefully and without interruption while Seldon explained
the importance of setting up a Project designed to prepare an
encyclopedia that would preserve human learning if the worst
happened.</p>
<p>“Yes yes,” said Agis XIV finally, “so you are, indeed, convinced the
Empire will fall.”</p>
<p>“It is a strong possibility, Sire, and it would not be prudent to
refuse to take that possibility into account. In a way, I wish to
prevent it if I can—or ameliorate the effects if I can’t.”</p>
<p>“Raven Seldon, if you continue to poke your nose into matters, I am
convinced that the Empire will fall and that nothing can help it.”</p>
<p>“Not so, Sire. I ask only permission to work.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you have that, but I fail to see what it is you wish of me. Why
have you told me all this about an encyclopedia?”</p>
<p>“Because I wish to work in the Galactic Library, Sire, or, more
accurately, I wish others to work there with me.”</p>
<p>“I assure you that I won’t stand in your way.”</p>
<p>“That is not enough, Sire. I want you to help.”</p>
<p>“In what way, ex—First Minister?”</p>
<p>“With funding. The Library must have appropriations or it will close
its doors to the public and evict me.”</p>
<p>“Credits!” A note of astonishment came into the Emperor’s voice. “You
came to me for credits?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire.”</p>
<p>Agis XIV stood up in some agitation. Seldon stood up at once also,
but Agis waved him down.</p>
<p>“Sit down. Don’t treat me as an Emperor. I’m not an Emperor. I didn’t
want this job, but they made me take it. I was the nearest thing to the
Imperial family and they jabbered at me that the Empire needed an
Emperor. So they have me and a lot of good I am to them.</p>
<p>“Credits! You expect me to have credits! You talk about the Empire
disintegrating. How do you suppose it disintegrates? Are you thinking of
rebellion? Of civil war? Of disorders here and there?</p>
<p>“No. Think of credits. Do you realize that I cannot collect any taxes
at all from half the provinces in the Empire? They’re still part of the
Empire—‘Hail the Imperium!’—‘All honor to the Emperor!’—but they don’t
pay anything and I don’t have the necessary force to collect it. And if
I can’t get the credits out of them, they are not really part of the
Empire, are they?</p>
<p>“Credits! The Empire runs a chronic deficit of appalling proportions.
There’s nothing I can pay for. Do you think there is enough funding to
maintain the Imperial Palace grounds? Just barely. I must cut corners. I
must let the Palace decay. I must let the number of retainers die down
by attrition.</p>
<p>“Professor Seldon. If you want credits, I have nothing. Where will I
find appropriations for the Library? They should be grateful I manage to
squeeze out something for them each year at all.” As he finished, the
Emperor held out his hands, palms up, as if to signify the emptiness of
the Imperial coffers.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon was stunned. He said, “Nevertheless, Sire, even if you
lack the credits, you still have the Imperial prestige. Can you not
order the Library to allow me to keep my office and let my colleagues in
to help me with our vital work?”</p>
<p>And now Agis XIV sat down again as though, once the subject was not
credits, he was no longer in a state of agitation.</p>
<p>He said, “You realize that, by long tradition, the Galactic Library
is independent of the Imperium, as far as its self-government is
concerned. It sets up its rules and has done so since Agis VI, my
namesake”—he smiled—“attempted to control the news functions of the
Library. He failed and, if the great Agis VI failed, do you think I can
succeed?”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to use force, Sire. Merely expressing a polite
wish. Surely, when no vital function of the Library is involved, they
will be pleased to honor the Emperor and oblige his wishes.”</p>
<p>“Professor Seldon, how little you know of the Library. I have but to
express a wish, however gently and tentatively, to make it certain that
they will proceed, in dudgeon, to do the opposite. They are very
sensitive to the slightest sign of Imperial control.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Then what do I do?”</p>
<p>“Why, I’ll tell you what. A thought occurs to me. I am a member of
the public and I can visit the Galactic Library if I wish. It is located
on the Palace grounds, so I won’t be violating protocol if I visit it.
Well, you come with me and we shall be ostentatiously friendly. I will
not ask them for anything, but if they note us walking arm-in-arm, then
perhaps some of the precious Board of theirs may feel more kindly toward
you than otherwise. —But that’s all I can do.”</p>
<p>And the deeply disappointed Seldon wondered if that could possibly be
enough.</p>
