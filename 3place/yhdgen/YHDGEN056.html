<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>BRIBERY</p>
<p>Sergeant Mori Luk made an ideal soldier of the ranks. He came from
the huge agricultural planets of the Pleiades where only army life could
break the bond to the soil and the unavailing life of drudgery; and he
was typical of that background. Unimaginative enough to face danger
without fear, he was strong and agile enough to face it successfully. He
accepted orders instantly, drove the men under him unbendingly, and
adored his general unswervingly.</p>
<p>And yet with that, he was of a sunny nature. If he killed a man in
the line of duty without a scrap of hesitation, it was also without a
scrap of animosity.</p>
<p>That Sergeant Luk should signal at the door before entering was
further a sign of tact, for he would have been perfectly within his
rights to enter without signaling.</p>
<p>The two within looked up from their evening meal and one reached out
with his foot to cut off the cracked voice which rattled out of the
battered pocket-transmitter with bright liveliness.</p>
<p>“More books?” asked Lathan Devers.</p>
<p>The sergeant held out the tightly wound cylinder of film and
scratched his neck. “It belongs to Engineer Orre, but he’ll have to have
it back. He’s going to send it to his kids, you know, like what you
might call a souvenir, you know.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr turned the cylinder in his hands with interest. “And where
did the engineer get it? He hasn’t a transmitter also, has he?”</p>
<p>The sergeant shook his head emphatically. He pointed to the
knocked-about remnant at the foot of the bed. “That’s the only one in
the place. This fellow, Orre, now, he got that book from one of these
pig-pen worlds out here we captured. They had it in a big building by
itself and he had to kill a few of the natives that tried to stop him
from taking it.”</p>
<p>He looked at it appraisingly. “It makes a good souvenir—for
kids.”</p>
<p>He paused, then said stealthily, “There’s big news floating about, by
the way. It’s only scuttlebutt, but even so, it’s too good to keep. The
general did it again.” And he nodded slowly, gravely.</p>
<p>“That so?” said Devers. “And what did he do?”</p>
<p>“Finished the Enclosure, that’s all.” The sergeant chuckled with a
fatherly pride. “Isn’t he the corker, though? Didn’t he work it fine?
One of the fellows who’s strong on fancy talk says it went as smooth and
even as the music of the spheres, whatever they are.”</p>
<p>“The big offensive starts now?” asked Barr, mildly.</p>
<p>“Hope so,” was the boisterous response. “I want to get back on my
ship now that my arm is in one piece again. I’m tired of sitting on my
scupper out here.”</p>
<p>“So am I,” muttered Devers, suddenly and savagely. There was a bit of
underlip caught in his teeth, and he worried it.</p>
<p>The sergeant looked at him doubtfully, and said, “I’d better go now.
The captain’s round is due and I’d just as soon he didn’t catch me in
here.”</p>
<p>He paused at the door. “By the way, sir,” he said with sudden,
awkward shyness to the Trader, “I heard from my wife. She says that
little freezer you gave me to send her works fine. It doesn’t cost her
anything, and she just about keeps a month’s supply of food froze up
complete. I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. Forget it.”</p>
<p>The great door moved noiselessly shut behind the grinning
sergeant.</p>
<p>Ducem Barr got out of his chair. “Well, he gives us a fair return for
the freezer. Let’s take a look at this new book. Ahh, the title is
gone.”</p>
<p>He unrolled a yard or so of the film and looked through at the light.
Then he murmured, “Well, skewer me through the scupper, as the sergeant
says. This is ‘The Garden of Summa,’ Devers.”</p>
<p>“That so?” said the Trader, without interest. He shoved aside what
was left of his dinner. “Sit down, Barr. Listening to this old-time
literature isn’t doing me any good. You heard what the sergeant
said?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did. What of it?”</p>
<p>“The offensive will start. And we sit here!”</p>
<p>“Where do you want to sit?”</p>
<p>“You know what I mean. There’s no use just waiting.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there?” Barr was carefully removing the old film from the
transmitter and installing the new. “You told me a good deal of
Foundation history in the last month, and it seems that the great
leaders of past crises did precious little more than sit—and wait.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Barr, but they knew where they were going.”</p>
<p>“Did they? I suppose they said they did when it was over, and for all
I know maybe they did. But there’s no proof that things would not have
worked out as well or better if they had not known where they were
going. The deeper economic and sociological forces aren’t directed by
individual men.”</p>
<p>Devers sneered. “No way of telling that things wouldn’t have worked
out worse, either. You’re arguing tail-end backwards.” His eyes were
brooding. “You know, suppose I blasted him?”</p>
<p>“Whom? Riose?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Barr sighed. His aging eyes were troubled with a reflection of the
long past. “Assassination isn’t the way out, Devers. I once tried it,
under provocation, when I was twenty—but it solved nothing. I removed a
villain from Siwenna, but not the Imperial yoke; and it was the Imperial
yoke and not the villain that mattered.”</p>
<p>“But Riose is not just a villain, doc. He’s the whole blamed army. It
would fall apart without him. They hang on him like babies. The sergeant
out there slobbers every time he mentions him.”</p>
<p>“Even so. There are other armies and other leaders. You must go
deeper. There is this Brodrig, for instance—no one more than he has the
ear of the Emperor. He could demand hundreds of ships where Riose must
struggle with ten. I know him by reputation.”</p>
<p>“That so? What about him?” The Trader’s eyes lost in frustration what
they gained in sharp interest.</p>
<p>“You want a pocket outline? He’s a low-born rascal who has by
unfailing flattery tickled the whims of the Emperor. He’s well-hated by
the court aristocracy, vermin themselves, because he can lay claim to
neither family nor humility. He is the Emperor’s adviser in all things,
and the Emperor’s tool in the worst things. He is faithless by choice
but loyal by necessity. There is not a man in the Empire as subtle in
villainy or as crude in his pleasures. And they say there is no way to
the Emperor’s favor but through him; and no way to his, but through
infamy.”</p>
<p>“Wow!” Devers pulled thoughtfully at his neatly trimmed beard. “And
he’s the old boy the Emperor sent out here to keep an eye on Riose. Do
you know I have an idea?”</p>
<p>“I do now.”</p>
<p>“Suppose this Brodrig takes a dislike to our young Army’s
Delight?”</p>
<p>“He probably has already. He’s not noted for a capacity for
liking.”</p>
<p>“Suppose it gets really bad. The Emperor might hear about it, and
Riose might be in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. Quite likely. But how do you propose to get that to
happen?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I suppose he could be bribed?”</p>
<p>The patrician laughed gently. “Yes, in a way, but not in the manner
you bribed the sergeant—not with a pocket freezer. And even if you reach
his scale, it wouldn’t be worth it. There’s probably no one so easily
bribed, but he lacks even the fundamental honesty of honorable
corruption. He doesn’t stay bribed; not for any sum. Think of something
else.”</p>
<p>Devers swung a leg over his knee and his toe nodded quickly and
restlessly. “It’s the first hint, though—”</p>
<p>He stopped; the door signal was flashing once again, and the sergeant
was on the threshold once more. He was excited, and his broad face was
red and unsmiling.</p>
<p>“Sir,” he began, in an agitated attempt at deference, “I am very
thankful for the freezer, and you have always spoken to me very fine,
although I am only the son of a farmer and you are great lords.”</p>
<p>His Pleiades accent had grown thick, almost too much so for easy
comprehension; and with excitement, his lumpish peasant derivation wiped
out completely the soldierly bearing so long and so painfully
cultivated.</p>
<p>Barr said softly, “What is it, sergeant?”</p>
<p>“Lord Brodrig is coming to see you. Tomorrow! I know, because the
captain told me to have my men ready for dress review tomorrow for … for
him. I thought—I might warn you.”</p>
<p>Barr said, “Thank you, sergeant, we appreciate that. But it’s all
right, man; no need for—”</p>
<p>But the look on Sergeant Luk’s face was now unmistakably one of fear.
He spoke in a rough whisper, “You don’t hear the stories the men tell
about him. He has sold himself to the space fiend. No, don’t laugh.
There are most terrible tales told about him. They say he has men with
blast-guns who follow him everywhere, and when he wants pleasure, he
just tells them to blast down anyone they meet. And they do—and he
laughs. They say even the Emperor is in terror of him, and that he
forces the Emperor to raise taxes and won’t let him listen to the
complaints of the people.</p>
<p>“And he hates the general, that’s what they say. They say he would
like to kill the general, because the general is so great and wise. But
he can’t because our general is a match for anyone and he knows Lord
Brodrig is a bad ’un.”</p>
<p>The sergeant blinked; smiled in a sudden incongruous shyness at his
own outburst; and backed toward the door. He nodded his head, jerkily.
“You mind my words. Watch him.”</p>
<p>He ducked out.</p>
<p>And Devers looked up, hard-eyed. “This breaks things our way, doesn’t
it, doc?”</p>
<p>“It depends,” said Barr, dryly, “on Brodrig, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>But Devers was thinking, not listening.</p>
<p>He was thinking hard.</p>
<p>Lord Brodrig ducked his head as he stepped into the cramped living
quarters of the trading ship, and his two armed guards followed quickly,
with bared guns and the professionally hard scowls of the hired
bravos.</p>
<p>The Privy Secretary had little of the look of the lost soul about him
just then. If the space fiend had bought him, he had left no visible
mark of possession. Rather might Brodrig have been considered a breath
of court-fashion come to enliven the hard, bare ugliness of an army
base.</p>
<p>The stiff, tight lines of his sheened and immaculate costume gave him
the illusion of height, from the very top of which his cold, emotionless
eyes stared down the declivity of a long nose at the trader. The
mother-of-pearl ruches at his wrists fluttered filmily as he brought his
ivory stick to the ground before him and leaned upon it daintily.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, with a little gesture, “you remain here. Forget your
toys; I am not interested in them.”</p>
<p>He drew forth a chair, dusted it carefully with the iridescent square
of fabric attached to the top of his white stick, and seated himself.
Devers glanced towards the mate to the chair, but Brodrig said lazily,
“You will stand in the presence of a Peer of the Realm.”</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Devers shrugged. “If you’re not interested in my stock in trade, what
am I here for?”</p>
<p>The Privy Secretary waited coldly, and Devers added a slow,
“Sir.”</p>
<p>“For privacy,” said the secretary. “Now is it likely that I would
come two hundred parsecs through space to inspect trinkets? It’s you I
want to see.” He extracted a small pink tablet from an engraved box and
placed it delicately between his teeth. He sucked it slowly and
appreciatively.</p>
<p>“For instance,” he said, “who are you? Are you really a citizen of
this barbarian world that is creating all this fury of military
frenzy?”</p>
<p>Devers nodded gravely.</p>
<p>“And you were really captured by him after the beginning of this
squabble he calls a war? I am referring to our young general.”</p>
<p>Devers nodded again.</p>
<p>“So! Very well, my worthy Outlander. I see your fluency of speech is
at a minimum. I shall smooth the way for you. It seems that our general
here is fighting an apparently meaningless war with frightful transports
of energy—and this over a forsaken fleabite of a world at the end of
nowhere, which to a logical man would not seem worth a single blast of a
single gun. Yet the general is not illogical. On the contrary, I would
say he was extremely intelligent. Do you follow me?”</p>
<p>“Can’t say I do, sir.”</p>
<p>The secretary inspected his fingernails and said, “Listen further,
then. The general would not waste his men and ships on a sterile feat of
glory. I know he talks of glory and of Imperial honor, but it is quite
obvious that the affectation of being one of the insufferable old
demigods of the Heroic Age won’t wash. There is something more than
glory here—and he does take queer, unnecessary care of you. Now if you
were my prisoner and told me as little of use as you have our general, I
would slit open your abdomen and strangle you with your own
intestines.”</p>
<p>Devers remained wooden. His eyes moved slightly, first to one of the
secretary’s bully-boys, and then to the other. They were ready; eagerly
ready.</p>
<p>The secretary smiled. “Well, now, you’re a silent devil. According to
the general, even a Psychic Probe made no impression, and that was a
mistake on his part, by the way, for it convinced me that our young
military whizz-bang was lying.” He seemed in high humor.</p>
<p>“My honest tradesman,” he said, “I have a Psychic Probe of my own,
one that ought to suit you peculiarly well. You see this—”</p>
<p>And between thumb and forefinger, held negligently, were intricately
designed, pink-and-yellow rectangles which were most definitely obvious
in identity.</p>
<p>Devers said so. “It looks like cash,” he said.</p>
<p>“Cash it is—and the best cash of the Empire, for it is backed by my
estates, which are more extensive than the Emperor’s own. A hundred
thousand credits. All here! Between two fingers! Yours!”</p>
<p>“For what, sir? I am a good Trader, but all trades go in both
directions.”</p>
<p>“For what? For the truth! What is the general after? Why is he
fighting this war?”</p>
<p>Lathan Devers sighed, and smoothed his beard thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“What he’s after?” His eyes were following the motions of the
secretary’s hands as he counted the money slowly, bill by bill. “In a
word, the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Hmp. How ordinary! It always comes to that in the end. But how? What
is the road that leads from the Galaxy’s edge to the peak of Empire so
broadly and invitingly?”</p>
<p>“The Foundation,” said Devers, bitterly, “has secrets. They have
books, old books—so old that the language they are in is only known to a
few of the top men. But the secrets are shrouded in ritual and religion,
and none may use them. I tried and now I am here—and there is a death
sentence waiting for me, there.”</p>
<p>“I see. And these old secrets? Come, for one hundred thousand I
deserve the intimate details.”</p>
<p>“The transmutation of elements,” said Devers, shortly.</p>
<p>The secretary’s eyes narrowed and lost some of their detachment. “I
have been told that practical transmutation is impossible by the laws of
nucleics.”</p>
<p>“So it is, if nuclear forces are used. But the ancients were smart
boys. There are sources of power greater than the nuclei and more
fundamental. If the Foundation used those sources as I suggested—”</p>
<p>Devers felt a soft, creeping sensation in his stomach. The bait was
dangling; the fish was nosing it.</p>
<p>The secretary said suddenly, “Continue. The general, I am sure, is
aware of all this. But what does he intend doing once he finishes this
opéra-bouffe affair?”</p>
<p>Devers kept his voice rock-steady. “With transmutation he controls
the economy of the whole setup of your Empire. Mineral holdings won’t be
worth a sneeze when Riose can make tungsten out of aluminum and iridium
out of iron. An entire production system based on the scarcity of
certain elements and the abundance of others is thrown completely out of
whack. There’ll be the greatest disjointment the Empire has ever seen,
and only Riose will be able to stop it. And there is the question of
this new power I mentioned, the use of which won’t give Riose religious
heebies.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing that can stop him now. He’s got the Foundation by
the back of the neck, and once he’s finished with it, he’ll be Emperor
in two years.”</p>
<p>“So.” Brodrig laughed lightly. “Iridium out of iron, that’s what you
said, isn’t it? Come, I’ll tell you a state secret. Do you know that the
Foundation has already been in communication with the general?”</p>
<p>Devers’s back stiffened.</p>
<p>“You look surprised. Why not? It seems logical now. They offered him
a hundred tons of iridium a year to make peace. A hundred tons of iron
converted to iridium in violation of their religious principles to save
their necks. Fair enough, but no wonder our rigidly incorruptible
general refused—when he can have the iridium and the Empire as well. And
poor Cleon called him his one honest general. My bewhiskered merchant,
you have earned your money.”</p>
<p>He tossed it, and Devers scrambled after the flying bills.</p>
<p>Lord Brodrig stopped at the door and turned. “One reminder, Trader.
My playmates with the guns here have neither middle ears, tongues,
education, nor intelligence. They can neither hear, speak, write, nor
even make sense to a Psychic Probe. But they are very expert at
interesting executions. I have bought you, man, at one hundred thousand
credits. You will be good and worthy merchandise. Should you forget that
you are bought at any time and attempt to … say … repeat our
conversation to Riose, you will be executed. But executed my way.”</p>
<p>And in that delicate face there were sudden hard lines of eager
cruelty that changed the studied smile into a red-lipped snarl. For one
fleeting second, Devers saw that space fiend who had bought his buyer
look out of his buyer’s eyes.</p>
<p>Silently, he preceded the two thrusting blast-guns of Brodrig’s
“playmates” to his quarters.</p>
<p>And to Ducem Barr’s question, he said with brooding satisfaction,
“No, that’s the queerest part of it. He bribed me.”</p>
<p>Two months of difficult war had left their mark on Bel Riose. There
was heavy-handed gravity about him; and he was short-tempered.</p>
<p>It was with impatience that he addressed the worshiping Sergeant Luk.
“Wait outside, soldier, and conduct these men back to their quarters
when I am through. No one is to enter until I call. No one at all, you
understand.”</p>
<p>The sergeant saluted himself stiffly out of the room, and Riose with
muttered disgust scooped up the waiting papers on his desk, threw them
into the top drawer, and slammed it shut.</p>
<p>“Take seats,” he said shortly, to the waiting two. “I haven’t much
time. Strictly speaking, I shouldn’t be here at all, but it is necessary
to see you.”</p>
<p>He turned to Ducem Barr, whose long fingers were caressing with
interest the crystal cube in which was set the simulacrum of the lined,
austere face of His Imperial Majesty, Cleon II.</p>
<p>“In the first place, patrician,” said the general, “your Seldon is
losing. To be sure, he battles well, for these men of the Foundation
swarm like senseless bees and fight like madmen. Every planet is
defended viciously, and once taken, every planet heaves so with
rebellion it is as much trouble to hold as to conquer. But they are
taken, and they are held. Your Seldon is losing.”</p>
<p>“But he has not yet lost,” murmured Barr politely.</p>
<p>“The Foundation itself retains less optimism. They offer me millions
in order that I may not put this Seldon to the final test.”</p>
<p>“So rumor goes.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is rumor preceding me? Does it prate also of the latest?”</p>
<p>“What is the latest?”</p>
<p>“Why, that Lord Brodrig, the darling of the Emperor, is now second in
command at his own request.”</p>
<p>Devers spoke for the first time. “At his own request, boss? How come?
Or are you growing to like the fellow?” He chuckled.</p>
<p>Riose said, calmly, “No, can’t say I do. It’s just that he bought the
office at what I considered a fair and adequate price.”</p>
<p>“Such as?”</p>
<p>“Such as a request to the Emperor for reinforcements.”</p>
<p>Devers’s contemptuous smile broadened. “He has communicated with the
Emperor, huh? And I take it, boss, you’re just waiting for these
reinforcements, but they’ll come any day. Right?”</p>
<p>“Wrong! They have already come. Five ships of the line; smooth and
strong, with a personal message of congratulations from the Emperor, and
more ships on the way. What’s wrong, Trader?” he asked,
sardonically.</p>
<p>Devers spoke through suddenly frozen lips. “Nothing!”</p>
<p>Riose strode out from behind his desk and faced the Trader, hand on
the butt of his blast-gun.</p>
<p>“I say, what’s wrong, Trader? The news would seem to disturb you.
Surely, you have no sudden birth of interest in the Foundation.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes—there are queer points about you.”</p>
<p>“That so, boss?” Devers smiled tightly, and balled the fists in his
pockets. “Just you line them up and I’ll knock them down for you.”</p>
<p>“Here they are. You were caught easily. You surrendered at first blow
with a burnt-out shield. You’re quite ready to desert your world, and
that without a price. Interesting, all this, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I crave to be on the winning side, boss. I’m a sensible man; you
called me that yourself.”</p>
<p>Riose said with tight throatiness, “Granted! Yet no Trader since has
been captured. No trade ship but has had the speed to escape at choice.
No trade ship but has had a screen that could take all the beating a
light cruiser could give it, should it choose to fight. And no Trader
but has fought to death when occasion warranted. Traders have been
traced as the leaders and instigators of the guerrilla warfare on
occupied planets and of the flying raids in occupied space.</p>
<p>“Are you the only sensible man then? You neither fight nor flee, but
turn traitor without urging. You are unique, amazingly unique—in fact,
suspiciously unique.”</p>
<p>Devers said softly, “I take your meaning, but you have nothing on me.
I’ve been here now six months, and I’ve been a good boy.”</p>
<p>“So you have, and I have repaid you by good treatment. I have left
your ship undisturbed and treated you with every consideration. Yet you
fall short. Freely offered information, for instance, on your gadgets
might have been helpful. The atomic principles on which they are built
would seem to be used in some of the Foundation’s nastiest weapons.
Right?”</p>
<p>“I am only a Trader,” said Devers, “and not one of these bigwig
technicians. I sell the stuff; I don’t make it.”</p>
<p>“Well, that will be seen shortly. It is what I came here for. For
instance, your ship will be searched for a personal force-shield. You
have never worn one; yet all soldiers of the Foundation do. It will be
significant evidence that there is information you do not choose to give
me. Right?”</p>
<p>There was no answer. He continued, “And there will be more direct
evidence. I have brought with me the Psychic Probe. It failed once
before, but contact with the enemy is a liberal education.”</p>
<p>His voice was smoothly threatening and Devers felt the gun thrust
hard into his midriff—the general’s gun, hitherto in its holster.</p>
<p>The general said quietly, “You will remove your wristband and any
other metal ornament you wear and give them to me. Slowly! Atomic fields
can be distorted, you see, and Psychic Probes might probe only into
static. That’s right. I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>The receiver on the general’s desk was glowing and a message capsule
clicked into the slot, near which Barr stood and still held the
trimensional Imperial bust.</p>
<p>Riose stepped behind his desk, with his blast-gun held ready. He said
to Barr, “You too, patrician. Your wristband condemns you. You have been
helpful earlier, however, and I am not vindictive, but I shall judge the
fate of your behostaged family by the results of the Psychic Probe.”</p>
<p>And as Riose leaned over to take out the message capsule, Barr lifted
the crystal-enveloped bust of Cleon and quietly and methodically brought
it down upon the general’s head.</p>
<p>It happened too suddenly for Devers to grasp. It was as if a sudden
demon had grown into the old man.</p>
<p>“Out!” said Barr, in a tooth-clenched whisper. “Quickly!” He seized
Riose’s dropped blaster and buried it in his blouse.</p>
<p>Sergeant Luk turned as they emerged from the narrowest possible crack
of the door.</p>
<p>Barr said easily, “Lead on, sergeant!”</p>
<p>Devers closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Sergeant Luk led in silence to their quarters, and then, with the
briefest pause, continued onward, for there was the nudge of a blast-gun
muzzle in his ribs, and a hard voice in his ears which said, “To the
trade ship.”</p>
<p>Devers stepped forward to open the air lock, and Barr said, “Stand
where you are, Luk. You’ve been a decent man, and we’re not going to
kill you.”</p>
<p>But the sergeant recognized the monogram on the gun. He cried in
choked fury, “You’ve killed the general!”</p>
<p>With a wild, incoherent yell, he charged blindly upon the blasting
fury of the gun and collapsed in blasted ruin.</p>
<p>The trade ship was rising above the dead planet before the signal
lights began their eerie blink, and against the creamy cobweb of the
great Lens in the sky which was the Galaxy, other black forms rose.</p>
<p>Devers said grimly, “Hold tight, Barr—and let’s see if they’ve got a
ship that can match my speed.”</p>
<p>He knew they hadn’t!</p>
<p>And once in open space, the Trader’s voice seemed lost and dead as he
said, “The line I fed Brodrig was a little too good. It seems as if he’s
thrown in with the general.”</p>
<p>Swiftly they raced into the depths of the starmass that was the
Galaxy.</p>
