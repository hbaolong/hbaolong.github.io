<h4 id="section">19</h4>
<p>The magistrate looked sourly at Seldon as he gave his story.</p>
<p>The magistrate said, “What makes you think it was the intention of
this man you struck to attack you? Did he strike you? Did he threaten
you? Did he in any way place you under bodily fear?”</p>
<p>“My granddaughter was aware of his approach and was quite certain
that he was planning to attack me.”</p>
<p>“Surely, sir, that cannot be enough. Is there anything else you can
tell me before I pass judgment?”</p>
<p>“Well now, wait a while,” said Seldon indignantly. “Don’t pass
judgment so quickly. I was assaulted a few weeks ago by eight men whom I
held off with the help of my son. So, you see, I have reason to think
that I might be assaulted again.”</p>
<p>The magistrate shuffled his papers. “Assaulted by eight men. Did you
report that?”</p>
<p>“There were no security officers around. Not one.”</p>
<p>“Aside from the point. Did you report it?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“For one thing, I was afraid of getting into long drawn-out legal
proceedings. Since we had driven off eight men and were safe, it seemed
useless to ask for more trouble.”</p>
<p>“How did you manage to ward off eight men—just you and your son?”</p>
<p>Seldon hesitated. “My son is now on Santanni and outside Trantorian
control. Thus, I can tell you that he had Dahlite knives and was expert
in their use. He killed one man and badly hurt two others. The rest ran,
carrying off the dead and wounded.”</p>
<p>“But did you not report the death of a man and the wounding of two
others?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. Same reason as before. And we fought in self-defense.
However, if you can track down the three dead and wounded, you will have
evidence that we were attacked.”</p>
<p>The magistrate said, “Track down one dead and two wounded nameless
faceless Trantorians? Are you aware that on Trantor over two thousand
people are found dead every day—by knife wounds alone. Unless these
things are reported to us at once, we are helpless. Your story of being
assaulted once before will not hold water. What we must do is deal with
the events of today, which were reported and which had a security
officer as a witness.</p>
<p>“So, let’s consider the situation as of now. Why do you think the
fellow was going to attack? Simply because you happened to be passing
by? Because you seemed old and defenseless? Because you looked like you
might be carrying a great deal of credits? What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I think, Magistrate, it was because of who I am.”</p>
<p>The magistrate looked at his papers. “You are Hari Seldon, a
professor and a scholar. Why should that make you subject to assault,
particularly?”</p>
<p>“Because of my views.”</p>
<p>“Your views. Well—” The magistrate shuffled some papers
perfunctorily. Suddenly he stopped and looked up, peering at Seldon.
“Wait—Hari Seldon.” A look of recognition spread across his face.
“You’re the psychohistory buff, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Magistrate.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I don’t know anything about it except the name and the
fact that you go around predicting the end of the Empire or something
like that.”</p>
<p>“Not quite, Magistrate. But my views have become unpopular because
they are proving to be true. I believe it is for that reason that there
are those who want to assault me or, even more likely, are being paid to
assault me.”</p>
<p>The magistrate stared at Seldon and then called over the arresting
security officer. “Did you check up on the man who was hurt? Does he
have a record?”</p>
<p>The security officer cleared her throat. “Yes, sir. He’s been
arrested several times. Assault, mugging.”</p>
<p>“Oh, he’s a repeat offender, is he? And does the professor have a
record?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“So we have an old and innocent man fighting off a known mugger—and
you arrest the old and innocent man. Is that it?”</p>
<p>The security officer was silent.</p>
<p>The magistrate said, “You may go, Professor.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. May I have my cane?”</p>
<p>The magistrate snapped his fingers at the officer, who handed over
the cane.</p>
<p>“But one thing, Professor,” said the magistrate. “If you use that
cane again, you had better be absolutely certain you can prove it was in
self-defense. Otherwise—”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” And Hari Seldon left the magistrate’s chambers, leaning
heavily on his cane but with his head held high.</p>
