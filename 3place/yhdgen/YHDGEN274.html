<h4 id="section">17</h4>
<p>Raych kept his eyes down. He had taken a quick look at Namarti and it
was all he needed. He had met the man ten years before, when Raych had
been sent to lure Jo-Jo Joranum to his destruction, and one look was
more than enough.</p>
<p>Namarti had changed little in ten years. Anger and hatred were still
the dominant characteristics one could see in him—or that Raych could
see in him, at any rate, for he realized he was not an impartial
witness—and those seemed to have marinated him into leathery permanence.
His face was a trifle more gaunt, his hair was flecked with gray, but
his thin-lipped mouth was set in the same harsh line and his dark eyes
were as brilliantly dangerous as ever.</p>
<p>That was enough and Raych kept his eyes averted. Namarti, he felt,
was not the type of person who would take to someone who could stare him
straight in the face.</p>
<p>Namarti seemed to devour Raych with his own eyes, but the slight
sneer his face always seemed to wear remained.</p>
<p>He turned to Andorin, who stood uneasily to one side, and said, quite
as though the subject of conversation were not present, “This is the
man, then.”</p>
<p>Andorin nodded and his lips moved in a soundless “Yes, Chief.”</p>
<p>Namarti said to Raych abruptly, “Your name.”</p>
<p>“Planchet, sir.”</p>
<p>“You believe in our cause?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” He spoke carefully, in accordance with Andorin’s
instructions. “I am a democrat and want greater participation of the
people in the governmental process.”</p>
<p>Namarti’s eyes flicked in Andorin’s direction. “A speechmaker.”</p>
<p>He looked back at Raych. “Are you willing to undertake risks for the
cause?”</p>
<p>“Any risk, sir.”</p>
<p>“You will do as you are told? No questions? No hanging back?”</p>
<p>“I will follow orders.”</p>
<p>“Do you know anything about gardening?”</p>
<p>Raych hesitated. “No, sir.”</p>
<p>“You’re a Trantorian, then? Born under the dome?”</p>
<p>“I was born in Millimaru, sir, and I was brought up in Dahl.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Namarti. Then to Andorin, “Take him out and deliver
him temporarily to the men waiting there. They will take good care of
him. Then come back, Andorin. I want to speak to you.”</p>
<p>When Andorin returned, a profound change had come over Namarti. His
eyes were glittering and his mouth was twisted into a feral grin.</p>
<p>“Andorin,” he said, “the gods we spoke of the other day are with us
to an extent I couldn’t have imagined.”</p>
<p>“I told you the man was suitable for our purposes.”</p>
<p>“Far more suitable than you think. You know, of course, the tale of
how Hari Seldon, our revered First Minister, sent his son—or foster son,
rather—to see Joranum and to set the trap into which Joranum, against my
advice, fell.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Andorin, nodding wearily, “I know the story.” He said it
with the air of one who knew the story entirely too well.</p>
<p>“I saw that boy only that once, but his image burned into my brain.
Do you suppose that ten years’ passage and false heels and a shaved
mustache could fool me? That Planchet of yours is Raych, the foster son
of Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>Andorin paled and held his breath for a moment. He said, “Are you
sure of that, Chief?”</p>
<p>“As sure as I am that you’re standing here in front of me and that
you have introduced an enemy into our midst.”</p>
<p>“I had no idea—”</p>
<p>“Don’t get nervous,” said Namarti. “I consider it the best thing you
have ever done in your idle aristocratic life. You have played the role
that the gods have marked out for you. If I had not known who he was, he
might have fulfilled the function for which he was undoubtedly intended:
to be a spy in our midst and an informant of our most secret plans. But
since I know who he is, it won’t work that way. Instead, we now have
everything.” Namarti rubbed his hands together in delight and,
haltingly, as if he realized how far out of character it was for him, he
smiled—and laughed.</p>
