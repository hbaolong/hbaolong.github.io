<h4 id="section">5</h4>
<p>THE WAR BEGINS</p>
<p>From the radiating point of Siwenna, the forces of the Empire reached
out cautiously into the black unknown of the Periphery. Giant ships
passed the vast distances that separated the vagrant stars at the
Galaxy’s rim, and felt their way around the outermost edge of Foundation
influence.</p>
<p>Worlds isolated in their new barbarism of two centuries felt the
sensation once again of Imperial overlords upon their soil. Allegiance
was sworn in the face of the massive artillery covering capital
cities.</p>
<p>Garrisons were left; garrisons of men in Imperial uniform with the
Spaceship-and-Sun insignia upon their shoulders. The old men took notice
and remembered once again the forgotten tales of their grandfathers’
fathers of the times when the universe was big, and rich, and peaceful
and that same Spaceship-and-Sun ruled all.</p>
<p>Then the great ships passed on to weave their line of forward bases
further around the Foundation. And as each world was knotted into its
proper place in the fabric, the report went back to Bel Riose at the
General Headquarters he had established on the rocky barrenness of a
wandering sunless planet.</p>
<p>Now Riose relaxed and smiled grimly at Ducem Barr. “Well, what do you
think, patrician?”</p>
<p>“I? Of what value are my thoughts? I am not a military man.” He took
in with one wearily distasteful glance the crowded disorder of the
rock-bound room which had been carved out of the wall of a cavern of
artificial air, light, and heat which marked the single bubble of life
in the vastness of a bleak world.</p>
<p>“For the help I could give you,” he muttered, “or would want to give
you, you might return me to Siwenna.”</p>
<p>“Not yet. Not yet.” The general turned his chair to the corner which
held the huge, brilliantly transparent sphere that mapped the old
Imperial prefect of Anacreon and its neighboring sectors. “Later, when
this is over, you will go back to your books and to more. I’ll see to it
that the estates of your family are restored to you and to your children
for the rest of time.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Barr, with faint irony, “but I lack your faith in
the happy outcome of all this.”</p>
<p>Riose laughed harshly, “Don’t start your prophetic croakings again.
This map speaks louder than all your woeful theories.” He caressed its
curved invisible outline gently. “Can you read a map in radial
projection? You can? Well, here, see for yourself. The stars in gold
represent the Imperial territories. The red stars are those in
subjection to the Foundation and the pink are those which are probably
within the economic sphere of influence. Now watch—”</p>
<p>Riose’s hand covered a rounded knob, and slowly an area of hard,
white pinpoints changed into a deepening blue. Like an inverted cup they
folded about the red and the pink.</p>
<p>“Those blue stars have been taken over by my forces,” said Riose with
quiet satisfaction, “and they still advance. No opposition has appeared
anywhere. The barbarians are quiet. And particularly, no opposition has
come from Foundation forces. They sleep peacefully and well.”</p>
<p>“You spread your force thinly, don’t you?” asked Barr.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact,” said Riose, “despite appearances, I don’t. The
key points which I garrison and fortify are relatively few, but they are
carefully chosen. The result is that the force expended is small, but
the strategic result great. There are many advantages, more than would
ever appear to anyone who hasn’t made a careful study of spatial
tactics, but it is apparent to anyone, for instance, that I can base an
attack from any point in an enclosing sphere, and that when I am
finished it will be impossible for the Foundation to attack at flank or
rear. I shall have no flank or rear with respect to them.</p>
<p>“This strategy of the Previous Enclosure has been tried before,
notably in the campaigns of Loris VI, some two thousand years ago, but
always imperfectly; always with the knowledge and attempted interference
of the enemy. This is different.”</p>
<p>“The ideal textbook case?” Barr’s voice was languid and
indifferent.</p>
<p>Riose was impatient, “You still think my forces will fail?”</p>
<p>“They must.”</p>
<p>“You understand that there is no case in military history where an
Enclosure has been completed that the attacking forces have not
eventually won, except where an outside Navy exists in sufficient force
to break the Enclosure.”</p>
<p>“If you say so.”</p>
<p>“And you still adhere to your faith.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Riose shrugged. “Then do so.”</p>
<p>Barr allowed the angry silence to continue for a moment, then asked
quietly, “Have you received an answer from the Emperor?”</p>
<p>Riose removed a cigarette from a wall container behind his head,
placed a filter tip between his lips, and puffed it aflame carefully. He
said, “You mean my request for reinforcements? It came, but that’s all.
Just the answer.”</p>
<p>“No ships.”</p>
<p>“None. I half-expected that. Frankly, patrician, I should never have
allowed myself to be stampeded by your theories into requesting them in
the first place. It puts me in a false light.”</p>
<p>“Does it?”</p>
<p>“Definitely. Ships are at a premium. The civil wars of the last two
centuries have smashed up more than half of the Grand Fleet and what’s
left is in pretty shaky condition. You know it isn’t as if the ships we
build these days are worth anything. I don’t think there’s a man in the
Galaxy today who can build a first-rate hypernuclear motor.”</p>
<p>“I knew that,” said the Siwennian. His eyes were thoughtful and
introspective. “I didn’t know that you knew it. So his Imperial Majesty
can spare no ships. Psychohistory could have predicted that; in fact, it
probably did. I should say that Hari Seldon’s dead hand wins the opening
round.”</p>
<p>Riose answered sharply, “I have enough ships as it is. Your Seldon
wins nothing. Should the situation turn more serious, then more ships
will be available. As yet, the Emperor does not know all the story.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? What haven’t you told him?”</p>
<p>“Obviously—your theories.” Riose looked sardonic. “The story is, with
all respect to you, inherently improbable. If developments warrant; if
events supply me with proof, then, but only then, would I make out the
case of mortal danger.</p>
<p>“And in addition,” Riose drove on, casually, “the story, unbolstered
by fact, has a flavor of lése-majesté that could scarcely be pleasant to
His Imperial Majesty.”</p>
<p>The old patrician smiled. “You mean that telling him his august
throne is in danger of subversion by a parcel of ragged barbarians from
the ends of the universe is not a warning to be believed or appreciated.
Then you expect nothing from him.”</p>
<p>“Unless you count a special envoy as something.”</p>
<p>“And why a special envoy?”</p>
<p>“It’s an old custom. A direct representative of the crown is present
on every military campaign which is under government auspices.”</p>
<p>“Really? Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s a method of preserving the symbol of personal Imperial
leadership in all campaigns. It’s gained a secondary function of
insuring the fidelity of generals. It doesn’t always succeed in that
respect.”</p>
<p>“You’ll find that inconvenient, general. Extraneous authority, I
mean.”</p>
<p>“I don’t doubt that,” Riose reddened faintly, “but it can’t be
helped—”</p>
<p>The receiver at the general’s hand glowed warmly, and with an
unobtrusive jar, the cylindered communication popped into its slot.
Riose unrolled it. “Good! This is it!”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr raised a mildly questioning eyebrow.</p>
<p>Riose said, “You know we’ve captured one of these Trader people.
Alive—and with his ship intact.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard talk of it.”</p>
<p>“Well, they’ve just brought him in, and we’ll have him here in a
minute. You keep your seat, patrician. I want you here when I’m
questioning him. It’s why I asked you here today in the first place. You
may understand him where I might miss important points.”</p>
<p>The door signal sounded and a touch of the general’s toe swung the
door wide. The man who stood on the threshold was tall and bearded, wore
a short coat of a soft, leathery plastic, with an attached hood shoved
back on his neck. His hands were free, and if he noticed the men about
him were armed, he did not trouble to indicate it.</p>
<p>He stepped in casually, and looked about with calculating eyes. He
favored the general with a rudimentary wave of the hand and a half
nod.</p>
<p>“Your name?” demanded Riose, crisply.</p>
<p>“Lathan Devers.” The Trader hooked his thumbs into his wide and gaudy
belt. “Are you the boss here?”</p>
<p>“You are a Trader of the Foundation?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Listen, if you’re the boss, you’d better tell your
hired men here to lay off my cargo.”</p>
<p>The general raised his head and regarded the prisoner coldly. “Answer
questions. Do not volunteer orders.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’m agreeable. But one of your boys blasted a two-foot
hole in his chest already, by sticking his fingers where he wasn’t
supposed to.”</p>
<p>Riose shifted his gaze to the lieutenant in charge. “Is this man
telling the truth? Your report, Vrank, had it that no lives were
lost.”</p>
<p>“None were, sir,” the lieutenant spoke stiffly, apprehensively, “at
the time. There was later some disposition to search the ship, there
having arisen a rumor that a woman was aboard. Instead, sir, many
instruments of unknown nature were located, instruments which the
prisoner claims to be his stock-in-trade. One of them flashed on
handling, and the soldier holding it died.”</p>
<p>The general turned back to the Trader. “Does your ship carry nuclear
explosives?”</p>
<p>“Galaxy, no. What for? That fool grabbed a nuclear puncher, wrong end
forward and set at maximum dispersion. You’re not supposed to do that.
Might as well point a neut-gun at your head. I’d have stopped him, if
five men weren’t sitting on my chest.”</p>
<p>Riose gestured at the waiting guard, “You go. The captured ship is to
be sealed against all intrusion. Sit down, Devers.”</p>
<p>The Trader did so, in the spot indicated, and withstood stolidly the
hard scrutiny of the Imperial general and the curious glance of the
Siwennian patrician.</p>
<p>Riose said, “You’re a sensible man, Devers.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Are you impressed by my face, or do you want something?
Tell you what, though. I’m a good businessman.”</p>
<p>“It’s about the same thing. You surrendered your ship when you might
have decided to waste our ammunition and have yourself blown to
electron-dust. It could result in good treatment for you, if you
continue that sort of outlook on life.”</p>
<p>“Good treatment is what I mostly crave, boss.”</p>
<p>“Good, and co-operation is what I mostly crave.” Riose smiled, and
said in a low aside to Ducem Barr, “I hope the word ‘crave’ means what I
think it does. Did you ever hear such a barbarous jargon?”</p>
<p>Devers said blandly, “Right. I check you. But what kind of
co-operation are you talking about, boss? To tell you straight, I don’t
know where I stand.” He looked about him, “Where’s this place, for
instance, and what’s the idea?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’ve neglected the other half of the introductions. I
apologize.” Riose was in good humor. “That gentleman is Ducem Barr,
Patrician of the Empire. I am Bel Riose, Peer of the Empire, and General
of the Third Class in the armed forces of His Imperial Majesty.”</p>
<p>The Trader’s jaw slackened. Then, “The Empire? I mean the old Empire
they taught us about at school? Huh! Funny! I always had the sort of
notion that it didn’t exist anymore.”</p>
<p>“Look about you. It does,” said Riose grimly.</p>
<p>“Might have known it though,” and Lathan Devers pointed his beard at
the ceiling. “That was a mightily polished-looking set of craft that
took my tub. No kingdom of the Periphery could have turned them out.”
His brow furrowed. “So what’s the game, boss? Or do I call you
general?”</p>
<p>“The game is war.”</p>
<p>“Empire versus Foundation, that it?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I think you know why.”</p>
<p>The trader stared sharply and shook his head.</p>
<p>Riose let the other deliberate, then said softly, “I’m sure you know
why.”</p>
<p>Lathan Devers muttered, “Warm here,” and stood up to remove his
hooded jacket. Then he sat down again and stretched his legs out before
him.</p>
<p>“You know,” he said, comfortably, “I figure you’re thinking I ought
to jump up with a whoop and lay about me. I can catch you before you
could move if I choose my time, and this old fellow who sits there and
doesn’t say anything couldn’t do much to stop me.”</p>
<p>“But you won’t,” said Riose, confidently.</p>
<p>“I won’t,” agreed Devers, amiably. “First off, killing you wouldn’t
stop the war, I suppose. There are more generals where you came
from.”</p>
<p>“Very accurately calculated.”</p>
<p>“Besides which, I’d probably be slammed down about two seconds after
I got you, and killed fast, or maybe slow, depending. But I’d be killed,
and I never like to count on that when I’m making plans. It doesn’t pay
off.”</p>
<p>“I said you were a sensible man.”</p>
<p>“But there’s one thing I would like, boss. I’d like you to tell me
what you mean when you say I know why you’re jumping us. I don’t; and
guessing games bother me no end.”</p>
<p>“Yes? Ever hear of Hari Seldon?”</p>
<p>“No. I said I don’t like guessing games.”</p>
<p>Riose flicked a side glance at Ducem Barr, who smiled with a narrow
gentleness and resumed his inwardly dreaming expression.</p>
<p>Riose said with a grimace, “Don’t you play games, Devers. There is a
tradition, or a fable, or sober history—I don’t care what—upon your
Foundation, that eventually you will found the Second Empire. I know
quite a detailed version of Hari Seldon’s psychohistorical claptrap, and
your eventual plans of aggression against the Empire.”</p>
<p>“That so?” Devers nodded thoughtfully. “And who told you all
that?”</p>
<p>“Does that matter?” said Riose with dangerous smoothness. “You’re
here to question nothing. I want what you know about the Seldon
Fable.”</p>
<p>“But if it’s a Fable—”</p>
<p>“Don’t play with words, Devers.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. In fact, I’ll give it to you straight. You know all I know
about it. It’s silly stuff, half-baked. Every world has its yarns; you
can’t keep it away from them. Yes, I’ve heard that sort of talk; Seldon,
Second Empire, and so on. They put kids to sleep at night with the
stuff. The young squirts curl up in the spare rooms with their pocket
projectors and suck up Seldon thrillers. But it’s strictly nonadult.
Nonintelligent adult, anyway.” The Trader shook his head.</p>
<p>The Imperial general’s eyes were dark. “Is that really so? You waste
your lies, man. I’ve been on the planet Terminus. I know your
Foundation. I’ve looked it in the face.”</p>
<p>“And you ask me? Me, when I haven’t kept foot on it for two months at
a piece in ten years. You are wasting your time. But go ahead with your
war, if it’s fables you’re after.”</p>
<p>And Barr spoke for the first time, mildly, “You are so confident then
that the Foundation will win?”</p>
<p>The Trader turned. He flushed faintly and an old scar on one temple
showed whitely, “Hm-m-m, the silent partner. How’d you squeeze that out
of what I said, doc?”</p>
<p>Riose nodded very slightly at Barr, and the Siwennian continued in a
low voice, “Because the notion would bother you if you thought your
world might lose this war, and suffer the bitter reapings of defeat, I
know. My world once did, and still does.”</p>
<p>Lathan Devers fumbled his beard, looked from one of his opponents to
the other, then laughed shortly. “Does he always talk like that, boss?
Listen,” he grew serious, “what’s defeat? I’ve seen wars and I’ve seen
defeats. What if the winner does take over? Who’s bothered? Me? Guys
like me?” He shook his head in derision.</p>
<p>“Get this,” the Trader spoke forcefully and earnestly, “there are
five or six fat slobs who usually run an average planet. They get the
rabbit punch, but I’m not losing peace of mind over them. See. The
people? The ordinary run of guys? Sure, some get killed, and the rest
pay extra taxes for a while. But it settles itself out; it runs itself
down. And then it’s the old situation again with a different five or
six.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr’s nostrils flared, and the tendons of his old right hand
jerked; but he said nothing.</p>
<p>Lathan Devers’s eyes were on him. They missed nothing. He said,
“Look. I spend my life in space for my five-and-dime gadgets and my
beer-and-pretzel kickback from the Combines. There’s fat fellows back
there,” his thumb jerked over his shoulder and back, “that sit home and
collect my year’s income every minute—out of skimmings from me and more
like me. Suppose you run the Foundation. You’ll still need us. You’ll
need us more than ever the Combines do—because you’d not know your way
around, and we could bring in the hard cash. We’d make a better deal
with the Empire. Yes, we would; and I’m a man of business. If it adds up
to a plus mark, I’m for it.”</p>
<p>And he stared at the two with sardonic belligerence.</p>
<p>The silence remained unbroken for minutes, and then a cylinder
rattled into its slot. The general flipped it open, glanced at the neat
printing, and incircuited the visuals with a sweep.</p>
<p>“Prepare plan indicating position of each ship in action. Await
orders on full-armed defensive.”</p>
<p>He reached for his cape. As he fastened it about his shoulders, he
whispered in a stiff-lipped monotone to Barr, “I’m leaving this man to
you. I’ll expect results. This is war and I can be cruel to failures.
Remember!” He left, with a salute to both.</p>
<p>Lathan Devers looked after him, “Well, something’s hit him where it
hurts. What goes on?”</p>
<p>“A battle, obviously,” said Barr, gruffly. “The forces of the
Foundation are coming out for their first battle. You’d better come
along.”</p>
<p>There were armed soldiers in the room. Their bearing was respectful
and their faces were hard. Devers followed the proud old Siwennian
patriarch out of the room.</p>
<p>The room to which they were led was smaller, barer. It contained two
beds, a visi-screen, and shower and sanitary facilities. The soldiers
marched out, and the thick door boomed hollowly shut.</p>
<p>“Hmp?” Devers stared disapprovingly about. “This looks
permanent.”</p>
<p>“It is,” said Barr, shortly. The old Siwennian turned his back.</p>
<p>The Trader said irritably, “What’s your game, doc?”</p>
<p>“I have no game. You’re in my charge, that’s all.”</p>
<p>The Trader rose and advanced. His bulk towered over the unmoving
patrician. “Yes? But you’re in this cell with me and when you were
marched here the guns were pointed just as hard at you as at me. Listen,
you were all boiled up about my notions on the subject of war and
peace.”</p>
<p>He waited fruitlessly, “All right, let me ask you something. You said
your country was licked once. By whom? Comet people from the outer
nebulae?”</p>
<p>Barr looked up. “By the Empire.”</p>
<p>“That so? Then what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Barr maintained an eloquent silence.</p>
<p>The Trader thrust out a lower lip and nodded his head slowly. He
slipped off the flat-linked bracelet that hugged his right wrist and
held it out. “What do you think of that?” He wore the mate to it on his
left.</p>
<p>The Siwennian took the ornament. He responded slowly to the Trader’s
gesture and put it on. The odd tingling at the wrist passed away
quickly.</p>
<p>Devers’s voice changed at once. “Right, doc, you’ve got the action
now. Just speak casually. If this room is wired, they won’t get a thing.
That’s a Field Distorter you’ve got there; genuine Mallow design. Sells
for twenty-five credits on any world from here to the outer rim. You get
it free. Hold your lips still when you talk and take it easy. You’ve got
to get the trick of it.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr was suddenly weary. The Trader’s boring eyes were luminous
and urging. He felt unequal to their demands.</p>
<p>Barr said, “What do you want?” The words slurred from between
unmoving lips.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you. You make mouth noises like what we call a patriot.
Yet your own world has been mashed up by the Empire, and here you are
playing ball with the Empire’s fair-haired general. Doesn’t make sense,
does it?”</p>
<p>Barr said, “I have done my part. A conquering Imperial viceroy is
dead because of me.”</p>
<p>“That so? Recently?”</p>
<p>“Forty years ago.”</p>
<p>“Forty … years … ago!” The words seemed to have meaning to the
Trader. He frowned, “That’s a long time to live on memories. Does that
young squirt in the general’s uniform know about it?”</p>
<p>Barr nodded.</p>
<p>Devers’s eyes were dark with thought. “You want the Empire to
win?”</p>
<p>And the old Siwennian patrician broke out in sudden deep anger, “May
the Empire and all its works perish in universal catastrophe. All
Siwenna prays that daily. I had brothers once, a sister, a father. But I
have children now, grandchildren. The general knows where to find
them.”</p>
<p>Devers waited.</p>
<p>Barr continued in a whisper, “But that would not stop me if the
results in view warranted the risk. They would know how to die.”</p>
<p>The Trader said gently, “You killed a viceroy once, huh? You know, I
recognize a few things. We once had a mayor, Hober Mallow his name was.
He visited Siwenna; that’s your world, isn’t it? He met a man named
Barr.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr stared hard, suspiciously. “What do you know of this?”</p>
<p>“What every Trader on the Foundation knows. You might be a smart old
fellow put in here to get on my right side. Sure, they’d point guns at
you, and you’d hate the Empire and be all-out for its smashing. Then I’d
fall all over you and pour out my heart to you, and wouldn’t the general
be pleased. There’s not much chance of that, doc.</p>
<p>“But just the same I’d like to have you prove that you’re the son of
Onum Barr of Siwenna—the sixth and youngest who escaped the
massacre.”</p>
<p>Ducem Barr’s hand shook as he opened the flat metal box in a wall
recess. The metal object he withdrew clanked softly as he thrust it into
the Trader’s hands.</p>
<p>“Look at that,” he said.</p>
<p>Devers stared. He held the swollen central link of the chain close to
his eyes and swore softly. “That’s Mallow’s monogram, or I’m a
space-struck rookie, and the design is fifty years old if it’s a
day.”</p>
<p>He looked up and smiled.</p>
<p>“Shake, doc. A man-sized nuclear shield is all the proof I need,” and
he held out his large hand.</p>
