<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>“A show!” said the Grand Master, grimly. He settled himself well into
his furs, and one thin hand grasped the iron cudgel he used as a
cane.</p>
<p>“And gold, your Veneration.”</p>
<p>“And gold,” agreed the Grand Master, carelessly.</p>
<p>Ponyets set the box down and opened it with as fine an appearance of
confidence as he could manage. He felt alone in the face of universal
hostility; the way he had felt out in space his first year. The
semicircle of bearded councilors who faced him down, stared
unpleasantly. Among them was Pherl, the thin-faced favorite who sat next
to the Grand Master in stiff hostility. Ponyets had met him once already
and marked him immediately as prime enemy, and, as a consequence, prime
victim.</p>
<p>Outside the hall, a small army awaited events. Ponyets was
effectively isolated from his ship; he lacked any weapon but his
attempted bribe; and Gorov was still a hostage.</p>
<p>He made the final adjustments on the clumsy monstrosity that had cost
him a week of ingenuity, and prayed once again that the lead-lined
quartz would stand the strain.</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked the Grand Master.</p>
<p>“This,” said Ponyets, stepping back, “is a small device I have
constructed myself.”</p>
<p>“That is obvious, but it is not the information I want. Is it one of
the black-magic abominations of your world?”</p>
<p>“It is nuclear in nature,” admitted Ponyets, gravely, “but none of
you need touch it, or have anything to do with it. It is for myself
alone, and if it contains abominations, I take the foulness of it upon
myself.”</p>
<p>The Grand Master had raised his iron cane at the machine in a
threatening gesture and his lips moved rapidly and silently in a
purifying invocation. The thin-faced councilor at his right leaned
towards him and his straggled red mustache approached the Grand Master’s
ear. The ancient Askonian petulantly shrugged himself free.</p>
<p>“And what is the connection of your instrument of evil and the gold
that may save your countryman’s life?”</p>
<p>“With this machine,” began Ponyets, as his hand dropped softly onto
the central chamber and caressed its hard, round flanks, “I can turn the
iron you discard into gold of the finest quality. It is the only device
known to man that will take iron—the ugly iron, your Veneration, that
props up the chair you sit in and the walls of this building—and change
it to shining, heavy, yellow gold.”</p>
<p>Ponyets felt himself botching it. His usual sales talk was smooth,
facile and plausible; but this limped like a shot-up space wagon. But it
was the content, not the form, that interested the Grand Master.</p>
<p>“So? Transmutation? There have been fools who have claimed the
ability. They have paid for their prying sacrilege.”</p>
<p>“Had they succeeded?”</p>
<p>“No.” The Grand Master seemed coldly amused. “Success at producing
gold would have been a crime that carried its own antidote. It is the
attempt plus the failure that is fatal. Here, what can you do with my
staff?” He pounded the floor with it.</p>
<p>“Your Veneration will excuse me. My device is a small model, prepared
by myself, and your staff is too long.”</p>
<p>The Grand Master’s small shining eye wandered and stopped. “Randel,
your buckles. Come, man, they shall be replaced double if need be.”</p>
<p>The buckles passed down the line, hand to hand. The Grand Master
weighed them thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Here,” he said, and threw them to the floor.</p>
<p>Ponyets picked them up. He tugged hard before the cylinder opened,
and his eyes blinked and squinted with effort as he centered the buckles
carefully on the anode screen. Later, it would be easier but there must
be no failures the first time.</p>
<p>The homemade transmuter crackled malevolently for ten minutes while
the odor of ozone became faintly present. The Askonians backed away,
muttering, and again Pherl whispered urgently into his ruler’s ear. The
Grand Master’s expression was stony. He did not budge.</p>
<p>And the buckles were gold.</p>
<p>Ponyets held them out to the Grand Master with a murmured, “Your
Veneration!” but the old man hesitated, then gestured them away. His
stare lingered upon the transmuter.</p>
<p>Ponyets said rapidly, “Gentlemen, this is pure gold. Gold through and
through. You may subject it to every known physical and chemical test,
if you wish to prove the point. It cannot be identified from
naturally-occurring gold in any way. Any iron can be so treated. Rust
will not interfere, nor will a moderate amount of alloying metals—”</p>
<p>But Ponyets spoke only to fill a vacuum. He let the buckles remain in
his outstretched hand, and it was the gold that argued for him.</p>
<p>The Grand Master stretched out a slow hand at last, and the
thin-faced Pherl was roused to open speech. “Your Veneration, the gold
is from a poisoned source.”</p>
<p>And Ponyets countered, “A rose can grow from the mud, your
Veneration. In your dealings with your neighbors, you buy material of
all imaginable variety, without inquiring as to where they get it,
whether from an orthodox machine blessed by your benign ancestors or
from some space-spawned outrage. Come, I don’t offer the machine. I
offer the gold.”</p>
<p>“Your Veneration,” said Pherl, “you are not responsible for the sins
of foreigners who work neither with your consent nor knowledge. But to
accept this strange pseudo-gold made sinfully from iron in your presence
and with your consent is an affront to the living spirits of our holy
ancestors.”</p>
<p>“Yet gold is gold,” said the Grand Master, doubtfully, “and is but an
exchange for the heathen person of a convicted felon. Pherl, you are too
critical.” But he withdrew his hand.</p>
<p>Ponyets said, “You are wisdom, itself, your Veneration. Consider—to
give up a heathen is to lose nothing for your ancestors, whereas with
the gold you get in exchange you can ornament the shrines of their holy
spirits. And surely, were gold evil in itself, if such a thing could be,
the evil would depart of necessity once the metal were put to such pious
use.”</p>
<p>“Now by the bones of my grandfather,” said the Grand Master with
surprising vehemence. His lips separated in a shrill laugh. “Pherl, what
do you say of this young man? The statement is valid. It is as valid as
the words of my ancestors.”</p>
<p>Pherl said gloomily, “So it would seem. Grant that the validity does
not turn out to be a device of the Malignant Spirit.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make it even better,” said Ponyets, suddenly. “Hold the gold in
hostage. Place it on the altars of your ancestors as an offering and
hold me for thirty days. If at the end of that time, there is no
evidence of displeasure—if no disasters occur—surely, it would be proof
that the offering was accepted. What more can be offered?”</p>
<p>And when the Grand Master rose to his feet to search out disapproval,
not a man in the council failed to signal his agreement. Even Pherl
chewed the ragged end of his mustache and nodded curtly.</p>
<p>Ponyets smiled and meditated on the uses of a religious
education.</p>
