<h4 id="section">19</h4>
<p>END OF WAR</p>
<p>Jole Turbor, in his new role of war correspondent, found his bulk
incased in a naval uniform, and rather liked it. He enjoyed being back
on the air, and some of the fierce helplessness of the futile fight
against the Second Foundation left him in the excitement of another sort
of fight with substantial ships and ordinary men.</p>
<p>To be sure, the Foundation’s fight had not been remarkable for
victories, but it was still possible to be philosophic about the matter.
After six months, the hard core of the Foundation was untouched, and the
hard core of the Fleet was still in being. With the new additions since
the start of the war, it was almost as strong numerically, and stronger
technically, than before the defeat at Ifni.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, planetary defenses were being strengthened; the armed
forces better trained; administrative efficiency was having some of the
water squeezed out of it—and much of the Kalganian’s conquering fleet
was being wallowed down through the necessity of occupying the
“conquered” territory.</p>
<p>At the moment, Turbor was with the Third Fleet in the outer reaches
of the Anacreonian sector. In line with his policy of making this a
“little man’s war,” he was interviewing Fennel Leemor, Engineer Third
Class, volunteer.</p>
<p>“Tell us a little about yourself, sailor,” said Turbor.</p>
<p>“Ain’t much to tell,” Leemor shuffled his feet and allowed a faint,
bashful smile to cover his face, as though he could see all the millions
that undoubtedly could see him at the moment. “I’m a Locrian. Got a job
in an air-car factory; section head and good pay. I’m married; got two
kids, both girls. Say, I couldn’t say hello to them, could I—in case
they’re listening.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, sailor. The video is all yours.”</p>
<p>“Gosh, thanks.” He burbled, “Hello, Milla, in case you’re listening,
I’m fine. Is Sunni all right? And Tomma? I think of you all the time and
maybe I’ll be back on furlough after we get back to port. I got your
food parcel but I’m sending it back. We get our regular mess, but they
say the civilians are a little tight. I guess that’s all.”</p>
<p>“I’ll look her up next time I’m on Locris, sailor, and make sure
she’s not short of food. O.K.?”</p>
<p>The young man smiled broadly and nodded his head. “Thank you,
Mr. Turbor. I’d appreciate that.”</p>
<p>“All right. Suppose you tell us, then— You’re a volunteer, aren’t
you?”</p>
<p>“Sure am. If anyone picks a fight with me, I don’t have to wait for
anyone to drag me in. I joined up the day I heard about the Hober
Mallow.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fine spirit. Have you seen much action? I notice you’re
wearing two battle stars.”</p>
<p>“Ptah.” The sailor spat. “Those weren’t battles, they were chases.
The Kalganians don’t fight, unless they have odds of five to one or
better in their favor. Even then they just edge in and try to cut us up
ship by ship. Cousin of mine was at Ifni and he was on a ship that got
away, the old Ebling Mis. He says it was the same there. They had their
Main fleet against just a wing division of ours, and down to where we
only had five ships left, they kept stalking instead of fighting. We got
twice as many of their ships at that fight.”</p>
<p>“Then you think we’re going to win the war?”</p>
<p>“Sure bet; now that we aren’t retreating. Even if things got too bad,
that’s when I’d expect the Second Foundation to step in. We still got
the Seldon Plan—and they know it, too.”</p>
<p>Turbor’s lips curled a bit. “You’re counting on the Second
Foundation, then?”</p>
<p>The answer came with honest surprise. “Well, doesn’t everyone?”</p>
<p>Junior Officer Tippellum stepped into Turbor’s room after the
visicast. He shoved a cigarette at the correspondent and knocked his cap
back to a perilous balance on the occiput.</p>
<p>“We picked up a prisoner,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Little crazy fellow. Claims to be a neutral—diplomatic immunity, no
less. I don’t think they know what to do with him. His name’s Palvro,
Palver, something like that, and he says he’s from Trantor. Don’t know
what in Space he’s doing in a war zone.”</p>
<p>But Turbor had swung to a sitting position on his bunk and the nap he
had been about to take was forgotten. He remembered quite well his last
interview with Darell, the day after war had been declared and he was
shoving off.</p>
<p>“Preem Palver,” he said. It was a statement.</p>
<p>Tippellum paused and let the smoke trickle out the sides of his
mouth. “Yeah,” he said, “how in Space did you know?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. Can I see him?”</p>
<p>“Space, I can’t say. The old man has him in his own room for
questioning. Everyone figures he’s a spy.”</p>
<p>“You tell the old man that I know him, if he’s who he claims he is.
I’ll take the responsibility.”</p>
<p>Captain Dixyl on the flagship of the Third Fleet watched
unremittingly at the Grand Detector. No ship could avoid being a source
of nuclear radiation—not even if it were lying an inert mass—and each
focal point of such radiation was a little sparkle in the
three-dimensional field.</p>
<p>Each one of the Foundation’s ships were accounted for and no sparkle
was left over, now that the little spy who claimed to be a neutral had
been picked up. For a while, that outside ship had created a stir in the
captain’s quarters. The tactics might have needed changing on short
notice. As it was—</p>
<p>“Are you sure you have it?” he asked.</p>
<p>Commander Cenn nodded. “I will take my squadron through hyperspace:
radius, 10.00 parsecs; theta, 268.52 degrees; phi, 84.15 degrees. Return
to origin at 1330. Total absence 11.83 hours.”</p>
<p>“Right. Now we are going to count on pinpoint return as regards both
space and time. Understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, captain.” He looked at his wristwatch, “My ships will be ready
by 0140.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Captain Dixyl.</p>
<p>The Kalganian squadron was not within detector range now, but they
would be soon. There was independent information to that effect. Without
Cenn’s squadron the Foundation forces would be badly outnumbered, but
the captain was quite confident. Quite confident.</p>
<p>Preem Palver looked sadly about him. First at the tall, skinny
admiral; then at the others, everyone in uniform; and now at this last
one, big and stout, with his collar open and no tie—not like the
rest—who said he wanted to speak to him.</p>
<p>Jole Turbor was saying: “I am perfectly aware, admiral, of the
serious possibilities involved here, but I tell you that if I can be
allowed to speak to him for a few minutes, I may be able to settle the
current uncertainty.”</p>
<p>“Is there any reason why you can’t question him before me?”</p>
<p>Turbor pursed his lips and looked stubborn. “Admiral,” he said,
“while I have been attached to your ships, the Third Fleet has received
an excellent press. You may station men outside the door, if you like,
and you may return in five minutes. But, meanwhile, humor me a bit, and
your public relations will not suffer. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>Then Turbor, in the isolation that followed, turned to Palver, and
said, “Quickly—what is the name of the girl you abducted?”</p>
<p>And Palver could simply stare round-eyed, and shake his head.</p>
<p>“No nonsense,” said Turbor. “If you do not answer, you will be a spy
and spies are blasted without trial in wartime.”</p>
<p>“Arcadia Darell!” gasped Palver.</p>
<p>“Well! All right, then. Is she safe?”</p>
<p>Palver nodded.</p>
<p>“You had better be sure of that, or it won’t be well for you.”</p>
<p>“She is in good health, perfectly safe,” said Palver, palely.</p>
<p>The admiral returned, “Well?”</p>
<p>“The man, sir, is not a spy. You may believe what he tells you. I
vouch for him.”</p>
<p>“That so?” The admiral frowned. “Then he represents an agricultural
co-operative on Trantor that wants to make a trade treaty with Terminus
for the delivery of grains and potatoes. Well, all right, but he can’t
leave now.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Palver, quickly.</p>
<p>“Because we’re in the middle of a battle. After it is over—assuming
we’re still alive—we’ll take you to Terminus.”</p>
<p>The Kalganian fleet that spanned through space detected the
Foundation ships from an incredible distance and were themselves
detected. Like little fireflies in each other’s Grand Detectors, they
closed in across the emptiness.</p>
<p>And the Foundation’s admiral frowned and said, “This must be their
main push. Look at the numbers.” Then, “They won’t stand up before us,
though; not if Cenn’s detachment can be counted on.”</p>
<p>Commander Cenn had left hours before—at the first detection of the
coming enemy. There was no way of altering the plan now. It worked or it
didn’t, but the admiral felt quite comfortable. As did the officers. As
did the men.</p>
<p>Again watch the fireflies.</p>
<p>Like a deadly ballet dance, in precise formations, they sparked.</p>
<p>The Foundation fleet edged slowly backwards. Hours passed and the
fleet veered slowly off, teasing the advancing enemy slightly off
course, then more so.</p>
<p>In the minds of the dictators of the battle plan, there was a certain
volume of space that must be occupied by the Kalganian ships. Out from
that volume crept the Foundationers; into it slipped the Kalganians.
Those that passed out again were attacked, suddenly and fiercely. Those
that stayed within were not touched.</p>
<p>It all depended on the reluctance of the ships of Lord Stettin to
take the initiative themselves—on their willingness to remain where none
attacked.</p>
<p>Captain Dixyl stared frigidly at his wristwatch. It was 1310.</p>
<p>“We’ve got twenty minutes,” he said.</p>
<p>The lieutenant at his side nodded tensely, “It looks all right so
far, captain. We’ve got more than ninety percent of them boxed. If we
can keep them that way—”</p>
<p>“Yes! If—”</p>
<p>The Foundation ships were drifting forward again—very slowly. Not
quick enough to urge a Kalganian retreat and just quickly enough to
discourage a Kalganian advance. They preferred to wait.</p>
<p>And the minutes passed.</p>
<p>At 1325, the admiral’s buzzer sounded in seventy-five ships of the
Foundation’s line, and they built up to a maximum acceleration toward
the front-plane of the Kalganian fleet, itself three hundred strong.
Kalganian shields flared into action, and the vast energy beams flicked
out. Every one of the three hundred concentrated in the same direction,
toward their mad attackers who bore down relentlessly, uncaringly
and—</p>
<p>At 1330, fifty ships under Commander Cenn appeared from nowhere, in
one single bound through hyperspace to a calculated spot at a calculated
time—and were spaced in tearing fury at the unprepared Kalganian
rear.</p>
<p>The trap worked perfectly.</p>
<p>The Kalganians still had numbers on their side, but they were in no
mood to count. Their first effort was to escape and the formation once
broken was only the more vulnerable, as the enemy ships bumbled into one
another’s path.</p>
<p>After a while, it took on the proportions of a rat hunt.</p>
<p>Of three hundred Kalganian ships, the core and pride of their fleet,
some sixty or less, many in a state of near-hopeless disrepair, reached
Kalgan once more. The Foundation loss was eight ships out of a total of
one hundred twenty-five. It was the third day of the new year of
377.</p>
<p>Preem Palver landed on Terminus at the height of the celebration. He
found the furor distracting, but before he left the planet, he had
accomplished two things, and received one request.</p>
<p>The two things accomplished were: 1) the conclusion of an agreement
whereby Palver’s co-operative was to deliver twenty shiploads of certain
foodstuffs per month for the next year at a war price, without, thanks
to the recent battle, a corresponding war risk, and 2) the transfer to
Dr. Darell of Arcadia’s five short words.</p>
<p>For a startled moment, Darell had stared wide-eyed at him, and then
he had made his request. It was to carry an answer back to Arcadia.
Palver liked it; it was a simple answer and made sense. It was: “Come
back now. There won’t be any danger.”</p>
<p>Lord Stettin was in raging frustration. To watch his every weapon
break in his hands; to feel the firm fabric of his military might part
like the rotten thread it suddenly turned out to be—would have turned
phlegmaticism itself into flowing lava. And yet he was helpless, and
knew it.</p>
<p>He hadn’t really slept well in weeks. He hadn’t shaved in three days.
He had canceled all audiences. His admirals were left to themselves and
none knew better than the Lord of Kalgan that very little time and no
further defeats need elapse before he would have to contend with
internal rebellion.</p>
<p>Lev Meirus, First Minister, was no help. He stood there, calm and
indecently old, with his thin, nervous finger stroking, as always, the
wrinkled line from nose to chin.</p>
<p>“Well,” shouted Stettin at him, “contribute something. We stand here
defeated, do you understand? Defeated! And why? I don’t know why. There
you have it. I don’t know why. Do you know why?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” said Meirus, calmly.</p>
<p>“Treason!” The word came out softly, and other words followed as
softly. “You’ve known of treason, and you’ve kept quiet. You served the
fool I ejected from the First Citizenship and you think you can serve
whatever foul rat replaces me. If you have acted so, I will extract your
entrails for it and burn them before your living eyes.”</p>
<p>Meirus was unmoved. “I have tried to fill you with my own doubts, not
once, but many times. I have dinned it in your ears and you have
preferred the advice of others because it stuffed your ego better.
Matters have turned out not as I feared, but even worse. If you do not
care to listen now, say so, sir, and I shall leave, and, in due course,
deal with your successor, whose first act, no doubt, will be to sign a
treaty of peace.”</p>
<p>Stettin stared at him red-eyed, enormous fists slowly clenching and
unclenching. “Speak, you gray slug. Speak!”</p>
<p>“I have told you often, sir, that you are not the Mule. You may
control ships and guns but you cannot control the minds of your
subjects. Are you aware, sir, of who it is you are fighting? You fight
the Foundation, which is never defeated—the Foundation, which is
protected by the Seldon Plan—the Foundation, which is destined to form a
new Empire.”</p>
<p>“There is no Plan. No longer. Munn has said so.”</p>
<p>“Then Munn is wrong. And if he were right, what then? You and I, sir,
are not the people. The men and women of Kalgan and its subject worlds
believe utterly and deeply in the Seldon Plan, as do all the inhabitants
of this end of the Galaxy. Nearly four hundred years of history teach
the fact that the Foundation cannot be beaten. Neither the kingdoms nor
the warlords nor the old Galactic Empire itself could do it.”</p>
<p>“The Mule did it.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, and he was beyond calculation—and you are not. What is
worse, the people know that you are not. So your ships go into battle
fearing defeat in some unknown way. The insubstantial fabric of the Plan
hangs over them so that they are cautious and look before they attack
and wonder a little too much. While on the other side, that same
insubstantial fabric fills the enemy with confidence, removes fear,
maintains morale in the face of early defeats. Why not? The Foundation
has always been defeated at first and has always won in the end.</p>
<p>“And your own morale, sir? You stand everywhere on enemy territory.
Your own dominions have not been invaded; are still not in danger of
invasion—yet you are defeated. You don’t believe in the possibility,
even, of victory, because you know there is none.</p>
<p>“Stoop, then, or you will be beaten to your knees. Stoop voluntarily,
and you may save a remnant. You have depended on metal and power and
they have sustained you as far as they could. You have ignored mind and
morale and they have failed you. Now, take my advice. You have the
Foundation man, Homir Munn. Release him. Send him back to Terminus and
he will carry your peace offers.”</p>
<p>Stettin’s teeth ground behind his pale, set lips. But what choice had
he?</p>
<p>On the eighth day of the new year, Homir Munn left Kalgan again. More
than six months had passed since he had left Terminus and in the
interim, a war had raged and reached its climax.</p>
<p>He had come alone, but he left escorted. He had come a simple man of
private life; he left the unappointed but nevertheless, actual,
ambassador of peace.</p>
<p>And what had most changed was his early concern over the Second
Foundation. He laughed at the thought of that: and pictured in luxuriant
detail the final revelation to Dr. Darell, to that energetic, young
competent, Anthor, to all of them—</p>
<p>He knew. He, Homir Munn, finally knew the truth.</p>
