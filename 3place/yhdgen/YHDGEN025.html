<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>The Time Vault was filled; filled far beyond the available seating
capacity, and men lined the back of the room, three deep.</p>
<p>Salvor Hardin compared this large company with the few men attending
the first appearance of Hari Seldon, thirty years earlier. There had
only been six, then; the five old Encyclopedists—all dead now—and
himself, the young figurehead of a mayor. It had been on that day, that
he, with Yohan Lee’s assistance, had removed the “figurehead” stigma
from his office.</p>
<p>It was quite different now; different in every respect. Every man of
the City Council was awaiting Seldon’s appearance. He, himself, was
still mayor, but all-powerful now; and since the utter rout of Anacreon,
all-popular. When he had returned from Anacreon with the news of the
death of Wienis, and the new treaty signed with the trembling Lepold, he
was greeted with a vote of confidence of shrieking unanimity. When this
was followed in rapid order by similar treaties signed with each of the
other three kingdoms—treaties that gave the Foundation powers such as
would forever prevent any attempts at attack similar to that of
Anacreon’s—torchlight processions had been held in every city street of
Terminus. Not even Hari Seldon’s name had been more loudly cheered.</p>
<p>Hardin’s lips twitched. Such popularity had been his after the first
crisis also.</p>
<p>Across the room, Sef Sermak and Lewis Bort were engaged in animated
discussion, and recent events seemed to have put them out not at all.
They had joined in the vote of confidence; made speeches in which they
publicly admitted that they had been in the wrong, apologized handsomely
for the use of certain phrases in earlier debates, excused themselves
delicately by declaring they had merely followed the dictates of their
judgment and their conscience—and immediately launched a new Actionist
campaign.</p>
<p>Yohan Lee touched Hardin’s sleeve and pointed significantly to his
watch.</p>
<p>Hardin looked up. “Hello there, Lee. Are you still sour? What’s wrong
now?”</p>
<p>“He’s due in five minutes, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“I presume so. He appeared at noon last time.”</p>
<p>“What if he doesn’t?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to wear me down with your worries all your life? If he
doesn’t, he won’t.”</p>
<p>Lee frowned and shook his head slowly. “If this thing flops, we’re in
another mess. Without Seldon’s backing for what we’ve done, Sermak will
be free to start all over. He wants outright annexation of the Four
Kingdoms, and immediate expansion of the Foundation—by force, if
necessary. He’s begun his campaign, already.”</p>
<p>“I know. A fire eater must eat fire even if he has to kindle it
himself. And you, Lee, have got to worry even if you must kill yourself
to invent something to worry about.”</p>
<p>Lee would have answered, but he lost his breath at just that
moment—as the lights yellowed and went dim. He raised his arm to point
to the glass cubicle that dominated half the room and then collapsed
into a chair with a windy sigh.</p>
<p>Hardin himself straightened at the sight of the figure that now
filled the cubicle—a figure in a wheel chair! He alone of all those
present could remember the day, decades ago, when that figure had
appeared first. He had been young then, and the figure old. Since then,
the figure had not aged a day, but he himself had in turn grown old.</p>
<p>The figure stared straight ahead, hands fingering a book in its
lap.</p>
<p>It said, “I am Hari Seldon!” The voice was old and soft.</p>
<p>There was a breathless silence in the room and Hari Seldon continued
conversationally. “This is the second time I’ve been here. Of course, I
don’t know if any of you were here the first time. In fact, I have no
way of telling, by sense perception, that there is anyone here at all,
but that doesn’t matter. If the second crisis has been overcome safely,
you are bound to be here; there is no way out. If you are not here, then
the second crisis has been too much for you.”</p>
<p>He smiled engagingly. “I doubt that, however, for my figures show a
ninety-eight point four percent probability there is to be no
significant deviation from the Plan in the first eighty years.</p>
<p>“According to our calculations, you have now reached domination of
the barbarian kingdoms immediately surrounding the Foundation. Just as
in the first crisis you held them off by use of the Balance of Power, so
in the second, you gained mastery by use of the Spiritual Power as
against the Temporal.</p>
<p>“However, I might warn you here against overconfidence. It is not my
way to grant you any foreknowledge in these recordings, but it would be
safe to indicate that what you have now achieved is merely a new
balance—though one in which your position is considerably better. The
Spiritual Power, while sufficient to ward off attacks of the Temporal,
is not sufficient to attack in turn. Because of the invariable growth of
the counteracting force known as Regionalism, or Nationalism, the
Spiritual Power cannot prevail. I am telling you nothing new, I’m
sure.</p>
<p>“You must pardon me, by the way, for speaking to you in this vague
way. The terms I use are at best mere approximations, but none of you is
qualified to understand the true symbology of psychohistory, and so I
must do the best I can.</p>
<p>“In this case, the Foundation is only at the start of the path that
leads to the Second Galactic Empire. The neighboring kingdoms, in
manpower and resources, are still overwhelmingly powerful as compared to
yourselves. Outside them lies the vast tangled jungle of barbarism that
extends around the entire breadth of the Galaxy. Within that rim there
is still what is left of the Galactic Empire—and that, weakened and
decaying though it is, is still incomparably mighty.”</p>
<p>At this point, Hari Seldon lifted his book and opened it. His face
grew solemn. “And never forget there was another Foundation established
eighty years ago; a Foundation at the other end of the Galaxy, at Star’s
End. They will always be there for consideration. Gentlemen, nine
hundred and twenty years of the Plan stretch ahead of you. The problem
is yours!”</p>
<p>He dropped his eyes to his book and flicked out of existence, while
the lights brightened to fullness. In the babble that followed, Lee
leaned over to Hardin’s ear. “He didn’t say when he’d be back.”</p>
<p>Hardin replied, “I know—but I trust he won’t return until you and I
are safely and cozily dead!”</p>
<p>TRADERS— … and constantly in advance of the political hegemony of the
Foundation were the Traders, reaching out tenuous fingerholds through
the tremendous distances of the Periphery. Months or years might pass
between landings on Terminus; their ships were often nothing more than
patchquilts of home-made repairs and improvisations; their honesty was
none of the highest; their daring …</p>
<p>Through it all they forged an empire more enduring than the
pseudo-religious despotism of the Four Kingdoms.…</p>
<p>Tales without end are told of these massive, lonely figures who bore
half-seriously, half-mockingly a motto adopted from one of Salvor
Hardin’s epigrams, “Never let your sense of morals prevent you from
doing what is right!” It is difficult now to tell which tales are real
and which apocryphal. There are none probably that have not suffered
some exaggeration.…</p>
