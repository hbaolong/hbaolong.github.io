<h4 id="section">52</h4>
<p>Seldon’s eyes shifted briefly. The man to his right was rather thin
and seemed quite old. He had dark brown eyes and a swarthy complexion,
and Seldon was sure that he would have had black hair if he had not been
depilated.</p>
<p>He faced front again, thinking. This Brother was rather atypical. The
few Brothers he had paid any attention to had been rather tall,
light-skinned, and with blue or gray eyes. Of course, he had not seen
enough of them to make a general rule.</p>
<p>Then there was a light touch on the right sleeve of his kirtle.
Seldon turned hesitantly and found himself looking at a card on which
was written lightly, CAREFUL, TRIBESMAN!</p>
<p>Seldon started and put a hand to his skincap automatically. The man
next to him silently mouthed, “Hair.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s hand found it, a tiny exposure of bristles at his temple. He
must have disturbed the skincap at some point or another. Quickly and as
unobtrusively as possible, he tugged the skincap, then made sure that it
was snug under the pretence of stroking his head.</p>
<p>He turned to his neighbor on his right, nodded slightly, and mouthed,
“Thank you.”</p>
<p>His neighbor smiled and said in a normal speaking voice, “Going to
the Sacratorium?”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Easy guess. So am I. Shall we get off together?” His smile was
friendly.</p>
<p>“I’m with my—my—”</p>
<p>“With your woman. Of course. All three together, then?”</p>
<p>Seldon was not sure how to react. A quick look in the other direction
showed him that Dors’s eyes were turned straight ahead. She was showing
no interest in masculine conversation—an attitude appropriate for a
Sister. However, Seldon felt a soft pat on his left knee, which he took
(with perhaps little justification) to mean: “It’s all right.”</p>
<p>In any case, his natural sense of courtesy was on that side and he
said, “Yes, certainly.”</p>
<p>There was no further conversation until the direction plaque told
them they were arriving at the Sacratorium and Seldon’s Mycogenian
friend was rising to get off.</p>
<p>The gravi-bus made a wide turn about the perimeter of a large area of
the Sacratorium grounds and there was a general exodus when it came to a
halt, the men sliding in front of the women to exit first. The women
followed.</p>
<p>The Mycogenian’s voice crackled a bit with age, but it was cheerful.
He said, “It’s a little early for lunch my … friends, but take my word
for it that things will be crowded in not too long a time. Would you be
willing to buy something simple now and eat it outside? I am very
familiar with this area and I know a good place.”</p>
<p>Seldon wondered if this was a device to maneuver innocent
tribespeople into something or other disreputable or costly, yet decided
to chance it.</p>
<p>“You’re very kind,” he said. “Since we are not at all familiar with
the place, we will be glad to let you take the lead.”</p>
<p>They bought lunch—sandwiches and a beverage that looked like milk—at
an open-air stand. Since it was a beautiful day and they were visitors,
the old Mycogenian said, they would go to the Sacratorium grounds and
eat out of doors, the better to become acquainted with their
surroundings.</p>
<p>During their walk, carrying their lunch, Seldon noted that, on a very
small scale, the Sacratorium resembled the Imperial Palace and that the
grounds around it resembled, on a minute scale, the Imperial grounds. He
could scarcely believe that the Mycogenian people admired the Imperial
institution or, indeed, did anything but hate and despise it, yet the
cultural attraction was apparently not to be withstood.</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful,” said the Mycogenian with obvious pride.</p>
<p>“Quite,” said Seldon. “How it glistens in the daylight.”</p>
<p>“The grounds around it,” he said, “are constructed in imitation of
the government grounds on our Dawn World … in miniature, to be
sure.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever see the grounds of the Imperial Palace?” asked Seldon
cautiously.</p>
<p>The Mycogenian caught the implication and seemed in no way put out by
it. “They copied the Dawn World as best they could too.”</p>
<p>Seldon doubted that in the extreme, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>They came to a semicircular seat of white stonite, sparkling in the
light as the Sacratorium did.</p>
<p>“Good,” said the Mycogenian, his dark eyes gleaming with pleasure.
“No one’s taken my place. I call it mine only because it’s my favorite
seat. It affords a beautiful view of the side wall of the Sacratorium
past the trees. Please sit down. It’s not cold, I assure you. And your
companion. She is welcome to sit too. She is a tribeswoman, I know, and
has different customs. She … she may speak if she wishes.”</p>
<p>Dors gave him a hard look and sat down.</p>
<p>Seldon, recognizing the fact that they might remain with this old
Mycogenian a while, thrust out his hand and said, “I am Hari and my
female companion is Dors. We don’t use numbers, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“To each his … or her … own,” said the other expansively. “I am
Mycelium Seventy-Two. We are a large cohort.”</p>
<p>“Mycelium?” said Seldon a bit hesitantly.</p>
<p>“You seem surprised,” said Mycelium. “I take it, then, you’ve only
met members of our Elder families. Names like Cloud and Sunshine and
Starlight—all astronomical.”</p>
<p>“I must admit—” began Seldon.</p>
<p>“Well, meet one of the lower classes. We take our names from the
ground and from the micro-organisms we grow. Perfectly respectable.”</p>
<p>“I’m quite certain,” said Seldon, “and thank you again for helping me
with my … problem in the gravi-bus.”</p>
<p>“Listen,” said Mycelium Seventy-Two, “I saved you a lot of trouble.
If a Sister had seen you before I did, she would undoubtedly have
screamed and the nearest Brothers would have hustled you off the
bus—maybe not even waiting for it to stop moving.”</p>
<p>Dors leaned forward so as to see across Seldon. “How is it you did
not act in this way yourself?”</p>
<p>“I? I have no animosity against tribespeople. I’m a scholar.”</p>
<p>“A scholar?”</p>
<p>“First one in my cohort. I studied at the Sacratorium School and did
very well. I’m learned in all the ancient arts and I have a license to
enter the tribal library, where they keep book-films and books by
tribespeople. I can view any book-film or read any book I wish to. We
even have a computerized reference library and I can handle that too.
That sort of thing broadens your mind. I don’t mind a little hair
showing. I’ve seen pictures of men with hair many a time. And women
too.” He glanced quickly at Dors.</p>
<p>They ate in silence for a while and then Seldon said, “I notice that
every Brother who enters or leaves the Sacratorium is wearing a red
sash.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Mycelium Seventy-Two. “Over the left shoulder and
around the right side of the waist—usually very fancily
embroidered.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“It’s called an ‘obiah.’ It symbolizes the joy felt at entering the
Sacratorium and the blood one would spill to preserve it.”</p>
<p>“Blood?” said Dors, frowning.</p>
<p>“Just a symbol. I never actually heard of anyone spilling blood over
the Sacratorium. For that matter, there isn’t that much joy. It’s mostly
wailing and mourning and prostrating one’s self over the Lost World.”
His voice dropped and became soft. “Very silly.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “You’re not a … a believer?”</p>
<p>“I’m a scholar,” said Mycelium with obvious pride. His face wrinkled
as he grinned and took on an even more pronounced appearance of age.
Seldon found himself wondering how old the man was. Several centuries?
—No, they’d disposed of that. It couldn’t be and yet—</p>
<p>“How old are you?” Seldon asked suddenly, involuntarily.</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two showed no signs of taking offense at the
question, nor did he display any hesitation at answering,
“Sixty-seven.”</p>
<p>Seldon had to know. “I was told that your people believe that in very
early times everyone lived for several centuries.”</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two looked at Seldon quizzically. “Now how did you
find that out? Someone must have been talking out of turn … but it’s
true. There is that belief. Only the unsophisticated believe it, but the
Elders encourage it because it shows our superiority. Actually, our life
expectancy is higher than elsewhere because we eat more nutritionally,
but living even one century is rare.”</p>
<p>“I take it you don’t consider Mycogenians superior,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two said, “There’s nothing wrong with Mycogenians.
They’re certainly not inferior. Still, I think that all men are equal.
—Even women,” he added, looking across at Dors.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose,” said Seldon, “that many of your people would agree
with that.”</p>
<p>“Or many of your people,” said Mycelium Seventy-Two with a faint
resentment. “I believe it, though. A scholar has to. I’ve viewed and
even read all the great literature of the tribespeople. I understand
your culture. I’ve written articles on it. I can sit here just as
comfortably with you as though you were … us.”</p>
<p>Dors said a little sharply, “You sound proud of understanding
tribespeople’s ways. Have you ever traveled outside Mycogen?”</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two seemed to move away a little. “No.”</p>
<p>“Why not? You would get to know us better.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t feel right. I’d have to wear a wig. I’d be ashamed.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Why a wig? You could stay bald.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Mycelium Seventy-Two, “I wouldn’t be that kind of fool.
I’d be mistreated by all the hairy ones.”</p>
<p>“Mistreated? Why?” said Dors. “We have a great many naturally bald
people everywhere on Trantor and on every other world too.”</p>
<p>“My father is quite bald,” said Seldon with a sigh, “and I presume
that in the decades to come I will be bald too. My hair isn’t all that
thick now.”</p>
<p>“That’s not bald,” said Mycelium Seventy-Two. “You keep hair around
the edges and over your eyes. I mean bald—no hair at all.”</p>
<p>“Anywhere on your body?” said Dors, interested.</p>
<p>And now Mycelium Seventy-Two looked offended and said nothing.</p>
<p>Seldon, anxious to get the conversation back on track, said, “Tell
me, Mycelium Seventy-Two, can tribespeople enter the Sacratorium as
spectators?”</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two shook his head vigorously. “Never. It’s for the
Sons of the Dawn only.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Only the Sons?”</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two looked shocked for a moment, then said
forgivingly, “Well, you’re tribespeople. Daughters of the Dawn enter
only on certain days and times. That’s just the way it is. I don’t say I
approve. If it was up to me, I’d say, ‘Go in. Enjoy if you can.’ Sooner
others than me, in fact.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you ever go in?”</p>
<p>“When I was young, my parents took me, but”—he shook his head—“it was
just people staring at the Book and reading from it and sighing and
weeping for the old days. It’s very depressing. You can’t talk to each
other. You can’t laugh. You can’t even look at each other. Your mind has
to be totally on the Lost World. Totally.” He waved a hand in rejection.
“Not for me. I’m a scholar and I want the whole world open to me.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Seldon, seeing an opening. “We feel that way too. We are
scholars also, Dors and myself.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Mycelium Seventy-Two.</p>
<p>“You know? How do you know?”</p>
<p>“You’d have to be. The only tribespeople allowed in Mycogen are
Imperial officials and diplomats, important traders, and scholars—and to
me you have the look of scholars. That’s what interested me in you.
Scholars together.” He smiled delightedly.</p>
<p>“So we are. I am a mathematician. Dors is a historian. And you?”</p>
<p>“I specialize in … culture. I’ve read all the great works of
literature of the tribespeople: Lissauer, Mentone, Novigor—”</p>
<p>“And we have read the great works of your people. I’ve read the Book,
for instance. —About the Lost World.”</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two’s eyes opened wide in surprise. His olive
complexion seemed to fade a little. “You have? How? Where?”</p>
<p>“At our University we have copies that we can read if we have
permission.”</p>
<p>“Copies of the Book?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if the Elders know this?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “And I’ve read about robots.”</p>
<p>“Robots?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That is why I would like to be able to enter the Sacratorium. I
would like to see the robot.” (Dors kicked lightly at Seldon’s ankle,
but he ignored her.)</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two said uneasily, “I don’t believe in such things.
Scholarly people don’t.” But he looked about as though he was afraid of
being overheard.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I’ve read that a robot still exists in the
Sacratorium.”</p>
<p>Mycelium Seventy-Two said, “I don’t want to talk about such
nonsense.”</p>
<p>Seldon persisted. “Where would it be if it was in the
Sacratorium?”</p>
<p>“Even if one was there, I couldn’t tell you. I haven’t been in there
since I was a child.”</p>
<p>“Would you know if there was a special place, a hidden place?”</p>
<p>“There’s the Elders’ aerie. Only Elders go there, but there’s nothing
there.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever been there?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not.”</p>
<p>“Then how do you know?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that there’s no pomegranate tree there. I don’t know
that there’s no laser-organ there. I don’t know that there’s no item of
a million different kinds there. Does my lack of knowledge of their
absence show they are all present?”</p>
<p>For the moment, Seldon had nothing to say.</p>
<p>A ghost of a smile broke through Mycelium Seventy-Two’s look of
concern. He said, “That’s scholars’ reasoning. I’m not an easy man to
tackle, you see. Just the same, I wouldn’t advise you to try to get up
into the Elders’ aerie. I don’t think you’d like what would happen if
they found a tribesman inside. —Well. Best of the Dawn to you.” And he
rose suddenly—without warning—and hurried away.</p>
<p>Seldon looked after him, rather surprised. “What made him rush off
like that?”</p>
<p>“I think,” said Dors, “it’s because someone is approaching.”</p>
<p>And someone was. A tall man in an elaborate white kirtle, crossed by
an even more elaborate and subtly glittering red sash, glided solemnly
toward them. He had the unmistakable look of a man with authority and
the even more unmistakable look of one who is not pleased.</p>
