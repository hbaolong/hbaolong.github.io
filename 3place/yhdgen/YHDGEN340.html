<p>“Do you mean to say I have been searching Trantor-wide for someone
with your powers, Wanda, and he’s been here with us for the past few
months and we never knew it?” Hari Seldon was incredulous. He had been
dozing in the solarium when Wanda and Palver shook him awake to give him
their amazing news.</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandpa. Think about it. I’ve never had occasion to meet
Stettin. Your time with him has primarily been away from the Project and
I spend the majority of my time closeted in my office, working with the
Prime Radiant. When would we have met? In fact, the one time our paths
did cross, the results were most significant.”</p>
<p>“When was that?” asked Seldon, searching his memory.</p>
<p>“Your last hearing—before Judge Lih,” Wanda replied immediately.
“Remember the eyewitness who swore that you and Stettin had attacked
those three muggers? Remember how he broke down and told the truth—and
even he didn’t seem to know why. But Stettin and I have pieced it
together. We were both pushing Rial Nevas to come clean. He had been
very steadfast in his original claim; I doubt that either one of us
would have been able to push him alone. But together”—she stole a shy
glance at Palver, who was standing off to the side—“our power is
awesome!”</p>
<p>Hari Seldon took all this in and then made as if to speak. But Wanda
continued. “In fact, we plan to spend the afternoon testing our mentalic
abilities, separately and together. From the little we’ve discovered so
far, it seems as if Stettin’s power is slightly lower than mine—perhaps
a five on my rating scale. But his five, combined with my seven, gives
us a twelve! Think of it, Grandpa. Awesome!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you see, Professor?” Palver spoke up. “Wanda and I are that
breakthrough you’re looking for. We can help you convince the worlds of
the validity of psychohistory, we can help find others like us, we can
help put psychohistory back on track.”</p>
<p>Hari Seldon gazed up at the two young people standing in front of
him. Their faces were aglow with youth and vigor and enthusiasm and he
realized it did his old heart good. Perhaps all was not lost, after all.
He had not thought he would survive this latest tragedy, the death of
his son and the disappearance of his son’s wife and child, but now he
could see that Raych lived on in Wanda. And in Wanda and Stettin, he now
knew, lived the future of the Foundation.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” agreed Seldon, nodding forcefully. “Come you two, help me
up. I must get back to my office to plan our next step.”</p>
