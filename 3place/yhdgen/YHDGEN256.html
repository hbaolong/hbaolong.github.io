<h4 id="section">24</h4>
<p>Tennis was one of Hari’s favorite sports, but he preferred to play
rather than watch others. He watched with impatience, therefore, as the
Emperor Cleon, dressed in sports fashion, loped across the court to
return the ball. It was Imperial tennis, actually, so-called because it
was a favorite of Emperors, a version of the game in which a
computerized racket was used that could alter its angle slightly with
appropriate pressures on the handle. Hari had tried to develop the
technique on several occasions but found that mastering the computerized
racket would take a great deal of practice—and Hari Seldon’s time was
far too precious for what was clearly a trivial pursuit.</p>
<p>Cleon placed the ball in a nonreturnable position and won the game.
He trotted off the court to the careful applause of the functionaries
who were watching and Seldon said to him, “Congratulations, Sire. You
played a marvelous game.”</p>
<p>Cleon said indifferently, “Do you think so, Seldon? They’re all so
careful to let me win. I get no pleasure out of it.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “In that case, Sire, you might order your opponents to
play harder.”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t help. They’d be careful to lose anyway. And if they did
win, I would get even less pleasure out of losing than out of winning
meaninglessly. Being an Emperor has its woes, Seldon. Joranum would have
found that out—if he had ever succeeded in becoming one.”</p>
<p>He disappeared into his private shower facility and emerged in due
time, scrubbed and dried and dressed rather more formally.</p>
<p>“And now, Seldon,” he said, waving all the others away, “the tennis
court is as private a place as we can find and the weather is glorious,
so let us not go indoors. I have read the Mycogenian message of this
Sunmaster Fourteen. Will it do?”</p>
<p>“Entirely, Sire. As you have read, Joranum was denounced as a
Mycogenian Breakaway and is accused of blasphemy in the strongest
terms.”</p>
<p>“And does that finish him?”</p>
<p>“It diminishes his importance fatally, Sire. There are few who accept
the mad story of the First Minister’s robothood now. Furthermore,
Joranum is revealed as a liar and a poseur and, worse, one who was
caught at it.”</p>
<p>“Caught at it, yes,” said Cleon thoughtfully. “You mean that merely
to be underhanded is to be sly and that may be admirable, while to be
caught is to be stupid and that is never admirable.”</p>
<p>“You put it succinctly, Sire.”</p>
<p>“Then Joranum is no longer a danger.”</p>
<p>“We can’t be certain of that, Sire. He may recover, even now. He
still has an organization and some of his followers will remain loyal.
History yields examples of men and women who have come back after
disasters as great as this one—or greater.”</p>
<p>“In that case, let us execute him, Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “That would be inadvisable, Sire. You would
not want to create a martyr or to make yourself appear to be a
despot.”</p>
<p>Cleon frowned. “Now you sound like Demerzel. Whenever I wish to take
forceful action, he mutters the word ‘despot.’ There have been Emperors
before me who have taken forceful action and who have been admired as a
result and have been considered strong and decisive.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, Sire, but we live in troubled times. Nor is execution
necessary. You can accomplish your purpose in a way that will make you
seem enlightened and benevolent.”</p>
<p>“Seem enlightened?”</p>
<p>“Be enlightened, Sire. I misspoke. To execute Joranum would be to
take revenge, which might be regarded as ignoble. As Emperor, however,
you have a kindly—even paternal—attitude toward the beliefs of all your
people. You make no distinctions, for you are the Emperor of all
alike.”</p>
<p>“What is it you’re saying?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Sire, that Joranum has offended the sensibilities of the
Mycogenians and you are horrified at his sacrilege, he having been born
one of them. What better can you do but hand Joranum over to the
Mycogenians and allow them to take care of him? You will be applauded
for your proper Imperial concern.”</p>
<p>“And the Mycogenians will execute him, then?”</p>
<p>“They may, Sire. Their laws against blasphemy are excessively severe.
At best, they will imprison him for life at hard labor.”</p>
<p>Cleon smiled. “Very good. I get the credit for humanity and tolerance
and they do the dirty work.”</p>
<p>“They would, Sire, if you actually handed Joranum over to them. That
would, however, still create a martyr.”</p>
<p>“Now you confuse me. What would you have me do?”</p>
<p>“Give Joranum the choice. Say that your regard for the welfare of all
the people in your Empire urges you to hand him over to the Mycogenians
for trial but that your humanity fears the Mycogenians may be too
severe. Therefore, as an alternative, he may choose to be banished to
Nishaya, the small and secluded world from which he claimed to have
come, to live the rest of his life in obscurity and peace. You’ll see to
it that he’s kept under guard, of course.”</p>
<p>“And that will take care of things?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Joranum would be committing virtual suicide if he chose
to be returned to Mycogen—and he doesn’t strike me as the suicidal type.
He will certainly choose Nishaya, and though that is the sensible course
of action, it is also an unheroic one. As a refugee in Nishaya, he can
scarcely lead any movement designed to take over the Empire. His
following is sure to disintegrate. They could follow a martyr with holy
zeal, but it would be difficult, indeed, to follow a coward.”</p>
<p>“Astonishing! How did you manage all this, Seldon?” There was a
distinct note of admiration in Cleon’s voice.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Well, it seemed reasonable to suppose—”</p>
<p>“Never mind,” said Cleon abruptly. “I don’t suppose you’ll tell me
the truth or that I would understand you if you did, but I’ll tell you
this much. Demerzel is leaving office. This last crisis has proved to be
too much for him and I agree with him that it is time for him to retire.
But I can’t do without a First Minister and, from this moment onward,
you are he.”</p>
<p>“Sire!” exclaimed Seldon in mingled astonishment and horror.</p>
<p>“First Minister Hari Seldon,” said Cleon calmly. “The Emperor wishes
it.”</p>
