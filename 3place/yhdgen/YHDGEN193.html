<h4 id="section">55</h4>
<p>The sky was almost cloudless, but it was a pale blue, as though
wrapped in a high thin mist. That, thought Seldon, was a good touch, but
suddenly he missed the sun itself. No one on Trantor saw the planet’s
sun unless he or she went Upperside and even then only when the natural
cloud layer broke.</p>
<p>Did native Trantorians miss the sun? Did they give it any thought?
When one of them visited another world where a natural sun was in view,
did he or she stare, half-blinded, at it with awe?</p>
<p>Why, he wondered, did so many people spend their lives not trying to
find answers to questions—not even thinking of questions to begin with?
Was there anything more exciting in life than seeking answers?</p>
<p>His glance shifted to ground level. The wide roadway was lined with
low buildings, most of them shops. Numerous individual ground-cars moved
in both directions, each hugging the right side. They seemed like a
collection of antiques, but they were electrically driven and quite
soundless. Seldon wondered if “antique” was always a word to sneer at.
Could it be that silence made up for slowness? Was there any particular
hurry to life, after all?</p>
<p>There were a number of children on the walkways and Seldon’s lips
pressed together in annoyance. Clearly, an extended life span for the
Mycogenians was impossible unless they were willing to indulge in
infanticide. The children of both sexes (though it was hard to tell the
boys from the girls) wore kirtles that came only a few inches below the
knee, making the wild activity of childhood easier.</p>
<p>The children also still had hair, reduced to an inch in length at
most, but even so the older ones among them had hoods attached to their
kirtles and wore them raised, hiding the top of the head altogether. It
was as though they were getting old enough to make the hair seem a
trifle obscene—or old enough to be wishing to hide it, in longing for
the day of rite of passage when they were depilated.</p>
<p>A thought occurred to Seldon. He said, “Dors, when you’ve been out
shopping, who paid, you or the Raindrop women?”</p>
<p>“I did of course. The Raindrops never produced a credit tile. But why
should they? What was being bought was for us, not for them.”</p>
<p>“But you have a Trantorian credit tile—a tribeswoman credit
tile.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Hari, but there was no problem. The people of Mycogen may
keep their own culture and ways of thought and habits of life as they
wish. They can destroy their cephalic hair and wear kirtles.
Nevertheless, they must use the world’s credits. If they don’t, that
would choke off commerce and no sensible person would want to do that.
The credits nerve, Hari.” She held up her hand as though she was holding
an invisible credit tile.</p>
<p>“And they accepted your credit tile?”</p>
<p>“Never a peep out of them. And never a word about my skincap. Credits
sanitize everything.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s good. So I can buy—”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll do the buying. Credits may sanitize everything, but they
more easily sanitize a tribeswoman. They’re so used to paying women
little or no attention that they automatically pay me the same. —And
here’s the clothing store I’ve been using.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait out here. Get me a nice red sash—one that looks
impressive.”</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend you’ve forgotten our decision. I’ll get two. And
another white kirtle also … to my measurements.”</p>
<p>“Won’t they think it odd that a woman would be buying a white
kirtle?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. They’ll assume I’m buying it for a male companion who
happens to be my size. Actually, I don’t think they’ll bother with any
assumptions at all as long as my credit tile is good.”</p>
<p>Seldon waited, half-expecting someone to come up and greet him as a
tribesman or denounce him as one—more likely—but no one did. Those who
passed him did so without a glance and even those who glanced in his
direction moved on seemingly untouched. He was especially nervous about
the gray kirtles—the women—walking by in pairs or, even worse, with a
man. They were downtrodden, unnoticed, snubbed. How better to gain a
brief notoriety than by shrieking at the sight of a tribesman? But even
the women moved on.</p>
<p>They’re not expecting to see a tribesman, Seldon thought, so they
don’t see one.</p>
<p>That, he decided, augured well for their forthcoming invasion of the
Sacratorium. How much less would anyone expect to see tribespeople there
and how much more effectively would they therefore fail to see them!</p>
<p>He was in fairly good humor when Dors emerged.</p>
<p>“You have everything?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go back to the room, so you can change.”</p>
<p>The white kirtle did not fit her quite as well as the gray one did.
Obviously, she could not have tried it on or even the densest shopkeeper
would have been struck with alarm.</p>
<p>“How do I look, Hari?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Exactly like a boy,” said Seldon. “Now let’s try the sash … or
obiah. I had better get used to calling it that.”</p>
<p>Dors, without her skincap, was shaking out her hair gratefully. She
said sharply, “Don’t put it on now. We’re not going to parade through
Mycogen with the sash on. The last thing we want to do is call attention
to ourselves.”</p>
<p>“No no. I just want to see how it goes on.”</p>
<p>“Well, not that one. This one is better quality and more
elaborate.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Dors. I’ve got to gather in what attention there is. I
don’t want them to detect you as a woman.”</p>
<p>“I’m not thinking of that, Hari. I just want you to look pretty.”</p>
<p>“A thousand thanks, but that’s impossible, I suspect. Now, let’s see,
how does this work?”</p>
<p>Together, Hari and Dors practiced putting their obiahs on and taking
them off, over and over again, until they could do it in one fluid
motion. Dors taught Hari how to do it, as she had seen a man doing it
the day before at the Sacratorium.</p>
<p>When Hari praised her for her acute observations, she blushed and
said, “It’s really nothing, Hari, just something I noticed.”</p>
<p>Hari replied, “Then you’re a genius for noticing.”</p>
<p>Finally satisfied, they stood well apart, each surveying the other.
Hari’s obiah glittered, a bright red dragonlike design standing out
against a paler field of similar hue. Dors’s was a little less bold, had
a simple thin line down the center, and was very light in color.
“There,” she said, “just enough to show good taste.” She took it
off.</p>
<p>“Now,” said Seldon, “we fold it up and it goes into one of the inner
pockets. I have my credit tile—Hummin’s, really—and the key to this
place in this one and here, on the other side, the Book.”</p>
<p>“The Book? Should you be carrying it around?”</p>
<p>“I must. I’m guessing that anyone going to the Sacratorium ought to
have a copy of the Book with him. They may intone passages or have
readings. If necessary, we’ll share the Book and maybe no one will
notice. Ready?”</p>
<p>“I’ll never be ready, but I’m going with you.”</p>
<p>“It will be a tedious trip. Will you check my skincap and make sure
no hair shows this time? And don’t scratch your head.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. You look all right.”</p>
<p>“So do you.”</p>
<p>“You also look nervous.”</p>
<p>And Seldon said wryly, “Guess why!”</p>
<p>Dors reached out impulsively and squeezed Hari’s hand, then drew back
as if surprised at herself. Looking down, she straightened her white
kirtle. Hari, himself a trifle surprised and peculiarly pleased, cleared
his throat and said, “Okay, let’s go.”</p>
<p>ROBOT—… A term used in the ancient legends of several worlds for what
are more usually called “automata.” Robots are described as generally
human in shape and made of metal, although some are supposed to have
been pseudo-organic in nature. Hari Seldon, in the course of The Flight,
is popularly supposed to have seen an actual robot, but that story is of
dubious origin. Nowhere in Seldon’s voluminous writings does he mention
robots at all, although …</p>
