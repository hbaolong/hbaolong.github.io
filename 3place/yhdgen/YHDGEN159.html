<h4 id="section">21</h4>
<p>Yet the following day found Hari Seldon back in the library. For one
thing, there was his promise to Hummin. He had promised to try and he
couldn’t very well make it a halfhearted process. For another, he owed
something to himself too. He resented having to admit failure. Not yet,
at least. Not while he could plausibly tell himself he was following up
leads.</p>
<p>So he stared at the list of reference book-films he had not yet
checked through and tried to decide which of the unappetizing number had
the slightest chance of being useful to him. He had about decided that
the answer was “none of the above” and saw no way out but to look at
samples of each when he was startled by a gentle tap against the alcove
wall.</p>
<p>Seldon looked up and found the embarrassed face of Lisung Randa
peering at him around the edge of the alcove opening. Seldon knew Randa,
had been introduced to him by Dors, and had dined with him (and with
others) on several occasions.</p>
<p>Randa, an instructor in psychology, was a little man, short and
plump, with a round cheerful face and an almost perpetual smile. He had
a sallow complexion and the narrowed eyes so characteristic of people on
millions of worlds. Seldon knew that appearance well, for there were
many of the great mathematicians who had borne it, and he had frequently
seen their holograms. Yet on Helicon he had never seen one of these
Easterners. (By tradition they were called that, though no one knew why;
and the Easterners themselves were said to resent the term to some
degree, but again no one knew why.)</p>
<p>“There’s millions of us here on Trantor,” Randa had said, smiling
with no trace of self-consciousness, when Seldon, on first meeting him,
had not been able to repress all trace of startled surprise. “You’ll
also find a lot of Southerners—dark skins, tightly curled hair. Did you
ever see one?”</p>
<p>“Not on Helicon,” muttered Seldon.</p>
<p>“All Westerners on Helicon, eh? How dull! But it doesn’t matter.
Takes all kinds.” (He left Seldon wondering at the fact that there were
Easterners, Southerners, and Westerners, but no Northerners. He had
tried finding an answer to why that might be in his reference searches
and had not succeeded.)</p>
<p>And now Randa’s good-natured face was looking at him with an almost
ludicrous look of concern. He said, “Are you all right, Seldon?”</p>
<p>Seldon stared. “Yes, of course. Why shouldn’t I be?”</p>
<p>“I’m just going by sounds, my friend. You were screaming.”</p>
<p>“Screaming?” Seldon looked at him with offended disbelief.</p>
<p>“Not loud. Like this.” Randa gritted his teeth and emitted a
strangled high-pitched sound from the back of his throat. “If I’m wrong,
I apologize for this unwarranted intrusion on you. Please forgive
me.”</p>
<p>Seldon hung his head. “You’re forgiven, Lisung. I do make that sound
sometimes, I’m told. I assure you it’s unconscious. I’m never aware of
it.”</p>
<p>“Are you aware why you make it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Frustration. Frustration.”</p>
<p>Randa beckoned Seldon closer and lowered his voice further. “We’re
disturbing people. Let’s come out to the lounge before we’re thrown
out.”</p>
<p>In the lounge, over a pair of mild drinks, Randa said, “May I ask
you, as a matter of professional interest, why you are feeling
frustration?”</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged. “Why does one usually feel frustration? I’m tackling
something in which I am making no progress.”</p>
<p>“But you’re a mathematician, Hari. Why should anything in the history
library frustrate you?”</p>
<p>“What were you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Passing through as part of a shortcut to where I was going when I
heard you … moaning. Now you see” and he smiled,—“it’s no longer a
shortcut, but a serious delay—one that I welcome, however.”</p>
<p>“I wish I were just passing through the history library, but I’m
trying to solve a mathematical problem that requires some knowledge of
history and I’m afraid I’m not handling it well.”</p>
<p>Randa stared at Seldon with an unusually solemn expression on his
face, then he said, “Pardon me, but I must run the risk of offending you
now. I’ve been computering you.”</p>
<p>“Computering me!” Seldon’s eyes widened. He felt distinctly
angry.</p>
<p>“I have offended you. But, you know, I had an uncle who was a
mathematician. You might even have heard of him: Kiangtow Randa.”</p>
<p>Seldon drew in his breath. “Are you a relative of that Randa?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He is my father’s older brother and he was quite displeased
with me for not following in his footsteps—he has no children of his
own. I thought somehow that it might please him that I had met a
mathematician and I wanted to boast of you—if I could—so I checked what
information the mathematics library might have.”</p>
<p>“I see. And that’s what you were really doing there. Well—I’m sorry.
I don’t suppose you could do much boasting.”</p>
<p>“You suppose wrong. I was impressed. I couldn’t make heads or tails
of the subject matter of your papers, but somehow the information seemed
to be very favorable. And when I checked the news files, I found you
were at the Decennial Convention earlier this year. So … what’s
‘psychohistory,’ anyway? Obviously, the first two syllables stir my
curiosity.”</p>
<p>“I see you got that word out of it.”</p>
<p>“Unless I’m totally misled, it seemed to me that you can work out the
future course of history.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded wearily, “That, more or less, is what psychohistory is
or, rather, what it is intended to be.”</p>
<p>“But is it a serious study?” Randa was smiling. “You don’t just throw
sticks?”</p>
<p>“Throw sticks?”</p>
<p>“That’s just a reference to a game played by children on my home
planet of Hopara. The game is supposed to tell the future and if you’re
a smart kid, you can make a good thing out of it. Tell a mother that her
child will grow up beautiful and marry a rich man and it’s good for a
piece of cake or a half-credit piece on the spot. She isn’t going to
wait and see if it comes true; you are rewarded just for saying it.”</p>
<p>“I see. No, I don’t throw sticks. Psychohistory is just an abstract
study. Strictly abstract. It has no practical application at all,
except—”</p>
<p>“Now we’re getting to it. Exceptions are what are interesting.”</p>
<p>“Except that I would like to work out such an application. Perhaps if
I knew more about history—”</p>
<p>“Ah, that is why you are reading history?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but it does me no good,” said Seldon sadly.</p>
<p>“There is too much history and there is too little of it that is
told.”</p>
<p>“And that’s what’s frustrating you?”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded.</p>
<p>Randa said, “But, Hari, you’ve only been here a matter of weeks.”</p>
<p>“True, but already I can see—”</p>
<p>“You can’t see anything in a few weeks. You may have to spend your
whole lifetime making one little advance. It may take many generations
of work by many mathematicians to make a real inroad on the
problem.”</p>
<p>“I know that, Lisung, but that doesn’t make me feel better. I want to
make some visible progress myself.”</p>
<p>“Well, driving yourself to distraction won’t help either. If it will
make you feel better, I can give you an example of a subject much less
complex than human history that people have been working for I don’t
know how long without making much progress. I know because a group is
working on it right here at the University and one of my good friends is
involved. Talk about frustration! You don’t know what frustration
is!”</p>
<p>“What’s the subject?” Seldon felt a small curiosity stirring within
him.</p>
<p>“Meteorology.”</p>
<p>“Meteorology!” Seldon felt revolted at the anticlimax.</p>
<p>“Don’t make faces. Look. Every inhabited world has an atmosphere.
Every world has its own atmospheric composition, its own temperature
range, its own rotation and revolution rate, its own axial tipping, its
own land-water distribution. We’ve got twenty-five million different
problems and no one has succeeded in finding a generalization.”</p>
<p>“That’s because atmospheric behavior easily enters a chaotic phase.
Everyone knows that.”</p>
<p>“So my friend Jenarr Leggen says. You’ve met him.”</p>
<p>Seldon considered. “Tall fellow? Long nose? Doesn’t speak much?”</p>
<p>“That’s the one. —And Trantor itself is a bigger puzzle than almost
any world. According to the records, it had a fairly normal weather
pattern when it was first settled. Then, as the population grew and
urbanization spread, more energy was used and more heat was discharged
into the atmosphere. The ice cover contracted, the cloud layer
thickened, and the weather got lousier. That encouraged the movement
underground and set off a vicious cycle. The worse the weather got, the
more eagerly the land was dug into and the domes built and the weather
got still worse. Now the planet has become a world of almost incessant
cloudiness and frequent rains—or snows when it’s cold enough. The only
thing is that no one can work it out properly. No one has worked out an
analysis that can explain why the weather has deteriorated quite as it
has or how one can reasonably predict the details of its day-to-day
changes.”</p>
<p>Seldon shrugged. “Is that sort of thing important?”</p>
<p>“To a meteorologist it is. Why can’t they be as frustrated over their
problems as you are over yours? Don’t be a project chauvinist.”</p>
<p>Seldon remembered the cloudiness and the dank chill on the way to the
Emperor’s Palace.</p>
<p>He said, “So what’s being done about it?”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s a big project on the matter here at the University and
Jenarr Leggen is part of it. They feel that if they can understand the
weather change on Trantor, they will learn a great deal about the basic
laws of general meteorology. Leggen wants that as much as you want your
laws of psychohistory. So he has set up an incredible array of
instruments of all kinds Upperside … you know, above the domes. It
hasn’t helped them so far. And if there’s so much work being done for
many generations on the atmosphere, without results, how can you
complain that you haven’t gotten anything out of human history in a few
weeks?”</p>
<p>Randa was right, Seldon thought, and he himself was being
unreasonable and wrong. And yet … and yet … Hummin would say that this
failure in the scientific attack on problems was another sign of the
degeneration of the times. Perhaps he was right, also, except that he
was speaking of a general degeneration and average effect. Seldon felt
no degeneration of ability and mentality in himself.</p>
<p>He said with some interest then, “You mean that people climb up out
of the domes and into the open air above?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Upperside. It’s a funny thing, though. Most native Trantorians
won’t do it. They don’t like to go Upperside. The idea gives them
vertigo or something. Most of those working on the meteorology project
are Outworlders.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked out of the window at the lawns and small garden of the
University campus, brilliantly lit without shadows or oppressive heat,
and said thoughtfully, “I don’t know that I can blame Trantorians for
liking the comfort of being within, but I should think curiosity would
drive some Upperside. It would drive me.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that you would like to see meteorology in action?”</p>
<p>“I think I would. How does one get Upperside?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to it. An elevator takes you up, a door opens, and there you
are. I’ve been up there. It’s … novel.”</p>
<p>“It would get my mind off psychohistory for a while.” Seldon sighed.
“I’d welcome that.”</p>
<p>“On the other hand,” said Randa, “my uncle used to say, ‘All
knowledge is one,’ and he may be right. You may learn something from
meteorology that will help you with your psychohistory. Isn’t that
possible?”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled weakly. “A great many things are possible.” And to
himself he added: But not practical.</p>
