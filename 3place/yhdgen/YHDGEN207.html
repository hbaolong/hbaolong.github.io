<h4 id="section">69</h4>
<p>They got off the Expressway where the sign, flickering in the air,
said: BILLIBOTTON. As perhaps an indication of what might be expected,
the second I was smeared, a mere blob of fainter light.</p>
<p>They made their way out of the car and down to the walkway below. It
was early afternoon and at first glance, Billibotton seemed much like
the part of Dahl they had left.</p>
<p>The air, however, had a pungent aroma and the walkway was littered
with trash. One could tell that auto-sweeps were not to be found in the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>And, although the walkway looked ordinary enough, the atmosphere was
uncomfortable and as tense as a too-tightly coiled spring.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the people. There seemed the normal number of
pedestrians, but they were not like pedestrians elsewhere, Seldon
thought. Ordinarily, in the press of business, pedestrians were
self-absorbed and in the endless crowds on the endless thoroughfares of
Trantor, people could only survive—psychologically—by ignoring each
other. Eyes slid away. Brains were closed off. There was an artificial
privacy with each person enclosed in a velvet fog of his or her own
making. Or there was the ritualistic friendliness of an evening
promenade in those neighborhoods that indulged in such things.</p>
<p>But here in Billibotton, there was neither friendliness nor neutral
withdrawal. At least not where outsiders were concerned. Every person
who passed, moving in either direction, turned to stare at Seldon and
Dors. Every pair of eyes, as though attached by invisible cords to the
two outsiders, followed them with ill will.</p>
<p>The clothing of the Billibottoners tended to be smudged, old, and
sometimes torn. There was a patina of ill-washed poverty over them and
Seldon felt uneasy at the slickness of his own new clothes.</p>
<p>He said, “Where in Billibotton does Mother Rittah live, do you
suppose?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Dors. “You brought us here, so you do the
supposing. I intend to confine myself to the task of protection and I
think I’m going to find it necessary to do just that.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I assumed it would only be necessary to ask the way of
any passerby, but somehow I’m not encouraged to do so.”</p>
<p>“I don’t blame you. I don’t think you’ll find anyone springing to
your assistance.”</p>
<p>“On the other hand, there are such things as youngsters.” He
indicated one with a brief gesture of one hand. A boy who looked to be
about twelve—in any case young enough to lack the universal adult male
mustache—had come to a full halt and was staring at them.</p>
<p>Dors said, “You’re guessing that a boy that age has not yet developed
the full Billibottonian dislike of outsiders.”</p>
<p>“At any rate,” said Seldon, “I’m guessing he is scarcely large enough
to have developed the full Billibottonian penchant for violence. I
suppose he might run away and shout insults from a distance if we
approach him, but I doubt he’ll attack us.”</p>
<p>Seldon raised his voice. “Young man.”</p>
<p>The boy took a step backward and continued to stare.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Come here,” and beckoned.</p>
<p>The boy said, “Wa’ for, guy?”</p>
<p>“So I can ask you directions. Come closer, so I don’t have to
shout.”</p>
<p>The boy approached two steps closer. His face was smudged, but his
eyes were bright and sharp. His sandals were of different make and there
was a large patch on one leg of his trousers. He said, “Wa’ kind o’
directions?”</p>
<p>“We’re trying to find Mother Rittah.”</p>
<p>The boy’s eyes flickered. “Wa’ for, guy?”</p>
<p>“I’m a scholar. Do you know what a scholar is?”</p>
<p>“Ya went to school?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Didn’t you?”</p>
<p>The boy spat to one side in contempt. “Nah.”</p>
<p>“I want advice from Mother Rittah—if you’ll take me to her.”</p>
<p>“Ya want your fortune? Ya come to Billibotton, guy, with your fancy
clothes, so I can tell ya your fortune. All bad.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name, young man?”</p>
<p>“What’s it to ya?”</p>
<p>“So we can speak in a more friendly fashion. And so you can take me
to Mother Rittah’s place. Do you know where she lives?”</p>
<p>“Maybe yes, maybe no. My name’s Raych. What’s in it for me if I take
ya?”</p>
<p>“What would you like, Raych?”</p>
<p>The boy’s eyes halted at Dors’s belt. Raych said, “The lady got a
couple o’ knives. Gimme one and I’ll take ya to Mother Rittah.”</p>
<p>“Those are grown people’s knives, Raych. You’re too young.”</p>
<p>“Then I guess I’m too young to know where Mother Rittah lives.” And
he looked up slyly through the shaggy hair that curtained his eyes.</p>
<p>Seldon grew uneasy. It was possible they might attract a crowd.
Several men had stopped already, but had then moved on when nothing of
interest seemed to be taking place. If, however, the boy grew angry and
lashed out at them in word or deed, people would undoubtedly gather.</p>
<p>He smiled and said, “Can you read, Raych?”</p>
<p>Raych spat again. “Nah! Who wants ta read?”</p>
<p>“Can you use a computer?”</p>
<p>“A talking computer? Sure. Anyone can.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what, then. You take me to the nearest computer store
and I’ll buy you a little computer all your own and software that will
teach you to read. A few weeks and you’ll be able to read.”</p>
<p>It seemed to Seldon that the boy’s eyes sparkled at the thought,
but—if so—they hardened at once. “Nah. Knife or nothin’.”</p>
<p>“That’s the point, Raych. You learn to read and don’t tell anyone and
you can surprise people. After a while you can bet them you can read.
Bet them five credits. You can win a few extra credits that way and you
can buy a knife of your own.”</p>
<p>The boy hesitated. “Nah! No one will bet me. No one got credits.”</p>
<p>“If you can read, you can get a job in a knife store and you can save
your wages and get a knife at a discount. How about that?”</p>
<p>“When ya gonna buy the talking computer?”</p>
<p>“Right now. I’ll give it to you when I see Mother Rittah.”</p>
<p>“You got credits?”</p>
<p>“I have a credit tile.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see ya buy the computer.”</p>
<p>The transaction was carried through, but when the boy reached for it,
Seldon shook his head and put it inside his pouch. “You’ve got to get me
to Mother Rittah first, Raych. Are you sure you know where to find
her?”</p>
<p>Raych allowed a look of contempt to cross his face. “Sure I do. I’ll
take ya there, only ya better hand over the computer when we get there
or I’ll get some guys I know after you and the lady, so ya better watch
out.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to threaten us,” said Seldon. “We’ll take care of our
end of the deal.”</p>
<p>Raych led them quickly along the walkway, past curious stares.</p>
<p>Seldon was silent during the walk and so was Dors. Dors was far less
lost in her own thoughts, though, for she clearly remained conscious of
the surrounding people at all times. She kept meeting, with a level
glare, the eyes of those passersby that turned toward them. On occasion,
when there were footsteps behind them, she turned to look grimly
back.</p>
<p>And then Raych stopped and said, “In here. She ain’t homeless, ya
know.”</p>
<p>They followed him into an apartment complex and Seldon, who had had
the intention of following their route with a view to retracing his
steps later, was quickly lost.</p>
<p>He said, “How do you know your way through these alleys, Raych?”</p>
<p>The boy shrugged. “I been loafin’ through them since I was a kid,” he
said. “Besides, the apartments are numbered—where they ain’t broken
off—and there’s arrows and things. You can’t get lost if you know the
tricks.”</p>
<p>Raych knew the tricks, apparently, and they wandered deeper into the
complex. Hanging over it all was an air of total decay: disregarded
debris, inhabitants slinking past in clear resentment of the outsiders’
invasion. Unruly youngsters ran along the alleys in pursuit of some game
or other. Some of them yelled, “Hey, get out o’ the way!” when their
levitating ball narrowly missed Dors.</p>
<p>And finally, Raych stopped before a dark scarred door on which the
number 2782 glowed feebly.</p>
<p>“This is it,” he said and held out his hand.</p>
<p>“First let’s see who’s inside,” said Seldon softly. He pushed the
signal button and nothing happened.</p>
<p>“It don’t work,” said Raych. “Ya gotta bang. Loud. She don’t hear too
good.”</p>
<p>Seldon pounded his fist on the door and was rewarded with the sound
of movement inside. A shrill voice called out, “Who wants Mother
Rittah?”</p>
<p>Seldon shouted, “Two scholars!”</p>
<p>He tossed the small computer, with its small package of software
attached, to Raych, who snatched it, grinned, and took off at a rapid
run. Seldon then turned to face the opening door and Mother Rittah.</p>
