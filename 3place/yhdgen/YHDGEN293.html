<h4 id="section">11</h4>
<p>The University had been transformed and Hari Seldon could not refrain
from being pleased.</p>
<p>The central rooms of the Project complex had suddenly sprouted in
color and light, with holography filling the air with shifting
three-dimensional images of Seldon at different places and different
times. There was Dors Venabili smiling, looking somewhat younger—Raych
as a teenager, still unpolished—Seldon and Amaryl, looking unbelievably
young, bent over their computers. There was even a fleeting sight of Eto
Demerzel, which filled Seldon’s heart with yearning for his old friend
and the security he had felt before Demerzel’s departure.</p>
<p>The Emperor Cleon appeared nowhere in the holographics. It was not
because holographs of him did not exist, but it was not wise, under the
rule of the junta, to remind people of the past Imperium.</p>
<p>It all poured outward, overflowing, filling room after room, building
after building. Somehow, time had been found to convert the entire
University into a display the likes of which Seldon had never seen or
even imagined. Even the dome lights were darkened to produce an
artificial night against which the University would sparkle for three
days.</p>
<p>“Three days!” said Seldon, half-impressed, half-horrified.</p>
<p>“Three days,” said Dors Venabili, nodding her head. “The University
would consider nothing less.”</p>
<p>“The expense! The labor!” said Seldon, frowning.</p>
<p>“The expense is minimal,” said Dors, “compared to what you have done
for the University. And the labor is all voluntary. The students turned
out and took care of everything.”</p>
<p>A from-the-air view of the University appeared now, panoramically,
and Seldon stared at it with a smile forcing itself onto his
countenance.</p>
<p>Dors said, “You’re pleased. You’ve done nothing but grouse these past
few months about how you didn’t want any celebration for being an old
man—and now look at you.”</p>
<p>“Well, it is flattering. I had no idea that they would do anything
like this.”</p>
<p>“Why not? You’re an icon, Hari. The whole world—the whole
Empire—knows about you.”</p>
<p>“They do not,” said Seldon, shaking his head vigorously. “Not one in
a billion knows anything at all about me—and certainly not about
psychohistory. No one outside the Project has the faintest knowledge of
how psychohistory works and not everyone inside does, either.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter, Hari. It’s you. Even the quadrillions who don’t
know anything about you or your work know that Hari Seldon is the
greatest mathematician in the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon, looking around, “they certainly are making me
feel that way right now. But three days and three nights! The place will
be reduced to splinters.”</p>
<p>“No, it won’t. All the records have been stored away. The computers
and other equipment have been secured. The students have set up a
virtual security force that will prevent anything from being
damaged.”</p>
<p>“You’ve seen to all of that, haven’t you, Dors?” said Seldon, smiling
at her fondly.</p>
<p>“A number of us have. It’s by no means all me. Your colleague Tamwile
Elar has worked with incredible dedication.”</p>
<p>Seldon scowled.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with Elar?” said Dors.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “He keeps calling me ‘Maestro.’”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “Well, there’s a terrible crime.”</p>
<p>Seldon ignored that and said, “And he’s young.”</p>
<p>“Worse and worse. Come, Hari, you’re going to have to learn to grow
old gracefully—and to begin with you’ll have to show that you’re
enjoying yourself. That will please others and increase their enjoyment
and surely you would want to do that. Come on. Move around. Don’t hide
here with me. Greet everyone. Smile. Ask after their health. And
remember that, after the banquet, you’re going to have to make a
speech.”</p>
<p>“I dislike banquets and I doubly dislike speeches.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to, anyway. Now move!”</p>
<p>Seldon sighed dramatically and did as he was told. He cut quite an
imposing figure as he stood in the archway leading into the main hall.
The voluminous First Minister’s robes of yesteryear were gone, as were
the Heliconian-style garments he had favored in his youth. Now Seldon
wore an outfit that bespoke his elevated status: straight pants, crisply
pleated, a modified tunic on top. Embroidered in silver thread above his
heart was the insignia: SELDON PSYCHOHISTORY PROJECT AT STREELING
UNIVERSITY. It sparkled like a beacon against the dignified
titanium-gray hue of his clothing. Seldon’s eyes twinkled in a face now
lined by age, his sixty years given away as much by his wrinkles as by
his white hair.</p>
<p>He entered the room in which the children were feasting. The room had
been entirely cleared, except for trestles with food upon them. The
children rushed up to him as soon as they saw him—knowing, as they did,
that he was the reason for the feast—and Seldon tried to avoid their
clutching fingers.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, children,” he said. “Now stand back.”</p>
<p>He pulled a small computerized robot from his pocket and placed it on
the floor. In an Empire without robots, this was something that he could
expect to be eye-popping. It had the shape of a small furry animal, but
it also had the capacity to change shapes without warning (eliciting
squeals of children’s laughter each time) and when it did so, the sounds
and motions it made changed as well.</p>
<p>“Watch it,” said Seldon, “and play with it, and try not to break it.
Later on, there’ll be one for each of you.”</p>
<p>He slipped out into the hallway leading back to the main hall and
realized, as he did so, that Wanda was following him.</p>
<p>“Grandpa,” she said.</p>
<p>Well, of course, Wanda was different. He swooped down and lifted her
high in the air, turned her over, and put her down.</p>
<p>“Are you having a good time, Wanda?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “but don’t go into that room.”</p>
<p>“Why not, Wanda? It’s my room. It’s the office where I work.”</p>
<p>“It’s where I had my bad dream.”</p>
<p>“I know, Wanda, but that’s all over, isn’t it?” He hesitated, then he
led Wanda to one of the chairs lining the hallway. He sat down and
placed her in his lap.</p>
<p>“Wanda,” he said, “are you sure it was a dream?”</p>
<p>“I think it was a dream.”</p>
<p>“Were you really sleeping?”</p>
<p>“I think I was.”</p>
<p>She seemed uncomfortable talking about it and Seldon decided to let
it go. There was no use pushing her any further.</p>
<p>He said, “Well, dream or not, there were two men and they talked of
lemonade death, didn’t they?”</p>
<p>Wanda nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “You’re sure they said lemonade?”</p>
<p>Wanda nodded again.</p>
<p>“Might they have said something else and you thought they said
lemonade?”</p>
<p>“Lemonade is what they said.”</p>
<p>Seldon had to be satisfied with that. “Well, run off and have a good
time, Wanda. Forget about the dream.”</p>
<p>“All right, Grandpa.” She cheered up as soon as the matter of the
dream was dismissed and off she went to join the festivities.</p>
<p>Seldon went to search for Manella. It took him an extraordinarily
long time to find her, since, at every step, he was stopped, greeted,
and conversed with.</p>
<p>Finally he saw her in the distance. Muttering, “Pardon me— Pardon me—
There’s someone I must—Pardon me—,” he worked his way over to her with
considerable trouble.</p>
<p>“Manella,” he said and drew her off to one side, smiling mechanically
in all directions.</p>
<p>“Yes, Hari,” she said. “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“It’s Wanda’s dream.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me she’s still talking about it.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s still bothering her. Listen, we have lemonade at the
party, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“Of course, the children adore it. I’ve added a couple of dozen
different Mycogenian taste buds to very small glasses of different
shapes and the children try them one after the other to see which taste
best. The adults have been drinking it, too. I have. Why don’t you taste
it, Hari? It’s great.”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking. If it wasn’t a dream, if the child really heard two
men speak of lemonade death—” He paused, as though ashamed to
continue.</p>
<p>Manella said, “Are you thinking that someone poisoned the lemonade?
That’s ridiculous. By now every child in the place would be sick or
dying.”</p>
<p>“I know,” muttered Seldon. “I know.”</p>
<p>He wandered off and almost didn’t see Dors when he passed her. She
seized his elbow.</p>
<p>“Why the face?” she said. “You look concerned.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking of Wanda’s lemonade death.”</p>
<p>“So have I, but I can’t make anything of it so far.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help but think of the possibility of poisoning.”</p>
<p>“Don’t. I assure you that every bit of food that came into this party
has been molecularly checked. I know you’ll think that’s my typical
paranoia, but my task is guarding you and that is what I must do.”</p>
<p>“And everything is—”</p>
<p>“No poison. I promise you.”</p>
<p>Seldon smiled, “Well, good. That’s a relief. I didn’t really
think—”</p>
<p>“Let’s hope not,” said Dors dryly. “What concerns me far more than
this myth of poison is that I have heard that you’re going to be seeing
that monster Tennar in a few days.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call him a monster, Dors. Be careful. We’re surrounded by ears
and tongues.”</p>
<p>Dors immediately lowered her voice. “I suppose you’re right. Look
around. All these smiling faces—and yet who knows which of our ‘friends’
will be reporting back to the head and his henchmen when the night is
over? Ah, humans! Even after all these thousands of centuries, to think
that such base treachery still exists. It seems to me to be so
unnecessary. Yet I know the harm it can do. That is why I must go with
you, Hari.”</p>
<p>“Impossible, Dors. It would just complicate matters for me. I’ll go
myself and I’ll have no trouble.”</p>
<p>“You would have no idea how to handle the General.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked grave. “And you would? You sound exactly like Elar. He,
too, is convinced that I am a helpless old fool. He, too, wants to come
with me—or, rather, to go in my place. —I wonder how many people on
Trantor are willing to take my place,” he added with clear sarcasm.
“Dozens? Millions?”</p>
