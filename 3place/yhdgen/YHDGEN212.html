<h4 id="section">74</h4>
<p>There was a pleasant glow to the evening light when they emerged, a
faint violet touch and a pinkish edge to the simulated sunset clouds
that were scudding along. Dahl might have complaints of their treatment
by the Imperial rulers of Trantor, but surely there was nothing wrong
with the weather the computers spun out for them.</p>
<p>Dors said in a low voice, “We seem to be celebrities. No mistake
about that.”</p>
<p>Seldon brought his eyes down from the supposed sky and was
immediately aware of a fair-sized crowd around the apartment house in
which the Tisalvers lived.</p>
<p>Everyone in the crowd stared at them intently. When it was clear that
the two Outworlders had become aware of the attention, a low murmur ran
through the crowd, which seemed to be on the point of breaking out into
applause.</p>
<p>Dors said, “Now I can see where Mistress Tisalver would find this
annoying. I should have been a little more sympathetic.”</p>
<p>The crowd was, for the most part, poorly dressed and it was not hard
to guess that many of the people were from Billibotton.</p>
<p>On impulse, Seldon smiled and raised one hand in a mild greeting that
was met with applause. One voice, lost in the safe anonymity of the
crowd, called out, “Can the lady show us some knife tricks?”</p>
<p>When Dors called back, “No, I only draw in anger,” there was instant
laughter.</p>
<p>One man stepped forward. He was clearly not from Billibotton and bore
no obvious mark of being a Dahlite. He had only a small mustache, for
one thing, and it was brown, not black. He said, “Marlo Tanto of the
‘Trantorian HV News.’ Can we have you in focus for a bit for our nightly
holocast?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dors shortly. “No interviews.”</p>
<p>The newsman did not budge. “I understand you were in a fight with a
great many men in Billibotton—and won.” He smiled. “That’s news, that
is.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dors. “We met some men in Billibotton, talked to them, and
then moved on. That’s all there is to it and that’s all you’re going to
get.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name? You don’t sound like a Trantorian.”</p>
<p>“I have no name.”</p>
<p>“And your friend’s name?”</p>
<p>“He has no name.”</p>
<p>The newsman looked annoyed, “Look, lady. You’re news and I’m just
trying to do my job.”</p>
<p>Raych pulled at Dors’s sleeve. She leaned down and listened to his
earnest whisper.</p>
<p>She nodded and straightened up again. “I don’t think you’re a
newsman, Mr. Tanto. What I think you are is an Imperial agent trying to
make trouble for Dahl. There was no fight and you’re trying to
manufacture news concerning one as a way of justifying an Imperial
expedition into Billibotton. I wouldn’t stay here if I were you. I don’t
think you’re very popular with these people.”</p>
<p>The crowd had begun to mutter at Dors’s first words. They grew louder
now and began to drift, slowly and in a menacing way, in the direction
of Tanto. He looked nervously around and began to move away.</p>
<p>Dors raised her voice. “Let him go. Don’t anyone touch him. Don’t
give him any excuse to report violence.”</p>
<p>And they parted before him.</p>
<p>Raych said, “Aw, lady, you shoulda let them rough him up.”</p>
<p>“Bloodthirsty boy,” said Dors, “take us to this friend of yours.”</p>
