<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>Theo Aporat was one of the very highest ranking priests of Anacreon.
From the standpoint of precedence alone, he deserved his appointment as
head priest—attendant upon the flagship Wienis.</p>
<p>But it was not only rank or precedence. He knew the ship. He had
worked directly under the holy men from the Foundation itself in
repairing the ship. He had gone over the motors under their orders. He
had rewired the ’visors; revamped the communications system; replated
the punctured hull; reinforced the beams. He had even been permitted to
help while the wise men of the Foundation had installed a device so holy
it had never been placed in any previous ship, but had been reserved
only for this magnificent colossus of a vessel—a hyperwave relay.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that he felt heartsick over the purposes to which
the glorious ship was perverted. He had never wanted to believe what
Verisof had told him—that the ship was to be used for appalling
wickedness; that its guns were to be turned on the great Foundation.
Turned on that Foundation, where he had been trained as a youth, from
which all blessedness was derived.</p>
<p>Yet he could not doubt now, after what the admiral had told him.</p>
<p>How could the king, divinely blessed, allow this abominable act? Or
was it the king? Was it not, perhaps, an action of the accursed regent,
Wienis, without the knowledge of the king at all. And it was the son of
this same Wienis that was the admiral who five minutes before had told
him:</p>
<p>“Attend to your souls and your blessings, priest. I will attend to my
ship.”</p>
<p>Aporat smiled crookedly. He would attend to his souls and his
blessings—and also to his cursings; and Prince Lefkin would whine soon
enough.</p>
<p>He had entered the general communications room now. His acolyte
preceded him and the two officers in charge made no move to interfere.
The head priest-attendant had the right of free entry anywhere on the
ship.</p>
<p>“Close the door,” Aporat ordered, and looked at the chronometer. It
lacked five minutes of twelve. He had timed it well.</p>
<p>With quick practiced motions, he moved the little levers that opened
all communications, so that every part of the two-mile-long ship was
within reach of his voice and his image.</p>
<p>“Soldiers of the royal flagship Wienis, attend! It is your
priest-attendant that speaks!” The sound of his voice reverberated, he
knew, from the stern atom blast in the extreme rear to the navigation
tables in the prow.</p>
<p>“Your ship,” he cried, “is engaged in sacrilege. Without your
knowledge, it is performing such an act as will doom the soul of every
man among you to the eternal frigidity of space! Listen! It is the
intention of your commander to take this ship to the Foundation and
there to bombard that source of all blessings into submission to his
sinful will. And since that is his intention, I, in the name of the
Galactic Spirit, remove him from his command, for there is no command
where the blessing of the Galactic Spirit has been withdrawn. The divine
king himself may not maintain his kingship without the consent of the
Spirit.”</p>
<p>His voice took on a deeper tone, while the acolyte listened with
veneration and the two soldiers with mounting fear. “And because this
ship is upon such a devil’s errand, the blessing of the Spirit is
removed from it as well.”</p>
<p>He lifted his arms solemnly, and before a thousand televisors
throughout the ship, soldiers cowered, as the stately image of their
priest-attendant spoke:</p>
<p>“In the name of the Galactic Spirit and of his prophet, Hari Seldon,
and of his interpreters, the holy men of the Foundation, I curse this
ship. Let the televisors of this ship, which are its eyes, become blind.
Let its grapples, which are its arms, be paralyzed. Let the nuclear
blasts, which are its fists, lose their function. Let the motors, which
are its heart, cease to beat. Let the communications, which are its
voice, become dumb. Let its ventilations, which are its breath, fade.
Let its lights, which are its soul, shrivel into nothing. In the name of
the Galactic Spirit, I so curse this ship.”</p>
<p>And with his last word, at the stroke of midnight, a hand,
light-years distant in the Argolid Temple, opened an ultrawave relay,
which at the instantaneous speed of the ultrawave, opened another on the
flagship Wienis.</p>
<p>And the ship died!</p>
<p>For it is the chief characteristic of the religion of science that it
works, and that such curses as that of Aporat’s are really deadly.</p>
<p>Aporat saw the darkness close down on the ship and heard the sudden
ceasing of the soft, distant purring of the hyperatomic motors. He
exulted and from the pocket of his long robe withdrew a self-powered
nucleo-bulb that filled the room with pearly light.</p>
<p>He looked down at the two soldiers who, brave men though they
undoubtedly were, writhed on their knees in the last extremity of mortal
terror. “Save our souls, your reverence. We are poor men, ignorant of
the crimes of our leaders,” one whimpered.</p>
<p>“Follow,” said Aporat, sternly. “Your soul is not yet lost.”</p>
<p>The ship was a turmoil of darkness in which fear was so thick and
palpable, it was all but a miasmic smell. Soldiers crowded close
wherever Aporat and his circle of light passed, striving to touch the
hem of his robe, pleading for the tiniest scrap of mercy.</p>
<p>And always his answer was, “Follow me!”</p>
<p>He found Prince Lefkin, groping his way through the officers’
quarters, cursing loudly for lights. The admiral stared at the
priest-attendant with hating eyes.</p>
<p>“There you are!” Lefkin inherited his blue eyes from his mother, but
there was that about the hook in his nose and the squint in his eye that
marked him as the son of Wienis. “What is the meaning of your
treasonable actions? Return the power to the ship. I am commander
here.”</p>
<p>“No longer,” said Aporat, somberly.</p>
<p>Lefkin looked about wildly. “Seize that man. Arrest him, or by Space,
I will send every man within reach of my voice out the air lock in the
nude.” He paused, and then shrieked, “It is your admiral that orders.
Arrest him.”</p>
<p>Then, as he lost his head entirely, “Are you allowing yourselves to
be fooled by this mountebank, this harlequin? Do you cringe before a
religion compounded of clouds and moonbeams? This man is an imposter and
the Galactic Spirit he speaks of a fraud of the imagination devised
to—”</p>
<p>Aporat interrupted furiously. “Seize the blasphemer. You listen to
him at the peril of your souls.”</p>
<p>And promptly, the noble admiral went down under the clutching hands
of a score of soldiers.</p>
<p>“Take him with you and follow me.”</p>
<p>Aporat turned, and with Lefkin dragged along after him, and the
corridors behind black with soldiery, he returned to the communications
room. There, he ordered the ex-commander before the one televisor that
worked.</p>
<p>“Order the rest of the fleet to cease course and to prepare for the
return to Anacreon.”</p>
<p>The disheveled Lefkin, bleeding, beaten, and half stunned, did
so.</p>
<p>“And now,” continued Aporat, grimly, “we are in contact with Anacreon
on the hyperwave beam. Speak as I order you.”</p>
<p>Lefkin made a gesture of negation, and the mob in the room and the
others crowding the corridor beyond, growled fearfully.</p>
<p>“Speak!” said Aporat. “Begin: The Anacreonian navy—”</p>
<p>Lefkin began.</p>
