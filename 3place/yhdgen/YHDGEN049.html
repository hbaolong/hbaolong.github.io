<h4 id="section">18</h4>
<p>Hober Mallow shuffled his feet wearily as he leafed through the
reports. Two years of the mayoralty had made him a bit more housebroken,
a bit softer, a bit more patient,—but it had not made him learn to like
government reports and the mind-breaking officialese in which they were
written.</p>
<p>“How many ships did they get?” asked Jael.</p>
<p>“Four trapped on the ground. Two unreported. All others accounted for
and safe.” Mallow grunted. “We should have done better, but it’s just a
scratch.”</p>
<p>There was no answer and Mallow looked up. “Does anything worry
you?”</p>
<p>“I wish Sutt would get here,” was the almost irrelevant answer.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, and now we’ll hear another lecture on the home front.”</p>
<p>“No, we won’t,” snapped Jael, “but you’re stubborn, Mallow. You may
have worked out the foreign situation to the last detail but you’ve
never given a care about what goes on here on the home planet.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s your job, isn’t it? What did I make you Minister of
Education and Propaganda for?”</p>
<p>“Obviously to send me to an early and miserable grave, for all the
co-operation you give me. For the last year, I’ve been deafening you
with the rising danger of Sutt and his Religionists. What good will your
plans be, if Sutt forces a special election and has you thrown out?”</p>
<p>“None, I admit.”</p>
<p>“And your speech last night just about handed the election to Sutt
with a smile and a pat. Was there any necessity for being so frank?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there such a thing as stealing Sutt’s thunder?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Jael, violently, “not the way you did it. You claim to
have foreseen everything, and don’t explain why you traded with Korell
to their exclusive benefit for three years. Your only plan of battle is
to retire without a battle. You abandon all trade with the sectors of
space near Korell. You openly proclaim a stalemate. You promise no
offensive, even in the future. Galaxy, Mallow, what am I supposed to do
with such a mess?”</p>
<p>“It lacks glamor?”</p>
<p>“It lacks mob emotion-appeal.”</p>
<p>“Same thing.”</p>
<p>“Mallow, wake up. You have two alternatives. Either you present the
people with a dynamic foreign policy, whatever your private plans are,
or you make some sort of compromise with Sutt.”</p>
<p>Mallow said, “All right, if I’ve failed the first, let’s try the
second. Sutt’s just arrived.”</p>
<p>Sutt and Mallow had not met personally since the day of the trial,
two years back. Neither detected any change in the other, except for
that subtle atmosphere about each which made it quite evident that the
roles of ruler and defier had changed.</p>
<p>Sutt took his seat without shaking hands.</p>
<p>Mallow offered a cigar and said, “Mind if Jael stays? He wants a
compromise earnestly. He can act as mediator if tempers rise.”</p>
<p>Sutt shrugged. “A compromise will be well for you. Upon another
occasion I once asked you to state your terms. I presume the positions
are reversed now.”</p>
<p>“You presume correctly.”</p>
<p>“Then these are my terms. You must abandon your blundering policy of
economic bribery and trade in gadgetry, and return to the tested foreign
policy of our fathers.”</p>
<p>“You mean conquest by missionary?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“No compromise short of that?”</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>“Um-m-m.” Mallow lit up very slowly and inhaled the tip of his cigar
into a bright glow. “In Hardin’s time, when conquest by missionary was
new and radical, men like yourself opposed it. Now it is tried, tested,
hallowed,—everything a Jorane Sutt would find well. But, tell me, how
would you get us out of our present mess?”</p>
<p>“Your present mess. I had nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p>“Consider the question suitably modified.”</p>
<p>“A strong offensive is indicated. The stalemate you seem to be
satisfied with is fatal. It would be a confession of weakness to all the
worlds of the Periphery, where the appearance of strength is
all-important, and there’s not one vulture among them that wouldn’t join
the assault for its share of the corpse. You ought to understand that.
You’re from Smyrno, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Mallow passed over the significance of the remark. He said, “And if
you beat Korell, what of the Empire? That is the real enemy.”</p>
<p>Sutt’s narrow smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. “Oh, no, your
records of your visit to Siwenna were complete. The viceroy of the
Normannic Sector is interested in creating dissension in the Periphery
for his own benefit, but only as a side issue. He isn’t going to stake
everything on an expedition to the Galaxy’s rim when he has fifty
hostile neighbors and an emperor to rebel against. I paraphrase your own
words.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes he might, Sutt, if he thinks we’re strong enough to be
dangerous. And he might think so, if we destroy Korell by the main force
of frontal attack. We’d have to be considerably more subtle.”</p>
<p>“As for instance—”</p>
<p>Mallow leaned back. “Sutt, I’ll give you your chance. I don’t need
you, but I can use you. So I’ll tell you what it’s all about, and then
you can either join me and receive a place in a coalition cabinet, or
you can play the martyr and rot in jail.”</p>
<p>“Once before you tried that last trick.”</p>
<p>“Not very hard, Sutt. The right time has only just come. Now listen.”
Mallow’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“When I first landed on Korell,” he began, “I bribed the Commdor with
the trinkets and gadgets that form the trader’s usual stock. At the
start, that was meant only to get us entrance into a steel foundry. I
had no plan further than that, but in that I succeeded. I got what I
wanted. But it was only after my visit to the Empire that I first
realized exactly what a weapon I could build that trade into.</p>
<p>“This is a Seldon crisis we’re facing, Sutt, and Seldon crises are
not solved by individuals but by historic forces. Hari Seldon, when he
planned our course of future history, did not count on brilliant heroics
but on the broad sweeps of economics and sociology. So the solutions to
the various crises must be achieved by the forces that become available
to us at the time.</p>
<p>“In this case,—trade!”</p>
<p>Sutt raised his eyebrows skeptically and took advantage of the pause.
“I hope I am not of subnormal intelligence, but the fact is that your
vague lecture isn’t very illuminating.”</p>
<p>“It will become so,” said Mallow. “Consider that until now the power
of trade has been underestimated. It has been thought that it took a
priesthood under our control to make it a powerful weapon. That is not
so, and this is my contribution to the Galactic situation. Trade without
priests! Trade alone! It is strong enough. Let us become very simple and
specific. Korell is now at war with us. Consequently our trade with her
has stopped. But,—notice that I am making this as simple as a problem in
addition,—in the past three years she has based her economy more and
more upon the nuclear techniques which we have introduced and which only
we can continue to supply. Now what do you suppose will happen once the
tiny nuclear generators begin failing, and one gadget after another goes
out of commission?</p>
<p>“The small household appliances go first. After a half a year of this
stalemate that you abhor, a woman’s nuclear knife won’t work any more.
Her stove begins failing. Her washer doesn’t do a good job. The
temperature-humidity control in her house dies on a hot summer day. What
happens?”</p>
<p>He paused for an answer, and Sutt said calmly, “Nothing. People
endure a good deal in war.”</p>
<p>“Very true. They do. They’ll send their sons out in unlimited numbers
to die horribly on broken spaceships. They’ll bear up under enemy
bombardment, if it means they have to live on stale bread and foul water
in caves half a mile deep. But it’s very hard to bear up under little
things when the patriotic uplift of imminent danger is not present. It’s
going to be a stalemate. There will be no casualties, no bombardments,
no battles.</p>
<p>“There will just be a knife that won’t cut, and a stove that won’t
cook, and a house that freezes in the winter. It will be annoying, and
people will grumble.”</p>
<p>Sutt said slowly, wonderingly, “Is that what you’re setting your
hopes on, man? What do you expect? A housewives’ rebellion? A Jacquerie?
A sudden uprising of butchers and grocers with their cleavers and
breadknives shouting ‘Give us back our Automatic Super-Kleeno Nuclear
Washing Machines.’ ”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” said Mallow, impatiently, “I do not. I expect, however, a
general background of grumbling and dissatisfaction which will be seized
on by more important figures later on.”</p>
<p>“And what more important figures are these?”</p>
<p>“The manufacturers, the factory owners, the industrialists of Korell.
When two years of the stalemate have gone, the machines in the factories
will, one by one, begin to fail. Those industries which we have changed
from first to last with our new nuclear gadgets will find themselves
very suddenly ruined. The heavy industries will find themselves, en
masse and at a stroke, the owners of nothing but scrap machinery that
won’t work.”</p>
<p>“The factories ran well enough before you came there, Mallow.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sutt, so they did—at about one-twentieth the profits, even if
you leave out of consideration the cost of reconversion to the original
pre-nuclear state. With the industrialist and financier and the average
man all against him, how long will the Commdor hold out?”</p>
<p>“As long as he pleases, as soon as it occurs to him to get new
nuclear generators from the Empire.”</p>
<p>And Mallow laughed joyously. “You’ve missed, Sutt, missed as badly as
the Commdor himself. You’ve missed everything, and understood nothing.
Look, man, the Empire can replace nothing. The Empire has always been a
realm of colossal resources. They’ve calculated everything in planets,
in stellar systems, in whole sectors of the Galaxy. Their generators are
gigantic because they thought in gigantic fashion.</p>
<p>“But we,—we, our little Foundation, our single world almost without
metallic resources,—have had to work with brute economy. Our generators
have had to be the size of our thumb, because it was all the metal we
could afford. We had to develop new techniques and new
methods,—techniques and methods the Empire can’t follow because they
have degenerated past the stage where they can make any really vital
scientific advance.</p>
<p>“With all their nuclear shields, large enough to protect a ship, a
city, an entire world; they could never build one to protect a single
man. To supply light and heat to a city, they have motors six stories
high,—I saw them—where ours could fit into this room. And when I told
one of their nuclear specialists that a lead container the size of a
walnut contained a nuclear generator, he almost choked with indignation
on the spot.</p>
<p>“Why, they don’t even understand their own colossi any longer. The
machines work from generation to generation automatically, and the
caretakers are a hereditary caste who would be helpless if a single
D-tube in all that vast structure burnt out.</p>
<p>“The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the
Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize
control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but
lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little
things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.</p>
<p>“A king, or a Commdor, will take the ships and even make war.
Arbitrary rulers throughout history have bartered their subjects’
welfare for what they consider honor, and glory, and conquest. But it’s
still the little things in life that count—and Asper Argo won’t stand up
against the economic depression that will sweep all Korell in two or
three years.”</p>
<p>Sutt was at the window, his back to Mallow and Jael. It was early
evening now, and the few stars that struggled feebly here at the very
rim of the Galaxy sparked against the background of the misty, wispy
Lens that included the remnants of that Empire, still vast, that fought
against them.</p>
<p>Sutt said, “No. You are not the man.”</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>“I mean I don’t trust you. You’re smooth-tongued. You befooled me
properly when I thought I had you under proper care on your first trip
to Korell. When I thought I had you cornered at the trial, you wormed
your way out of it and into the mayor’s chair by demagoguery. There is
nothing straight about you; no motive that hasn’t another behind it; no
statement that hasn’t three meanings.</p>
<p>“Suppose you were a traitor. Suppose your visit to the Empire had
brought you a subsidy and a promise of power. Your actions would be
precisely what they are now. You would bring about a war after having
strengthened the enemy. You would force the Foundation into inactivity.
And you would advance a plausible explanation of everything, one so
plausible it would convince everyone.”</p>
<p>“You mean there’ll be no compromise?” asked Mallow, gently.</p>
<p>“I mean you must get out, by free will or force.”</p>
<p>“I warned you of the only alternative to co-operation.”</p>
<p>Jorane Sutt’s face congested with blood in a sudden access of
emotion. “And I warn you, Hober Mallow of Smyrno, that if you arrest me,
there will be no quarter. My men will stop nowhere in spreading the
truth about you, and the common people of the Foundation will unite
against their foreign ruler. They have a consciousness of destiny that a
Smyrnian can never understand—and that consciousness will destroy
you.”</p>
<p>Hober Mallow said quietly to the two guards who had entered, “Take
him away. He’s under arrest.”</p>
<p>Sutt said, “Your last chance.”</p>
<p>Mallow stubbed out his cigar and never looked up.</p>
<p>And five minutes later, Jael stirred and said, wearily, “Well, now
that you’ve made a martyr for the cause, what next?”</p>
<p>Mallow stopped playing with the ash tray and looked up. “That’s not
the Sutt I used to know. He’s a blood-blind bull. Galaxy, he hates
me.”</p>
<p>“All the more dangerous then.”</p>
<p>“More dangerous? Nonsense! He’s lost all power of judgment.”</p>
<p>Jael said grimly, “You’re overconfident, Mallow. You’re ignoring the
possibility of a popular rebellion.”</p>
<p>Mallow looked up, grim in his turn. “Once and for all, Jael, there is
no possibility of a popular rebellion.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure of yourself!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure of the Seldon crisis and the historical validity of their
solutions, externally and internally. There are some things I didn’t
tell Sutt right now. He tried to control the Foundation itself by
religious forces as he controlled the outer worlds, and he failed,—which
is the surest sign that in the Seldon scheme, religion is played
out.</p>
<p>“Economic control worked differently. And to paraphrase that famous
Salvor Hardin quotation of yours, it’s a poor nuclear blaster that won’t
point both ways. If Korell prospered with our trade, so did we. If
Korellian factories fail without our trade; and if the prosperity of the
outer worlds vanishes with commercial isolation; so will our factories
fail and our prosperity vanish.</p>
<p>“And there isn’t a factory, not a trading center, not a shipping line
that isn’t under my control; that I couldn’t squeeze to nothing if Sutt
attempts revolutionary propaganda. Where his propaganda succeeds, or
even looks as though it might succeed, I will make certain that
prosperity dies. Where it fails, prosperity will continue, because my
factories will remain fully staffed.</p>
<p>“So by the same reasoning which makes me sure that the Korellians
will revolt in favor of prosperity, I am sure we will not revolt against
it. The game will be played out to its end.”</p>
<p>“So then,” said Jael, “you’re establishing a plutocracy. You’re
making us a land of traders and merchant princes. Then what of the
future?”</p>
<p>Mallow lifted his gloomy face, and exclaimed fiercely, “What business
of mine is the future? No doubt Seldon has foreseen it and prepared
against it. There will be other crises in the time to come when money
power has become as dead a force as religion is now. Let my successors
solve those new problems, as I have solved the one of today.”</p>
<p>KORELL— … And so after three years of a war which was certainly the
most unfought war on record, the Republic of Korell surrendered
unconditionally, and Hober Mallow took his place next to Hari Seldon and
Salvor Hardin in the hearts of the people of the Foundation.</p>
<p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p>
<p>PROLOGUE</p>
<p>The Galactic Empire was falling.</p>
<p>It was a colossal Empire, stretching across millions of worlds from
arm-end to arm-end of the mighty multi-spiral that was the Milky Way.
Its fall was colossal, too—and a long one, for it had a long way to
go.</p>
<p>It had been falling for centuries before one man became really aware
of that fall. That man was Hari Seldon, the man who represented the one
spark of creative effort left among the gathering decay. He developed
and brought to its highest pitch the science of psychohistory.</p>
<p>Psychohistory dealt not with man, but man-masses. It was the science
of mobs; mobs in their billions. It could forecast reactions to stimuli
with something of the accuracy that a lesser science could bring to the
forecast of a rebound of a billiard ball. The reaction of one man could
be forecast by no known mathematics; the reaction of a billion is
something else again.</p>
<p>Hari Seldon plotted the social and economic trends of the time,
sighted along the curves and foresaw the continuing and accelerating
fall of civilization and the gap of thirty thousand years that must
elapse before a struggling new Empire could emerge from the ruins.</p>
<p>It was too late to stop that fall, but not too late to narrow the gap
of barbarism. Seldon established two Foundations at “opposite ends of
the Galaxy” and their location was so designed that in one short
millennium events would knit and mesh so as to force out of them a
stronger, more permanent, more benevolent Second Empire.</p>
<p>Foundation has told the story of one of those Foundations during the
first two centuries of life.</p>
<p>It began as a settlement of physical scientists on Terminus, a planet
at the extreme end of one of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Separated
from the turmoil of the Empire, they worked as compilers of a universal
compendium of knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, unaware of the
deeper role planned for them by the already-dead Seldon.</p>
<p>As the Empire rotted, the outer regions fell into the hands of
independent “kings.” The Foundation was threatened by them. However, by
playing one petty ruler against another, under the leadership of their
first mayor, Salvor Hardin, they maintained a precarious independence.
As sole possessors of nuclear power among worlds which were losing their
sciences and falling back on coal and oil, they even established an
ascendancy. The Foundation became the “religious” center of the
neighboring kingdoms.</p>
<p>Slowly, the Foundation developed a trading economy as the
Encyclopedia receded into the background. Their Traders, dealing in
nuclear gadgets which not even the Empire in its heyday could have
duplicated for compactness, penetrated hundreds of light-years through
the Periphery.</p>
<p>Under Hober Mallow, the first of the Foundation’s Merchant Princes,
they developed the techniques of economic warfare to the point of
defeating the Republic of Korell, even though that world was receiving
support from one of the outer provinces of what was left of the
Empire.</p>
<p>At the end of two hundred years, the Foundation was the most powerful
state in the Galaxy, except for the remains of the Empire, which,
concentrated in the inner third of the Milky Way, still controlled
three-quarters of the population and wealth of the Universe.</p>
<p>It seemed inevitable that the next danger the Foundation would have
to face was the final lash of the dying Empire.</p>
<p>The way must be cleared for the battle of Foundation and Empire.</p>
<p>BEL RIOSE.… In his relatively short career, Riose earned the title of
“The Last of the Imperials” and earned it well. A study of his campaigns
reveals him to be the equal of Peurifoy in strategic ability and his
superior perhaps in his ability to handle men. That he was born in the
days of the decline of Empire made it all but impossible for him to
equal Peurifoy’s record as a conqueror. Yet he had his chance when, the
