<h4 id="section">84</h4>
<p>The air-jet sped out of the tunnel and onto a long runway with a roof
so high that it seemed closer to true daylight than anything Seldon had
seen since he had left the Imperial Sector.</p>
<p>They came to a halt in a shorter time than Seldon would have
expected, but at the price of an uncomfortable pressure forward. Raych,
in particular, was crushed against the seat before him and was finding
it difficult to breathe till Dors’s hand on his shoulder pulled him back
slightly.</p>
<p>Sergeant Thalus, impressive and erect, left the jet and moved to the
rear, where he opened the door of the passenger compartment and helped
the three out, one by one.</p>
<p>Seldon was last. He half-turned as he passed the sergeant, saying,
“It was a pleasant trip, Sergeant.”</p>
<p>A slow smile spread over the sergeant’s large face and lifted his
mustachioed upper lip. He touched the visor of his cap in what was half
a salute and said, “Thank you again, Doctor.”</p>
<p>They were then ushered into the backseat of a ground-car of lavish
design and the sergeant himself pushed into the front seat and drove the
vehicle with a surprisingly light touch.</p>
<p>They passed through wide roadways, flanked by tall, well-designed
buildings, all glistening in broad daylight. As elsewhere on Trantor,
they heard the distant drone of an Expressway. The walkways were crowded
with what were, for the most part, well-dressed people. The surroundings
were remarkably—almost excessively—clean.</p>
<p>Seldon’s sense of security sank further. Dors’s misgivings concerning
their destination now seemed justified after all. He leaned toward her
and said, “Do you think we are back in the Imperial Sector?”</p>
<p>She said, “No, the buildings are more rococo in the Imperial Sector
and there’s less Imperial parkishness to this sector—if you know what I
mean.”</p>
<p>“Then where are we, Dors?”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to ask, I’m afraid, Hari.”</p>
<p>It was not a long trip and soon they rolled into a car-bay that
flanked an imposing four-story structure. A frieze of imaginary animals
ran along the top, decorated with strips of warm pink stone. It was an
impressive façade with a rather pleasing design.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “That certainly looks rococo enough.”</p>
<p>Dors shrugged uncertainly.</p>
<p>Raych whistled and said in a failing attempt to sound unimpressed,
“Hey, look at that fancy place.”</p>
<p>Sergeant Thalus gestured to Seldon, clearly indicating that he was to
follow. Seldon hung back and, also relying on the universal language of
gesture, held out both arms, clearly including Dors and Raych.</p>
<p>The sergeant hesitated in a slightly hangdog fashion at the
impressive pink doorway. His mustache almost seemed to droop.</p>
<p>Then he said gruffly, “All three of you, then. My word of honor
holds. —Still, others may not feel obligated by my own obligation, you
know.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “I hold you responsible for your own deeds only,
Sergeant.”</p>
<p>The sergeant was clearly moved and, for a moment, his face lightened
as though he was considering the possibility of shaking Seldon’s hand or
expressing his heartfelt approval in some other way. He decided against
it, however, and stepped onto the bottom step of the flight that led to
the door. The stairs immediately began a stately upward movement.</p>
<p>Seldon and Dors stepped after him at once and kept their balance
without much trouble. Raych, who was momentarily staggered in surprise,
jumped onto the moving stairs after a short run, shoved both hands into
his pockets, and whistled carelessly.</p>
<p>The door opened and two women stepped out, one on either side in
symmetrical fashion. They were young and attractive. Their dresses,
belted tightly about the waist and reaching nearly to their ankles, fell
in crisp pleats and rustled when they walked. Both had brown hair that
was coiled in thick plaits on either side of their heads. (Seldon found
it attractive, but wondered how long it took them each morning to
arrange it just so. He had not been aware of so elaborate a coiffure on
the women they had passed in the streets.)</p>
<p>The two women stared at the newcomers with obvious contempt. Seldon
was not surprised. After the day’s events, he and Dors looked almost as
disreputable as Raych.</p>
<p>Yet the women managed to bow decorously and then made a half-turn and
gestured inward in perfect unison and with symmetry carefully
maintained. (Did they rehearse these things?) It was clear that the
three were to enter.</p>
<p>They stepped through an elaborate room, cluttered with furniture and
decorative items whose use Seldon did not readily understand. The floor
was light-colored, springy, and glowed with luminescence. Seldon noted
with some embarrassment that their footwear left dusty marks upon
it.</p>
<p>And then an inner door was flung open and yet another woman emerged.
She was distinctly older than the first two (who sank slowly as she came
in, crossing their legs symmetrically as they did so in a way that made
Seldon marvel that they could keep their balance; it undoubtedly took a
deal of practice).</p>
<p>Seldon wondered if he too was expected to display some ritualized
form of respect, but since he hadn’t the faintest notion of what this
might consist of, he merely bowed his head slightly. Dors remained
standing erect and, it seemed to Seldon, did so with disdain. Raych was
staring open-mouthed in all directions and looked as though he didn’t
even see the woman who had just entered.</p>
<p>She was plump—not fat, but comfortably padded. She wore her hair
precisely as the young ladies did and her dress was in the same style,
but much more richly ornamented—too much so to suit Seldon’s aesthetic
notions.</p>
<p>She was clearly middle-aged and there was a hint of gray in her hair,
but the dimples in her cheeks gave her the appearance of having rather
more than a dash of youth. Her light brown eyes were merry and on the
whole she looked more motherly than old.</p>
<p>She said, “How are you? All of you.” (She showed no surprise at the
presence of Dors and Raych, but included them easily in her greeting.)
“I’ve been waiting for you for some time and almost had you on Upperside
at Streeling. You are Dr. Hari Seldon, whom I’ve been looking forward to
meeting. You, I think, must be Dr. Dors Venabili, for you had been
reported to be in his company. This young man I fear I do not know, but
I am pleased to see him. But we must not spend our time talking, for I’m
sure you would like to rest first.”</p>
<p>“And bathe, Madam,” said Dors rather forcefully, “Each of us could
use a thorough shower.”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly,” said the woman, “and a change in clothing.
Especially the young man.” She looked down at Raych without any of the
look of contempt and disapproval that the two young women had shown.</p>
<p>She said, “What is your name, young man?”</p>
<p>“Raych,” said Raych in a rather choked and embarrassed voice. He then
added experimentally, “Missus.”</p>
<p>“What an odd coincidence,” said the woman, her eyes sparkling. “An
omen, perhaps. My own name is Rashelle. Isn’t that odd? —But come. We
shall take care of you all. Then there will be plenty of time to have
dinner and to talk.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Madam,” said Dors. “May I ask where we are?”</p>
<p>“Wye, dear. And please call me Rashelle, as you come to feel more
friendly. I am always at ease with informality.”</p>
<p>Dors stiffened. “Are you surprised that we ask? Isn’t it natural that
we should want to know where we are?”</p>
<p>Rashelle laughed in a pleasant, tinkling manner. “Really,
Dr. Venabili, something must be done about the name of this place. I was
not asking a question but making a statement. You asked where you were
and I did not ask you why. I told you, ‘Wye.’ You are in the Wye
Sector.”</p>
<p>“In Wye?” said Seldon forcibly.</p>
<p>“Yes indeed, Dr. Seldon. We’ve wanted you from the day you addressed
the Decennial Convention and we are so glad to have you now.”</p>
