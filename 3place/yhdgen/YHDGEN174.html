<h4 id="section">36</h4>
<p>They landed at a jetport that seemed deserted to Seldon’s wondering
eyes. The pilot, having completed his task, shook hands with both Hari
and Dors and took his jet up into the air with a rush, plunging it into
an opening that appeared for his benefit.</p>
<p>There seemed, then, nothing to do but wait. There were benches that
could seat perhaps a hundred people, but Seldon and Dors Venabili were
the only two people around. The port was rectangular, surrounded by
walls in which there must be many tunnels that could open to receive or
deliver jets, but there were no jets present after their own had
departed and none arrived while they waited.</p>
<p>There were no people arriving or any indications of habitation; the
very life hum of Trantor was muted.</p>
<p>Seldon felt this aloneness to be oppressive. He turned to Dors and
said, “What is it that we must do here? Have you any idea?”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “Hummin told me we would be met by Sunmaster
Fourteen. I don’t know anything beyond that.”</p>
<p>“Sunmaster Fourteen? What would that be?”</p>
<p>“A human being, I presume. From the name I can’t be certain whether
it would be a man or a woman.”</p>
<p>“An odd name.”</p>
<p>“Oddity is in the mind of the receiver. I am sometimes taken to be a
man by those who have never met me.”</p>
<p>“What fools they must be,” said Seldon, smiling.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Judging from my name, they are justified. I’m told it is
a popular masculine name on various worlds.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never encountered it before.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you aren’t much of a Galactic traveler. The name
‘Hari’ is common enough everywhere, although I once knew a woman named
‘Hare,’ pronounced like your name but spelled with an ‘e.’ In Mycogen,
as I recall, particular names are confined to families—and
numbered.”</p>
<p>“But Sunmaster seems so unrestrained a name.”</p>
<p>“What’s a little braggadocio? Back on Cinna, ‘Dors’ is from an old
local expression meaning ‘spring gift.’”</p>
<p>“Because you were born in the spring?”</p>
<p>“No. I first saw the light of day at the height of Cinna’s summer,
but the name struck my people as pleasant regardless of its
traditional—and largely forgotten—meaning.”</p>
<p>“In that case, perhaps Sunmaster—”</p>
<p>And a deep, severe voice said, “That is my name, tribesman.”</p>
<p>Seldon, startled, looked to his left. An open ground-car had somehow
drawn close. It was boxy and archaic, looking almost like a delivery
wagon. In it, at the controls, was a tall old man who looked vigorous
despite his age. With stately majesty, he got out of the ground-car.</p>
<p>He wore a long white gown with voluminous sleeves, pinched in at the
wrists. Beneath the gown were soft sandals from which the big toe
protruded, while his head, beautifully shaped, was completely hairless.
He regarded the two calmly with his deep blue eyes.</p>
<p>He said, “I greet you, tribesman.”</p>
<p>Seldon said with automatic politeness, “Greetings, sir.” Then,
honestly puzzled, he asked, “How did you get in?”</p>
<p>“Through the entrance, which closed behind me. You paid little
heed.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we didn’t. But then we didn’t know what to expect. Nor do
we now.”</p>
<p>“Tribesman Chetter Hummin informed the Brethren that there would be
members from two of the tribes arriving. He asked that you be cared
for.”</p>
<p>“Then you know Hummin.”</p>
<p>“We do. He has been of service to us. And because he, a worthy
tribesman, has been of service to us, so must we be now to him. There
are few who come to Mycogen and few who leave. I am to make you secure,
give you house-room, see that you are undisturbed. You will be safe
here.”</p>
<p>Dors bent her head. “We are grateful, Sunmaster Fourteen.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster turned to look at her with an air of dispassionate
contempt. “I am not unaware of the customs of the tribes,” he said. “I
know that among them a woman may well speak before being spoken to. I am
therefore not offended. I would ask her to have a care among others of
the Brethren who may be of lesser knowledge in the matter.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?” said Dors, who was clearly offended, even if Sunmaster
was not.</p>
<p>“In truth,” agreed Sunmaster. “Nor is it needful to use my numerical
identifier when I alone of my cohort am with you. ‘Sunmaster’ will be
sufficient. —Now I will ask you to come with me so that we may leave
this place which is of too tribal a nature to comfort me.”</p>
<p>“Comfort is for all of us,” said Seldon, perhaps a little more loudly
than was necessary, “and we will not budge from this place unless we are
assured that we will not be forcibly bent to your liking against our own
natures. It is our custom that a woman may speak whenever she has
something to say. If you have agreed to keep us secure, that security
must be psychological as well as physical.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster gazed at Seldon levelly and said, “You are bold, young
tribesman. Your name?”</p>
<p>“I am Hari Seldon of Helicon. My companion is Dors Venabili of
Cinna.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster bowed slightly as Seldon pronounced his own name, did not
move at the mention of Dors’s name. He said, “I have sworn to Tribesman
Hummin that we will keep you safe, so I will do what I can to protect
your woman companion in this. If she wishes to exercise her impudence, I
will do my best to see that she is held guiltless. —Yet in one respect
you must conform.”</p>
<p>And he pointed, with infinite scorn, first to Seldon’s head and then
to Dors’s.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Your cephalic hair.”</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>“It must not be seen.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean we’re to shave our heads like you? Certainly not.”</p>
<p>“My head is not shaven, Tribesman Seldon. I was depilated when I
entered puberty, as are all the Brethren and their women.”</p>
<p>“If we’re talking about depilation, then more than ever the answer is
no—never.”</p>
<p>“Tribesman, we ask neither shaving nor depilation. We ask only that
your hair be covered when you are among us.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I have brought skincaps that will mold themselves to your skulls,
together with strips that will hide the superoptical patches—the
eyebrows. You will wear them while with us. And of course, Tribesman
Seldon, you will shave daily—or oftener if that becomes necessary.”</p>
<p>“But why must we do this?”</p>
<p>“Because to us, hair on the head is repulsive and obscene.”</p>
<p>“Surely, you and all your people know that it is customary for
others, in all the worlds of the Galaxy, to retain their cephalic
hair.”</p>
<p>“We know. And those among us, like myself, who must deal with
tribesmen now and then, must witness this hair. We manage, but it is
unfair to ask the Brethren generally to suffer the sight.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Very well, then, Sunmaster—but tell me. Since you are
born with cephalic hair, as all of us are and as you all retain it
visibly till puberty, why is it so necessary to remove it? Is it just a
matter of custom or is there some rationale behind it?”</p>
<p>And the old Mycogenian said proudly, “By depilation, we demonstrate
to the youngster that he or she has become an adult and through
depilation adults will always remember who they are and never forget
that all others are but tribesmen.”</p>
<p>He waited for no response (and, in truth, Seldon could think of none)
but brought out from some hidden compartment in his robe a handful of
thin bits of plastic of varying color, stared keenly at the two faces
before him, holding first one strip, then another, against each
face.</p>
<p>“The colors must match reasonably,” he said. “No one will be fooled
into thinking you are not wearing a skincap, but it must not be
repulsively obvious.”</p>
<p>Finally, Sunmaster gave a particular strip to Seldon and showed him
how it could be pulled out into a cap.</p>
<p>“Please put it on, Tribesman Seldon,” he said. “You will find the
process clumsy at first, but you will grow accustomed to it.”</p>
<p>Seldon put it on, but the first two times it slipped off when he
tried to pull it backward over his hair.</p>
<p>“Begin just above your eyebrows,” said Sunmaster. His fingers seemed
to twitch, as though eager to help.</p>
<p>Seldon said, suppressing a smile, “Would you do it for me?”</p>
<p>And Sunmaster drew back, saying, almost in agitation, “I couldn’t. I
would be touching your hair.”</p>
<p>Seldon managed to hook it on and followed Sunmaster’s advice, in
pulling it here and there until all his hair was covered. The eyebrow
patches fitted on easily. Dors, who had watched carefully, put hers on
without trouble.</p>
<p>“How does it come off?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>“You have but to find an end and it will peel off without trouble.
You will find it easier both to put on and take off if you cut your hair
shorter.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather struggle a bit,” said Seldon. Then, turning to Dors, he
said in a low voice, “You’re still pretty, Dors, but it does tend to
remove some of the character from your face.”</p>
<p>“The character is there underneath just the same,” she answered. “And
I dare say you’ll grow accustomed to the hairless me.”</p>
<p>In a still lower whisper, Seldon said, “I don’t want to stay here
long enough to get accustomed to this.”</p>
<p>Sunmaster, who ignored, with visible haughtiness, the mumblings among
mere tribesmen, said, “If you will enter my ground-car, I will now take
you into Mycogen.”</p>
