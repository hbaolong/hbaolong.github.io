<h4 id="section">23</h4>
<p>Jenarr Leggen had a dark look about him. It was not so much his
complexion, which was fair enough. It was not even his eyebrows, which
were thick and dark enough. It was, rather, that those eyebrows were
hunched over deepset eyes and a long and rather prominent nose. He had,
as a result, a most unmerry look. His eyes did not smile and when he
spoke, which wasn’t often, he had a deep, strong voice, surprisingly
resonant for his rather thin body.</p>
<p>He said, “You’ll need warmer clothing than that, Seldon.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Oh?” and looked about.</p>
<p>There were two men and two women who were making ready to go up with
Leggen and Seldon and, as in Leggen’s own case, their rather satiny
Trantorian clothing was covered by thick sweaters that, not
surprisingly, were brightly colored in bold designs. No two were even
faintly alike, of course.</p>
<p>Seldon looked down at himself and said, “Sorry, I didn’t know—but I
don’t have any suitable outer garment.”</p>
<p>“I can give you one. I think there’s a spare here somewhere. —Yes,
here it is. A little threadbare, but it’s better than nothing.”</p>
<p>“Wearing sweaters like these can make you unpleasantly warm,” said
Seldon.</p>
<p>“Here they would,” said Leggen. “Other conditions exist Upperside.
Cold and windy. Too bad I don’t have spare leggings and boots for you
too. You’ll want them later.”</p>
<p>They were taking with them a cart of instruments, which they were
testing one by one with what Seldon thought was unnecessary
slowness.</p>
<p>“Your home planet cold?” asked Leggen.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Parts of it, of course. The part of Helicon I come from
is mild and often rainy.”</p>
<p>“Too bad. You won’t like the weather Upperside.”</p>
<p>“I think I can manage to endure it for the time we’ll be up
there.”</p>
<p>When they were ready, the group filed into an elevator that was
marked: OFFICIAL USE ONLY.</p>
<p>“That’s because it goes Upperside,” said one of the young women, “and
people aren’t supposed to be up there without good reason.”</p>
<p>Seldon had not met the young woman before, but he had heard her
addressed as Clowzia. He didn’t know if that was a first name, a last
name, or a nickname.</p>
<p>The elevator seemed no different from others that Seldon had been on,
either here on Trantor or at home in Helicon (barring, of course, the
gravitic lift he and Hummin had used), but there was something about
knowing that it was going to take him out of the confines of the planet
and into emptiness above that made it feel like a spaceship.</p>
<p>Seldon smiled internally. A foolish fantasy.</p>
<p>The elevator quivered slightly, which reminded Seldon of Hummin’s
forebodings of Galactic decay. Leggen, along with the other men and one
of the women, seemed frozen and waiting, as though they had suspended
thought as well as activity until they could get out, but Clowzia kept
glancing at him as though she found him terribly impressive.</p>
<p>Seldon leaned close and whispered to her (he hesitated to disturb the
others), “Are we going up very high?”</p>
<p>“High?” she repeated. She spoke in a normal voice, apparently not
feeling that the others required silence. She seemed very young and it
occurred to Seldon that she was probably an undergraduate. An
apprentice, perhaps.</p>
<p>“We’re taking a long time. Upperside must be many stories high in the
air.”</p>
<p>For a moment, she looked puzzled. Then, “Oh no. Not high at all. We
started very deep. The University is at a low level. We use a great deal
of energy and if we’re quite deep, the energy costs are lower.”</p>
<p>Leggen said, “All right. We’re here. Let’s get the equipment
out.”</p>
<p>The elevator stopped with a small shudder and the wide door slid open
rapidly. The temperature dropped at once and Seldon thrust his hands
into his pockets and was very glad he had a sweater on. A cold wind
stirred his hair and it occurred to him that he would have found a hat
useful and, even as he thought that, Leggen pulled something out of a
fold in his sweater, snapped it open, and put it on his head. The others
did the same.</p>
<p>Only Clowzia hesitated. She paused just before she put hers on, then
offered it to Seldon.</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “I can’t take your hat, Clowzia.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. I have long hair and it’s pretty thick. Yours is short and
a little … thin.”</p>
<p>Seldon would have liked to deny that firmly and at another time he
would have. Now, however, he took the hat and mumbled, “Thank you. If
your head gets cold, I’ll give it back.”</p>
<p>Maybe she wasn’t so young. It was her round face, almost a baby face.
And now that she had called attention to her hair, he could see that it
was a charming russet shade. He had never seen hair quite like that on
Helicon.</p>
<p>Outside it was cloudy, as it had been the time he was taken across
open country to the Palace. It was considerably colder than it had been
then, but he assumed that was because they were six weeks farther into
winter. The clouds were thicker than they had been on the earlier
occasion and the day was distinctly darker and threatening—or was it
just closer to night?</p>
<p>Surely, they wouldn’t come up to do important work without leaving
themselves an ample period of daylight to do it in. Or did they expect
to take very little time?</p>
<p>He would have liked to have asked, but it occurred to him that they
might not like questions at this time. All of them seemed to be in
states varying from excitement to anger.</p>
<p>Seldon inspected his surroundings.</p>
<p>He was standing on something that he thought might be dull metal from
the sound it made when he surreptitiously thumped his foot down on it.
It was not bare metal, however. When he walked, he left footprints. The
surface was clearly covered by dust or fine sand or clay.</p>
<p>Well, why not? There could scarcely be anyone coming up here to dust
the place. He bent down to pinch up some of the matter out of
curiosity.</p>
<p>Clowzia had come up to him. She noticed what he was doing and said,
with the air of a housewife caught at an embarrassing negligence, “We do
sweep hereabouts for the sake of the instruments. It’s much worse most
places Upperside, but it really doesn’t matter. It makes for insulation,
you know.”</p>
<p>Seldon grunted and continued to look about. There was no chance of
understanding the instruments that looked as though they were growing
out of the thin soil (if one could call it that). He hadn’t the faintest
idea of what they were or what they measured.</p>
<p>Leggen was walking toward him. He was picking up his feet and putting
them down gingerly and it occurred to Seldon that he was doing so to
avoid jarring the instruments. He made a mental note to walk that way
himself.</p>
<p>“You! Seldon!”</p>
<p>Seldon didn’t quite like the tone of voice. He replied coolly, “Yes,
Dr. Leggen?”</p>
<p>“Well, Dr. Seldon, then.” He said it impatiently. “That little fellow
Randa told me you are a mathematician.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“A good one?”</p>
<p>“I’d like to think so, but it’s a hard thing to guarantee.”</p>
<p>“And you’re interested in intractable problems?”</p>
<p>Seldon said feelingly, “I’m stuck with one.”</p>
<p>“I’m stuck with another. You’re free to look about. If you have any
questions, our intern, Clowzia, will help out. You might be able to help
us.”</p>
<p>“I would be delighted to, but I know nothing about meteorology.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, Seldon. I just want you to get a feel for this
thing and then I’d like to discuss my mathematics, such as it is.”</p>
<p>“I’m at your service.”</p>
<p>Leggen turned away, his long scowling face looking grim. Then he
turned back. “If you get cold—too cold—the elevator door is open. You
just step in and touch the spot marked: UNIVERSITY BASE. It will take
you down and the elevator will then return to us automatically. Clowzia
will show you—if you forget.”</p>
<p>“I won’t forget.”</p>
<p>This time he did leave and Seldon looked after him, feeling the cold
wind knife through his sweater. Clowzia came back over to him, her face
slightly reddened by that wind.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Dr. Leggen seems annoyed. Or is that just his ordinary
outlook on life?”</p>
<p>She giggled. “He does look annoyed most of the time, but right now he
really is.”</p>
<p>Seldon said very naturally, “Why?”</p>
<p>Clowzia looked over her shoulder, her long hair swirling. Then she
said, “I’m not supposed to know, but I do just the same. Dr. Leggen had
it all figured out that today, just at this time, there was going to be
a break in the clouds and he’d been planning to make special
measurements in sunlight. Only … well, look at the weather.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded.</p>
<p>“We have holovision receivers up here, so he knew it was cloudy—worse
than usual—and I guess he was hoping there would be something wrong with
the instruments so that it would be their fault and not that of his
theory. So far, though, they haven’t found anything out of the way.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why he looks so unhappy.”</p>
<p>“Well, he never looks happy.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked about, squinting. Despite the clouds, the light was
harsh. He became aware that the surface under his feet was not quite
horizontal. He was standing on a shallow dome and as he looked outward
there were other domes in all directions, with different widths and
heights.</p>
<p>“Upperside seems to be irregular,” he said.</p>
<p>“Mostly, I think. That’s the way it worked out.”</p>
<p>“Any reason for it?”</p>
<p>“Not really. The way I’ve heard it explained—I looked around and
asked, just as you did, you know—was that originally the people on
Trantor domed in places, shopping malls, sports arenas, things like
that, then whole towns, so that there were lots of domes here and there,
with different heights and different widths. When they all came
together, it was all uneven, but by that time, people decided that’s the
way it ought to be.”</p>
<p>“You mean that something quite accidental came to be viewed as a
tradition?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so—if you want to put it that way.”</p>
<p>(If something quite accidental can easily become viewed as a
tradition and be made unbreakable or nearly so, thought Seldon, would
that be a law of psychohistory? It sounded trivial, but how many other
laws, equally trivial, might there be? A million? A billion? Were there
a relatively few general laws from which these trivial ones could be
derived as corollaries? How could he say? For a while, lost in thought,
he almost forgot the biting wind.)</p>
<p>Clowzia was aware of that wind, however, for she shuddered and said,
“It’s very nasty. It’s much better under the dome.”</p>
<p>“Are you a Trantorian?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Seldon remembered Randa’s dismissal of Trantorians as agoraphobic and
said, “Do you mind being up here?”</p>
<p>“I hate it,” said Clowzia, “but I want my degree and my specialty and
status and Dr. Leggen says I can’t get it without some field work. So
here I am, hating it, especially when it’s so cold. When it’s this cold,
by the way, you wouldn’t dream that vegetation actually grows on these
domes, would you?”</p>
<p>“It does?” He looked at Clowzia sharply, suspecting some sort of
practical joke designed to make him look foolish. She looked totally
innocent, but how much of that was real and how much was just her baby
face?</p>
<p>“Oh sure. Even here, when it’s warmer. You notice the soil here? We
keep it swept away because of our work, as I said, but in other places
it accumulates here and there and is especially deep in the low places
where the domes meet. Plants grow in it.”</p>
<p>“But where does the soil come from?”</p>
<p>“When the domes covered just part of the planet, the wind deposited
soil on them, little by little. Then, when Trantor was all covered and
the living levels were dug deeper and deeper, some of the material dug
up, if suitable, would be spread over the top.”</p>
<p>“Surely, it would break down the domes.”</p>
<p>“Oh no. The domes are very strong and they’re supported almost
everywhere. The idea was, according to a book-film I viewed, that they
were going to grow crops Upperside, but it turned out to be much more
practical to do it inside the dome. Yeast and algae could be cultivated
within the domes too, taking the pressure off the usual crops, so it was
decided to let Upperside go wild. There are animals on Upperside
too—butterflies, bees, mice, rabbits. Lots of them.”</p>
<p>“Won’t the plant roots damage the domes?”</p>
<p>“In thousands of years they haven’t. The domes are treated so that
they repel the roots. Most of the growth is grass, but there are trees
too. You’d be able to see for yourself if this were the warm season or
if we were farther south or if you were up in a spaceship.” She looked
at him with a sidewise flick of her eyes, “Did you see Trantor when you
were coming down from space?”</p>
<p>“No, Clowzia, I must confess I didn’t. The hypership was never well
placed for viewing. Have you ever seen Trantor from space?”</p>
<p>She smiled weakly. “I’ve never been in space.”</p>
<p>Seldon looked about. Gray everywhere.</p>
<p>“I can’t make myself believe it,” he said. “About vegetation
Upperside, I mean.”</p>
<p>“It’s true, though. I’ve heard people say—Otherworlders, like
yourself, who did see Trantor from space—that the planet looks green,
like a lawn, because it’s mostly grass and underbrush. There are trees
too, actually. There’s a copse not very far from here. I’ve seen it.
They’re evergreens and they’re up to six meters high.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“You can’t see it from here. It’s on the other side of a dome.
It’s—”</p>
<p>The call came out thinly. (Seldon realized they had been walking
while they had been talking and had moved away from the immediate
vicinity of the others.) “Clowzia. Get back here. We need you.”</p>
<p>Clowzia said, “Uh-oh. Coming. —Sorry, Dr. Seldon, I have to go.” She
ran off, managing to step lightly despite her lined boots.</p>
<p>Had she been playing with him? Had she been filling the gullible
foreigner with a mess of lies for amusement’s sake? Such things had been
known to happen on every world and in every time. An air of transparent
honesty was no guide either; in fact, successful taletellers would
deliberately cultivate just such an air.</p>
<p>So could there really be six-meter trees Upperside? Without thinking
much about it, he moved in the direction of the highest dome on the
horizon. He swung his arms in an attempt to warm himself. And his feet
were getting cold.</p>
<p>Clowzia hadn’t pointed. She might have, to give him a hint of the
direction of the trees, but she didn’t. Why didn’t she? To be sure, she
had been called away.</p>
<p>The domes were broad rather than high, which was a good thing, since
otherwise the going would have been considerably more difficult. On the
other hand, the gentle grade meant trudging a distance before he could
top a dome and look down the other side.</p>
<p>Eventually, he could see the other side of the dome he had climbed.
He looked back to make sure he could still see the meteorologists and
their instruments. They were a good way off, in a distant valley, but he
could see them clearly enough. Good.</p>
<p>He saw no copse, no trees, but there was a depression that snaked
about between two domes. Along each side of that crease, the soil was
thicker and there were occasional green smears of what might be moss. If
he followed the crease and if it got low enough and the soil was thick
enough, there might be trees.</p>
<p>He looked back, trying to fix landmarks in his mind, but there were
just the rise and fall of domes. It made him hesitate and Dors’s warning
against his being lost, which had seemed a rather unnecessary piece of
advice then, made more sense now. Still, it seemed clear to him that the
crease was a kind of road. If he followed it for some distance, he only
had to turn about and follow it back to return to this spot.</p>
<p>He strode off purposefully, following the rounded crease downward.
There was a soft rumbling noise above, but he didn’t give it any
thought. He had made up his mind that he wanted to see trees and that
was all that occupied him at the moment.</p>
<p>The moss grew thicker and spread out like a carpet and here and there
grassy tufts had sprung up. Despite the desolation Upperside, the moss
was bright green and it occurred to Seldon that on a cloudy, overcast
planet there was likely to be considerable rain.</p>
<p>The crease continued to curve and there, just above another dome, was
a dark smudge against the gray sky and he knew he had found the
trees.</p>
<p>Then, as though his mind, having been liberated by the sight of those
trees, could turn to other things, Seldon took note of the rumble he had
heard before and had, without thinking, dismissed as the sound of
machinery. Now he considered that possibility: Was it, indeed, the sound
of machinery?</p>
<p>Why not? He was standing on one of the myriad domes that covered
hundreds of millions of square kilometers of the world-city. There must
be machinery of all kinds hidden under those domes—ventilation motors,
for one thing. Maybe it could be heard, where and when all the other
sounds of the world-city were absent.</p>
<p>Except that it did not seem to come from the ground. He looked up at
the dreary featureless sky. Nothing.</p>
<p>He continued to scan the sky, vertical creases appearing between his
eyes and then, far off—</p>
<p>It was a small dark spot, showing up against the gray. And whatever
it was it seemed to be moving about as though getting its bearings
before it was obscured by the clouds again.</p>
<p>Then, without knowing why, he thought, They’re after me.</p>
<p>And almost before he could work out a line of action, he had taken
one. He ran desperately along the crease toward the trees and then, to
reach them more quickly, he turned left and hurtled up and over a low
dome, treading through brown and dying fernlike overgrowth, including
thorny springs with bright red berries.</p>
