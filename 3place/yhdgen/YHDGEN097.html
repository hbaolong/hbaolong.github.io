<p>THE ANSWER THAT WAS TRUE</p>
<p>An unlocated room on an unlocated world!</p>
<p>And a man whose plan had worked.</p>
<p>The First Speaker looked up at the Student, “Fifty men and women,” he
said. “Fifty martyrs! They knew it meant death or permanent imprisonment
and they could not even be oriented to prevent weakening—since
orientation might have been detected. Yet they did not weaken. They
brought the plan through, because they loved the greater Plan.”</p>
<p>“Might they have been fewer?” asked the Student, doubtfully.</p>
<p>The First Speaker slowly shook his head, “It was the lower limit.
Less could not possibly have carried conviction. In fact, pure
objectivism would have demanded seventy-five to leave margin for error.
Never mind. Have you studied the course of action as worked out by the
Speakers’ Council fifteen years ago?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker.”</p>
<p>“And compared it with actual developments?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker.” Then, after a pause—</p>
<p>“I was quite amazed, Speaker.”</p>
<p>“I know. There is always amazement. If you knew how many men labored
for how many months—years, in fact—to bring about the polish of
perfection, you would be less amazed. Now tell me what happened—in
words. I want your translation of the mathematics.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Speaker.” The young man marshaled his thoughts. “Essentially,
it was necessary for the men of the First Foundation to be thoroughly
convinced that they had located and destroyed the Second Foundation. In
that way, there would be reversion to the intended original. To all
intents, Terminus would once again know nothing about us; include us in
none of their calculations. We are hidden once more, and safe—at the
cost of fifty men.”</p>
<p>“And the purpose of the Kalganian war?”</p>
<p>“To show the Foundation that they could beat a physical enemy—to wipe
out the damage done to their self-esteem and self-assuredness by the
Mule.”</p>
<p>“There you are insufficient in your analysis. Remember, the
population of Terminus regarded us with distinct ambivalence. They hated
and envied our supposed superiority; yet they relied on us implicitly
for protection. If we had been ‘destroyed’ before the Kalganian war, it
would have meant panic throughout the Foundation. They would then never
have had the courage to stand up against Stettin, when he then attacked;
and he would have. Only in the full flush of victory could the
‘destruction’ have taken place with minimum ill-effects. Even waiting a
year, thereafter, might have meant a too-great cooling-off spirit for
success.”</p>
<p>The Student nodded. “I see. Then the course of history will proceed
without deviation in the direction indicated by the Plan.”</p>
<p>“Unless,” pointed out the First Speaker, “further accidents,
unforeseen and individual, occur.”</p>
<p>“And for that,” said the Student, “we will exist. Except— Except— One
facet of the present state of affairs worries me, Speaker. The First
Foundation is left with the Mind Static device—a powerful weapon against
us. That, at least, is not as it was before.”</p>
<p>“A good point. But they have no one to use it against. It has become
a sterile device; just as without the spur of our own menace against
them, encephalographic analysis will become a sterile science. Other
varieties of knowledge will once again bring more important and
immediate returns. So this first generation of mental scientists among
the First Foundation will also be the last—and, in a century, Mind
Static will be a nearly forgotten item of the past.”</p>
<p>“Well—” The Student was calculating mentally. “I suppose you’re
right.”</p>
<p>“But what I want you most to realize, young man, for the sake of your
future in the Council, is the consideration given to the tiny
intermeshings that were forced into our plan of the last decade and a
half simply because we dealt with individuals. There was the manner in
which Anthor had to create suspicion against himself in such a way that
it would mature at the right time, but that was relatively simple.</p>
<p>“There was the manner in which the atmosphere was so manipulated that
to no one on Terminus would it occur, prematurely, that Terminus itself
might be the center they were seeking. That knowledge had to be supplied
to the young girl, Arcadia, who would be heeded by no one but her own
father. She had to be sent to Trantor, thereafter, to make certain that
there would be no premature contact with her father. Those two were the
two poles of a hypernuclear motor; each being inactive without the
other. And the switch had to be thrown—contact had to be made—at just
the right moment. I saw to that!</p>
<p>“And the final battle had to be handled properly. The Foundation’s
fleet had to be soaked in self-confidence, while the fleet of Kalgan
made ready to run. I saw to that, also!”</p>
<p>Said the Student, “It seems to me, Speaker, that you … I mean, all of
us … were counting on Dr. Darell not suspecting that Arcadia was our
tool. According to my check on the calculations, there was something
like a thirty percent probability that he would so suspect. What would
have happened then?”</p>
<p>“We had taken care of that. What have you been taught about Tamper
Plateaus? What are they? Certainly not evidence of the introduction of
an emotional bias. That can be done without any chance of possible
detection by the most refined conceivable encephalographic analysis. A
consequence of Leffert’s Theorem, you know. It is the removal, the
cutting-out, of previous emotional bias, that shows. It must show.</p>
<p>“And, of course, Anthor made certain that Darell knew all about
Tamper Plateaus.</p>
<p>“However— When can an individual be placed under Control without
showing it? Where there is no previous emotional bias to remove. In
other words, when the individual is a newborn infant with a blank slate
of a mind. Arcadia Darell was such an infant here on Trantor fifteen
years ago, when the first line was drawn into the structure of the Plan.
She will never know that she has been Controlled, and will be all the
better for it, since her Control involved the development of a precious
and intelligent personality.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker laughed shortly, “In a sense, it is the irony of it
all that is most amazing. For four hundred years, so many men have been
blinded by Seldon’s words ‘the other end of the Galaxy,’ they have
brought their own peculiar, physical-science thought to the problem,
measuring off the other end with protractors and rulers, ending up
eventually either at a point in the periphery one hundred eighty degrees
around the rim of the Galaxy, or back at the original point.</p>
<p>“Yet our very greatest danger lay in the fact that there was a
possible solution based on physical modes of thought. The Galaxy, you
know, is not simply a flat ovoid of any sort; nor is the Periphery a
closed curve. Actually, it is a double spiral, with at least eighty
percent of the inhabited planets on the Main Arm. Terminus is the
extreme outer end of the spiral arm, and we are at the other—since, what
is the opposite end of a spiral? Why, the central regions.</p>
<p>“But that is trifling. It is an accidental and irrelevant solution.
The solution could have been reached immediately, if the questioners had
but remembered that Hari Seldon was a social scientist, not a physical
scientist, and adjusted their thought processes accordingly. What could
‘opposite ends’ mean to a social scientist? Opposite ends on the map? Of
course not. That’s the mechanical interpretation only.</p>
<p>“The First Foundation was at the Periphery, where the original Empire
was weakest, where its civilizing influence was least, where its wealth
and culture were most nearly absent. And where is the social opposite
end of the Galaxy? Why, at the place where the original Empire was
strongest, where its civilizing influence was most, where its wealth and
culture were most strongly present.</p>
<p>“Here! At the center! At Trantor, capital of the Empire of Seldon’s
time.</p>
<p>“And it is so inevitable. Hari Seldon left the Second Foundation
behind him to maintain, improve, and extend his work. That has been
known, or guessed at, for fifty years. But where could that best be
done? At Trantor, where Seldon’s group had worked, and where the data of
decades had been accumulated. And it was the purpose of the Second
Foundation to protect the Plan against enemies. That, too, was known!
And where was the source of greatest danger to Terminus and the
Plan?</p>
<p>“Here! Here at Trantor, where the Empire, dying though it was, could,
for three centuries, still destroy the Foundation, if it could only have
decided to do so.</p>
<p>“Then when Trantor fell and was sacked and utterly destroyed, a short
century ago, we were naturally able to protect our headquarters, and, on
all the planet, the Imperial Library and the grounds about it remained
untouched. This was well-known to the Galaxy, but even that apparently
overwhelming hint passed them by.</p>
<p>“It was here at Trantor that Ebling Mis discovered us; and here that
we saw to it that he did not survive the discovery. To do so, it was
necessary to arrange to have a normal Foundation girl defeat the
tremendous mutant powers of the Mule. Surely, such a phenomenon might
have attracted suspicion to the planet on which it happened—It was here
that we first studied the Mule and planned his ultimate defeat. It was
here that Arcadia was born and the train of events begun that led to the
great return to the Seldon Plan.</p>
<p>“And all those flaws in our secrecy; those gaping holes; remained
unnoticed because Seldon had spoken of ‘the other end’ in his way, and
they had interpreted it in their way.”</p>
<p>The First Speaker had long since stopped speaking to the Student. It
was an exposition to himself, really, as he stood before the window,
looking up at the incredible blaze of the firmament; at the huge Galaxy
that was now safe forever.</p>
<p>“Hari Seldon called Trantor ‘Star’s End,’” he whispered, “and why not
that bit of poetic imagery? All the universe was once guided from this
rock; all the apron strings of the stars led here. ‘All roads lead to
Trantor,’ says the old proverb, ‘and that is where all stars end.’”</p>
<p>Eight months earlier, the First Speaker had viewed those same
crowding stars—nowhere as crowded as in the central regions of that huge
cluster of matter Man calls the Galaxy—with misgivings; but now there
was a somber satisfaction on the round and ruddy face of Preem
Palver—First Speaker.</p>
<p>PROLOGUE</p>
<p>The first Galactic Empire was falling. It had been decaying and
breaking down for centuries and only one man fully realized that
fact.</p>
<p>He was Hari Seldon, the last great scientist of the First Empire, and
it was he who perfected psychohistory—the science of human behavior
reduced to mathematical equations.</p>
<p>The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of
human mobs, Seldon found, could be treated statistically. The larger the
mob, the greater the accuracy that could be achieved. And the size of
the human masses that Seldon worked with was no less than the population
of all the inhabited millions of worlds of the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Seldon’s equations told him that, left to itself, the Empire would
fall and that thirty thousand years of human misery and agony would
elapse before a Second Empire would arise from the ruins. And yet, if
one could adjust some of the conditions that existed, that Interregnum
could be decreased to a single millennium—just one thousand years.</p>
<p>It was to insure this that Seldon set up two colonies of scientists
that he called “Foundations.” With deliberate intention, he set them up
“at opposite ends of the Galaxy.” The First Foundation, which centered
on physical science, was set up in the full daylight of publicity. The
existence of the other, the Second Foundation, a world of
psychohistorical and “mentalic” scientists, was drowned in silence.</p>
<p>In The Foundation Trilogy, the story of the first four centuries of
the Interregnum is told. The First Foundation (commonly known as simply
“The Foundation,” since the existence of another was unknown to almost
all) began as a small community lost in the emptiness of the Outer
Periphery of the Galaxy. Periodically it faced a crisis in which the
variables of human intercourse—and of the social and economic currents
of the time—constricted about it. Its freedom to move lay along only one
certain line and when it moved in that direction, a new horizon of
development opened before it. All had been planned by Hari Seldon, long
dead now.</p>
<p>The First Foundation, with its superior science, took over the
barbarized planets that surrounded it. It faced the anarchic warlords
who broke away from the dying Empire and beat them. It faced the remnant
of the Empire itself under its last strong Emperor and its last strong
general—and beat it.</p>
<p>It seemed as though the “Seldon Plan” was going through smoothly and
that nothing would prevent the Second Empire from being established on
time—and with a minimum of intermediate devastation.</p>
<p>But psychohistory is a statistical science. Always there is a small
chance that something will go wrong, and something did—something which
Hari Seldon could not have foreseen. One man, called the Mule, appeared
from nowhere. He had mental powers in a Galaxy that lacked them. He
could mold men’s emotions and shape their minds so that his bitterest
opponents were made into his devoted servants. Armies could not, would
not, fight him. The First Foundation fell and Seldon’s Plan seemed to
lie in ruins.</p>
<p>There was left the mysterious Second Foundation, which had been
caught unprepared by the sudden appearance of the Mule, but which was
now slowly working out a counterattack. Its great defense was the fact
of its unknown location. The Mule sought it in order to make his
conquest of the Galaxy complete. The faithful of what was left of the
First Foundation sought it to obtain help.</p>
<p>Neither found it. The Mule was stopped first by the action of a
woman, Bayta Darell, and that bought enough time for the Second
Foundation to organize the proper action and, with that, to stop the
Mule permanently. Slowly they prepared to reinstate the Seldon Plan.</p>
<p>But, in a way, the cover of the Second Foundation was gone. The First
Foundation knew of the Second’s existence, and the First did not want a
future in which they were overseen by the mentalists. The First
Foundation was the superior in physical force, while the Second
Foundation was hampered not only by that fact, but by being faced by a
double task: it had not only to stop the First Foundation but had also
to regain its anonymity.</p>
<p>This the Second Foundation, under its greatest “First Speaker,” Preem
Palver, managed to do. The First Foundation was allowed to seem to win,
to seem to defeat the Second Foundation, and it moved on to greater and
greater strength in the Galaxy, totally ignorant that the Second
Foundation still existed.</p>
<p>It is now four hundred and ninety-eight years after the First
Foundation had come into existence. It is at the peak of its strength,
but one man does not accept appearances—</p>
