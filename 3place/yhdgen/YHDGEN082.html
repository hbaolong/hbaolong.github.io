<p>ARCADIA</p>
<p>Arcadia Darell declaimed firmly into the mouthpiece of her
Transcriber:</p>
<p>“The Future of Seldon’s Plan, by A. Darell” and then thought darkly
that some day when she was a great writer, she would write all her
masterpieces under the pseudonym of Arkady. Just Arkady. No last name at
all.</p>
<p>“A. Darell” would be just the sort of thing that she would have to
put on all her themes for her class in Composition and Rhetoric—so
tasteless. All the other kids had to do it, too, except for Olynthus
Dam, because the class laughed so when he did it the first time. And
“Arcadia” was a little girl’s name, wished on her because her
great-grandmother had been called that; her parents just had no
imagination at all.</p>
<p>Now that she was two days past fourteen, you’d think they’d recognize
the simple fact of adulthood and call her Arkady. Her lips tightened as
she thought of her father looking up from his book-viewer just long
enough to say, “But if you’re going to pretend you’re nineteen, Arcadia,
what will you do when you’re twenty-five and all the boys think you’re
thirty?”</p>
<p>From where she sprawled across the arms and into the hollow of her
own special armchair, she could see the mirror on her dresser. Her foot
was a little in the way because her house slipper kept twirling about
her big toe, so she pulled it in and sat up with an unnatural
straightness to her neck that she felt sure, somehow, lengthened it a
full two inches into slim regality.</p>
<p>For a moment, she considered her face thoughtfully—too fat. She
opened her jaws half an inch behind closed lips, and caught the
resultant trace of unnatural gauntness at every angle. She licked her
lips with a quick touch of tongue and let them pout a bit in moist
softness. Then she let her eyelids droop in a weary, worldly way— Oh,
golly if only her cheeks weren’t that silly pink.</p>
<p>She tried putting her fingers to the outer corners of her eyes and
tilting the lids a bit to get that mysterious exotic languor of the
women of the inner star systems, but her hands were in the way and she
couldn’t see her face very well.</p>
<p>Then she lifted her chin, caught herself at a half-profile, and with
her eyes a little strained from looking out the corner and her neck
muscles faintly aching, she said, in a voice one octave below its
natural pitch, “Really, father, if you think it makes a particle of
difference to me what some silly old boys think, you just—”</p>
<p>And then she remembered that she still had the transmitter open in
her hand and said, drearily, “Oh, golly,” and shut it off.</p>
<p>The faintly violet paper with the peach margin line on the left had
upon it the following:</p>
<p>THE FUTURE OF SELDON’S PLAN</p>
<p>“Really, father, if you think it makes a particle of difference to me
what some silly old boys think, you just</p>
<p>“Oh, golly.”</p>
<p>She pulled the sheet out of the machine with annoyance and another
clicked neatly into place.</p>
<p>But her face smoothed out of its vexation, nevertheless, and her
wide, little mouth stretched into a self-satisfied smile. She sniffed at
the paper delicately. Just right. Just that proper touch of elegance and
charm. And the penmanship was just the last word.</p>
<p>The machine had been delivered two days ago on her first adult
birthday. She had said, “But father, everybody—just everybody in the
class who has the slightest pretensions to being anybody has one. Nobody
but some old drips would use key machines—”</p>
<p>The salesman had said, “There is no other model as compact on the one
hand and as adaptable on the other. It will spell and punctuate
correctly according to the sense of the sentence. Naturally, it is a
great aid to education since it encourages the user to employ careful
enunciation and breathing in order to make sure of the correct spelling,
to say nothing of demanding a proper and elegant delivery for correct
punctuation.”</p>
<p>Even then her father had tried to get one geared for typeprint as if
she were some dried-up, old-maid teacher.</p>
<p>But when it was delivered, it was the model she wanted—obtained
perhaps with a little more wail and sniffle than quite went with the
adulthood of fourteen—and copy was turned out in a charming and entirely
feminine handwriting, with the most beautifully graceful capitals anyone
ever saw.</p>
<p>Even the phrase, “Oh, golly,” somehow breathed glamour when the
Transcriber was done with it.</p>
<p>But just the same she had to get it right, so she sat up straight in
her chair, placed her first draft before her in businesslike fashion,
and began again, crisply and clearly; her abdomen flat, her chest
lifted, and her breathing carefully controlled. She intoned, with
dramatic fervor:</p>
<p>“The Future of Seldon’s Plan.</p>
<p>“The Foundation’s past history is, I am sure, well-known to all of us
who have had the good fortune to be educated in our planet’s efficient
and well-staffed school system.</p>
<p>(There! That would start things off right with Miss Erlking, that
mean old hag.)</p>
<p>That past</p>
<p>history is largely the past history of the great Plan of Hari Seldon.
The two are one. But the question in the mind of most people today is
whether this Plan will continue in all its great wisdom, or whether it
will be foully destroyed, or, perhaps, has been so destroyed
already.</p>
<p>“To understand this, it may be best to pass quickly over some of the
highlights of the Plan as it has been revealed to humanity thus far.</p>
<p>(This part was easy because she had taken Modern History the semester
before.)</p>
<p>“In the days, nearly four centuries ago, when the First Galactic
Empire was decaying into the paralysis that preceded final death, one
man—the great Hari Seldon—foresaw the approaching end. Through the
science of psychohistory, the intrissacies of whose mathematics has long
since been forgotten,</p>
<p>(She paused in a trifle of doubt. She was sure that “intricacies” was
pronounced with soft c’s but the spelling didn’t look right. Oh, well,
the machine couldn’t very well be wrong—)</p>
<p>he and the men</p>
<p>who worked with him are able to foretell the course of the great
social and economic currents sweeping the Galaxy at the time. It was
possible for them to realize that, left to itself, the Empire would
break up, and that thereafter there would be at least thirty thousand
years of anarchic chaos prior to the establishment of a new Empire.</p>
<p>“It was too late to prevent the great Fall, but it was still
possible, at least, to cut short the intermediate period of chaos. The
Plan was, therefore, evolved whereby only a single millennium would
separate the Second Empire from the First. We are completing the fourth
century of that millennium, and many generations of men have lived and
died while the Plan has continued its inexorable workings.</p>
<p>“Hari Seldon established two Foundations at the opposite ends of the
Galaxy, in a manner and under such circumstances as would yield the best
mathematical solution for his psychohistorical problem. In one of these,
our Foundation, established here on Terminus, there was concentrated the
physical science of the Empire, and through the possession of that
science, the Foundation was able to withstand the attacks of the
barbarous kingdoms which had broken away and become independent, out at
the fringe of the Empire.</p>
<p>“The Foundation, indeed, was able to conquer in its turn these
short-lived kingdoms by means of the leadership of a series of wise and
heroic men like Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow who were able to
interpret the Plan intelligently and to guide our land through its</p>
<p>(She had written “intricacies” here also, but decided not to risk it
a second time.)</p>
<p>complica—</p>
<p>tions. All our planets still revere their memories although centuries
have passed.</p>
<p>“Eventually, the Foundation established a commercial system which
controlled a large portion of the Siwennian and Anacreonian sectors of
the Galaxy, and even defeated the remnants of the old Empire under its
last great general, Bel Riose. It seemed that nothing could now stop the
workings of Seldon’s Plan. Every crisis that Seldon had planned had come
at its appropriate time and had been solved, and with each solution the
Foundation had taken another giant stride toward Second Empire and
peace.</p>
<p>“And then,</p>
<p>(Her breath came short at this point, and she hissed the words
between her teeth, but the Transcriber simply wrote them, calmly and
gracefully.)</p>
<p>with the last remnants of the dead First Empire gone and with only
ineffectual warlords ruling over the splinters and remnants of the
decayed colossus,</p>
<p>(She got that phrase out of a thriller on the video last week, but
old Miss Erlking never listened to anything but symphonies and lectures,
so she’d never know.)</p>
<p>there came the Mule.</p>
<p>“This strange man was not allowed for in the Plan. He was a mutant,
whose birth could not have been predicted. He had the strange and
mysterious power of controlling and manipulating human emotions and in
this manner could bend all men to his will. With breathtaking swiftness,
he became a conqueror and Empire-builder, until, finally, he even
defeated the Foundation itself.</p>
<p>“Yet he never obtained universal dominion, since in his first
overpowering lunge he was stopped by the wisdom and daring of a great
woman</p>
<p>(Now there was that old problem again. Father would insist that she
never bring up the fact that she was the grandchild of Bayta Darell.
Everyone knew it and Bayta was just about the greatest woman there ever
was and she had stopped the Mule single-handed.)</p>
<p>in a manner the true story</p>
<p>of which is known in its entirety to very few.</p>
<p>(There! If she had to read it to the class, that last could be said
in a dark voice, and someone would be sure to ask what the true story
was, and then—well, and then she couldn’t help tell the truth if they
asked her, could she? In her mind, she was already wordlessly whizzing
through a hurt and eloquent explanation to a stern and questioning
paternal parent.)</p>
<p>“After five years of restricted rule, another change took place, the
reasons for which are not known, and the Mule abandoned all plans for
further conquest. His last five years were those of an enlightened
despot.</p>
<p>“It is said by some that the change in the Mule was brought about by
the intervention of the Second Foundation. However, no man has ever
discovered the exact location of this other Foundation, nor knows its
exact function, so that theory remains unproven.</p>
<p>“A whole generation has passed since the death of the Mule. What of
the future, then, now that he has come and gone? He interrupted Seldon’s
Plan and seemed to have burst it to fragments, yet as soon as he died,
the Foundation rose again, like a nova from the dead ashes of a dying
star.</p>
<p>(She had made that up herself.)</p>
<p>Once again, the planet</p>
<p>Terminus houses the center of a commercial federation almost as great
and as rich as before the conquest, and even more peaceful and
democratic.</p>
<p>“Is this planned? Is Seldon’s great dream still alive, and will a
Second Galactic Empire yet be formed six hundred years from now? I,
myself, believe so, because</p>
<p>(This was the important part. Miss Erlking always had those large,
ugly red-pencil scrawls that went: “But this is only descriptive. What
are your personal reactions? Think! Express yourself! Penetrate your own
soul!” Penetrate your own soul. A lot she knew about souls, with her
lemon face that never smiled in its life—)</p>
<p>never at any time has the political situation been so favorable. The
old Empire is completely dead and the period of the Mule’s rule put an
end to the era of warlords that preceded him. Most of the surrounding
portions of the Galaxy are civilized and peaceful.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the internal health of the Foundation is better than ever
before. The despotic times of the pre-Conquest hereditary mayors have
given way to the democratic elections of early times. There are no
longer dissident worlds of independent Traders; no longer the injustices
and dislocations that accompanied accumulations of great wealth in the
hands of a few.</p>
<p>“There is no reason, therefore, to fear failure, unless it is true
that the Second Foundation itself presents a danger. Those who think so
have no evidence to back their claim, but merely vague fears and
superstitions. I think that our confidence in ourselves, in our nation,
and in Hari Seldon’s great Plan should drive from our hearts and minds
all uncertainties and</p>
<p>(Hm-m-m. This was awfully corny, but something like this was expected
at the end.)</p>
<p>so I say—”</p>
<p>That is as far as “The Future of Seldon’s Plan” got, at that moment,
because there was the gentlest little tap on the window, and when
Arcadia shot up to balance on one arm of the chair, she found herself
confronted by a smiling face beyond the glass, its even symmetry of
feature interestingly accentuated by the short, vertical line of a
finger before its lips.</p>
<p>With the slight pause necessary to assume an attitude of
bepuzzlement, Arcadia dismounted from the armchair, walked to the couch
that fronted the wide window that held the apparition, and, kneeling
upon it, stared out thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The smile upon the man’s face faded quickly. While the fingers of one
hand tightened whitely upon the sill, the other made a quick gesture.
Arcadia obeyed calmly, and touched the contact that moved the lower
third of the window smoothly into its socket in the wall, allowing the
warm spring air to interfere with the conditioning within.</p>
<p>“You can’t get in,” she said, with comfortable smugness. “The windows
are all screened, and keyed only to people who belong here. If you come
in, all sorts of alarms will break loose.” A pause, then she added, “You
look sort of silly balancing on that ledge underneath the window. If
you’re not careful, you’ll fall and break your neck and a lot of
valuable flowers.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said the man at the window, who had been thinking
that very thing—with a slightly different arrangement of
adjectives—“will you shut off the screen and let me in?”</p>
<p>“No use in doing that,” said Arcadia. “You’re probably thinking of a
different house, because I’m not the kind of girl who lets strange men
into their … her bedroom this time of night.” Her eyes, as she said it,
took on a heavy-lidded sultriness—or an unreasonable facsimile
thereof.</p>
<p>All traces of humor whatever had disappeared from the young
stranger’s face. He muttered, “This is Dr. Darell’s house, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>“Why should I tell you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Galaxy— Good-by—”</p>
<p>“If you jump off, young man, I will personally give the alarm.” (This
was intended as a refined and sophisticated thrust of irony, since to
Arcadia’s enlightened eyes, the intruder was an obviously mature thirty,
at least—quite elderly, in fact.)</p>
<p>Quite a pause. Then, tightly, he said, “Well, now, look here, girlie,
if you don’t want me to stay, and don’t want me to go, what do you want
me to do?”</p>
<p>“You can come in, I suppose. Dr. Darell does live here. I’ll shut off
the screen now.”</p>
<p>Warily, after a searching look, the young man poked his hand through
the window, then hunched himself up and through it. He brushed at his
knees with an angry, slapping gesture, and lifted a reddened face at
her.</p>
<p>“You’re quite sure that your character and reputation won’t suffer
when they find me here, are you?”</p>
<p>“Not as much as yours would, because just as soon as I hear footsteps
outside, I’ll just shout and yell and say you forced your way in
here.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” he replied with heavy courtesy. “And how do you intend to
explain the shut-off protective screen?”</p>
<p>“Poof! That would be easy. There wasn’t any there in the first
place.”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes were wide with chagrin. “That was a bluff? How old are
you, kid?”</p>
<p>“I consider that a very impertinent question, young man. And I am not
accustomed to being addressed as ‘kid.’”</p>
<p>“I don’t wonder. You’re probably the Mule’s grandmother in disguise.
Do you mind if I leave now before you arrange a lynching party with
myself as star performer?”</p>
<p>“You had better not leave—because my father’s expecting you.”</p>
<p>The man’s look became a wary one, again. An eyebrow shot up as he
said, lightly, “Oh? Anyone with your father?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Anyone called on him lately?”</p>
<p>“Only tradespeople—and you.”</p>
<p>“Anything unusual happen at all?”</p>
<p>“Only you.”</p>
<p>“Forget me, will you? No, don’t forget me. Tell me, how did you know
your father was expecting me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that was easy. Last week, he received a Personal Capsule, keyed
to him personally, with a self-oxidizing message, you know. He threw the
capsule shell into the Trash Disinto, and yesterday, he gave Poli—that’s
our maid, you see—a month’s vacation so she could visit her sister in
Terminus City, and this afternoon, he made up the bed in the spare room.
So I knew he expected somebody that I wasn’t supposed to know anything
about. Usually, he tells me everything.”</p>
<p>“Really! I’m surprised he has to. I should think you’d know
everything before he tells you.”</p>
<p>“I usually do.” Then she laughed. She was beginning to feel very much
at ease. The visitor was elderly, but very distinguished-looking with
curly brown hair and very blue eyes. Maybe she could meet somebody like
that again, sometimes, when she was old herself.</p>
<p>“And just how,” he asked, “did you know it was I he expected.”</p>
<p>“Well, who else could it be? He was expecting somebody in so secrety
a way, if you know what I mean—and then you come gumping around trying
to sneak through windows, instead of walking through the front door, the
way you would if you had any sense.” She remembered a favorite line, and
used it promptly. “Men are so stupid!”</p>
<p>“Pretty stuck on yourself, aren’t you, kid? I mean, Miss. You could
be wrong, you know. What if I told you that all this is a mystery to me
and that as far as I know, your father is expecting someone else, not
me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t think so. I didn’t ask you to come in until after I saw
you drop your briefcase.”</p>
<p>“My what?”</p>
<p>“Your briefcase, young man. I’m not blind. You didn’t drop it by
accident, because you looked down first, so as to make sure it would
land right. Then you must have realized it would land just under the
hedges and wouldn’t be seen, so you dropped it and didn’t look down
afterwards. Now since you came to the window instead of the front door,
it must mean that you were a little afraid to trust yourself in the
house before investigating the place. And after you had a little trouble
with me, you took care of your briefcase before taking care of yourself,
which means that you consider whatever your briefcase has in it to be
more valuable than your own safety, and that means that as long as
you’re in here and the briefcase is out there and we know that it’s out
there, you’re probably pretty helpless.”</p>
<p>She paused for a much-needed breath, and the man said, grittily,
“Except that I think I’ll choke you just about medium dead and get out
of here, with the briefcase.”</p>
<p>“Except, young man, that I happen to have a baseball bat under my
bed, which I can reach in two seconds from where I’m sitting, and I’m
very strong for a girl.”</p>
<p>Impasse. Finally, with a strained courtesy, the “young man” said,
“Shall I introduce myself, since we’re being so chummy. I’m Pelleas
Anthor. And your name?”</p>
<p>“I’m Arca— Arkady Darell. Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>“And now Arkady, would you be a good little girl and call your
father?”</p>
<p>Arcadia bridled. “I’m not a little girl. I think you’re very
rude—especially when you’re asking a favor.”</p>
<p>Pelleas Anthor sighed. “Very well. Would you be a good, kind, dear,
little old lady, and call your father?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant either, but I’ll call him. Only not so I’ll
take my eyes off you, young man.” And she stamped on the floor.</p>
<p>There came the sound of hurrying footsteps in the hall, and the door
was flung open.</p>
<p>“Arcadia—” There was a tiny explosion of exhaled air, and Dr. Darell
said, “Who are you, sir?”</p>
<p>Pelleas sprang to his feet in what was quite obviously relief.
“Dr. Toran Darell? I am Pelleas Anthor. You’ve received word about me, I
think. At least, your daughter says you have.”</p>
<p>“My daughter says I have?” He bent a frowning glance at her which
caromed harmlessly off the wide-eyed and impenetrable web of innocence
with which she met the accusation.</p>
<p>Dr. Darell said, finally: “I have been expecting you. Would you mind
coming down with me, please?” And he stopped as his eye caught a flicker
of motion, which Arcadia caught simultaneously.</p>
<p>She scrambled toward her Transcriber, but it was quite useless, since
her father was standing right next to it. He said, sweetly, “You’ve left
it going all this time, Arcadia.”</p>
<p>“Father,” she squeaked, in real anguish, “it is very ungentlemanly to
read another person’s private correspondence, especially when it’s
talking correspondence.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said her father, “but ‘talking correspondence’ with a strange
man in your bedroom! As a father, Arcadia, I must protect you against
evil.”</p>
<p>“Oh, golly—it was nothing like that.”</p>
<p>Pelleas laughed suddenly, “Oh, but it was, Dr. Darell. The young lady
was going to accuse me of all sorts of things, and I must insist that
you read it, if only to clear my name.”</p>
<p>“Oh—” Arcadia held back her tears with an effort. Her own father
didn’t even trust her. And that darned Transcriber— If that silly fool
hadn’t come gooping at the window, and making her forget to turn it off.
And now her father would be making long, gentle speeches about what
young ladies aren’t supposed to do. There just wasn’t anything they were
supposed to do, it looked like, except choke and die, maybe.</p>
<p>“Arcadia,” said her father, gently, “it strikes me that a young
lady—”</p>
<p>She knew it. She knew it.</p>
<p>“—should not be quite so impertinent to men older than she is.”</p>
<p>“Well, what did he want to come peeping around my window for? A young
lady has a right to privacy—Now I’ll have to do my whole darned
composition over.”</p>
<p>“It’s not up to you to question his propriety in coming to your
window. You should simply not have let him in. You should have called me
instantly—especially if you thought I was expecting him.”</p>
<p>She said, peevishly, “It’s just as well if you didn’t see him—stupid
thing. He’ll give the whole thing away if he keeps on going to windows,
instead of doors.”</p>
<p>“Arcadia, nobody wants your opinion on matters you know nothing
of.”</p>
<p>“I do, too. It’s the Second Foundation, that’s what it is.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. Even Arcadia felt a little nervous stirring in
her abdomen.</p>
<p>Dr. Darell said, softly, “Where have you heard this?”</p>
<p>“Nowhere, but what else is there to be so secret about? And you don’t
have to worry that I’ll tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Anthor,” said Dr. Darell, “I must apologize for all this.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” came Anthor’s rather hollow response. “It’s
not your fault if she’s sold herself to the forces of darkness. But do
you mind if I ask her a question before we go? Miss Arcadia—”</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Why do you think it is stupid to go to windows instead of to
doors?”</p>
<p>“Because you advertise what you’re trying to hide, silly. If I have a
secret, I don’t put tape over my mouth and let everyone know I have a
secret. I talk just as much as usual, only about something else. Didn’t
you ever read any of the sayings of Salvor Hardin? He was our first
Mayor, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>
<p>“Well, he used to say that only a lie that wasn’t ashamed of itself
could possibly succeed. He also said that nothing had to be true, but
everything had to sound true. Well, when you come in through a window,
it’s a lie that’s ashamed of itself and it doesn’t sound true.”</p>
<p>“Then what would you have done?”</p>
<p>“If I had wanted to see my father on top secret business, I would
have made his acquaintance openly and seen him about all sorts of
strictly legitimate things. And then when everyone knew all about you
and connected you with my father as a matter of course, you could be as
top secret as you wanted and nobody would ever think of questioning
it.”</p>
<p>Anthor looked at the girl strangely, then at Dr. Darell. He said,
“Let’s go. I have a briefcase I want to pick up in the garden. Wait!
Just one last question. Arcadia, you don’t really have a baseball bat
under your bed, do you?”</p>
<p>“No! I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Hah. I didn’t think so.”</p>
<p>Dr. Darell stopped at the door. “Arcadia,” he said, “when you rewrite
your composition on the Seldon Plan, don’t be unnecessarily mysterious
about your grandmother. There is no necessity to mention that part at
all.”</p>
<p>He and Pelleas descended the stairs in silence. Then the visitor
asked in a strained voice, “Do you mind, sir? How old is she?”</p>
<p>“Fourteen, day before yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Fourteen? Great Galaxy— Tell me, has she ever said she expects to
marry someday?”</p>
<p>“No, she hasn’t. Not to me.”</p>
<p>“Well, if she ever does, shoot him. The one she’s going to marry, I
mean.” He stared earnestly into the older man’s eyes. “I’m serious. Life
could hold no greater horror than living with what she’ll be like when
she’s twenty. I don’t mean to offend you, of course.”</p>
<p>“You don’t offend me. I think I know what you mean.”</p>
<p>Upstairs, the object of their tender analyses faced the Transcriber
with revolted weariness and said, dully: “Thefutureofseldonsplan.” The
Transcriber, with infinite aplomb, translated that into elegantly
complicated script capitals as:</p>
<p>“The Future of Seldon’s Plan.”</p>
<p>MATHEMATICS The synthesis of the calculus of n-variables and of
n-dimensional geometry is the basis of what Seldon once called “my
little algebra of humanity”.…</p>
