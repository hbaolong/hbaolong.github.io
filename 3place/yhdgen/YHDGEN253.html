<h4 id="section">21</h4>
<p>In two days Joranum had swept Trantor, partly by himself, mostly
through his lieutenants. As Hari muttered to Dors, it was a campaign
that had all the marks of military efficiency. “He was born to be a war
admiral in the old days,” he said. “He’s wasted on politics.”</p>
<p>And Dors said, “Wasted? At this rate, he’s going to make himself
First Minister in a week and, if he wishes, Emperor in two weeks. There
are reports that some of the military garrisons are cheering him.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “It will collapse, Dors.”</p>
<p>“What? Joranum’s party or the Empire?”</p>
<p>“Joranum’s party. The story of the robot has created an instant stir,
especially with the effective use of that flier, but a little thought, a
little coolness, and the public will see it for the ridiculous
accusation it is.”</p>
<p>“But, Hari,” said Dors tightly, “you needn’t pretend with me. It is
not a ridiculous story. How could Joranum possibly have found out that
Demerzel is a robot?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that! Why, Raych told him so.”</p>
<p>“Raych!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. He did his job perfectly and got back safely with the
promise of being made Dahl’s sector leader someday. Of course he was
believed. I knew he would be.”</p>
<p>“You mean you told Raych that Demerzel was a robot and had him pass
on the news to Joranum?” Dors looked utterly horrified.</p>
<p>“No, I couldn’t do that. You know I couldn’t tell Raych—or
anyone—that Demerzel was a robot. I told Raych as firmly as I could that
Demerzel was not a robot—and even that much was difficult. But I did ask
him to tell Joranum that he was. He is under the firm impression that he
lied to Joranum.”</p>
<p>“But why, Hari? Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s not psychohistory, I’ll tell you that. Don’t you join the
Emperor in thinking I’m a magician. I just wanted Joranum to believe
that Demerzel was a robot. He’s a Mycogenian by birth, so he was filled
from youth with his culture’s tales of robots. Therefore, he was
predisposed to believe and he was convinced that the public would
believe with him.”</p>
<p>“Well, won’t they?”</p>
<p>“Not really. After the initial shock is over, they will realize that
it’s madcap fiction—or they will think so. I’ve persuaded Demerzel that
he must give a talk on subetheric holovision to be broadcast to key
portions of the Empire and to every sector on Trantor. He is to talk
about everything but the robot issue. There are enough crises, we all
know, to fill such a talk. People will listen and will hear nothing
about robots. Then, at the end, he will be asked about the flier and he
need not answer a word. He need only laugh.”</p>
<p>“Laugh? I’ve never known Demerzel to laugh. He almost never
smiles.”</p>
<p>“This time, Dors, he’ll laugh. It is the one thing that no one ever
visualizes a robot doing. You’ve seen robots in holographic fantasies,
haven’t you? They’re always pictured as literal-minded, unemotional,
inhuman— That’s what people are sure to expect. So Demerzel need merely
laugh. And on top of that— Do you remember Sunmaster Fourteen, the
religious leader of Mycogen?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Literal-minded, unemotional, inhuman. He’s never
laughed, either.”</p>
<p>“And he won’t this time. I’ve done a lot of work on this Joranum
matter since I had that little set-to at the Field. I know Joranum’s
real name. I know where he was born, who his parents were, where he had
his early training, and all of it, with documentary proof, has gone to
Sunmaster Fourteen. I don’t think Sunmaster likes Breakaways.”</p>
<p>“But I thought you said you don’t wish to spark off bigotry.”</p>
<p>“I don’t. If I had given the information to the holovision people, I
would have, but I’ve given it to Sunmaster, where, after all, it
belongs.”</p>
<p>“And he’ll start off the bigotry.”</p>
<p>“Of course he won’t. No one on Trantor would pay any attention to
Sunmaster—whatever he might say.”</p>
<p>“Then what’s the point?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what we’ll see, Dors. I don’t have a psychohistorical
analysis of the situation. I don’t even know if one is possible. I just
hope that my judgment is right.”</p>
