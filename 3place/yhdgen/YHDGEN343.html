<h4 id="section">34</h4>
<p>Hari Seldon entered his office to find that Wanda and Palver had
already arrived and were seated around the conference table at the far
end of the room. As was usual with those two, the room was completely
silent.</p>
<p>Then Seldon stopped short, noticing that a new fellow was sitting
with them. How strange—out of politeness, Wanda and Palver usually
reverted to standard speech when in the company of other people, yet
none of the three was speaking.</p>
<p>Seldon studied the stranger—an odd-looking man, about thirty-five
years old, with the myopic look of one caught up for too long in his
studies. If it weren’t for a certain determined set to the stranger’s
jaw, Seldon thought he might be dismissed as ineffectual, but that would
obviously be a mistake. There was both strength and kindness in the
man’s face. A trustworthy face, Seldon decided.</p>
<p>“Grandfather,” Wanda said, rising gracefully from her chair. Seldon’s
heart ached as he looked at his granddaughter. She’d changed so much in
the past few months, since the loss of her family. Whereas before she
had always called him Grandpa, now it was the more formal Grandfather.
In the past it seemed she could barely refrain from grins and giggles;
lately her serene gaze was lightened only occasionally by a beatific
smile. But—now as always—she was beautiful and that beauty was surpassed
only by her stunning intellect.</p>
<p>“Wanda, Palver,” Seldon said, kissing the former on the cheek and
slapping the latter on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hello,” Seldon said, turning to the stranger, who had also stood. “I
am Hari Seldon.”</p>
<p>“I am most honored to meet you, Professor,” the man replied. “I am
Bor Alurin.” Alurin offered a hand to Seldon in the archaic and, hence,
most formal mode of greeting.</p>
<p>“Bor is a psychologist, Hari,” said Palver, “and a great fan of your
work.”</p>
<p>“More important, Grandfather,” said Wanda, “Bor is one of us.”</p>
<p>“One of you?” Seldon looked searchingly from one to the other. “Do
you mean …?” Seldon’s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandfather. Yesterday Stettin and I were walking through Ery
Sector, getting out and around, as you’d suggested, probing for others.
All of a sudden—wham!—there it was.”</p>
<p>“We recognized the thought patterns immediately and began to look
around, trying to establish a link,” Palver said, taking up the story.
“We were in a commercial area, near the spaceport, so the walkways were
clogged with shoppers and tourists and Outworld traders. It seemed
hopeless, but then Wanda simply stopped and signaled Come here and out
of the crowd Bor appeared. He just walked up to us and signaled
Yes?”</p>
<p>“Amazing,” Seldon said, beaming at his granddaughter. “And Dr.—it is
Doctor, isn’t it?—Alurin, what do you make of all this?”</p>
<p>“Well,” began the psychologist thoughtfully, “I am pleased. I’ve
always felt different somehow and now I know why. And if I can be of any
help to you, why—” The psychologist looked down at his feet, as if all
of a sudden he realized he was being presumptuous. “What I mean is,
Wanda and Stettin said I may be able to contribute in some way to your
Psychohistory Project. Professor, nothing would please me more.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes. That’s quite true, Dr. Alurin. In fact, I think you may
make a great contribution to the Project—if you’ll join me. Of course,
you’ll have to give up whatever it is you do now, whether it is teaching
or private practice. Can you manage that?”</p>
<p>“Why, yes, Professor, of course. I may need a little help convincing
my wife—” At this he chuckled slightly, glancing shyly at each of his
three companions in turn. “But I seem to have a way with that.”</p>
<p>“So it’s set, then,” said Seldon briskly. “You will join the
Psychohistory Project. I promise you, Dr. Alurin, this is a decision you
will not regret.”</p>
<p>“Wanda, Stettin,” Seldon said later, after Bor Alurin had left. “This
is a most welcome breakthrough. How quickly do you think you can find
more mentalics?”</p>
<p>“Grandfather, it took us over a month to locate Bor—we cannot predict
with what frequency others will be found.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, all this ‘out and around’ takes us away from
our work on the Prime Radiant and it is distracting as well. Now that I
have Stettin to ‘talk’ to, verbal communication is somewhat too harsh,
too loud.”</p>
<p>Seldon’s smile faded. He had been afraid of this. As Wanda and Palver
had been honing their mentalic skills, so their tolerance for “ordinary”
life had diminished. It only made sense; their mentalic manipulations
set them apart.</p>
<p>“Wanda, Stettin, I think it may be time for me to tell you more about
the idea Yugo Amaryl had years ago and about the Plan I’ve devised as a
result of that idea. I haven’t been ready to elaborate upon it until
now, because until this moment, all the pieces have not been in
place.</p>
<p>“As you know, Yugo felt we must establish two Foundations—each as a
fail-safe measure for the other. It was a brilliant idea, one which I
wish Yugo could have lived long enough to see realized.” Here Seldon
paused, heaving a regretful sigh.</p>
<p>“But I digress. —Six years ago, when I was certain that Wanda had
mentalic, or mind-touching, capabilities, it came to me that not only
should there be two Foundations but that they should be distinct in
nature, as well. One would be made up of physical scientists—the
Encyclopedists will be their pioneer group on Terminus. The second would
be made up of true psychohistorians; mentalists—you. That is why I’ve
been so eager for you to find others like you.</p>
<p>“Finally, though, is this: The Second Foundation must be secret. Its
strength will lie in its seclusion, in its telepathic omnipresence and
omnipotence.</p>
<p>“You see, a few years ago, when it became apparent that I would
require the services of a bodyguard, I realized that the Second
Foundation must be the strong, silent, secret bodyguard of the primary
Foundation.</p>
<p>“Psychohistory is not infallible—its predictions are, however, highly
probable. The Foundation, especially in its infancy, will have many
enemies, as do I today.</p>
<p>“Wanda, you and Palver are the pioneers of the Second Foundation, the
guardians of the Terminus Foundation.”</p>
<p>“But how, Grandfather?” demanded Wanda. “We are just two—well, three,
if you count Bor. To guard the entire Foundation, we would need—”</p>
<p>“Hundreds? Thousands? Find however many it takes, Granddaughter. You
can do it. And you know how.</p>
<p>“Earlier, when relating the story of finding Dr. Alurin, Stettin said
you simply stopped and communicated out to the mentalic presence you
felt and he came to you. Don’t you see? All along I’ve been urging you
to go out and find others like you. But this is difficult, almost
painful for you. I realize now that you and Stettin must seclude
yourselves, in order to form the nucleus of the Second Foundation. From
there you will cast your nets into the ocean of humanity.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather, what are you saying?” Wanda asked in a whisper. She had
left her seat and was kneeling next to Seldon’s chair. “Do you want me
to leave?”</p>
<p>“No, Wanda,” Seldon replied, his voice choked with emotion. “I don’t
want you to leave, but it is the only way. You and Stettin must isolate
yourselves from the crude physicality of Trantor. As your mentalic
abilities grow stronger, you will attract others to you—the silent and
secret Foundation will grow.</p>
<p>“We will be in touch—occasionally, of course. And each of us has a
Prime Radiant. You see, don’t you, the truth—and the absolute
necessity—of what I am saying, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, Grandfather,” said Wanda. “More important, I feel the
brilliance of it as well. Rest assured; we won’t let you down.”</p>
<p>“I know you won’t, dear,” Seldon said wearily.</p>
<p>How could he do this—how could he send his darling granddaughter
away? She was his last link to his happiest days, to Dors, Yugo, and
Raych. She was the only other Seldon in the Galaxy.</p>
<p>“I shall miss you terribly, Wanda,” Seldon said as a tear worked its
way down his finely creased cheek.</p>
<p>“But, Grandfather,” Wanda said as she stood with Palver, preparing to
leave. “Where shall we go? Where is the Second Foundation?”</p>
<p>Seldon looked up and said, “The Prime Radiant has already told you,
Wanda.”</p>
<p>Wanda looked at Seldon blankly, searching her memory.</p>
<p>Seldon reached out and clutched at his granddaughter’s hand.</p>
<p>“Touch my mind, Wanda. It is there.”</p>
<p>Wanda’s eyes widened as she reached into Seldon’s mind.</p>
<p>“I see,” Wanda whispered to Seldon.</p>
