<p>“Gleb Andorin,” said Hari Seldon wearily, rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>“And who is he?” asked Dors Venabili, her mood as cold as it had been
every day since Raych had left.</p>
<p>“Until a few days ago I never heard of him,” said Seldon. “That’s the
trouble with trying to run a world of forty billion people. You never
hear of anyone, except for the few who obtrude themselves on your
notice. With all the computerized information in the world, Trantor
remains a planet of anonymities. We can drag up people with their
reference numbers and their statistics, but whom do we drag up? Add
twenty-five million Outer Worlds and the wonder is that the Galactic
Empire has remained a working phenomenon for all these millennia.
Frankly I think it has existed only because it very largely runs itself.
And now it is finally running down.”</p>
<p>“So much for philosophizing, Hari,” said Dors. “Who is this
Andorin?”</p>
<p>“Someone I admit I ought to have known about. I managed to cajole the
security establishment into calling up some files on him. He’s a member
of the Wyan Mayoralty family—the most prominent member, in fact—so the
security people have kept tabs on him. They think he has ambitions but
is too much of a playboy to do anything about them.”</p>
<p>“And is he involved with the Joranumites?”</p>
<p>Seldon made an uncertain gesture. “I’m under the impression that the
security establishment knows nothing about the Joranumites. That may
mean that the Joranumites no longer exist or that, if they do, they are
of no importance. It may also mean that the security establishment just
isn’t interested. Nor is there any way in which I can force it to be
interested. I’m only thankful the officers give me any information at
all. And I am the First Minister.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible that you’re not a very good First Minister?” said
Dors, dryly.</p>
<p>“That’s more than possible. It’s probably been generations since
there’s been an appointee less suited to the job than myself. But that
has nothing to do with the security establishment. It’s a totally
independent arm of the government. I doubt that Cleon himself knows much
about it, though, in theory, the security officers are supposed to
report to him through their director. Believe me, if we only knew more
about the security establishment, we’d be trying to stick its actions
into our psychohistorical equations, such as they are.”</p>
<p>“Are the security officers on our side, at least?”</p>
<p>“I believe so, but I can’t swear to it.”</p>
<p>“And why are you interested in this what’s-his-name?”</p>
<p>“Gleb Andorin. Because I received a roundabout message from
Raych.”</p>
<p>Dors’s eyes flashed. “Why didn’t you tell me? Is he all right?”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, but I hope he doesn’t try any further messages. If
he’s caught communicating, he won’t be all right. In any case, he has
made contact with Andorin.”</p>
<p>“And the Joranumites, too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. It would sound unlikely, for the connection is not
something that would make sense. The Joranumite movement is
predominantly lower-class—a proletarian movement, so to speak. And
Andorin is an aristocrat of aristocrats. What would he be doing with the
Joranumites?”</p>
<p>“If he’s of the Wyan Mayoralty family, he might aspire to the
Imperial throne, might he not?”</p>
<p>“They’ve been aspiring for generations. You remember Rashelle, I
trust. She was Andorin’s aunt.”</p>
<p>“Then he might be using the Joranumites as a stepping-stone, don’t
you think?”</p>
<p>“If they exist. And if they do—and if a stepping-stone is what
Andorin wants—I think he’d find himself playing a dangerous game. The
Joranumites—if they exist—would have their own plans and a man like
Andorin may find he’s simply riding a greti—”</p>
<p>“What’s a greti?”</p>
<p>“Some extinct animal of a ferocious type, I think. It’s just a
proverbial phrase back on Helicon. If you ride a greti, you find you
can’t get off, for then it will eat you.”</p>
<p>Seldon paused. “One more thing. Raych seems to be involved with a
woman who knows Andorin and through whom, he thinks, he may get
important information. I’m telling you this now so that you won’t accuse
me afterward of keeping anything from you.”</p>
<p>Dors frowned. “A woman?”</p>
<p>“One, I gather, who knows a great many men who will talk to her
unwisely, sometimes, under intimate circumstances.”</p>
<p>“One of those.” Her frown deepened. “I don’t like the thought of
Raych—”</p>
<p>“Come, come. Raych is thirty years old and undoubtedly has much
experience. You can leave this woman—or any woman, I think—safely to
Raych’s good sense.” He turned toward Dors with a look so worn, so
weary, and said, “Do you think I like this? Do you think I like any of
this?”</p>
<p>And Dors could find nothing to say.</p>
