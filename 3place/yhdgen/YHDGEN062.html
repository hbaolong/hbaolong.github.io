<h4 id="section">13</h4>
<p>LIEUTENANT AND CLOWN</p>
<p>If, from a distance of seven thousand parsecs, the fall of Kalgan to
the armies of the Mule had produced reverberations that had excited the
curiosity of an old Trader, the apprehension of a dogged captain, and
the annoyance of a meticulous mayor—to those on Kalgan itself, it
produced nothing and excited no one. It is the invariable lesson to
humanity that distance in time, and in space as well, lends focus. It is
not recorded, incidentally, that the lesson has ever been permanently
learned.</p>
<p>Kalgan was—Kalgan. It alone of all that quadrant of the Galaxy seemed
not to know that the Empire had fallen, that the Stannells no longer
ruled, that greatness had departed, and peace had disappeared.</p>
<p>Kalgan was the luxury world. With the edifice of mankind crumbling,
it maintained its integrity as a producer of pleasure, a buyer of gold
and a seller of leisure.</p>
<p>It escaped the harsher vicissitudes of history, for what conqueror
would destroy or even seriously damage a world so full of the ready cash
that would buy immunity?</p>
<p>Yet even Kalgan had finally become the headquarters of a warlord and
its softness had been tempered to the exigencies of war.</p>
<p>Its tamed jungles, its mildly modeled shores, and its garishly
glamorous cities echoed to the march of imported mercenaries and
impressed citizens. The worlds of its province had been armed and its
money invested in battleships rather than bribes for the first time in
its history. Its ruler proved beyond doubt that he was determined to
defend what was his and eager to seize what was others’.</p>
<p>He was a great one of the Galaxy, a war and peace maker, a builder of
Empire, an establisher of dynasty.</p>
<p>And an unknown with a ridiculous nickname had taken him—and his
arms—and his budding Empire—and had not even fought a battle.</p>
<p>So Kalgan was as before, and its uniformed citizens hurried back to
their older life, while the foreign professionals of war merged easily
into the newer bands that descended.</p>
<p>Again as always, there were the elaborate luxury hunts for the
cultivated animal life of the jungles that never took human life; and
the speedster bird-chases in the air above, that was fatal only to the
Great Birds.</p>
<p>In the cities, the escapers of the Galaxy could take their varieties
of pleasure to suit their purse, from the ethereal sky-palaces of
spectacle and fantasy that opened their doors to the masses at the
jingle of half a credit, to the unmarked, unnoted haunts to which only
those of great wealth were of the cognoscenti.</p>
<p>To the vast flood, Toran and Bayta added not even a trickle. They
registered their ship in the huge common hangar on the East Peninsula,
and gravitated to that compromise of the middle classes, the Inland
Sea—where the pleasures were yet legal, and even respectable, and the
crowds not yet beyond endurance.</p>
<p>Bayta wore dark glasses against the light, and a thin, white robe
against the heat. Warm-tinted arms, scarcely the goldener for the sun,
clasped her knees to her, and she stared with firm, abstracted gaze at
the length of her husband’s outstretched body—almost shimmering in the
brilliance of white sunsplendor.</p>
<p>“Don’t overdo it,” she had said at first, but Toran was of a dying
red star. Despite three years of the Foundation, sunlight was a luxury,
and for four days now his skin, treated beforehand for ray resistance,
had not felt the harshness of clothing, except for the brief shorts.</p>
<p>Bayta huddled close to him on the sand and they spoke in
whispers.</p>
<p>Toran’s voice was gloomy, as it drifted upwards from a relaxed face,
“No, I admit we’re nowhere. But where is he? Who is he? This mad world
says nothing of him. Perhaps he doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>“He exists,” replied Bayta, with lips that didn’t move. “He’s clever,
that’s all. And your uncle is right. He’s a man we could use—if there’s
time.”</p>
<p>A short pause. Toran whispered, “Know what I’ve been doing, Bay? I’m
just daydreaming myself into a sun-stupor. Things figure themselves out
so neatly—so sweetly.” His voice nearly trailed off, then returned,
“Remember the way Dr. Amann talked back at college, Bay. The Foundation
can never lose, but that does not mean the rulers of the Foundation
can’t. Didn’t the real history of the Foundation begin when Salvor
Hardin kicked out the Encyclopedists and took over the planet Terminus
as the first mayor? And then in the next century, didn’t Hober Mallow
gain power by methods almost as drastic? That’s twice the rulers were
defeated, so it can be done. So why not by us?”</p>
<p>“It’s the oldest argument in the books, Torie. What a waste of good
reverie.”</p>
<p>“Is it? Follow it out. What’s Haven? Isn’t it part of the Foundation?
If we become top dog, it’s still the Foundation winning, and only the
current rulers losing.”</p>
<p>“Lots of difference between ‘we can’ and ‘we will.’ You’re just
jabbering.”</p>
<p>Toran squirmed. “Nuts, Bay, you’re just in one of your sour, green
moods. What do you want to spoil my fun for? I’ll just go to sleep if
you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>But Bayta was craning her head, and suddenly—quite a non sequitur—she
giggled, and removed her glasses to look down the beach with only her
palm shading her eyes.</p>
<p>Toran looked up, then lifted and twisted his shoulders to follow her
glance.</p>
<p>Apparently, she was watching a spindly figure, feet in air, who
teetered on his hands for the amusement of a haphazard crowd. It was one
of the swarming acrobatic beggars of the shore, whose supple joints bent
and snapped for the sake of the thrown coins.</p>
<p>A beach guard was motioning him on his way and with a surprising
one-handed balance, the clown brought a thumb to his nose in an
upside-down gesture. The guard advanced threateningly and reeled
backward with a foot in his stomach. The clown righted himself without
interrupting the motion of the initial kick and was away, while the
frothing guard was held off by a thoroughly unsympathetic crowd.</p>
<p>The clown made his way raggedly down the beach. He brushed past many,
hesitated often, stopped nowhere. The original crowd had dispersed. The
guard had departed.</p>
<p>“He’s a queer fellow,” said Bayta, with amusement, and Toran agreed
indifferently. The clown was close enough now to be seen clearly. His
thin face drew together in front into a nose of generous planes and
fleshy tip that seemed all but prehensile. His long, lean limbs and
spidery body, accentuated by his costume, moved easily and with grace,
but with just a suggestion of having been thrown together at random.</p>
<p>To look was to smile.</p>
<p>The clown seemed suddenly aware of their regard, for he stopped after
he had passed, and, with a sharp turn, approached. His large brown eyes
fastened upon Bayta.</p>
<p>She found herself disconcerted.</p>
<p>The clown smiled, but it only saddened his beaked face, and when he
spoke it was with the soft, elaborate phrasing of the Central
Sectors.</p>
<p>“Were I to use the wits the good Spirits gave me,” he said, “then I
would say this lady cannot exist—for what sane man would hold a dream to
be reality. Yet rather would I not be sane and lend belief to charmed,
enchanted eyes.”</p>
<p>Bayta’s own eyes opened wide. She said, “Wow!”</p>
<p>Toran laughed, “Oh, you enchantress. Go ahead, Bay, that deserves a
five-credit piece. Let him have it.”</p>
<p>But the clown was forward with a jump. “No, my lady, mistake me not.
I spoke for money not at all, but for bright eyes and sweet face.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks,” then, to Toran, “Golly, you think the sun’s in his
eyes?”</p>
<p>“Yet not alone for eyes and face,” babbled the clown, as his words
hurled past each other in heightened frenzy, “but also for a mind, clear
and sturdy—and kind as well.”</p>
<p>Toran rose to his feet, reached for the white robe he had crooked his
arm about for four days, and slipped into it. “Now, bud,” he said,
“suppose you tell me what you want, and stop annoying the lady.”</p>
<p>The clown fell back a frightened step, his meager body cringing.
“Now, sure I meant no harm. I am a stranger here, and it’s been said I
am of addled wits; yet there is something in a face that I can read.
Behind this lady’s fairness, there is a heart that’s kind, and that
would help me in my trouble for all I speak so boldly.”</p>
<p>“Will five credits cure your trouble?” said Toran, dryly, and held
out the coin.</p>
<p>But the clown did not move to take it, and Bayta said, “Let me talk
to him, Torie.” She added swiftly, and in an undertone, “There’s no use
being annoyed at his silly way of talking. That’s just his dialect; and
our speech is probably as strange to him.”</p>
<p>She said, “What is your trouble? You’re not worried about the guard,
are you? He won’t bother you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not he. He’s but a windlet that blows the dust about my
ankles. There is another that I flee, and he is a storm that sweeps the
worlds aside and throws them plunging at each other. A week ago, I ran
away, have slept in city streets, and hid in city crowds. I’ve looked in
many faces for help in need. I find it here.” He repeated the last
phrase in softer, anxious tones, and his large eyes were troubled, “I
find it here.”</p>
<p>“Now,” said Bayta, reasonably, “I would like to help, but really,
friend, I’m no protection against a world-sweeping storm. To be truthful
about it, I could use—”</p>
<p>There was an uplifted, powerful voice that bore down upon them.</p>
<p>“Now, then, you mud-spawned rascal—”</p>
<p>It was the beach guard, with a fire-red face and snarling mouth, that
approached at a run. He pointed with his low-power stun pistol.</p>
<p>“Hold him, you two. Don’t let him get away.” His heavy hand fell upon
the clown’s thin shoulder, so that a whimper was squeezed out of
him.</p>
<p>Toran said, “What’s he done?”</p>
<p>“What’s he done? What’s he done? Well, now, that’s good!” The guard
reached inside the dangling pocket attached to his belt, and removed a
purple handkerchief, with which he mopped his bare neck. He said with
relish, “I’ll tell you what he’s done. He’s run away. The word’s all
over Kalgan and I would have recognized him before this if he had been
on his feet instead of on his hawkface top.” And he rattled his prey in
a fierce good humor.</p>
<p>Bayta said with a smile, “Now where did he escape from, sir?”</p>
<p>The guard raised his voice. A crowd was gathering, pop-eyed and
jabbering, and with the increase of audience, the guard’s sense of
importance increased in direct ratio.</p>
<p>“Where did he escape from?” he declaimed in high sarcasm. “Why, I
suppose you’ve heard of the Mule, now.”</p>
<p>All jabbering stopped, and Bayta felt a sudden iciness trickle down
into her stomach. The clown had eyes only for her—he still quivered in
the guard’s brawny grasp.</p>
<p>“And who,” continued the guard heavily, “would this infernal ragged
piece be, but his lordship’s own court fool who’s run away.” He jarred
his captive with a massive shake, “Do you admit it, fool?”</p>
<p>There was only white fear for answer, and the soundless sibilance of
Bayta’s voice close to Toran’s ear.</p>
<p>Toran stepped forward to the guard in friendly fashion, “Now, my man,
suppose you take your hand away for just a while. This entertainer you
hold has been dancing for us and has not yet danced out his fee.”</p>
<p>“Here!” The guard’s voice rose in sudden concern. “There’s a
reward—”</p>
<p>“You’ll have it, if you can prove he’s the man you want. Suppose you
withdraw till then. You know that you’re interfering with a guest, which
could be serious for you.”</p>
<p>“But you’re interfering with his lordship and that will be serious
for you.” He shook the clown once again. “Return the man’s fee,
carrion.”</p>
<p>Toran’s hand moved quickly and the guard’s stun pistol was wrenched
away with half a finger nearly following it. The guard howled his pain
and rage. Toran shoved him violently aside, and the clown, unhanded,
scuttled behind him.</p>
<p>The crowd, whose fringes were now lost to the eye, paid little
attention to the latest development. There was among them a craning of
necks, and a centrifugal motion as if many had decided to increase their
distance from the center of activity.</p>
<p>Then there was a bustle, and a rough order in the distance. A
corridor formed itself and two men strode through, electric whips in
careless readiness. Upon each purple blouse was designed an angular
shaft of lightning with a splitting planet underneath.</p>
<p>A dark giant, in lieutenant’s uniform, followed them; dark of skin,
and hair, and scowl.</p>
<p>The dark man spoke with the dangerous softness that meant he had
little need of shouting to enforce his whims. He said, “Are you the man
who notified us?”</p>
<p>The guard was still holding his wrenched hand, and with a
pain-distorted face mumbled, “I claim the reward, your mightiness, and I
accuse that man—”</p>
<p>“You’ll get your reward,” said the lieutenant, without looking at
him. He motioned curtly to his men, “Take him.”</p>
<p>Toran felt the clown tearing at his robe with a maddened grip.</p>
<p>He raised his voice and kept it from shaking, “I’m sorry, lieutenant;
this man is mine.”</p>
<p>The soldiers took the statement without blinking. One raised his whip
casually, but the lieutenant’s snapped order brought it down.</p>
<p>His dark mightiness swung forward and planted his square body before
Toran, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>And the answer rang out, “A citizen of the Foundation.”</p>
<p>It worked—with the crowd, at any rate. The pent-up silence broke into
an intense hum. The Mule’s name might excite fear, but it was, after
all, a new name and scarcely stuck as deeply in the vitals as the old
one of the Foundation—that had destroyed the Empire—and the fear of
which ruled a quadrant of the Galaxy with ruthless despotism.</p>
<p>The lieutenant kept face. He said, “Are you aware of the identity of
the man behind you?”</p>
<p>“I have been told he’s a runaway from the court of your leader, but
my only sure knowledge is that he is a friend of mine. You’ll need firm
proof of his identity to take him.”</p>
<p>There were high-pitched sighs from the crowd, but the lieutenant let
it pass. “Have you your papers of Foundation citizenship with you?”</p>
<p>“At my ship.”</p>
<p>“You realize that your actions are illegal? I can have you shot.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly. But then you would have shot a Foundation citizen and
it is quite likely that your body would be sent to the
Foundation—quartered—as part compensation. It’s been done by other
warlords.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant wet his lips. The statement was true.</p>
<p>He said, “Your name?”</p>
<p>Toran followed up his advantage, “I will answer further questions at
my ship. You can get the cell number at the Hangar; it is registered
under the name ‘Bayta.’ ”</p>
<p>“You won’t give up the runaway?”</p>
<p>“To the Mule, perhaps. Send your master!”</p>
<p>The conversation had degenerated to a whisper and the lieutenant
turned sharply away.</p>
<p>“Disperse the crowd!” he said to his men, with suppressed
ferocity.</p>
<p>The electric whips rose and fell. There were shrieks and a vast surge
of separation and flight.</p>
<p>Toran interrupted his reverie only once on their way back to the
Hangar. He said, almost to himself, “Galaxy, Bay, what a time I had! I
was so scared—”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, with a voice that still shook, and eyes that still
showed something akin to worship, “it was quite out of character.”</p>
<p>“Well, I still don’t know what happened. I just got up there with a
stun pistol that I wasn’t even sure I knew how to use, and talked back
to him. I don’t know why I did it.”</p>
<p>He looked across the aisle of the short-run air vessel that was
carrying them out of the beach area, to the seat on which the Mule’s
clown scrunched up in sleep, and added distastefully, “It was the
hardest thing I’ve ever done.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant stood respectfully before the colonel of the garrison,
and the colonel looked at him and said, “Well done. Your part’s over
now.”</p>
<p>But the lieutenant did not retire immediately. He said darkly, “The
Mule has lost face before a mob, sir. It will be necessary to undertake
disciplinary action to restore proper atmosphere of respect.”</p>
<p>“Those measures have already been taken.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant half turned, then, almost with resentment, “I’m
willing to agree, sir, that orders are orders, but standing before that
man with his stun pistol and swallowing his insolence whole, was the
hardest thing I’ve ever done.”</p>
