<h4 id="section">26</h4>
<p>In the small conference room in the main building, Tamwile Elar
listened to Dors Venabili with a gathering look of confusion and anger
on his face. Finally he burst out, “Impossible!”</p>
<p>He rubbed his chin, then went on cautiously, “I don’t mean to offend
you, Dr. Venabili, but your suggestions are ridic—cannot be right.
There’s no way in which anyone can think that there are, in this
Psychohistory Project, any feelings so deadly as to justify your
suspicions. I would certainly know if there were and I assure you there
are not. Don’t think it.”</p>
<p>“I do think it,” said Dors stubbornly, “and I can find evidence for
it.”</p>
<p>Elar said, “I don’t know how to say this without offense,
Dr. Venabili, but if a person is ingenious enough and intent enough on
proving something, he or she can find all the evidence he or she
wants—or, at least, something he or she believes is evidence.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m paranoid?”</p>
<p>“I think that in your concern for the Maestro—something in which I’m
with you all the way—you’re, shall we say, overheated.”</p>
<p>Dors paused and considered Elar’s statement. “At least you’re right
that a person with sufficient ingenuity can find evidence anywhere. I
can build a case against you, for instance.”</p>
<p>Elar’s eyes widened as he stared at her in total astonishment.
“Against me? I would like to hear what case you can possibly have
against me.”</p>
<p>“Very well. You shall. The birthday party was your idea, wasn’t
it?”</p>
<p>Elar said, “I thought of it, yes, but I’m sure others did, too. With
the Maestro moaning about his advancing years, it seemed a natural way
of cheering him up.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure others may have thought of it, but it was you who actually
pressed the issue and got my daughter-in-law fired up about it. She took
over the details and you persuaded her that it was possible to put
together a really large celebration. Isn’t that so?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I had any influence on her, but even if I did,
what’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“In itself, nothing, but in setting up so large and widespread and
prolonged a celebration, were we not advertising to the rather unstable
and suspicious men of the junta that Hari was too popular and might be a
danger to them?”</p>
<p>“No one could possibly believe such a thing was in my mind.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “I am merely pointing out the possibility. —In planning
the birthday celebration, you insisted that the central offices be
cleared out—”</p>
<p>“Temporarily. For obvious reasons.”</p>
<p>“—and insisted that they remain totally unoccupied for a while. No
work was done—except by Yugo Amaryl—during that time.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it would hurt if the Maestro had some rest in advance
of the party. Surely you can’t complain about that.”</p>
<p>“But it meant that you could consult with other people in the empty
offices and do so in total privacy. The offices are, of course, well
shielded.”</p>
<p>“I did consult there—with your daughter-in-law, with caterers,
suppliers, and other tradesmen. It was absolutely necessary, wouldn’t
you say?”</p>
<p>“And if one of those you consulted with was a member of the
junta?”</p>
<p>Elar looked as though Dors had hit him. “I resent that, Dr. Venabili.
What do you take me for?”</p>
<p>Dors did not answer directly. She said, “You went on to talk to
Dr. Seldon about his forthcoming meeting with the General and urged
him—rather pressingly—to let you take his place and run the risks that
might follow. The result was, of course, that Dr. Seldon insisted rather
vehemently on seeing the General himself, which one can argue was
precisely what you wanted him to do.”</p>
<p>Elar emitted a short nervous laugh. “With all due respect, this does
sound like paranoia, Doctor.”</p>
<p>Dors pressed on. “And then, after the party, it was you, wasn’t it,
who was the first to suggest that a group of us go to the Dome’s Edge
Hotel?”</p>
<p>“Yes and I remember you saying it was a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Might it not have been suggested in order to make the junta uneasy,
as yet another example of Hari’s popularity? And might it not have been
arranged to tempt me into invading the Palace grounds?”</p>
<p>“Could I have stopped you?” said Elar, his incredulity giving way to
anger. “You had made up your own mind about that.”</p>
<p>Dors paid no attention. “And, of course, you hoped that by entering
the Palace grounds I might make sufficient trouble to turn the junta
even further against Hari.”</p>
<p>“But why, Dr. Venabili? Why would I be doing this?”</p>
<p>“One might say it was to get rid of Dr. Seldon and to succeed him as
director of the Project.”</p>
<p>“How can you possibly think this of me? I can’t believe you are
serious. You’re just doing what you said you would at the start of this
exercise—just showing me what can be done by an ingenious mind intent on
finding so-called evidence.”</p>
<p>“Let’s turn to something else. I said that you were in a position to
use the empty rooms for private conversations and that you may have been
there with a member of the junta.”</p>
<p>“That is not even worth a denial.”</p>
<p>“But you were overheard. A little girl wandered into the room, curled
up in a chair out of sight, and overheard your conversation.”</p>
<p>Elar frowned. “What did she hear?”</p>
<p>“She reported that two men were talking about death. She was only a
child and could not repeat anything in detail, but two words did impress
her and they were ‘lemonade death.’”</p>
<p>“Now you seem to be changing from fantasy to—if you’ll excuse
me—madness. What can ‘lemonade death’ mean and what would it have to do
with me?”</p>
<p>“My first thought was to take it literally. The girl in question is
very fond of lemonade and there was a good deal of it at the party, but
no one had poisoned it.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for granting sanity that much.”</p>
<p>“Then I realized the girl had heard something else, which her
imperfect command of the language and her love of the beverage had
perverted into ‘lemonade.’”</p>
<p>“And have you invented a distortion?” Elar snorted.</p>
<p>“It did seem to me for a while that what she might have heard was
‘laymen-aided death.’”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“An assassination carried through by laymen—by
nonmathematicians.”</p>
<p>Dors stopped and frowned. Her hand clutched her chest.</p>
<p>Elar said with sudden concern, “Is something wrong,
Dr. Venabili?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Dors, seeming to shake herself.</p>
<p>For a few moments she said nothing further and Elar cleared his
throat. There was no sign of amusement on his face any longer, as he
said, “Your comments, Dr. Venabili, are growing steadily more ridiculous
and—well, I don’t care if I do offend you, but I have grown tired of
them. Shall we put an end to this?”</p>
<p>“We are almost at an end, Dr. Elar. Layman-aided may indeed be
ridiculous, as you say. I had decided that in my own mind, too. —You
are, in part, responsible for the development of the Electro-Clarifier,
aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Elar seemed to stand straighter as he said with a touch of pride,
“Entirely responsible.”</p>
<p>“Surely not entirely. I understand it was designed by Cinda
Monay.”</p>
<p>“A designer. She followed my instructions.”</p>
<p>“A layman. The Electro-Clarifier is a layman-aided device.”</p>
<p>With suppressed violence Elar said, “I don’t think I want to hear
that phrase again. Once more, shall we put an end to this?”</p>
<p>Dors forged on, as if she hadn’t heard his request. “Though you give
her no credit now, you gave Cinda credit to her face—to keep her working
eagerly, I suppose. She said you gave her credit and she was very
grateful because of it. She said you even called the device by her name
and yours, though that’s not the official name.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. It’s the Electro-Clarifier.”</p>
<p>“And she said she was designing improvements, intensifiers, and so
on—and that you had the prototype of an advanced version of the new
device for testing.”</p>
<p>“What has all this to do with anything?”</p>
<p>“Since Dr. Seldon and Dr. Amaryl have been working with the
Electro-Clarifier, both have in some ways deteriorated. Yugo, who works
with it more, has also suffered more.”</p>
<p>“The Electro-Clarifier can, in no way, do that kind of damage.”</p>
<p>Dors put her hand to her forehead and momentarily winced. She said,
“And now you have a more intense Electro-Clarifier that might do more
damage, that might kill quickly, rather than slowly.”</p>
<p>“Absolute nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Now consider the name of the device, a name which, according to the
woman who designed it, you are the only one to use. I presume you called
it the Elar-Monay Clarifier.”</p>
<p>“I don’t ever recall using that phrase,” said Elar uneasily.</p>
<p>“Surely you did. And the new intensified Elar-Monay Clarifier could
be used to kill with no blame to be attached to anyone—just a sad
accident through a new and untried device. It would be the ‘Elar-Monay
death’ and a little girl heard it as ‘lemonade death.’”</p>
<p>Dors’s hand groped at her side.</p>
<p>Elar said softly, “You are not well, Dr. Venabili.”</p>
<p>“I am perfectly well. Am I not correct?”</p>
<p>“Look, it doesn’t matter what you can twist into lemonade. Who knows
what the little girl may have heard? It all boils down to the deadliness
of the Electro-Clarifier. Bring me into court or before a scientific
investigating board and let experts—as many as you like—check the effect
of the Electro-Clarifier, even the new intensified one, on human beings.
They will find it has no measurable effect.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that,” muttered Venabili. Her hands were now at her
forehead and her eyes were closed. She swayed slightly.</p>
<p>Elar said, “It is clear that you are not well, Dr. Venabili. Perhaps
that means it is my turn to talk. May I?”</p>
<p>Dors’s eyes opened and she simply stared.</p>
<p>“I’ll take your silence for consent, Doctor. Of what use would it be
for me to try to to get rid of Dr. Seldon and Dr. Amaryl in order to
take my place as director? You would prevent any attempt I made at
assassination, as you now think you are doing. In the unlikely case that
I succeeded in such a project and was rid of the two great men, you
would tear me to pieces afterward. You’re a very unusual woman—strong
and fast beyond belief—and while you are alive, the Maestro is
safe.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Dors, glowering.</p>
<p>“I told this to the men of the junta. —Why should they not consult me
on matters involving the Project? They are very interested in
psychohistory, as well they ought to be. It was difficult for them to
believe what I told them about you—until you made your foray into the
Palace grounds. That convinced them, you can be sure, and they agreed
with my plan.”</p>
<p>“Aha. Now we come to it,” Dors said weakly.</p>
<p>“I told you the Electro-Clarifier cannot harm human beings. It
cannot. Amaryl and your precious Hari are just getting old, though you
refuse to accept it. So what? They are fine—perfectly human. The
electromagnetic field has no effect of any importance on organic
materials. Of course, it may have adverse effects on sensitive
electromagnetic machinery and, if we could imagine a human being built
of metal and electronics, it might have an effect on it. Legends tell us
of such artificial human beings. The Mycogenians have based their
religion on them and they call such beings “robots.” If there were such
a thing as a robot, one would imagine it would be stronger and faster by
far than an ordinary human being, that it would have properties, in
fact, resembling those you have, Dr. Venabili. And such a robot could,
indeed, be stopped, hurt, even destroyed by an intense
Electro-Clarifier, such as the one that I have here, one that has been
operating at low energy since we began our conversation. That is why you
are feeling ill, Dr. Venabili—and for the first time in your existence,
I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Dors said nothing, merely stared at the man. Slowly she sank into a
chair.</p>
<p>Elar smiled and went on, “Of course, with you taken care of, there
will be no problem with the Maestro and with Amaryl. The Maestro, in
fact, without you, may fade out at once and resign in grief, while
Amaryl is merely a child in his mind. In all likelihood, neither will
have to be killed. How does it feel, Dr. Venabili, to be unmasked after
all these years? I must admit, you were very good at concealing your
true nature. It’s almost surprising that no one else discovered the
truth before now. But then, I am a brilliant mathematician—an observer,
a thinker, a deducer. Even I would not have figured it out were it not
for your fanatical devotion to the Maestro and the occasional bursts of
superhuman power you seemed to summon at will—when he was
threatened.</p>
<p>“Say good-bye, Dr. Venabili. All I have to do now is to turn the
device to full power and you will be history.”</p>
<p>Dors seemed to collect herself and rose slowly from her seat,
mumbling, “I may be better shielded than you think.” Then, with a grunt,
she threw herself at Elar.</p>
<p>Elar, his eyes widening, shrieked and reeled back.</p>
<p>Then Dors was on him, her hand flashing. Its side struck Elar’s neck,
smashing the vertebrae and shattering the nerve cord. He fell dead on
the floor.</p>
<p>Dors straightened with an effort and staggered toward the door. She
had to find Hari. He had to know what had happened.</p>
