<p>“Mr. Bindris,” said Hari Seldon, reaching out his hand to shake the
other’s. “I am so glad to be able to see you. It was good of you to
agree to see me.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Terep Bindris jovially. “I know you well. Or, rather,
I know of you well.”</p>
<p>“That’s pleasant. I take it you’ve heard of psychohistory, then.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, what intelligent person hasn’t? Not that I understand
anything about it, of course. And who is this young lady you have with
you?”</p>
<p>“My granddaughter, Wanda.”</p>
<p>“A very pretty young woman.” He beamed. “Somehow I feel I’d be putty
in her hands.”</p>
<p>Wanda said, “I think you exaggerate, sir.”</p>
<p>“No, really. Now, please, sit down and tell me what it is I can do
for you.” He gestured expansively with his arm, indicating that they be
seated on two overstuffed, richly brocaded chairs in front of the desk
at which he sat. The chairs, like the ornate desk, the imposing carved
doors which had slid back noiselessly at their arrival signal, and the
gleaming obsidian floor of Bindris’s vast office, were of the finest
quality. And, although his surroundings were impressive—and
imposing—Bindris himself was not. The slight cordial man would not be
taken, at first glance, for one of Trantor’s leading financial
powerbrokers.</p>
<p>“We’re here, sir, at the Emperor’s suggestion.”</p>
<p>“The Emperor?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he could not help us, but he thought a man like you might be
able to do so. The question, of course, is credits.”</p>
<p>Bindris’s face fell. “Credits?” he said. “I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon, “for nearly forty years, psychohistory has been
supported by the government. However, times change and the Empire is no
longer what it was.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know that.”</p>
<p>“The Emperor lacks the credits to support us or, even if he did have
the credits, he couldn’t get the request for funding past the
Legislature. He recommends, therefore, that I see businesspeople who, in
the first place, still have credits and, in the second place, can simply
write out a credit voucher.”</p>
<p>There was a longish pause and Bindris finally said, “The Emperor, I’m
afraid, knows nothing about business. —How many credits do you
want?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Bindris, we’re talking about an enormous task. I’m going to need
several million.”</p>
<p>“Several million!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Bindris frowned. “Are we talking about a loan here? When do you
expect to be able to pay it back?”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Bindris, I can’t honestly say I ever expect to be able to
pay it back. I’m looking for a gift.”</p>
<p>“Even if I wanted to give you the credits—and let me tell you, for
some strange reason I very much want to do so—I couldn’t. The Emperor
may have his Legislature, but I have my Board members. I can’t make a
gift of that sort without the Board’s permission and they’ll never grant
it.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Your firm is enormously wealthy. A few million would mean
nothing to you.”</p>
<p>“That sounds good,” said Bindris, “but I’m afraid that the firm is in
a state of decline right now. Not sufficiently to bring us into serious
trouble, but enough to make us unhappy. If the Empire is in a state of
decay, different individual parts of it are decaying, too. We are in no
position to hand out a few million. —I’m truly sorry.”</p>
<p>Seldon sat there silently and Bindris seemed unhappy. He shook his
head at last and said, “Look, Professor Seldon, I would really like to
help you out, particularly for the sake of the young lady you have with
you. It just can’t be done. —However, we’re not the only firm in
Trantor. Try others, Professor. You may have better luck elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Seldon, raising himself to his feet with an effort, “we
shall try.”</p>
