<h4 id="section">12</h4>
<p>For days thereafter Hari Seldon neglected his departmental duties to
use his computer in its news-gathering mode.</p>
<p>There were not many computers capable of handling the daily news from
twenty-five million worlds. There were a number of them at Imperial
headquarters, where they were absolutely necessary. Some of the larger
Outer World capitals had them as well, though most were satisfied with
hyperconnection to the Central Newspost on Trantor.</p>
<p>A computer at an important Mathematics Department could, if it were
sufficiently advanced, be modified as an independent news source and
Seldon had been careful to do that with his computer. It was, after all,
necessary for his work on psychohistory, though the computer’s
capabilities were carefully ascribed to other, exceedingly plausible
reasons.</p>
<p>Ideally the computer would report anything that was out of the
ordinary on any world of the Empire. A coded and unobtrusive warning
light would make itself evident and Seldon could track it down easily.
Such a light rarely showed, for the definition of “out of the ordinary”
was tight and intense and dealt with large-scale and rare upheavals.</p>
<p>What one did in its absence was to ring in various worlds at
random—not all twenty-five million, of course, but some dozens. It was a
depressing and even debilitating task, for there were no worlds that
didn’t have their daily relatively minor catastrophes. A volcanic
eruption here, a flood there, an economic collapse of one sort or
another yonder, and, of course, riots. There had not been a day in the
last thousand years that there had not been riots over something or
other on each of a hundred or more different worlds.</p>
<p>Naturally such things had to be discounted. One could scarcely worry
about riots any more than one could about volcanic eruptions when both
were constants on inhabited worlds. Rather, if a day should come in
which not one riot was reported anywhere, that might be a sign of
something so unusual as to warrant the gravest concern.</p>
<p>Concern was what Seldon could not make himself feel. The Outer
Worlds, with all their disorders and misfortunes, were like a great
ocean on a peaceful day, with a gentle swell and minor heavings—but no
more. He found no evidence of any overall situation that clearly showed
a decline in the last eight years or even in the last eighty. Yet
Demerzel (in Demerzel’s absence, Seldon could no longer think of him as
Daneel) said the decline was continuing and he had his finger on the
Empire’s pulse from day to day in ways that Seldon could not
duplicate—until such time as he would have the guiding power of
psychohistory at his disposal.</p>
<p>It could be that the decline was so small that it was unnoticeable
till some crucial point was reached—like a domicile that slowly wears
out and deteriorates, showing no signs of that deterioration until one
night when the roof collapses.</p>
<p>When would the roof collapse? That was the problem and Seldon had no
answer.</p>
<p>And on occasion, Seldon would check on Trantor itself. There, the
news was always considerably more substantial. For one thing, Trantor
was the most highly populated of all the worlds, with its forty billion
people. For another, its eight hundred sectors formed a mini-Empire all
its own. For a third, there were the tedious rounds of governmental
functions and the doings of the Imperial family to follow.</p>
<p>What struck Seldon’s eyes, however, was in the Dahl Sector. The
elections for the Dahl Sector Council had placed five Joranumites into
office. This was the first time, according to the commentary, that
Joranumites had achieved sector office.</p>
<p>It was not surprising. Dahl was a Joranumite stronghold if any sector
was, but Seldon found it a disturbing indication of the progress being
made by the demagogue. He ordered a microchip of the item and took it
home with him that evening.</p>
<p>Raych looked up from his computer as Seldon entered and apparently
felt the need to explain himself. “I’m helping Mom on some reference
material she needs,” he said.</p>
<p>“What about your own work?”</p>
<p>“Done, Dad. All done.”</p>
<p>“Good. —Look at this.” He showed Raych the chip in his hand before
slipping it into the microprojector.</p>
<p>Raych glanced at the news item hanging in the air before his eyes and
said, “Yes, I know.”</p>
<p>“You do?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I usually keep track of Dahl. You know, home sector and
all.”</p>
<p>“And what do you think about it?”</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised. Are you? The rest of Trantor treats Dahl like
dirt. Why shouldn’t they go for Joranum’s views?”</p>
<p>“Do you go for them also?”</p>
<p>“Well—” Raych twisted his face thoughtfully. “I got to admit some
things he says appeal to me. He says he wants equality for all people.
What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all—if he means it. If he’s sincere. If he isn’t just
using it as a ploy to get votes.”</p>
<p>“True enough, Dad, but most Dahlites probably figure: What’s there to
lose? We don’t have equality now, though the laws say we do.”</p>
<p>“It’s a hard thing to legislate.”</p>
<p>“That’s not something to cool you off when you’re sweating to
death.”</p>
<p>Seldon was thinking rapidly. He had been thinking since he had come
across this item. He said, “Raych, you haven’t been in Dahl since your
mother and I took you out of the sector, have you?”</p>
<p>“Sure I was, when I went with you to Dahl five years ago on your
visit there.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes”—Seldon waved a hand in dismissal—“but that doesn’t count.
We stayed at an intersector hotel, which was not Dahlite in the least,
and, as I recall, Dors never once let you out on the streets alone.
After all, you were only fifteen. How would you like to visit Dahl now,
alone, in charge of yourself—now that you’re full twenty?”</p>
<p>Raych chuckled. “Mom would never allow that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t say that I enjoy the prospect of facing her with it, but I
don’t intend to ask her permission. The question is: Would you be
willing to do this for me?”</p>
<p>“Out of curiosity? Sure. I’d like to see what’s happened to the old
place.”</p>
<p>“Can you spare the time from your studies?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll never miss a week or so. Besides, you can tape the
lectures and I’ll catch up when I get back. I can get permission. After
all, my old man’s on the faculty—unless you’ve been fired, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Not yet. But I’m not thinking of this as a fun vacation.”</p>
<p>“I’d be surprised if you did. I don’t think you know what a fun
vacation is, Dad. I’m surprised you know the phrase.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be impertinent. When you go there, I want you to meet with
Laskin Joranum.”</p>
<p>Raych looked startled. “How do I do that? I don’t know where he’s
gonna be.”</p>
<p>“He’s going to be in Dahl. He’s been asked to speak to the Dahl
Sector Council with its new Joranumite members. We’ll find out the exact
day and you can go a few days earlier.”</p>
<p>“And how do I get to see him, Dad? I don’t figure he keeps open
house.”</p>
<p>“I don’t, either, but I’ll leave that up to you. You would have known
how to do it when you were twelve. I hope you keen edge hasn’t blunted
too badly in the intervening years.”</p>
<p>Raych smiled. “I hope not. But suppose I do see him. What then?”</p>
<p>“Well, find out what you can. What’s he’s really planning. What he’s
really thinking.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think he’s gonna tell me?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he does. You have the trick of inspiring
confidence, you miserable youngster. Let’s talk about it.”</p>
<p>And so they did. Several times.</p>
<p>Seldon’s thoughts were painful. He was not sure where all this was
leading to, but he dared not consult Yugo Amaryl or Demerzel or (most of
all) Dors. They might stop him. They might prove to him that his idea
was a poor one and he didn’t want that proof. What he planned seemed the
only gateway to salvation and he didn’t want it blocked.</p>
<p>But did the gateway exist at all? Raych was the only one, it seemed
to Seldon, who could possibly manage to worm himself into Joranum’s
confidence, but was Raych the proper tool for the purpose? He was a
Dahlite and sympathetic to Joranum. How far could Seldon trust him?</p>
<p>Horrible! Raych was his son—and Seldon had never had occasion to
mistrust Raych before.</p>
