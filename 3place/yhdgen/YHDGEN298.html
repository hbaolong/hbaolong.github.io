<h4 id="section">16</h4>
<p>General Tennar stared at Hari Seldon in a rather pop-eyed manner and
his fingers tapped lightly at the desk where he sat.</p>
<p>“Thirty years,” he said. “Thirty years and you are telling me you
still have nothing to show for it?”</p>
<p>“Actually, General, twenty-eight years.”</p>
<p>Tennar ignored that. “And all at government expense. Do you know how
many billions of credits have been invested in your Project,
Professor?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t kept up, General, but we have records that could give me
the answer to your question in seconds.”</p>
<p>“And so have we. The government, Professor, is not an endless source
of funds. These are not the old times. We don’t have Cleon’s old
free-and-easy attitude toward finances. Raising taxes is hard and we
need credits for many things. I have called you here, hoping that you
can benefit us in some way with your psychohistory. If you cannot, then
I must tell you, quite frankly, that we will have to shut off the
faucet. If you can continue your research without government funding, do
so, for unless you show me something that would make the expense worth
it, you will have to do just that.”</p>
<p>“General, you make a demand I cannot meet, but, if in response, you
end government support, you will be throwing away the future. Give me
time and eventually—”</p>
<p>“Various governments have heard that ‘eventually’ from you for
decades. Isn’t it true, Professor, that you say your psychohistory
predicts that the junta is unstable, that my rule is unstable, that in a
short time it will collapse?”</p>
<p>Seldon frowned. “The technique is not yet firm enough for me to say
that this is something that psychohistory states.”</p>
<p>“I put it to you that psychohistory does state it and that this is
common knowledge within your Project.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Seldon warmly. “No such thing. It is possible that some
among us have interpreted some relationships to indicate that the junta
may be an unstable form of government, but there are other relationships
that may easily be interpreted to show it is stable. That is the reason
why we must continue our work. At the present moment it is all too easy
to use incomplete data and imperfect reasoning to reach any conclusion
we wish.”</p>
<p>“But if you decide to present the conclusion that the government is
unstable and say that psychohistory warrants it—even if it does not
actually do so—will it not add to the instability?”</p>
<p>“It may very well do that, General. And if we announced that the
government is stable, it may well add to the stability. I have had this
very same discussion with Emperor Cleon on a number of occasions. It is
possible to use psychohistory as a tool to manipulate the emotions of
the people and achieve short-term effects. In the long run, however, the
predictions are quite likely to prove incomplete or downright erroneous
and psychohistory will lose all its credibility and it will be as though
it had never existed.”</p>
<p>“Enough! Tell me straight out! What do you think psychohistory shows
about my government?”</p>
<p>“It shows, we think, that there are elements of instability in it,
but we are not certain—and cannot be certain—exactly in what way this
can be made worse or made better.”</p>
<p>“In other words, psychohistory simply tells you what you would know
without psychohistory and it is that in which the government has
invested uncounted piles of credits.”</p>
<p>“The time will come when psychohistory will tell us what we could not
know without it and then the investment will pay itself back many, many
times over.”</p>
<p>“And how long will it be before that time comes?”</p>
<p>“Not too long, I hope. We have been making rather gratifying progress
in the last few years.”</p>
<p>Tennar was tapping his fingernail on his desk again. “Not enough.
Tell me something helpful now. Something useful.”</p>
<p>Seldon pondered, then said, “I can prepare a detailed report for you,
but it will take time.”</p>
<p>“Of course it will. Days, months, years—and somehow it will never be
written. Do you take me for a fool?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not, General. However, I don’t want to be taken for a
fool, either. I can tell you something that I will take sole
responsibility for. I have seen it in my psychohistorical research, but
I may have misinterpreted what I saw. However, since you insist—”</p>
<p>“I insist.”</p>
<p>“You mentioned taxes a little while ago. You said raising taxes was
difficult. Certainly. It is always difficult. Every government must do
its work by collecting wealth in one form or another. The only two ways
in which such credits can be obtained are, first, by robbing a neighbor,
or second, persuading a government’s own citizens to grant the credits
willingly and peaceably.</p>
<p>“Since we have established a Galactic Empire that has been conducting
its business in reasonable fashion for thousands of years, there is no
possibility of robbing a neighbor, except as the result of an occasional
rebellion and its repression. This does not happen often enough to
support a government—and, if it did, the government would be too
unstable to last long, in any case.”</p>
<p>Seldon drew a deep breath and went on. “Therefore, credits must be
raised by asking the citizens to hand over part of their wealth for
government use. Presumably, since the government will then work
efficiently, the citizens can better spend their credits in this way
than to hoard it—each man to himself—while living in a dangerous and
chaotic anarchy.</p>
<p>“However, though the request is reasonable and the citizenry is
better off paying taxes as their price for maintaining a stable and
efficient government, they are nevertheless reluctant to do so. In order
to overcome this reluctance, governments must make it appear that they
are not taking too many credits, and that they are considering each
citizen’s rights and benefits. In other words, they must lower the
percentage taken out of low incomes; they must allow deductions of
various kinds to be made before the tax is assessed, and so on.</p>
<p>“As time goes on, the tax situation inevitably grows more and more
complex as different worlds, different sectors within each world, and
different economic divisions all demand and require special treatment.
The result is that the tax-collecting branch of the government grows in
size and complexity and tends to become uncontrollable. The average
citizen cannot understand why or how much he is being taxed; what he can
get away with and what he can’t. The government and the tax agency
itself are often in the dark as well.</p>
<p>“What’s more, an ever-larger fraction of the funds collected must be
put into running the overelaborate tax agency—maintaining records,
pursuing tax delinquents—so the amount of credits available for good and
useful purposes declines despite anything we can do.</p>
<p>“In the end, the tax situation becomes overwhelming. It inspires
discontent and rebellion. The history books tend to ascribe these things
to greedy businessmen, to corrupt politicians, to brutal warriors, to
ambitious viceroys—but these are just the individuals who take advantage
of the tax overgrowth.”</p>
<p>The General said harshly, “Are you telling me that our tax system is
overcomplicated?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “If it were not, it would be the only one in history
that wasn’t, as far as I know. If there is one thing that psychohistory
tells me is inevitable, it is tax overgrowth.”</p>
<p>“And what do we do about it?”</p>
<p>“That I cannot tell you. It is that for which I would like to prepare
a report that—as you say—may take a while to get ready.”</p>
<p>“Never mind the report. The tax system is overcomplicated, isn’t it?
Isn’t that what you are saying?”</p>
<p>“It is possible that it is,” said Seldon cautiously.</p>
<p>“And to correct that, one must make the tax system simpler—as simple
as possible, in fact.”</p>
<p>“I would have to study—”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. The opposite of great complication is great simplicity. I
don’t need a report to tell me that.”</p>
<p>“As you say, General,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>At this point the General looked up suddenly, as though he had been
called—as, indeed, he had been. His fists clenched and holovision images
of Colonel Linn and Dors Venabili suddenly appeared in the room.</p>
<p>Thunderstruck, Seldon exclaimed, “Dors! What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>The General said nothing, but his brow furrowed into a frown.</p>
