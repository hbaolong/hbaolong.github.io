<p>APPROACHING CRISIS</p>
<p>A week had passed on the Second Foundation, and the First Speaker was
smiling once again upon the Student.</p>
<p>“You must have brought me interesting results, or you would not be so
filled with anger.”</p>
<p>The Student put his hand upon the sheaf of calculating paper he had
brought with him and said, “Are you sure that the problem is a factual
one?”</p>
<p>“The premises are true. I have distorted nothing.”</p>
<p>“Then I must accept the results, and I do not want to.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. But what have your wants to do with it? Well, tell me
what disturbs you so. No, no, put your derivations to one side. I will
subject them to analysis afterward. Meanwhile, talk to me. Let me judge
your understanding.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, Speaker— It becomes very apparent that a gross overall
change in the basic psychology of the First Foundation has taken place.
As long as they knew of the existence of a Seldon Plan, without knowing
any of the details thereof, they were confident but uncertain. They knew
they would succeed, but they didn’t know when or how. There was,
therefore, a continuous atmosphere of tension and strain—which was what
Seldon desired. The First Foundation, in other words, could be counted
upon to work at maximum potential.”</p>
<p>“A doubtful metaphor,” said the First Speaker, “but I understand
you.”</p>
<p>“But now, Speaker, they know of the existence of a Second Foundation
in what amounts to detail, rather merely than as an ancient and vague
statement of Seldon’s. They have an inkling as to its function as the
guardian of the Plan. They know that an agency exists which watches
their every step and will not let them fall. So they abandon their
purposeful stride and allow themselves to be carried upon a litter.
Another metaphor, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, go on.”</p>
<p>“And that very abandonment of effort; that growing inertia; that
lapse into softness and into a decadent and hedonistic culture, means
the ruin of the Plan. They must be self-propelled.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?”</p>
<p>“No, there is more. The majority reaction is as described. But a
great probability exists for a minority reaction. Knowledge of our
guardianship and our control will rouse among a few not complacence, but
hostility. This follows from Korillov’s Theorem—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. I know the theorem.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Speaker. It is difficult to avoid mathematics. In any
case, the effect is that not only is the Foundation’s effort diluted,
but part of it is turned against us, actively against us.”</p>
<p>“And is that all?”</p>
<p>“There remains one other factor of which the probability is
moderately low—”</p>
<p>“Very good. What is that?”</p>
<p>“While the energies of the First Foundation were directed only to
Empire; while their only enemies were huge and outmoded hulks that
remained from the shambles of the past, they were obviously concerned
only with the physical sciences. With us forming a new, large part of
their environment, a change in view may well be imposed on them. They
may try to become psychologists—”</p>
<p>“That change,” said the First Speaker, coolly, “has already taken
place.”</p>
<p>The Student’s lips compressed themselves into a pale line. “Then all
is over. It is the basic incompatibility with the Plan. Speaker, would I
have known of this if I had lived—outside?”</p>
<p>The First Speaker spoke seriously, “You feel humiliated, my young
man, because, thinking you understood so much so well, you suddenly find
that many very apparent things were unknown to you. Thinking you were
one of the Lords of the Galaxy; you suddenly find that you stand near to
destruction. Naturally, you will resent the ivory tower in which you
lived; the seclusion in which you were educated; the theories on which
you were reared.</p>
<p>“I once had that feeling. It is normal. Yet it was necessary that in
your formative years you have no direct contact with the Galaxy; that
you remain here, where all knowledge is filtered to you, and your mind
carefully sharpened. We could have shown you this … this part-failure of
the Plan earlier and spared you the shock now, but you would not have
understood the significance properly, as you now will. Then you find no
solution at all to the problem?”</p>
<p>The Student shook his head and said hopelessly, “None!”</p>
<p>“Well, it is not surprising. Listen to me, young man. A course of
action exists and has been followed for over a decade. It is not a usual
course, but one that we have been forced into against our will. It
involves low probabilities, dangerous assumptions—We have even been
forced to deal with individual reactions at times, because that was the
only possible way, and you know that Psychostatistics by its very nature
has no meaning when applied to less than planetary numbers.”</p>
<p>“Are we succeeding?” gasped the Student.</p>
<p>“There’s no way of telling yet. We have kept the situation stable so
far—but for the first time in the history of the Plan, it is possible
for the unexpected actions of a single ordinary individual to destroy
it. We have adjusted a minimum number of outsiders to a needful state of
mind; we have our agents—but their paths are planned. They dare not
improvise. That should be obvious to you. And I will not conceal the
worst—if we are discovered, here, on this world, it will not only be the
Plan that is destroyed, but ourselves, our physical selves. So you see,
our solution is not very good.”</p>
<p>“But the little you have described does not sound like a solution at
all, but like a desperate guess.”</p>
<p>“No. Let us say, an intelligent guess.”</p>
<p>“When is the crisis, Speaker? When will we know whether we have
succeeded or not?”</p>
<p>“Well within the year, no doubt.”</p>
<p>The Student considered that, then nodded his head. He shook hands
with the Speaker. “Well, it’s good to know.”</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and left.</p>
<p>The First Speaker looked out silently as the window gained
transparency. Past the giant structures to the quiet, crowding
stars.</p>
<p>A year would pass quickly. Would any of them, any of Seldon’s
heritage, be alive at its end?</p>
