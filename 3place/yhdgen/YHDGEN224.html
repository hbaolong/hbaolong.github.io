<h4 id="section">86</h4>
<p>It was Raych who was the first to react to the statement. Quite
forgetting the cloak of civility that sat upon him so uncomfortably, he
laughed raucously and said, “Hey, lady, ya can’t be Mayor. Mayors is
guys.”</p>
<p>Rashelle looked at him good-naturedly and said in a perfect imitation
of his tone of voice, “Hey, kid, some Mayors is guys and some Mayors is
dames. Put that under your lid and let it bubble.”</p>
<p>Raych’s eyes protruded and he seemed stunned. Finally he managed to
say, “Hey, ya talk regular, lady.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing. Regular as ya want,” said Rashelle, still smiling.</p>
<p>Seldon cleared his throat and said, “That’s quite an accent you have,
Rashelle.”</p>
<p>Rashelle tossed her head slightly. “I haven’t had occasion to use it
in many years, but one never forgets. I once had a friend, a good
friend, who was a Dahlite—when I was very young.” She sighed. “He didn’t
speak that way, of course—he was quite intelligent—but he could do so if
he wished and he taught me. It was exciting to talk so with him. It
created a world that excluded our surroundings. It was wonderful. It was
also impossible. My father made that plain. And now along comes this
young rascal, Raych, to remind me of those long-ago days. He has the
accent, the eyes, the impudent cast of countenance, and in six years or
so he will be a delight and terror to the young women. Won’t you,
Raych?”</p>
<p>Raych said, “I dunno, lady—uh, mum.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you will and you will come to look very much like my … old
friend and it will be much more comfortable for me not to see you then.
And now, dinner’s over and it’s time for you to go to your room, Raych.
You can watch holovision for a while if you wish. I don’t suppose you
read.”</p>
<p>Raych reddened. “I’m gonna read someday. Master Seldon says I’m
gonna.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m sure you will.”</p>
<p>A young woman approached Raych, curtsying respectfully in Rashelle’s
direction. Seldon had not seen the signal that had summoned her.</p>
<p>Raych said, “Can’t I stay with Master Seldon and Missus
Venabili?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see them later,” said Rashelle gently, “but Master and Missus
and I have to talk right now—so you must go.”</p>
<p>Dors mouthed a firm “Go!” at Raych and with a grimace the boy slid
out of his chair and followed the attendant.</p>
<p>Rashelle turned to Seldon and Dors once Raych was gone and said, “The
boy will be safe, of course, and treated well. Please have no fears
about that. And I will be safe too. As my woman approached just now, so
will a dozen armed men—and much more rapidly—when summoned. I want you
to understand that.”</p>
<p>Seldon said evenly, “We are in no way thinking of attacking you,
Rashelle—or must I now say, ‘Madam Mayor’?”</p>
<p>“Still Rashelle. I am given to understand that you are a wrestler of
sorts, Hari, and you, Dors, are very skillful with the knives we have
removed from your room. I don’t want you to rely uselessly on your
skills, since I want Hari alive, unharmed, and friendly.”</p>
<p>“It is quite well understood, Madam Mayor,” said Dors, her lack of
friendship uncompromised, “that the ruler of Wye, now and for the past
forty years, is Mannix, Fourth of that Name, and that he is still alive
and in full possession of his faculties. Who, then, are you really?”</p>
<p>“Exactly who I say I am, Dors. Mannix IV is my father. He is, as you
say, still alive and in possession of his faculties. In the eyes of the
Emperor and of all the Empire, he is Mayor of Wye, but he is weary of
the strains of power and is willing, at last, to let them slip into my
hands, which are just as willing to receive them. I am his only child
and I was brought up all my life to rule. My father is therefore Mayor
in law and name, but I am Mayor in fact. It is to me, now, that the
armed forces of Wye have sworn allegiance and in Wye that is all that
counts.”</p>
<p>Seldon nodded. “Let it be as you say. But even so, whether it is
Mayor Mannix IV or Mayor Rashelle I—it is the First, I suppose—there is
no purpose in your holding me. I have told you that I don’t have a
workable psychohistory and I do not think that either I or anyone else
will ever have one. I have told that to the Emperor. I am of no use
either to you or to him.”</p>
<p>Rashelle said, “How naïve you are. Do you know the history of the
Empire?”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head. “I have recently come to wish that I knew it
much better.”</p>
<p>Dors said dryly, “I know Imperial history quite well, though the
pre-Imperial age is my specialty, Madam Mayor. But what does it matter
whether we do or do not?”</p>
<p>“If you know your history, you know that the House of Wye is ancient
and honorable and is descended from the Dacian dynasty.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “The Dacians ruled five thousand years ago. The number of
their descendants in the hundred and fifty generations that have lived
and died since then may number half the population of the Galaxy—if all
genealogical claims, however outrageous, are accepted.”</p>
<p>“Our genealogical claims, Dr. Venabili”—Rashelle’s tone of voice was,
for the first time, cold and unfriendly and her eyes flashed like
steel—“are not outrageous. They are fully documented. The House of Wye
has maintained itself consistently in positions of power through all
those generations and there have been occasions when we have held the
Imperial throne and have ruled as Emperors.”</p>
<p>“The history book-films,” said Dors, “usually refer to the Wye rulers
as ‘anti-Emperors,’ never recognized by the bulk of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“It depends on who writes the history book-films. In the future, we
will, for the throne which has been ours will be ours again.”</p>
<p>“To accomplish that, you must bring about civil war.”</p>
<p>“There won’t be much risk of that,” said Rashelle. She was smiling
again. “That is what I must explain to you because I want Dr. Seldon’s
help in preventing such a catastrophe. My father, Mannix IV, has been a
man of peace all his life. He has been loyal to whomever it might be
that ruled in the Imperial Palace and he has kept Wye a prosperous and
strong pillar of the Trantorian economy for the good of all the
Empire.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that the Emperor has ever trusted him any the more for
all that,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“I’m sure that is so,” said Rashelle calmly, “for the Emperors that
have occupied the Palace in my father’s time have known themselves to be
usurpers of a usurping line. Usurpers cannot afford to trust the true
rulers. And yet my father has kept the peace. He has, of course,
developed and trained a magnificent security force to maintain the
peace, prosperity, and stability of the sector and the Imperial
authorities have allowed this because they wanted Wye peaceful,
prosperous, stable—and loyal.”</p>
<p>“But is it loyal?” said Dors.</p>
<p>“To the true Emperor, of course,” said Rashelle, “and we have now
reached the stage where our strength is such that we can take over the
government quickly—in a lightning stroke, in fact—and before one can say
‘civil war’ there will be a true Emperor—or Empress, if you prefer—and
Trantor will be as peaceful as before.”</p>
<p>Dors shook her head. “May I enlighten you? As a historian?”</p>
<p>“I am always willing to listen.” And she inclined her head ever so
slightly toward Dors.</p>
<p>“Whatever size your security force may be, however well-trained and
well-equipped, they cannot possibly equal in size and strength the
Imperial forces backed by twenty-five million worlds.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but you have put your finger on the usurper’s weakness,
Dr. Venabili. There are twenty-five million worlds, with the Imperial
forces scattered over them. Those forces are thinned out over
incalculable space, under uncounted officers, none of them particularly
ready for any action outside their own Provinces, many ready for action
in their own interest rather than in the Empire’s. Our forces, on the
other hand, are all here, all on Trantor. We can act and conclude before
the distant generals and admirals can get it through their heads that
they are needed.”</p>
<p>“But that response will come—and with irresistible force.”</p>
<p>“Are you certain of that?” said Rashelle. “We will be in the Palace.
Trantor will be ours and at peace. Why should the Imperial forces stir
when, by minding their own business, each petty military leader can have
his own world to rule, his own Province?”</p>
<p>“But is that what you want?” asked Seldon wonderingly. “Are you
telling me that you look forward to ruling over an Empire that will
break up into splinters?”</p>
<p>Rashelle said, “That is exactly right. I would rule over Trantor,
over its outlying space settlements, over the few nearby planetary
systems that are part of the Trantorian Province. I would much rather be
Emperor of Trantor than Emperor of the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“You would be satisfied with Trantor only,” said Dors in tones of the
deepest disbelief.</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Rashelle, suddenly ablaze. She leaned forward
eagerly, both hands pressed palms-down on the table. “That is what my
father has been planning for forty years. He is only clinging to life
now to witness its fulfillment. Why do we need millions of worlds,
distant worlds that mean nothing to us, that weaken us, that draw our
forces far away from us into meaningless cubic parsecs of space, that
drown us in administrative chaos, that ruin us with their endless
quarrels and problems when they are all distant nothings as far as we
are concerned? Our own populous world—our own planetary city—is Galaxy
enough for us. We have all we need to support ourselves. As for the rest
of the Galaxy, let it splinter. Every petty militarist can have his own
splinter. They needn’t fight. There will be enough for all.”</p>
<p>“But they will fight, just the same,” said Dors. “Each will refuse to
be satisfied with his Province. Each will fear that his neighbor is not
satisfied with his Province. Each will feel insecure and will dream of
Galactic rule as the only guarantee of safety. This is certain, Madam
Empress of Nothing. There will be endless wars into which you and
Trantor will be inevitably drawn—to the ruin of all.”</p>
<p>Rashelle said with clear contempt, “So it might seem, if one could
see no farther than you do, if one relied on the ordinary lessons of
history.”</p>
<p>“What is there to see farther?” retorted Dors. “What is one to rely
on beyond the lessons of history?”</p>
<p>“What lies beyond?” said Rashelle. “Why, he!”</p>
<p>And her arm shot outward, her index finger jabbing toward Seldon.</p>
<p>“Me?” said Seldon. “I have already told you that psychohistory—”</p>
<p>Rashelle said, “Do not repeat what you have already said, my good
Dr. Seldon. We gain nothing by that. —Do you think, Dr. Venabili, that
my father was never aware of the danger of endless civil war? Do you
think he did not bend his powerful mind to thinking of some way to
prevent that? He has been prepared at any time these last ten years to
take over the Empire in a day. It needed only the assurance of security
beyond victory.”</p>
<p>“Which you can’t have,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“Which we had the moment we heard of Dr. Seldon’s paper at the
Decennial Convention. I saw at once that that was what we needed. My
father was too old to see the significance at once. When I explained it,
however, he saw it too and it was then that he formally transferred his
power to me. So it is to you, Hari, that I owe my position and to you I
will owe my greater position in the future.”</p>
<p>“I keep telling you that it cannot—” began Seldon with deep
annoyance.</p>
<p>“It is not important what can or cannot be done. What is important is
what people will or will not believe can be done. They will believe you,
Hari, when you tell them the psychohistoric prediction is that Trantor
can rule itself and that the Provinces can become Kingdoms that will
live together in peace.”</p>
<p>“I will make no such prediction,” said Seldon, “in the absence of
true psychohistory. I won’t play the charlatan. If you want something
like that, you say it.”</p>
<p>“Now, Hari. They won’t believe me. It’s you they will believe. The
great mathematician. Why not oblige them?”</p>
<p>“As it happens,” said Seldon, “the Emperor also thought to use me as
a source of self-serving prophecies. I refused to do it for him, so do
you think I will agree to do it for you?”</p>
<p>Rashelle was silent for a while and when she spoke again her voice
had lost its intense excitement and became almost coaxing.</p>
<p>“Hari,” she said, “think a little of the difference between Cleon and
myself. What Cleon undoubtedly wanted from you was propaganda to
preserve his throne. It would be useless to give him that, for the
throne can’t be preserved. Don’t you know that the Galactic Empire is in
a state of decay, that it cannot endure for much longer? Trantor itself
is slowly sliding into ruin because of the ever-increasing weight of
administering twenty-five million worlds. What’s ahead of us is breakup
and civil war, no matter what you do for Cleon.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I have heard something like this said. It may even be
true, but what then?”</p>
<p>“Well then, help it break into fragments without any war. Help me
take Trantor. Help me establish a firm government over a realm small
enough to be ruled efficiently. Let me give freedom to the rest of the
Galaxy, each portion to go its own way according to its own customs and
cultures. The Galaxy will become a working whole again through the free
agencies of trade, tourism, and communication and the fate of cracking
into disaster under the present rule of force that barely holds it
together will be averted. My ambition is moderate indeed; one world, not
millions; peace, not war; freedom, not slavery. Think about it and help
me.”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Why should the Galaxy believe me any more than they
would believe you? They don’t know me and which of our fleet commanders
will be impressed by the mere word ‘psychohistory’?”</p>
<p>“You won’t be believed now, but I don’t ask for action now. The House
of Wye, having waited thousands of years, can wait thousands of days
more. Cooperate with me and I will make your name famous. I will make
the promise of psychohistory glow through all the worlds and at the
proper time, when I judge the moment to be the chosen moment, you will
pronounce your prediction and we will strike. Then, in a twinkling of
history, the Galaxy will exist under a New Order that will render it
stable and happy for eons. Come now, Hari, can you refuse me?”</p>
<p>THALUS, EMMER—… A sergeant in the armed security forces of the Wye
Sector of ancient Trantor …</p>
<p>… Aside from these totally unremarkable vital statistics, nothing is
known of the man except that on one occasion he held the fate of the
Galaxy in his fist.</p>
