<h4 id="section">10</h4>
<p>Seldon tried to look inconspicuous at the air-taxi rental terminus,
which he found difficult. To look ostentatiously inconspicuous—to slink
about, to turn his face away from all who passed, to study one of the
vehicles overintently—was surely the way to invite attention. The way to
behave was merely to assume an innocent normality.</p>
<p>But what was normality? He felt uncomfortable in his clothes. There
were no pockets, so he had no place to put his hands. The two pouches,
which dangled from his belt on either side, distracted him by hitting
against him as he moved, so that he was continually thinking someone had
nudged him.</p>
<p>He tried looking at women as they passed. They had no pouches, at
least none dangling, but they carried little boxlike affairs that they
occasionally clipped to one hip or another by some device he could not
make out. It was probably pseudomagnetic, he decided. Their clothes were
not particularly revealing, he noted regretfully, and not one had any
sign of décolletage, although some dresses seemed to be designed to
emphasize the buttocks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hummin had been very businesslike, having presented the
necessary credits and returned with the superconductive ceramic tile
that would activate a specific air-taxi.</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Get in, Seldon,” gesturing to a small two-seated
vehicle.</p>
<p>Seldon asked, “Did you have to sign your name, Hummin?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. They know me here and don’t stand on ceremony.”</p>
<p>“What do they think you’re doing?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t ask and I volunteered no information.” He inserted the
tile and Seldon felt a slight vibration as the air-taxi came to
life.</p>
<p>“We’re headed for D-7,” said Hummin, making conversation.</p>
<p>Seldon didn’t know what D-7 was, but he assumed it meant some route
or other.</p>
<p>The air-taxi found its way past and around other ground-cars and
finally moved onto a smooth upward-slanting track and gained speed. Then
it lifted upward with a slight jolt.</p>
<p>Seldon, who had been automatically strapped in by a webbed restraint,
felt himself pushed down into his seat and then up against the
webbing.</p>
<p>He said, “That didn’t feel like antigravity.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t,” said Hummin. “That was a small jet reaction. Just enough
to take us up to the tubes.”</p>
<p>What appeared before them now looked like a cliff patterned with cave
openings, much like a checkerboard. Hummin maneuvered toward the D-7
opening, avoiding other air-taxis that were heading for other
tunnels.</p>
<p>“You could crash easily,” said Seldon, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>“So I probably would if everything depended on my senses and
reactions, but the taxi is computerized and the computer can overrule me
without trouble. The same is true for the other taxis. —Here we go.”</p>
<p>They slid into D-7 as if they had been sucked in and the bright light
of the open plaza outside mellowed, turning a warmer yellow hue.</p>
<p>Hummin released the controls and sat back. He drew a deep breath and
said, “Well, that’s one stage successfully carried through. We might
have been stopped at the station. In here, we’re fairly safe.”</p>
<p>The ride was smooth and the walls of the tunnel slipped by rapidly.
There was almost no sound, just a steady velvety whirr as the taxi sped
along.</p>
<p>“How fast are we going?” asked Seldon.</p>
<p>Hummin cast an eye briefly at the controls. “Three hundred and fifty
kilometers per hour.”</p>
<p>“Magnetic propulsion?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You have it on Helicon, I imagine.”</p>
<p>“Yes. One line. I’ve never been on it myself, though I’ve always
meant to. I don’t think it’s anything like this.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it isn’t. Trantor has many thousands of kilometers of these
tunnels honeycombing the land subsurface and a number that snake under
the shallower extensions of the ocean. It’s the chief method of
long-distance travel.”</p>
<p>“How long will it take us?”</p>
<p>“To reach our immediate destination? A little over five hours.”</p>
<p>“Five hours!” Seldon was dismayed.</p>
<p>“Don’t be disturbed. We pass rest areas every twenty minutes or so
where we can stop, pull out of the tunnel, stretch our feet, eat, or
relieve ourselves. I’d like to do that as few times as possible, of
course.”</p>
<p>They continued on in silence for a while and then Seldon started when
a blaze of light flared at their right for a few seconds and, in the
flash, he thought he saw two air-taxis.</p>
<p>“That was a rest area,” said Hummin in answer to the unspoken
question.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Am I really going to be safe wherever it is you are
taking me?”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “Quite safe from any open movement on the part of the
Imperial forces. Of course, when it comes to the individual operator—the
spy, the agent, the hired assassin—one must always be careful.
Naturally, I will supply you with a bodyguard.”</p>
<p>Seldon felt uneasy. “The hired assassin? Are you serious? Would they
really want to kill me?”</p>
<p>Hummin said, “I’m sure Demerzel doesn’t. I suspect he wants to use
you rather than kill you. Still, other enemies may turn up or there may
be unfortunate concatenations of events. You can’t go through life
sleepwalking.”</p>
<p>Seldon shook his head and turned his face away. To think, only
forty-eight hours ago he had been just an insignificant, virtually
unknown Outworld mathematician, content only to spend his remaining time
on Trantor sight-seeing, gazing at the enormity of the great world with
his provincial eye. And now, it was finally sinking in: He was a wanted
man, hunted by Imperial forces. The enormity of the situation seized him
and he shuddered.</p>
<p>“And what about you and what you’re doing right now?”</p>
<p>Hummin said thoughtfully, “Well, they won’t feel kindly toward me, I
suppose. I might have my head laid open or my chest exploded by some
mysterious and never-found assailant.”</p>
<p>Hummin said it without a tremor in his voice or a change in his calm
appearance, but Seldon winced.</p>
<p>Seldon said, “I rather thought you would assume that might be in
store for you. You don’t seem to be … bothered by it.”</p>
<p>“I’m an old Trantorian. I know the planet as well as anybody can. I
know many people and many of them are under obligation to me. I like to
think that I am shrewd and not easy to outwit. In short, Seldon, I am
quite confident that I can take care of myself.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you feel that way and I hope you’re justified in thinking
so, Hummin, but I can’t get it through my head why you’re taking this
chance at all. What am I to you? Why should you take even the smallest
risk for someone who is a stranger to you?”</p>
<p>Hummin checked the controls in a preoccupied manner and then he faced
Seldon squarely, eyes steady and serious.</p>
<p>“I want to save you for the same reason that the Emperor wants to use
you—for your predictive powers.”</p>
<p>Seldon felt a deep pang of disappointment. This was not after all a
question of being saved. He was merely the helpless and disputed prey of
competing predators. He said angrily, “I will never live down that
presentation at the Decennial Convention. I have ruined my life.”</p>
<p>“No. Don’t rush to conclusions, mathematician. The Emperor and his
officers want you for one reason only, to make their own lives more
secure. They are interested in your abilities only so far as they might
be used to save the Emperor’s rule, preserve that rule for his young
son, maintain the positions, status, and power of his officials. I, on
the other hand, want your powers for the good of the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Is there a distinction?” spat Seldon acidly.</p>
<p>And Hummin replied with the stern beginning of a frown, “If you do
not see the distinction, then that is to your shame. The human occupants
of the Galaxy existed before this Emperor who now rules, before the
dynasty he represents, before the Empire itself. Humanity is far older
than the Empire. It may even be far older than the twenty-five million
worlds of the Galaxy. There are legends of a time when humanity
inhabited a single world.”</p>
<p>“Legends!” said Seldon, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Yes, legends, but I see no reason why that may not have been so in
fact, twenty thousand years ago or more. I presume that humanity did not
come into existence complete with knowledge of hyperspatial travel.
Surely, there must have been a time when people could not travel at
superluminal velocities and they must then have been imprisoned in a
single planetary system. And if we look forward in time, the human
beings of the worlds of the Galaxy will surely continue to exist after
you and the Emperor are dead, after his whole line comes to an end, and
after the institutions of the Empire itself unravel. In that case, it is
not important to worry overmuch about individuals, about the Emperor and
the young Prince Imperial. It is not important to worry even about the
mechanics of Empire. What of the quadrillions of people that exist in
the Galaxy? What of them?”</p>
<p>Seldon said, “Worlds and people would continue, I presume.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you feel any serious need of probing the possible conditions
under which they would continue to exist?”</p>
<p>“One would assume they would exist much as they do now.”</p>
<p>“One would assume. But could one know by this art of prediction that
you speak of?”</p>
<p>“Psychohistory is what I call it. In theory, one could.”</p>
<p>“And you feel no pressure to turn that theory into practice.”</p>
<p>“I would love to, Hummin, but the desire to do so doesn’t
automatically manufacture the ability to do so. I told the Emperor that
psychohistory could not be turned into a practical technique and I am
forced to tell you the same thing.”</p>
<p>“And you have no intention of even trying to find the technique?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t, any more than I would feel I ought to try to tackle a
pile of pebbles the size of Trantor, count them one by one, and arrange
them in order of decreasing mass. I would know it was not something I
could accomplish in a lifetime and I would not be fool enough to make a
pretense of trying.”</p>
<p>“Would you try if you knew the truth about humanity’s situation?”</p>
<p>“That’s an impossible question. What is the truth about humanity’s
situation? Do you claim to know it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. And in five words.” Hummin’s eyes faced forward again,
turning briefly toward the blank changelessness of the tunnel as it
pushed toward them, expanding until it passed and then dwindling as it
slipped away. He then spoke those five words grimly.</p>
<p>He said, “The Galactic Empire is dying.”</p>
<p>STREELING UNIVERSITY—… An institution of higher learning in the
Streeling Sector of ancient Trantor … Despite all these claims to fame
in the fields of the humanities and sciences alike, it is not for those
that the University looms large in today’s consciousness. It would
probably have come as a total surprise to the generations of scholars at
the University to know that in later times Streeling University would be
most remembered because a certain Hari Seldon, during the period of The
Flight, had been in residence there for a short time.</p>
