<h4 id="section">4</h4>
<p>There was a short silence again, but only because thoughts are
silent. Seldon’s were tumultuous enough.</p>
<p>Yes, it was true. His wife did seem to have an uncanny knowledge of
robots. Hari had wondered about this so often over the years that he had
finally given up, tucked it away in the back of his mind. If it hadn’t
been for Eto Demerzel—a robot—Hari would never have met Dors. For Dors
worked for Demerzel; it was Demerzel who “assigned” Dors to Hari’s case
eight years ago to protect him during his flight throughout the various
sectors of Trantor. Even though now she was his wife, his help-meet, his
“better half,” Hari still occasionally wondered about Dors’s strange
connection with the robot Demerzel. It was the only area of Dors’s life
where Hari truly felt he did not belong—nor welcome. And that brought to
mind the most painful question of all: Was it out of obedience to
Demerzel that Dors stayed with Hari or was it out of love for him? He
wanted to believe the latter—and yet …</p>
<p>His life with Dors Venabili was a happy one, but it was so at a cost,
at a condition. The condition was all the more stringent, in that it had
been settled not through discussion or agreement but by a mutual
unspoken understanding.</p>
<p>Seldon understood that he found in Dors everything he would have
wanted in a wife. True, he had no children, but he had neither expected
any, nor, to tell the truth, had greatly wanted any. He had Raych, who
was as much a son of his emotionally as if he had inherited the entire
Seldonian genome—perhaps more so.</p>
<p>The mere fact that Dors was causing him to think about the matter was
breaking the agreement that had kept them in peace and comfort all these
years and he felt a faint but growing resentment at that.</p>
<p>But he pushed those thoughts, the questions, away again. He had
learned to accept her role as his protector and would continue to do so.
After all, it was he with whom she shared a home, a table, and a bed—not
Eto Demerzel.</p>
<p>Dors’s voice brought him out of his reverie.</p>
<p>“I said— Are you sulking, Hari?”</p>
<p>He started slightly, for there was the sound of repetition in her
voice, and he realized he had been shrinking steadily deeper into his
mind and away from her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, dear. I’m not sulking. —Not deliberately sulking. I’m
just wondering how I ought to respond to your statement.”</p>
<p>“About robots?” She seemed quite calm as she said the word.</p>
<p>“You said I don’t know as much about them as you do. How do I respond
to that?” He paused, then added quietly (knowing he was taking a
chance), “That is, without offense.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say you didn’t know about robots. If you’re going to quote
me, do so with precision. I said you didn’t understand about robots. I’m
sure that you know a great deal, perhaps more than I do, but to know is
not necessarily to understand.”</p>
<p>“Now, Dors, you’re deliberately speaking in paradoxes to be annoying.
A paradox arises only out of an ambiguity that deceives either
unwittingly or by design. I don’t like that in science and I don’t like
it in casual conversation, either, unless it is meant humorously, which
I think is not the case now.”</p>
<p>Dors laughed in her particular way, softly, almost as though
amusement were too precious to be shared in an overliberal manner.
“Apparently the paradox has annoyed you into pomposity and you are
always humorous when you are pompous. However, I’ll explain. It’s not my
intention to annoy you.” She reached over to pat his hand and it was to
Seldon’s surprise (and slight embarrassment) that he found that he had
clenched his hand into a fist.</p>
<p>Dors said, “You talk about psychohistory a great deal. To me, at any
rate. You know that?”</p>
<p>Seldon cleared his throat. “I throw myself on your mercy as far as
that’s concerned. The project is secret—by its very nature.
Psychohistory won’t work unless the people it affects know nothing about
it, so I can talk about it only to Yugo and to you. To Yugo, it is all
intuition. He’s brilliant, but he is so apt to leap wildly into darkness
that I must play the role of caution, of forever pulling him back. But I
have my wild thoughts, too, and it helps me to be able to hear them
aloud, even”—and he smiled—“when I have a pretty good notion that you
don’t understand a word I’m saying.”</p>
<p>“I know I’m your sounding board and I don’t mind. —I really don’t
mind, Hari, so don’t begin making inner resolutions to change your
behavior. Naturally I don’t understand your mathematics. I’m just a
historian—and not even a historian of science. The influence of economic
change on political development is what is taking up my time now—”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I’m your sounding board on that or hadn’t you noticed? I’ll
need it for psychohistory when the time comes, so I suspect you’ll be an
indispensable help to me.”</p>
<p>“Good! Now that we’ve settled why you stay with me—I knew it couldn’t
be for my ethereal beauty—let me go on to explain that occasionally,
when your discussion veers away from the strictly mathematical aspects,
it seems to me that I get your drift. You have, on a number of
occasions, explained what you call the necessity of minimalism. I think
I understand that. By it, you mean—”</p>
<p>“I know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Dors looked hurt. “Less lofty, please, Hari. I’m not trying to
explain it to you. I want to explain it to myself. You say you’re my
sounding board, so act like one. Turnabout is fair play, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Turnabout is fine, but if you’re going to accuse me of loftiness
when I say one little—”</p>
<p>“Enough! Shut up! —You have told me that minimalism is of the highest
importance in applied psychohistory; in the art of attempting to change
an undesired development into a desired one or, at any rate, a less
undesired one. You have said that a change must be applied that is as
minute, as minimal, as possible—”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Seldon eagerly, “that is because—”</p>
<p>“No, Hari. I’m trying to explain. We both know that you understand
it. You must have minimalism because every change, any change, has
myriad side effects that can’t always be allowed for. If the change is
too great and the side effects too many, then it becomes certain that
the outcome will be far removed from anything you’ve planned and that it
would be entirely unpredictable.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Seldon. “That’s the essence of a chaotic effect. The
problem is whether any change is small enough to make the consequence
reasonably predictable or whether human history is inevitably and
unalterably chaotic in every respect. It was that which, at the start,
made me think that psychohistory was not—”</p>
<p>“I know, but you’re not letting me make my point. Whether any change
would be small enough is not the issue. The point is that any change
greater than the minimal is chaotic. The required minimum may be zero,
but if it is not zero, then it is still very small—and it would be a
major problem to find some change that is small enough and yet is
significantly greater than zero. Now, that, I gather, is what you mean
by the necessity of minimalism.”</p>
<p>“More or less,” said Seldon. “Of course, as always, the matter is
expressed more compactly and more rigorously in the language of
mathematics. See here—”</p>
<p>“Save me,” said Dors. “Since you know this about psychohistory, Hari,
you ought to know it about Demerzel, too. You have the knowledge but not
the understanding, because it apparently doesn’t occur to you to apply
the rules of psychohistory to the Laws of Robotics.”</p>
<p>To which Seldon replied faintly, “Now I don’t see what you’re getting
at.”</p>
<p>“He requires minimality, too, doesn’t he, Hari? By the First Law of
Robotics, a robot can’t harm a human being. That is the prime rule for
the usual robot, but Demerzel is something quite unusual and for him,
the Zeroth Law is a reality and it takes precedence even over the First
Law. The Zeroth Law states that a robot can’t harm humanity as a whole.
But that puts Demerzel into the same bind in which you exist when you
labor at psychohistory. Do you see?”</p>
<p>“I’m beginning to.”</p>
<p>“I hope so. If Demerzel has the ability to change minds, he has to do
so without bringing about side effects he does not wish—and since he is
the Emperor’s First Minister, the side effects he must worry about are
numerous, indeed.”</p>
<p>“And the application to the present case?”</p>
<p>“Think about it! You can’t tell anyone—except me, of course—that
Demerzel is a robot, because he has adjusted you so that you can’t. But
how much adjustment did that take? Do you want to tell people that he is
a robot? Do you want to ruin his effectiveness when you depend on him
for protection, for support of your grants, for influence quietly
exerted on your behalf? Of course not. The change he had to make then
was a very tiny one, just enough to keep you from blurting it out in a
moment of excitement or carelessness. It is so small a change that there
are no particular side effects. That is how Demerzel tries to run the
Empire generally.”</p>
<p>“And the case of Joranum?”</p>
<p>“Is obviously completely different from yours. He is, for whatever
motives, unalterably opposed to Demerzel. Undoubtedly, Demerzel could
change that, but it would be at the price of introducing a considerable
wrench in Joranum’s makeup that would bring about results Demerzel could
not predict. Rather than take the chance of harming Joranum, of
producing side effects that would harm others and, possibly, all of
humanity, he must leave Joranum alone until he can find some small
change—some small change—that will save the situation without harm. That
is why Yugo is right and why Demerzel is vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Seldon had listened but did not respond. He seemed lost in thought.
Minutes passed before he said, “If Demerzel can do nothing in this
matter, then I must.”</p>
<p>“If he can do nothing, what can you do?”</p>
<p>“The case is different. I am not bound by the Laws of Robotics. I
need not concern myself obsessively with minimalism. —And to begin with,
I must see Demerzel.”</p>
<p>Dors looked faintly anxious. “Must you? Surely it wouldn’t be wise to
advertise a connection between the two of you.”</p>
<p>“We have reached a time where we can’t make a fetish of pretending
there is no connection. Naturally I won’t go to see him behind a
flourish of trumpets and an announcement on holovision, but I must see
him.”</p>
