<h4 id="section">61</h4>
<p>The Emperor of all the Galaxy felt weary—physically weary. His lips
ached from the gracious smile he had had to place on his face at careful
intervals. His neck was stiff from having inclined his head this way and
that in a feigned show of interest. His ears pained from having to
listen. His whole body throbbed from having to rise and to sit and to
turn and to hold out his hand and to nod.</p>
<p>It was merely a state function where one had to meet Mayors and
Viceroys and Ministers and their wives or husbands from here and there
in Trantor and (worse) from here and there in the Galaxy. There were
nearly a thousand present, all in costumes that varied from the ornate
to the downright outlandish, and he had had to listen to a babble of
different accents made the worse by an effort to speak the Emperor’s
Galactic as spoken at the Galactic University. Worst of all, the Emperor
had had to remember to avoid making commitments of substance, while
freely applying the lotion of words without substance.</p>
<p>All had been recorded, sight and sound—very discreetly—and Eto
Demerzel would go over it to see if Cleon, First of that Name, had
behaved himself. That, of course, was only the way that the Emperor put
it to himself. Demerzel would surely say that he was merely collecting
data on any unintentional self-revelation on the part of the guests. And
perhaps he was.</p>
<p>Fortunate Demerzel!</p>
<p>The Emperor could not leave the Palace and its extensive grounds,
while Demerzel could range the Galaxy if he wished. The Emperor was
always on display, always accessible, always forced to deal with
visitors, from the important to the merely intrusive. Demerzel remained
anonymous and never allowed himself to be seen inside the Palace
grounds. He remained merely a fearsome name and an invisible (and
therefore the more frightening) presence.</p>
<p>The Emperor was the Inside Man with all the trappings and emoluments
of power. Demerzel was the Outside Man, with nothing evident, not even a
formal title, but with his fingers and mind probing everywhere and
asking for no reward for his tireless labors but one—the reality of
power.</p>
<p>It amused the Emperor—in a macabre sort of way—to consider that, at
any moment, without warning, with a manufactured excuse or with none at
all, he could have Demerzel arrested, imprisoned, exiled, tortured, or
executed. After all, in these annoying centuries of constant unrest, the
Emperor might have difficulty in exerting his will over the various
planets of the Empire, even over the various sectors of Trantor—with
their rabble of local executives and legislatures that he was forced to
deal with in a maze of interlocking decrees, protocols, commitments,
treaties, and general interstellar legalities—but at least his powers
remained absolute over the Palace and its grounds.</p>
<p>And yet Cleon knew that his dreams of power were useless. Demerzel
had served his father and Cleon could not remember a time when he did
not turn to Demerzel for everything. It was Demerzel who knew it all,
devised it all, did it all. More than that, it was on Demerzel that
anything that went wrong could be blamed. The Emperor himself remained
above criticism and had nothing to fear—except, of course, palace coups
and assassination by his nearest and dearest. It was to prevent this,
above all, that he depended upon Demerzel.</p>
<p>Emperor Cleon felt a tiny shudder at the thought of trying to do
without Demerzel. There had been Emperors who had ruled personally, who
had had a series of Chiefs of Staff of no talent, who had had
incompetents serving in the post and had kept them—and somehow they had
gotten along for a time and after a fashion.</p>
<p>But Cleon could not. He needed Demerzel. In fact, now that the
thought of assassination had come to him—and, in view of the modern
history of the Empire, it was inevitable that it had come to him—he
could see that getting rid of Demerzel was quite impossible. It couldn’t
be done. No matter how cleverly he, Cleon, would attempt to arrange it,
Demerzel (he was sure) would anticipate the move somehow, would know it
was on its way, and would arrange, with far superior cleverness, a
palace coup. Cleon would be dead before Demerzel could possibly be taken
away in chains and there would simply be another Emperor that Demerzel
would serve—and dominate.</p>
<p>Or would Demerzel tire of the game and make himself Emperor?</p>
<p>Never! The habit of anonymity was too strong in him. If Demerzel
exposed himself to the world, then his powers, his wisdom, his luck
(whatever it was) would surely desert him. Cleon was convinced of that.
He felt it to be beyond dispute.</p>
<p>So while he behaved himself, Cleon was safe. With no ambitions of his
own, Demerzel would serve him faithfully.</p>
<p>And now here was Demerzel, dressed so severely and simply that it
made Cleon uneasily conscious of the useless ornamentation of his robes
of state, now thankfully removed with the aid of two valets. Naturally,
it would not be until he was alone and in dishabille that Demerzel would
glide into view.</p>
<p>“Demerzel,” said the Emperor of all the Galaxy, “I am tired!”</p>
<p>“State functions are tiring, Sire,” murmured Demerzel.</p>
<p>“Then must I have them every evening?”</p>
<p>“Not every evening, but they are essential. It gratifies others to
see you and to be taken note of by you. It helps keep the Empire running
smoothly.”</p>
<p>“The Empire used to be kept running smoothly by power,” said the
Emperor somberly. “Now it must be kept running by a smile, a wave of the
hand, a murmured word, and a medal or a plaque.”</p>
<p>“If all that keeps the peace, Sire, there is much to be said for it.
And your reign proceeds well.”</p>
<p>“You know why—because I have you at my side. My only real gift is
that I am aware of your importance.” He looked at Demerzel slyly. “My
son need not be my heir. He is not a talented boy. What if I make you my
heir?”</p>
<p>Demerzel said freezingly, “Sire, that is unthinkable. I would not
usurp the throne. I would not steal it from your rightful heir. Besides,
if I have displeased you, punish me justly. Surely, nothing I have done
or could possibly do deserves the punishment of being made Emperor.”</p>
<p>Cleon laughed. “For that true assessment of the value of the Imperial
throne, Demerzel, I abandon any thought of punishing you. Come now, let
us talk about something. I would sleep, but I am not yet ready for the
ceremonies with which they put me to bed. Let us talk.”</p>
<p>“About what, Sire?”</p>
<p>“About anything. —About that mathematician and his psychohistory. I
think about him every once in a while, you know. I thought of him at
dinner tonight. I wondered: What if a psychohistorical analysis would
predict a method for making it possible to be an Emperor without endless
ceremony?”</p>
<p>“I somehow think, Sire, that even the cleverest psychohistorian could
not manage that.”</p>
<p>“Well, tell me the latest. Is he still hiding among those peculiar
baldheads of Mycogen? You promised you would winkle him out of
there.”</p>
<p>“So I did, Sire, and I moved in that direction, but I regret that I
must say that I failed.”</p>
<p>“Failed?” The Emperor allowed himself to frown. “I don’t like
that.”</p>
<p>“Nor I, Sire. I planned to have the mathematician be encouraged to
commit some blasphemous act—such acts are easy to commit in Mycogen,
especially for an outsider—one that would call for severe punishment.
The mathematician would then be forced to appeal to the Emperor and, as
a result, we would get him. I planned it at the cost of insignificant
concessions on our part—important to Mycogen, totally unimportant to
us—and I meant to play no direct role in the arrangement. It was to be
handled subtly.”</p>
<p>“I dare say,” said Cleon, “but it failed. Did the Mayor of
Mycogen—”</p>
<p>“He is called the High Elder, Sire.”</p>
<p>“Do not quibble over titles. Did this High Elder refuse?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, Sire, he agreed and the mathematician, Seldon, fell
into the trap neatly.”</p>
<p>“Well then?”</p>
<p>“He was allowed to leave unharmed.”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Cleon indignantly.</p>
<p>“Of this I am not certain, Sire, but I suspect we were outbid.”</p>
<p>“By whom? By the Mayor of Wye?”</p>
<p>“Possibly, Sire, but I doubt that. I have Wye under constant
surveillance. If they had gained the mathematician, I would know it by
now.”</p>
<p>The Emperor was not merely frowning. He was clearly enraged.
“Demerzel, this is bad. I am greatly displeased. A failure like this
makes me wonder if you are perhaps not the man you once were. What
measures shall we take against Mycogen for this clear defiance of the
Emperor’s wishes?”</p>
<p>Demerzel bowed low in recognition of the storm unleashed, but he said
in steely tones, “It would be a mistake to move against Mycogen now,
Sire. The disruption that would follow would play into the hands of
Wye.”</p>
<p>“But we must do something.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not, Sire. It is not as bad as it may seem.”</p>
<p>“How can it be not as bad as it seems?”</p>
<p>“You’ll remember, Sire, that this mathematician was convinced that
psychohistory was impractical.”</p>
<p>“Of course I remember that, but that doesn’t matter, does it? For our
purposes?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not. But if it were to become practical, it would serve our
purposes to an infinitely great extent, Sire. And from what I have been
able to find out, the mathematician is now attempting to make
psychohistory practical. His blasphemous attempt in Mycogen was, I
understand, part of an attempt at solving the problem of psychohistory.
In that case, it may pay us, Sire, to leave him to himself. It will
serve us better to pick him up when he is closer to his goal or has
reached it.”</p>
<p>“Not if Wye gets him first.”</p>
<p>“That, I shall see to it, will not happen.”</p>
<p>“In the same way that you succeeded in winkling the mathematician out
of Mycogen just now?”</p>
<p>“I will not make a mistake the next time, Sire,” said Demerzel
coldly.</p>
<p>The Emperor said, “Demerzel, you had better not. I will not tolerate
another mistake in this respect.” And then he added pettishly, “I think
I shall not sleep tonight after all.”</p>
