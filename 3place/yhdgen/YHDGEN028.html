<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>Eskel Gorov stirred on his couch and opened one eye as Limmar Ponyets
entered the heavily reinforced door. It boomed shut behind him. Gorov
sputtered and came to his feet.</p>
<p>“Ponyets! They sent you?”</p>
<p>“Pure chance,” said Ponyets, bitterly, “or the work of my own
personal malevolent demon. Item one, you get into a mess on Askone. Item
two, my sales route, as known to the Board of Trade, carries me within
fifty parsecs of the system at just the time of item one. Item three,
we’ve worked together before and the Board knows it. Isn’t that a sweet,
inevitable set-up? The answer just pops out of a slot.”</p>
<p>“Be careful,” said Gorov, tautly. “There’ll be someone listening. Are
you wearing a Field Distorter?”</p>
<p>Ponyets indicated the ornamented bracelet that hugged his wrist and
Gorov relaxed.</p>
<p>Ponyets looked about him. The cell was bare, but large. It was
well-lit and it lacked offensive odors. He said, “Not bad. They’re
treating you with kid gloves.”</p>
<p>Gorov brushed the remark aside. “Listen, how did you get down here?
I’ve been in strict solitary for almost two weeks.”</p>
<p>“Ever since I came, huh? Well, it seems the old bird who’s boss here
has his weak points. He leans toward pious speeches, so I took a chance
that worked. I’m here in the capacity of your spiritual adviser. There’s
something about a pious man such as he. He will cheerfully cut your
throat if it suits him, but he will hesitate to endanger the welfare of
your immaterial and problematical soul. It’s just a piece of empirical
psychology. A trader has to know a little of everything.”</p>
<p>Gorov’s smile was sardonic. “And you’ve been to theological school as
well. You’re all right, Ponyets. I’m glad they sent you. But the Grand
Master doesn’t love my soul exclusively. Has he mentioned a ransom?”</p>
<p>The trader’s eyes narrowed, “He hinted—barely. And he also threatened
death by gas. I played safe, and dodged; it might easily have been a
trap. So it’s extortion, is it? What is it he wants?”</p>
<p>“Gold.”</p>
<p>“Gold!” Ponyets frowned. “The metal itself? What for?”</p>
<p>“It’s their medium of exchange.”</p>
<p>“Is it? And where do I get gold from?”</p>
<p>“Wherever you can. Listen to me; this is important. Nothing will
happen to me as long as the Grand Master has the scent of gold in his
nose. Promise it to him; as much as he asks for. Then go back to the
Foundation, if necessary, to get it. When I’m free, we’ll be escorted
out of the system, and then we part company.”</p>
<p>Ponyets stared disapprovingly. “And then you’ll come back and try
again.”</p>
<p>“It’s my assignment to sell nucleics to Askone.”</p>
<p>“They’ll get you before you’ve gone a parsec in space. You know that,
I suppose.”</p>
<p>“I don’t,” said Gorov. “And if I did, it wouldn’t affect things.”</p>
<p>“They’ll kill you the second time.”</p>
<p>Gorov shrugged.</p>
<p>Ponyets said quietly, “If I’m going to negotiate with the Grand
Master again, I want to know the whole story. So far, I’ve been working
it too blind. As it was, the few mild remarks I did make almost threw
his Veneration into fits.”</p>
<p>“It’s simple enough,” said Gorov. “The only way we can increase the
security of the Foundation here in the Periphery is to form a
religion-controlled commercial empire. We’re still too weak to be able
to force political control. It’s all we can do to hold the Four
Kingdoms.”</p>
<p>Ponyets was nodding. “This I realize. And any system that doesn’t
accept nuclear gadgets can never be placed under our religious
control—”</p>
<p>“And can therefore become a focal point for independence and
hostility. Yes.”</p>
<p>“All right, then,” said Ponyets, “so much for theory. Now what
exactly prevents the sale. Religion? The Grand Master implied as
much.”</p>
<p>“It’s a form of ancestor worship. Their traditions tell of an evil
past from which they were saved by the simple and virtuous heroes of the
past generations. It amounts to a distortion of the anarchic period a
century ago, when the imperial troops were driven out and an independent
government was set up. Advanced science and nuclear power in particular
became identified with the old imperial regime they remember with
horror.”</p>
<p>“That so? But they have nice little ships which spotted me very
handily two parsecs away. That smells of nucleics to me.”</p>
<p>Gorov shrugged. “Those ships are holdovers of the Empire, no doubt.
Probably with nuclear drive. What they have, they keep. The point is
that they will not innovate and their internal economy is entirely
non-nuclear. That is what we must change.”</p>
<p>“How were you going to do it?”</p>
<p>“By breaking the resistance at one point. To put it simply, if I
could sell a penknife with a force-field blade to a nobleman, it would
be to his interest to force laws that would allow him to use it. Put
that baldly, it sounds silly, but it is sound, psychologically. To make
strategic sales, at strategic points, would be to create a pronucleics
faction at court.”</p>
<p>“And they send you for that purpose, while I’m only here to ransom
you and leave, while you keep on trying? Isn’t that sort of
tail-backward?”</p>
<p>“In what way?” said Gorov, guardedly.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Ponyets was suddenly exasperated, “you’re a diplomat, not a
trader, and calling you a trader won’t make you one. This case is for
one who’s made a business of selling—and I’m here with a full cargo
stinking into uselessness, and a quota that won’t ever be met, it looks
like.”</p>
<p>“You mean you’re going to risk your life on something that isn’t your
business?” Gorov smiled thinly.</p>
<p>Ponyets said, “You mean that this is a matter of patriotism and
traders aren’t patriotic?”</p>
<p>“Notoriously not. Pioneers never are.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll grant that. I don’t scoot about space to save the
Foundation or anything like that. But I’m out to make money, and this is
my chance. If it helps the Foundation at the same time, all the better.
And I’ve risked my life on slimmer chances.”</p>
<p>Ponyets rose, and Gorov rose with him. “What are you going to
do?”</p>
<p>The trader smiled. “Gorov, I don’t know—not yet. But if the crux of
the matter is to make a sale, then I’m your man. I’m not a boaster as a
general thing, but there’s one thing I’ll always back up. I’ve never
ended up below quota yet.”</p>
<p>The door to the cell opened almost instantly when he knocked, and two
guards fell in on either side.</p>
