<h4 id="section">78</h4>
<p>Casilia Tisalver stood ramrod straight with a tight smile on her
round face and her dark eyes glinting. Her husband was leaning moodily
against the wall. In the center of the room were two men who were
standing stiffly upright, as though they had noticed the cushions on the
floor but scorned them.</p>
<p>Both had the dark crisp hair and the thick black mustache to be
expected of Dahlites. Both were thin and both were dressed in dark
clothes so nearly alike that they were surely uniforms. There was thin
white piping up and over the shoulders and down the sides of the tubular
trouser legs. Each had, on the right side of his chest, a rather dim
Spaceship-and-Sun, the symbol of the Galactic Empire on every inhabited
world of the Galaxy, with, in this case, a dark “D” in the center of the
sun.</p>
<p>Seldon realized immediately that these were two members of the
Dahlite security forces.</p>
<p>“What’s all this?” said Seldon sternly.</p>
<p>One of the men stepped forward. “I am Sector Officer Lanel Russ. This
is my partner, Gebore Astinwald.”</p>
<p>Both presented glittering identification holo-tabs.</p>
<p>Seldon didn’t bother looking at them. “What is it you want?”</p>
<p>Russ said calmly, “Are you Hari Seldon of Helicon?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“And are you Dors Venabili of Cinna, Mistress?”</p>
<p>“I am,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“I’m here to investigate a complaint that one Hari Seldon instigated
a riot yesterday.”</p>
<p>“I did no such thing,” said Seldon.</p>
<p>“Our information is,” said Russ, looking at the screen of a small
computer pad, “that you accused a newsman of being an Imperial agent,
thus instigating a riot against him.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “It was I who said he was an Imperial agent, Officer. I
had reason to think he was. It is surely no crime to express one’s
opinion. The Empire has freedom of speech.”</p>
<p>“That does not cover an opinion deliberately advanced in order to
instigate a riot.”</p>
<p>“How can you say it was, Officer?”</p>
<p>At this point, Mistress Tisalver interposed in a shrill voice, “I can
say it, Officer. She saw there was a crowd present, a crowd of gutter
people who were just looking for trouble. She deliberately said he was
an Imperial agent when she knew nothing of the sort and she shouted it
to the crowd to stir them up. It was plain that she knew what she was
doing.”</p>
<p>“Casilia,” said her husband pleadingly, but she cast one look at him
and he said no more.</p>
<p>Russ turned to Mistress Tisalver. “Did you lodge the complaint,
Mistress?”</p>
<p>“Yes. These two have been living here for a few days and they’ve done
nothing but make trouble. They’ve invited people of low reputation into
my apartment, damaging my standing with my neighbors.”</p>
<p>“Is it against the law, Officer,” asked Seldon, “to invite clean,
quiet citizens of Dahl into one’s room? The two rooms upstairs are our
rooms. We have rented them and they are paid for. Is it a crime to speak
to Dahlites in Dahl, Officer?”</p>
<p>“No, it is not,” said Russ. “That is not part of the complaint. What
gave you reason, Mistress Venabili, to suppose the person you so accused
was, in fact, an Imperial agent?”</p>
<p>Dors said, “He had a small brown mustache, from which I concluded he
was not a Dahlite. I surmised he was an Imperial agent.”</p>
<p>“You surmised? Your associate, Master Seldon, has no mustache at all.
Do you surmise he is an Imperial agent?”</p>
<p>“In any case,” said Seldon hastily, “there was no riot. We asked the
crowd to take no action against the supposed newsman and I’m sure they
didn’t.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure, Master Seldon?” said Russ. “Our information is that you
left immediately after making your accusation. How could you witness
what happened after you left?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t,” said Seldon, “but let me ask you—Is the man dead? Is
the man hurt?”</p>
<p>“The man has been interviewed. He denies he is an Imperial agent and
we have no information that he is. He also claims he was handled
roughly.”</p>
<p>“He may well be lying in both respects,” said Seldon. “I would
suggest a Psychic Probe.”</p>
<p>“That cannot be done on the victim of a crime,” said Russ. “The
sector government is very firm on that. It might do if you two, as the
criminals in this case, each underwent a Psychic Probe. Would you like
us to do that?”</p>
<p>Seldon and Dors exchanged glances for a moment, then Seldon said,
“No, of course not.”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” repeated Russ with just a tinge of sarcasm in his
voice, “but you’re ready enough to suggest it for someone else.”</p>
<p>The other officer, Astinwald, who had so far not said a word, smiled
at this.</p>
<p>Russ said, “We also have information that two days ago you engaged in
a knife fight in Billibotton and badly hurt a Dahlite citizen named”—he
struck a button on his computer pad and studied the new page on the
screen—“Elgin Marron.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “Does your information tell you how the fight
started?”</p>
<p>“That is irrelevant at the moment, Mistress. Do you deny that the
fight took place?”</p>
<p>“Of course we don’t deny the fight took place,” said Seldon hotly,
“but we deny that we in any way instigated that. We were attacked.
Mistress Venabili was seized by this Marron and it was clear he was
attempting to rape her. What happened afterward was pure self-defense.
Or does Dahl condone rape?”</p>
<p>Russ said with very little intonation in his voice, “You say you were
attacked? By how many?”</p>
<p>“Ten men.”</p>
<p>“And you alone—with a woman—defended yourself against ten men?”</p>
<p>“Mistress Venabili and I defended ourselves. Yes.”</p>
<p>“How is it, then, that neither of you shows any damage whatever? Are
either of you cut or bruised where it doesn’t show right now?”</p>
<p>“No, Officer.”</p>
<p>“How is it, then, that in the fight of one—plus a woman—against ten,
you are in no way hurt, but that the complainant, Elgin Marron, has been
hospitalized with wounds and will require a skin transplant on his upper
lip?”</p>
<p>“We fought well,” said Seldon grimly.</p>
<p>“Unbelievably well. What would you say if I told you that three men
have testified that you and your friend attacked Marron,
unprovoked?”</p>
<p>“I would say that it belies belief that we should. I’m sure that
Marron has a record as a brawler and knifeman. I tell you that there
were ten there. Obviously, six refused to swear to a lie. Do the other
three explain why they did not come to the help of their friend if they
witnessed him under unprovoked attack and in danger of his life? It must
be clear to you that they are lying.”</p>
<p>“Do you suggest a Psychic Probe for them?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And before you ask, I still refuse to consider one for us.”</p>
<p>Russ said, “We have also received information that yesterday, after
leaving the scene of the riot, you consulted with one Davan, a known
subversive who is wanted by the security police. Is that true?”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to prove that without help from us,” said Seldon. “We’re
not answering any further questions.”</p>
<p>Russ put away his pad. “I’m afraid I must ask you to come with us to
headquarters for further interrogation.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s necessary, Officer,” said Seldon. “We are
Outworlders who have done nothing criminal. We have tried to avoid a
newsman who was annoying us unduly, we tried to protect ourselves
against rape and possible murder in a part of the sector known for
criminal behavior, and we’ve spoken to various Dahlites. We see nothing
there to warrant our further questioning. It would come under the
heading of harassment.”</p>
<p>“We make these decisions,” said Russ. “Not you. Will you please come
with us?”</p>
<p>“No, we will not,” said Dors.</p>
<p>“Watch out!” cried out Mistress Tisalver. “She’s got two knives.”</p>
<p>Officer Russ sighed and said, “Thank you, Mistress, but I know she
does.” He turned to Dors. “Do you know it’s a serious crime to carry a
knife without a permit in this sector? Do you have a permit?”</p>
<p>“No, Officer, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“It was clearly with an illegal knife, then, that you assaulted
Marron? Do you realize that that greatly increases the seriousness of
the crime?”</p>
<p>“It was no crime, Officer,” said Dors. “Understand that. Marron had a
knife as well and no permit, I am certain.”</p>
<p>“We have no evidence to that effect and while Marron has knife
wounds, neither of you have any.”</p>
<p>“Of course he had a knife, Officer. If you don’t know that every man
in Billibotton and most men elsewhere in Dahl carry knives for which
they probably don’t have permits, then you’re the only man in Dahl who
doesn’t know. There are shops here wherever you turn that sell knives
openly. Don’t you know that?”</p>
<p>Russ said, “It doesn’t matter what I know or don’t know in this
respect. Nor does it matter whether other people are breaking the law or
how many of them do. All that matters at this moment is that Mistress
Venabili is breaking the anti-knife law. I must ask you to give up those
knives to me right now, Mistress, and the two of you must then accompany
me to headquarters.”</p>
<p>Dors said, “In that case, take my knives away from me.”</p>
<p>Russ sighed. “You must not think, Mistress, that knives are all the
weapons there are in Dahl or that I need engage you in a knife fight.
Both my partner and I have blasters that will destroy you in a moment,
before you can drop your hands to your knife hilt—however fast you are.
We won’t use a blaster, of course, because we are not here to kill you.
However, each of us also has a neuronic whip, which we can use on you
freely. I hope you won’t ask for a demonstration. It won’t kill you, do
you permanent harm of any kind, or leave any marks—but the pain is
excruciating. My partner is holding a neuronic whip on you right now.
And here is mine. —Now, let us have your knives, Mistress Venabili.”</p>
<p>There was a moment’s pause and then Seldon said, “It’s no use, Dors.
Give him your knives.”</p>
<p>And at that moment, a frantic pounding sounded at the door and they
all heard a voice raised in high-pitched expostulation.</p>
