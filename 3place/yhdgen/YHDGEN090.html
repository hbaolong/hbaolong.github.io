<h4 id="section">15</h4>
<p>THROUGH THE GRID</p>
<p>There is nothing, never has been anything, quite like a busy
spaceport on the outskirts of a capital city of a populous planet. There
are the huge machines resting mightily in their cradles. If you choose
your time properly, there is the impressive sight of the sinking giant
dropping to rest or, more hair-raising still, the swiftening departure
of a bubble of steel. All processes involved are nearly noiseless. The
motive power is the silent surge of nucleons shifting into more compact
arrangements—</p>
<p>In terms of area, ninety-five percent of the port has just been
referred to. Square miles are reserved for the machines, and for the men
who serve them and for the calculators that serve both.</p>
<p>Only five percent of the port is given over to the floods of humanity
to whom it is the way station to all the stars of the Galaxy. It is
certain that very few of the anonymous many-headed stop to consider the
technological mesh that knits the spaceways. Perhaps some of them might
itch occasionally at the thought of the thousands of tons represented by
the sinking steel that looks so small off in the distance. One of those
cyclopean cylinders could, conceivably, miss the guiding beam and crash
half a mile from its expected landing point—through the glassite roof of
the immense waiting room perhaps—so that only a thin organic vapor and
some powdered phosphates would be left behind to mark the passing of a
thousand men.</p>
<p>It could never happen, however, with the safety devices in use; and
only the badly neurotic would consider the possibility for more than a
moment.</p>
<p>Then what do they think about? It is not just a crowd, you see. It is
a crowd with a purpose. That purpose hovers over the field and thickens
the atmosphere. Lines queue up; parents herd their children; baggage is
maneuvered in precise masses—people are going somewhere.</p>
<p>Consider then the complete psychic isolation of a single unit of this
terribly intent mob that does not know where to go; yet at the same time
feels more intensely than any of the others possibly can the necessity
of going somewhere, anywhere! Or almost anywhere!</p>
<p>Even lacking telepathy or any of the crudely definite methods of mind
touching mind, there is a sufficient clash in atmosphere, in intangible
mood, to suffice for despair.</p>
<p>To suffice? To overflow, and drench, and drown.</p>
<p>Arcadia Darell, dressed in borrowed clothes, standing on a borrowed
planet in a borrowed situation of what seemed even to be a borrowed
life, wanted earnestly the safety of the womb. She didn’t know that was
what she wanted. She only knew that the very openness of the open world
was a great danger. She wanted a closed spot somewhere—somewhere
far—somewhere in an unexplored nook of the universe—where no one would
ever look.</p>
<p>And there she was, age fourteen plus, weary enough for eighty plus,
frightened enough for five minus.</p>
<p>What stranger of the hundreds that brushed past her—actually brushed
past her, so that she could feel their touch—was a Second Foundationer?
What stranger could not help but instantly destroy her for her guilty
knowledge—her unique knowledge—of knowing where the Second Foundation
was?</p>
<p>And the voice that cut in on her was a thunderclap that iced the
scream in her throat into a voiceless slash.</p>
<p>“Look, miss,” it said, irritably, “are you using the ticket-machine
or are you just standing there?”</p>
<p>It was the first she realized that she was standing in front of a
ticket-machine. You put a high-denomination bill into the clipper which
sank out of sight. You pressed the button below your destination and a
ticket came out together with the correct change as determined by an
electronic scanning device that never made a mistake. It was a very
ordinary thing and there was no cause for anyone to stand before it for
five minutes.</p>
<p>Arcadia plunged a two-hundred credit into the clipper, and was
suddenly aware of the button labeled, “Trantor.” Trantor, dead capital
of the dead Empire—the planet on which she was born. She pressed it in a
dream. Nothing happened, except that the red letters flicked on and off,
reading 172.18—172.18—172.18—</p>
<p>It was the amount she was short. Another two-hundred credit. The
ticket was spit out toward her. It came loose when she touched it, and
the change tumbled out afterward.</p>
<p>She seized it and ran. She felt the man behind her pressing close,
anxious for his own chance at the machine, but she twisted out from
before him and did not look behind.</p>
<p>Yet there was nowhere to run. They were all her enemies.</p>
<p>Without quite realizing it, she was watching the gigantic, glowing
signs that puffed into the air: Steffani, Anacreon, Fermus— There was
even one that ballooned Terminus, and she longed for it, but did not
dare—</p>
<p>For a trifling sum, she could have hired a notifier which could have
been set for any destination she cared and which would, when placed in
her purse, make itself heard only to her, fifteen minutes before
take-off time. But such devices are for people who are reasonably
secure, however; who can pause to think of them.</p>
<p>And then, attempting to look both ways simultaneously, she ran
head-on into a soft abdomen. She felt the startled outbreath and grunt,
and a hand come down on her arm. She writhed desperately but lacked
breath to do more than mew a bit in the back of her throat.</p>
<p>Her captor held her firmly and waited. Slowly, he came into focus for
her and she managed to look at him. He was rather plump and rather
short. His hair was white and copious, being brushed back to give a
pompadour effect that looked strangely incongruous above a round and
ruddy face that shrieked its peasant origin.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” he said finally, with a frank and twinkling
curiosity. “You look scared.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” muttered Arcadia in a frenzy. “I’ve got to go. Pardon
me.”</p>
<p>But he disregarded that entirely, and said, “Watch out, little girl.
You’ll drop your ticket.” And he lifted it from her resistless white
fingers and looked at it with every evidence of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“I thought so,” he said, and then bawled in bull-like tones,
“Mommuh!”</p>
<p>A woman was instantly at his side, somewhat more short, somewhat more
round, somewhat more ruddy. She wound a finger about a stray gray lock
to shove it beneath a well-outmoded hat.</p>
<p>“Pappa,” she said, reprovingly, “why do you shout in a crowd like
that? People look at you like you were crazy. Do you think you are on
the farm?”</p>
<p>And she smiled sunnily at the unresponsive Arcadia, and added, “He
has manners like a bear.” Then, sharply, “Pappa, let go the little girl.
What are you doing?”</p>
<p>But Pappa simply waved the ticket at her. “Look,” he said, “she’s
going to Trantor.”</p>
<p>Mamma’s face was a sudden beam, “You’re from Trantor? Let go her arm,
I say, Pappa.” She turned the overstuffed valise she was carrying onto
its side and forced Arcadia to sit down with a gentle but unrelenting
pressure. “Sit down,” she said, “and rest your little feet. It will be
no ship yet for an hour and the benches are crowded with sleeping
loafers. You are from Trantor?”</p>
<p>Arcadia drew a deep breath and gave in. Huskily, she said, “I was
born there.”</p>
<p>And Mamma clapped her hands gleefully, “One month we’ve been here and
till now we met nobody from home. This is very nice. Your parents—” she
looked about vaguely.</p>
<p>“I’m not with my parents,” Arcadia said, carefully.</p>
<p>“All alone? A little girl like you?” Mamma was at once a blend of
indignation and sympathy, “How does that come to be?”</p>
<p>“Mamma,” Pappa plucked at her sleeve, “let me tell you. There’s
something wrong. I think she’s frightened.” His voice, though obviously
intended for a whisper, was quite plainly audible to Arcadia. “She was
running—I was watching her—and not looking where she was going. Before I
could step out of the way, she bumped into me. And you know what? I
think she’s in trouble.”</p>
<p>“So shut your mouth, Pappa. Into you, anybody could bump.” But she
joined Arcadia on the valise, which creaked wearily under the added
weight, and put an arm about the girl’s trembling shoulder. “You’re
running away from somebody, sweetheart? Don’t be afraid to tell me. I’ll
help you.”</p>
<p>Arcadia looked across at the kind gray eyes of the woman and felt her
lips quivering. One part of her brain was telling her that here were
people from Trantor, with whom she could go, who could help her remain
on that planet until she could decide what next to do, where next to go.
And another part of her brain, much the louder, was telling her in
jumbled incoherence that she did not remember her mother, that she was
weary to death of fighting the universe, that she wanted only to curl
into a little ball with strong, gentle arms about her, that if her
mother had lived, she might … she might—</p>
<p>And for the first time that night, she was crying; crying like a
little baby, and glad of it; clutching tightly at the old-fashioned
dress and dampening a corner of it thoroughly, while soft arms held her
closely and a gentle hand stroked her curls.</p>
<p>Pappa stood helplessly looking at the pair, fumbling futilely for a
handkerchief which, when produced, was snatched from his hand. Mamma
glared an admonition of quietness at him. The crowds surged about the
little group with the true indifference of disconnected crowds
everywhere. They were effectively alone.</p>
<p>Finally, the weeping trickled to a halt, and Arcadia smiled weakly as
she dabbed at red eyes with the borrowed handkerchief. “Golly,” she
whispered, “I—”</p>
<p>“Shhh. Shhh. Don’t talk,” said Mamma, fussily, “just sit and rest for
a while. Catch your breath. Then tell us what’s wrong, and you’ll see,
we’ll fix it up, and everything will be all right.”</p>
<p>Arcadia scrabbled what remained of her wits together. She could not
tell them the truth. She could tell nobody the truth—And yet she was too
worn to invent a useful lie.</p>
<p>She said, whisperingly, “I’m better, now.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Mamma. “Now tell me why you’re in trouble. You did
nothing wrong? Of course, whatever you did, we’ll help you; but tell us
the truth.”</p>
<p>“For a friend from Trantor, anything,” added Pappa, expansively, “eh,
Mamma?”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth, Pappa,” was the response, without rancor.</p>
<p>Arcadia was groping in her purse. That, at least, was still hers,
despite the rapid clothes-changing forced upon her in Lady Callia’s
apartments. She found what she was looking for and handed it to
Mamma.</p>
<p>“These are my papers,” she said, diffidently. It was shiny, synthetic
parchment which had been issued her by the Foundation’s ambassador on
the day of her arrival and which had been countersigned by the
appropriate Kalganian official. It was large, florid, and impressive.
Mamma looked at it helplessly, and passed it to Pappa, who absorbed its
contents with an impressive pursing of the lips.</p>
<p>He said, “You’re from the Foundation?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But I was born in Trantor. See, it says that—”</p>
<p>“Ah-hah. It looks all right to me. You’re named Arcadia, eh? That’s a
good Trantorian name. But where’s your uncle? It says here you came in
the company of Homir Munn, uncle.”</p>
<p>“He’s been arrested,” said Arcadia, drearily.</p>
<p>“Arrested!”—from the two of them at once. “What for?” asked Mamma.
“He did something?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I don’t know. We were just on a visit. Uncle
Homir had business with Lord Stettin but—” She needed no effort to act a
shudder. It was there.</p>
<p>Pappa was impressed. “With Lord Stettin. Mm-m-m, your uncle must be a
big man.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what it was all about, but Lord Stettin wanted me to
stay—” She was recalling the last words of Lady Callia, which had been
acted out for her benefit. Since Callia, as she now knew, was an expert,
the story could do for a second time.</p>
<p>She paused, and Mamma said interestedly, “And why you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. He … he wanted to have dinner with me all alone, but I
said no, because I wanted Uncle Homir along. He looked at me funny and
kept holding my shoulder.”</p>
<p>Pappa’s mouth was a little open, but Mamma was suddenly red and
angry. “How old are you, Arcadia?”</p>
<p>“Fourteen and a half, almost.”</p>
<p>Mamma drew a sharp breath and said, “That such people should be let
live. The dogs in the streets are better. You’re running from him, dear,
is not?”</p>
<p>Arcadia nodded.</p>
<p>Mamma said, “Pappa, go right to Information and find out exactly when
the ship to Trantor comes to berth. Hurry!”</p>
<p>But Pappa took one step and stopped. Loud metallic words were booming
overhead, and five thousand pairs of eyes looked startledly upwards.</p>
<p>“Men and women,” it said, with sharp force. “The airport is being
searched for a dangerous fugitive, and it is now surrounded. No one can
enter and no one can leave. The search will, however, be conducted with
great speed and no ships will reach or leave berth during the interval,
so you will not miss your ship. I repeat, no one will miss his ship. The
grid will descend. None of you will move outside your square until the
grid is removed, as otherwise we will be forced to use our neuronic
whips.”</p>
<p>During the minute or less in which the voice dominated the vast dome
of the spaceport’s waiting room, Arcadia could not have moved if all the
evil in the Galaxy had concentrated itself into a ball and hurled itself
at her.</p>
<p>They could mean only her. It was not even necessary to formulate that
idea as a specific thought. But why—</p>
<p>Callia had engineered her escape. And Callia was of the Second
Foundation. Why, then, the search now? Had Callia failed? Could Callia
fail? Or was this part of the plan, the intricacies of which escaped
her?</p>
<p>For a vertiginous moment, she wanted to jump up and shout that she
gave up, that she would go with them, that … that—</p>
<p>But Mamma’s hand was on her wrist. “Quick! Quick! We’ll go to the
ladies room before they start.”</p>
<p>Arcadia did not understand. She merely followed blindly. They oozed
through the crowd, frozen as it was into clumps, with the voice still
booming through its last words.</p>
<p>The grid was descending now, and Pappa, open-mouthed, watched it come
down. He had heard of it and read of it, but had never actually been the
object of it. It glimmered in the air, simply a series of cross-hatched
and tight radiation-beams that set the air aglow in a harmless network
of flashing light.</p>
<p>It always was so arranged as to descend slowly from above in order
that it might represent a falling net with all the terrific
psychological implications of entrapment.</p>
<p>It was at waist-level now, ten feet between glowing lines in each
direction. In his own hundred square feet, Pappa found himself alone,
yet the adjoining squares were crowded. He felt himself conspicuously
isolated but knew that to move into the greater anonymity of a group
would have meant crossing one of those glowing lines, stirring an alarm,
and bringing down the neuronic whip.</p>
<p>He waited.</p>
<p>He could make out, over the heads of the eerily quiet and waiting
mob, the far-off stir that was the line of policemen covering the vast
floor area, lighted square by lighted square.</p>
<p>It was a long time before a uniform stepped into his square and
carefully noted its co-ordinates into an official notebook.</p>
<p>“Papers!”</p>
<p>Pappa handed them over, and they were flipped through in expert
fashion.</p>
<p>“You’re Preem Palver, native of Trantor, on Kalgan for a month,
returning to Trantor. Answer, yes or no.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>
<p>“What’s your business on Kalgan?”</p>
<p>“I’m trading representative of our farm co-operative. I’ve been
negotiating terms with the Department of Agriculture on Kalgan.”</p>
<p>“Um-m-m. Your wife is with you? Where is she? She is mentioned in
your papers.”</p>
<p>“Please. My wife is in the—” He pointed.</p>
<p>“Hanto,” roared the policeman. Another uniform joined him.</p>
<p>The first one said, dryly, “Another dame in the can, by the Galaxy.
The place must be busting with them. Write down her name.” He indicated
the entry in the papers which gave it.</p>
<p>“Anyone else with you?”</p>
<p>“My niece.”</p>
<p>“She’s not mentioned in the papers.”</p>
<p>“She came separately.”</p>
<p>“Where is she? Never mind, I know. Write down the niece’s name, too,
Hanto. What’s her name? Write down Arcadia Palver. You stay right here,
Palver. We’ll take care of the women before we leave.”</p>
<p>Pappa waited interminably. And then, long, long after, Mamma was
marching toward him, Arcadia’s hand firmly in hers, the two policemen
trailing behind her.</p>
<p>They entered Pappa’s square, and one said, “Is this noisy old woman
your wife?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” said Pappa, placatingly.</p>
<p>“Then you’d better tell her she’s liable to get into trouble if she
talks the way she does to the First Citizen’s police.” He straightened
his shoulders angrily. “Is this your niece?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“I want her papers.”</p>
<p>Looking straight at her husband, Mamma slightly, but no less firmly,
shook her head.</p>
<p>A short pause, and Pappa said with a weak smile, “I don’t think I can
do that.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you can’t do that?” The policeman thrust out a hard
palm. “Hand it over.”</p>
<p>“Diplomatic immunity,” said Pappa, softly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I said I was trading representative of my farm co-operative. I’m
accredited to the Kalganian government as an official foreign
representative and my papers prove it. I showed them to you and now I
don’t want to be bothered anymore.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the policeman was taken aback. “I’ve got to see your
papers. It’s orders.”</p>
<p>“You go away,” broke in Mamma, suddenly. “When we want you, we’ll
send for you, you … you bum.”</p>
<p>The policeman’s lips tightened. “Keep your eye on them, Hanto. I’ll
get the lieutenant.”</p>
<p>“Break a leg!” called Mamma after him. Someone laughed, and then
choked it off suddenly.</p>
<p>The search was approaching its end. The crowd was growing dangerously
restless. Forty-five minutes had elapsed since the grid had started
falling and that is too long for best effects. Lieutenant Dirige
threaded his way hastily, therefore, toward the dense center of the
mob.</p>
<p>“Is this the girl?” he asked wearily. He looked at her and she
obviously fitted the description. All this for a child.</p>
<p>He said, “Her papers, if you please?”</p>
<p>Pappa began, “I have already explained—”</p>
<p>“I know what you have explained, and I’m sorry,” said the lieutenant,
“but I have my orders, and I can’t help them. If you care to make a
protest later, you may. Meanwhile, if necessary, I must use force.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, and the lieutenant waited patiently.</p>
<p>Then Pappa said, huskily, “Give me your papers, Arcadia.”</p>
<p>Arcadia shook her head in panic, but Pappa nodded his head. “Don’t be
afraid. Give them to me.”</p>
<p>Helplessly she reached out and let the documents change hands. Pappa
fumbled them open and looked carefully through them, then handed them
over. The lieutenant in his turn looked through them carefully. For a
long moment, he raised his eyes to rest them on Arcadia, and then he
closed the booklet with a sharp snap.</p>
<p>“All in order,” he said. “All right, men.”</p>
<p>He left, and in two minutes, scarcely more, the grid was gone, and
the voice above signified a back-to-normal. The noise of the crowd,
suddenly released, rose high.</p>
<p>Arcadia said: “How … how—”</p>
<p>Pappa said, “Sh-h. Don’t say a word. Let’s better go to the ship. It
should be in the berth soon.”</p>
<p>They were on the ship. They had a private stateroom and a table to
themselves in the dining room. Two light-years already separated them
from Kalgan, and Arcadia finally dared to broach the subject again.</p>
<p>She said, “But they were after me, Mr. Palver, and they must have had
my description and all the details. Why did he let me go?”</p>
<p>And Pappa smiled broadly over his roast beef. “Well, Arcadia, child,
it was easy. When you’ve been dealing with agents and buyers and
competing co-operatives, you learn some of the tricks. I’ve had twenty
years or more to learn them in. You see, child, when the lieutenant
opened your papers, he found a five-hundred-credit bill inside, folded
up small. Simple, no?”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you back— Honest, I’ve got lots of money.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Pappa’s broad face broke into an embarrassed smile, as he
waved it away. “For a countrywoman—”</p>
<p>Arcadia desisted. “But what if he’d taken the money and turned me in
anyway. And accused me of bribery.”</p>
<p>“And give up five hundred credits? I know these people better than
you do, girl.”</p>
<p>But Arcadia knew that he did not know people better. Not these
people. In her bed that night, she considered carefully, and knew that
no bribe would have stopped a police lieutenant in the matter of
catching her unless that had been planned. They didn’t want to catch
her, yet had made every motion of doing so, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Why? To make sure she left? And for Trantor? Were the obtuse and
soft-hearted couple she was with now only a pair of tools in the hands
of the Second Foundation, as helpless as she herself?</p>
<p>They must be!</p>
<p>Or were they?</p>
<p>It was all so useless. How could she fight them? Whatever she did, it
might only be what those terrible omnipotents wanted her to do.</p>
<p>Yet she had to outwit them. Had to. Had to! Had to!!</p>
