<h4 id="section">2</h4>
<p>TWO MEN WITHOUT THE MULE</p>
<p>The ship was in near-readiness. Nothing lacked, but the destination.
The Mule had suggested a return to Trantor—the world that was the hulk
of an incomparable Galactic metropolis of the hugest Empire mankind had
ever known—the dead world that had been capital of all the stars.</p>
<p>Pritcher disapproved. It was an old path—sucked dry.</p>
<p>He found Bail Channis in the ship’s navigation room. The young man’s
curly hair was just sufficiently disheveled to allow a single curl to
droop over the forehead—as if it had been carefully placed there—and
even teeth showed in a smile that matched it. Vaguely, the stiff officer
felt himself harden against the other.</p>
<p>Channis’ excitement was evident, “Pritcher, it’s too far a
coincidence.”</p>
<p>The general said coldly: “I’m not aware of the subject of
conversation.”</p>
<p>“Oh— Well, then drag up a chair, old man, and let’s get into it. I’ve
been going over your notes. I find them excellent.”</p>
<p>“How … pleasant that you do.”</p>
<p>“But I’m wondering if you’ve come to the conclusions I have. Have you
ever tried analyzing the problem deductively? I mean, it’s all very well
to comb the stars at random, and to have done all you did in five
expeditions is quite a bit of star-hopping. That’s obvious. But have you
calculated how long it would take to go through every known world at
this rate?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Several times.” Pritcher felt no urge to meet the young man
halfway, but there was the importance of filching the other’s mind—the
other’s uncontrolled, and hence, unpredictable, mind.</p>
<p>“Well, then, suppose we’re analytical about it and try to decide just
what we’re looking for?”</p>
<p>“The Second Foundation,” said Pritcher, grimly.</p>
<p>“A Foundation of psychologists,” corrected Channis, “who are as weak
in physical science as the First Foundation was weak in psychology.
Well, you’re from the First Foundation, which I’m not. The implications
are probably obvious to you. We must find a world which rules by virtue
of mental skills, and yet which is very backwards scientifically.”</p>
<p>“Is that necessarily so?” questioned Pritcher, quietly. “Our own
‘Union of Worlds’ isn’t backwards scientifically, even though our ruler
owes his strength to his mental powers.”</p>
<p>“Because he has the skills of the First Foundation to draw upon,”
came the slightly impatient answer, “and that is the only such reservoir
of knowledge in the Galaxy. The Second Foundation must live among the
dry crumbs of the broken Galactic empire. There are no pickings
there.”</p>
<p>“So then you postulate mental power sufficient to establish their
rule over a group of worlds and physical helplessness as well?”</p>
<p>“Comparative physical helplessness. Against the decadent neighboring
areas, they are competent to defend themselves. Against the resurgent
forces of the Mule, with his background of a mature nuclear economy,
they cannot stand. Else, why is their location so well-hidden, both at
the start by the founder, Hari Seldon, and now by themselves? Your own
First Foundation made no secret of its existence and did not have it
made for them, when they were an undefended single city on a lonely
planet three hundred years ago.”</p>
<p>The smooth lines of Pritcher’s dark face twitched sardonically. “And
now that you’ve finished your deep analysis, would you like a list of
all the kingdoms, republics, planet states, and dictatorships of one
sort or another in that political wilderness out there that correspond
to your description and to several factors besides?”</p>
<p>“All this has been considered then?” Channis lost none of his
brashness.</p>
<p>“You won’t find it here, naturally, but we have a completely worked
out guide to the political units of the Opposing Periphery. Really, did
you suppose the Mule would work entirely hit-and-miss?”</p>
<p>“Well, then,” and the young man’s voice rose in a burst of energy,
“what of the Oligarchy of Tazenda?”</p>
<p>Pritcher touched his ear thoughtfully, “Tazenda? Oh, I think I know
it. They’re not in the Periphery, are they? It seems to me they’re fully
a third of the way toward the center of the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Yes. What of that?”</p>
<p>“The records we have place the Second Foundation at the other end of
the Galaxy. Space knows it’s the only thing we have to go on. Why talk
of Tazenda anyway? Its angular deviation from the First Foundation
radian is only about one hundred ten to one hundred twenty degrees
anyway. Nowhere near one hundred eighty.”</p>
<p>“There’s another point in the records. The Second Foundation was
established at ‘Star’s End.’”</p>
<p>“No such region in the Galaxy has ever been located.”</p>
<p>“Because it was a local name, suppressed later for greater secrecy.
Or maybe one invented for the purpose by Seldon and his group. Yet
there’s some relationship between ‘Star’s End’ and ‘Tazenda,’ don’t you
think?”</p>
<p>“A vague similarity in sound? Insufficient.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever been there?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Yet it is mentioned in your records.”</p>
<p>“Where? Oh, yes, but that was merely to take on food and water. There
was certainly nothing remarkable about the world.”</p>
<p>“Did you land at the ruling planet? The center of government?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t possibly say.”</p>
<p>Channis brooded about it under the other’s cold gaze. Then, “Would
you look at the Lens with me for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>The Lens was perhaps the newest feature of the interstellar cruisers
of the day. Actually, it was a complicated computer which could throw on
a screen a reproduction of the night sky as seen from any given point of
the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Channis adjusted the co-ordinate points and the wall lights of the
pilot room were extinguished. In the dim red light at the control board
of the Lens, Channis’ face glowed ruddily. Pritcher sat in the pilot
seat, long legs crossed, face lost in the gloom.</p>
<p>Slowly, as the induction period passed, the points of light
brightened on the screen. And then they were thick and bright with the
generously populated star-groupings nearer the Galaxy’s center.</p>
<p>“This,” explained Channis, “is the winter night sky as seen from
Trantor. That is the important point that, as far as I know, has been
neglected so far in your search. All intelligent orientation must start
from Trantor as zero point. Trantor was the capital of the Galactic
Empire. Even more so scientifically and culturally than politically.
And, therefore, the significance of any descriptive name should stem,
nine times out of ten, from a Trantorian orientation. You’ll remember in
this connection that, although Seldon was from Helicon, toward the
Periphery, his group worked on Trantor itself.”</p>
<p>“What is it you’re trying to show me?” Pritcher’s level voice plunged
icily into the gathering enthusiasm of the other.</p>
<p>“The map will explain it. Do you see the dark nebula?” The shadow of
his arm fell upon the screen, which took on the bespanglement of the
Galaxy. The pointing finger ended on a tiny patch of black that seemed a
hole in the speckled fabric of light. “The stellagraphical records call
it Pellot’s Nebula. Watch it. I’m going to expand the image.”</p>
<p>Pritcher had watched the phenomenon of Lens Image expansion before
but he still caught his breath. It was like being at the visiplate of a
spaceship storming through a horribly crowded Galaxy without entering
hyperspace. The stars diverged toward them from a common center, flared
outwards and tumbled off the edge of the screen. Single points became
double, then globular. Hazy patches dissolved into myriad points. And
always that illusion of motion.</p>
<p>Channis spoke through it all, “You’ll notice that we are moving along
the direct line from Trantor to Pellot’s Nebula, so that in effect we
are still looking at a stellar orientation equivalent to that of
Trantor. There is probably a slight error because of the gravitic
deviation of light that I haven’t the math to calculate for, but I’m
sure it can’t be significant.”</p>
<p>The darkness was spreading over the screen. As the rate of
magnification slowed, the stars slipped off the four ends of the screen
in a regretful leave-taking. At the rims of the growing Nebula, the
brilliant universe of stars shone abruptly in token for that light which
was merely hidden behind the swirling unradiating atom fragments of
sodium and calcium that filled cubic parsecs of space.</p>
<p>And Channis pointed again, “This has been called ‘The Mouth’ by the
inhabitants of that region of space. And that is significant because it
is only from the Trantorian orientation that it looks like a mouth.”
What he indicated was a rift in the body of the Nebula, shaped like a
ragged, grinning mouth in profile, outlined by the blazing glory of the
starlight with which it was filled.</p>
<p>“Follow ‘The Mouth,’” said Channis. “Follow ‘The Mouth’ toward the
gullet as it narrows down to a thin, splintering line of light.”</p>
<p>Again the screen expanded a trifle, until the Nebula stretched away
from “The Mouth” to block off all the screen but that narrow trickle and
Channis’ finger silently followed it down, to where it straggled to a
halt, and then, as his finger continued moving onward, to a spot where
one single star sparked lonesomely; and there his finger halted, for
beyond that was blackness, unrelieved.</p>
<p>“ ‘Star’s End,’ ” said the young man, simply. “The fabric of the
Nebula is thin there and the light of that one star finds its way
through in just that one direction—to shine on Trantor.”</p>
<p>“You’re trying to tell me that—” the voice of the Mule’s general died
in suspicion.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying. That is Tazenda—Star’s End.”</p>
<p>The lights went on. The Lens flicked off. Pritcher reached Channis in
three long strides, “What made you think of this?”</p>
<p>And Channis leaned back in his chair with a queerly puzzled
expression on his face. “It was accidental. I’d like to take
intellectual credit for this, but it was only accidental. In any case,
however it happens, it fits. According to our references, Tazenda is an
oligarchy. It rules twenty-seven inhabited planets. It is not advanced
scientifically. And most of all, it is an obscure world that has adhered
to a strict neutrality in the local politics of that stellar region, and
is not expansionist. I think we ought to see it.”</p>
<p>“Have you informed the Mule of this?”</p>
<p>“No. Nor shall we. We’re in space now, about to make the first
hop.”</p>
<p>Pritcher, in sudden horror, sprang to the visiplate. Cold space met
his eyes when he adjusted it. He gazed fixedly at the view, then turned.
Automatically, his hand reached for the hard, comfortable curve of the
butt of his blaster.</p>
<p>“By whose order?”</p>
<p>“By my order, general”—it was the first time Channis had ever used
the other’s title—“while I was engaging you here. You probably felt no
acceleration, because it came at the moment I was expanding the field of
the Lens and you undoubtedly imagined it to be an illusion of the
apparent star motion.”</p>
<p>“Why? Just what are you doing? What was the point of your nonsense
about Tazenda, then?”</p>
<p>“That was no nonsense. I was completely serious. We’re going there.
We left today because we were scheduled to leave three days from now.
General, you don’t believe there is a Second Foundation, and I do. You
are merely following the Mule’s orders without faith; I recognize a
serious danger. The Second Foundation has now had five years to prepare.
How they’ve prepared, I don’t know, but what if they have agents on
Kalgan? If I carry about in my mind the knowledge of the whereabouts of
the Second Foundation, they may discover that. My life might be no
longer safe, and I have a great affection for my life. Even on a thin
and remote possibility such as that, I would rather play safe. So no one
knows of Tazenda but you, and you found out only after we were out in
space. And even so, there is the question of the crew.” Channis was
smiling again, ironically, in obviously complete control of the
situation.</p>
<p>Pritcher’s hand fell away from his blaster, and for a moment a vague
discomfort pierced him. What kept him from action? What deadened him?
There was a time when he was a rebellious and unpromoted captain of the
First Foundation’s commercial empire, when it would have been himself
rather than Channis who would have taken prompt and daring action such
as that. Was the Mule right? Was his controlled mind so concerned with
obedience as to lose initiative? He felt a thickening despondency drive
him down into a strange lassitude.</p>
<p>He said, “Well done! However, you will consult me in the future
before making decisions of this nature.”</p>
<p>The flickering signal caught his attention.</p>
<p>“That’s the engine room,” said Channis, casually. “They warmed up on
five minutes’ notice and I asked them to let me know if there was any
trouble. Want to hold the fort?”</p>
<p>Pritcher nodded mutely, and cogitated in the sudden loneliness on the
evils of approaching fifty. The visiplate was sparsely starred. The main
body of the Galaxy misted one end. What if he were free of the Mule’s
influence—</p>
<p>But he recoiled in horror at the thought.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Huxlani looked sharply at the young, ununiformed man
who carried himself with the assurance of a Fleet officer and seemed to
be in a position of authority. Huxlani, as a regular Fleet man from the
days his chin had dripped milk, generally confused authority with
specific insignia.</p>
<p>But the Mule had appointed this man, and the Mule was, of course, the
last word. The only word, for that matter. Not even subconsciously did
he question that. Emotional control went deep.</p>
<p>He handed Channis the little oval object without a word.</p>
<p>Channis hefted it, and smiled engagingly.</p>
<p>“You’re a Foundation man, aren’t you, chief?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I served in the Foundation Fleet eighteen years before the
First Citizen took over.”</p>
<p>“Foundation training in engineering?”</p>
<p>“Qualified Technician, First Class—Central School on Anacreon.”</p>
<p>“Good enough. And you found this on the communication circuit, where
I asked you to look?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Does it belong there?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Then what is it?”</p>
<p>“A hyper-relay, sir.”</p>
<p>“That’s not enough. I’m not a Foundation man. What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a device to allow the ship to be traced through
hyperspace.”</p>
<p>“In other words we can be followed anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“All right. This version is a recent improvement, isn’t it? It was
developed by one of the Research Institutes set up by the First Citizen,
wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I believe so, sir.”</p>
<p>“And its workings are a government secret. Right?”</p>
<p>“I believe so, sir.”</p>
<p>“Yet here it is. Intriguing.”</p>
<p>Channis tossed the hyper-relay methodically from hand to hand for a
few seconds. Then, sharply, he held it out, “Take it, then, and put it
back exactly where you found it and exactly how you found it.
Understand? And then forget this incident. Entirely!”</p>
<p>The chief choked down his near-automatic salute, turned sharply, and
left.</p>
<p>The ship bounded through the Galaxy, its path a wide-spaced dotted
line through the stars. The dots referred to were the scant stretches of
ten to sixty light-seconds spent in normal space and between them
stretched gaps of many parsecs that represented the Jumps through
hyperspace.</p>
<p>Bail Channis sat at the control panel of the Lens and felt again the
involuntary surge of near-worship at the contemplation of it. He was not
a Foundation man and the interplay of forces at the twist of a knob or
the breaking of a contact was not second nature to him.</p>
<p>Not that the Lens ought quite to bore even a Foundation man. Within
its unbelievably compact body were enough electronic circuits to
pinpoint accurately a hundred million separate stars in exact
relationship to each other. And as if that were not a feat in itself, it
was further capable of translating any given portion of the Galactic
Field along any of the three spatial axes or of rotating any portion of
the Field about a center.</p>
<p>It was because of that, that the Lens had performed a near-revolution
in interstellar travel. In the younger days of interstellar travel, the
calculation of each Jump through hyperspace meant any amount of work
from a day to a week—and the larger portion of such work was the more or
less precise calculation of “Ship’s Position” on the Galactic scale of
reference. Essentially that meant the accurate observation of at least
three widely-spaced stars, the positions of which, with reference to the
arbitrary Galactic triple-zero, were known.</p>
<p>And it is the word “known,” that is the catch. To any who know the
star field well from one certain reference point, stars are as
individual as people. Jump ten parsecs, however, and not even your own
sun is recognizable. It may not even be visible.</p>
<p>The answer was, of course, spectroscopic analysis. For centuries, the
main object of interstellar engineering was the analysis of the “light
signature” of more and more stars in greater and greater detail. With
this, and the growing precision of the Jump itself, standard routes of
travel through the Galaxy were adopted and interstellar travel became
less of an art and more of a science.</p>
<p>And yet, even under the Foundation with improved computers and a new
method of mechanically scanning the star field for a known “light
signature,” it sometimes took days to locate three stars and then
calculate position in regions not previously familiar to the pilot.</p>
<p>It was the Lens that changed all that. For one thing it required only
a single known star. For another, even a space tyro such as Channis
could operate it.</p>
<p>The nearest sizable star at the moment was Vincetori, according to
Jump calculations, and on the visiplate now, a bright star was centered.
Channis hoped that it was Vincetori.</p>
<p>The field screen of the Lens was thrown directly next to that of the
visiplate and with careful fingers, Channis punched out the co-ordinates
of Vincetori. He closed a relay, and the star field sprang to bright
view. In it, too, a bright star was centered, but otherwise there seemed
no relationship. He adjusted the Lens along the Z-Axis and expanded the
Field to where the photometer showed both centered stars to be of equal
brightness.</p>
<p>Channis looked for a second star, sizably bright, on the visiplate
and found one on the field screen to correspond. Slowly, he rotated the
screen to similar angular deflection. He twisted his mouth and rejected
the result with a grimace. Again he rotated and another bright star was
brought into position, and a third. And then he grinned. That did it.
Perhaps a specialist with trained relationship perception might have
clicked first try, but he’d settle for three.</p>
<p>That was the adjustment. In the final step, the two fields overlapped
and merged into a sea of not-quite-rightness. Most of the stars were
close doubles. But the fine adjustment did not take long. The double
stars melted together, one field remained, and the “Ship’s Position”
could now be read directly off the dials. The entire procedure had taken
less than half an hour.</p>
<p>Channis found Han Pritcher in his private quarters. The general was
quite apparently preparing for bed. He looked up.</p>
<p>“News?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly. We’ll be at Tazenda in another hop.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to bother you if you’re turning in, but have you looked
through the film we picked up in Cil?”</p>
<p>Han Pritcher cast a disparaging look at the article in question,
where it lay in its black case upon his low bookshelf, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“And what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I think that if there was ever any science to History, it has been
quite lost in this region of the Galaxy.”</p>
<p>Channis grinned broadly, “I know what you mean. Rather barren, isn’t
it?”</p>
<p>“Not if you enjoy personal chronicles of rulers. Probably unreliable,
I should say, in both directions. Where history concerns mainly
personalities, the drawings become either black or white according to
the interests of the writer. I find it all remarkably useless.”</p>
<p>“But there is talk about Tazenda. That’s the point I tried to make
when I gave you the film. It’s the only one I could find that even
mentioned them.”</p>
<p>“All right. They have good rulers and bad. They’ve conquered a few
planets, won some battles, lost a few. There is nothing distinctive
about them. I don’t think much of your theory, Channis.”</p>
<p>“But you’ve missed a few points. Didn’t you notice that they never
formed coalitions? They always remained completely outside the politics
of this corner of the star swarm. As you say, they conquered a few
planets, but then they stopped—and that without any startling defeat of
consequence. It’s just as if they spread out enough to protect
themselves, but not enough to attract attention.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” came the unemotional response. “I have no objection to
landing. At the worst—a little lost time.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. At the worst—complete defeat. If it is the Second
Foundation. Remember, it would be a world of space-knows-how-many
Mules.”</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do?”</p>
<p>“Land on some minor subject planet. Find out as much as we can about
Tazenda first, then improvise from that.”</p>
<p>“All right. No objection. If you don’t mind now, I would like the
light out.”</p>
<p>Channis left with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>And in the darkness of a tiny room in an island of driving metal lost
in the vastness of space, General Han Pritcher remained awake, following
the thoughts that led him through such fantastic reaches.</p>
<p>If everything he had so painfully decided were true—and how all the
facts were beginning to fit—then Tazenda was the Second Foundation.
There was no way out. But how? How?</p>
<p>Could it be Tazenda? An ordinary world? One without distinction? A
slum lost amid the wreckage of an Empire? A splinter among the
fragments? He remembered, as from a distance, the Mule’s shriveled face
and his thin voice as he used to speak of the old Foundation
psychologist, Ebling Mis, the one man who had—maybe—learned the secret
of the Second Foundation.</p>
<p>Pritcher recalled the tension of the Mule’s words: “It was as if
astonishment had overwhelmed Mis. It was as though something about the
Second Foundation had surpassed all his expectations, had driven in a
direction completely different from what he might have assumed. If I
could only have read his thoughts rather than his emotions. Yet the
emotions were plain—and above everything else was this vast
surprise.”</p>
<p>Surprise was the keynote. Something supremely astonishing! And now
came this boy, this grinning youngster, glibly joyful about Tazenda and
its undistinguished subnormality. And he had to be right. He had to.
Otherwise, nothing made sense.</p>
<p>Pritcher’s last conscious thought had a touch of grimness. That
hypertracer along the Etheric tube was still there. He had checked it
one hour back, with Channis well out of the way.</p>
<p>SECOND INTERLUDE</p>
<p>It was a casual meeting in the anteroom of the Council Chamber—just a
few moments before passing into the Chamber to take up the business of
the day—and the few thoughts flashed back and forth quickly.</p>
<p>“So the Mule is on his way.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I hear, too. Risky! Mighty risky!”</p>
<p>“Not if affairs adhere to the functions set up.”</p>
<p>“The Mule is not an ordinary man—and it is difficult to manipulate
his chosen instruments without detection by him. The controlled minds
are difficult to touch. They say he’s caught on to a few cases.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I don’t see how that can be avoided.”</p>
<p>“Uncontrolled minds are easier. But so few are in positions of
authority under him—”</p>
<p>They entered the Chamber. Others of the Second Foundation followed
them.</p>
