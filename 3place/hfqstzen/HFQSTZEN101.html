<h4 id="what-to-do-when-youre-feeling-distracted-at-work">4 What to Do
When You’re Feeling Distracted at Work</h4>
<p>By Amy Gallo</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s so much going on in your life, and in the world,
that you can’t focus. What can you do when every time you sit down at
your desk, you feel distracted? How can you get back to feeling focused
and productive?</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>Feeling distracted and unproductive is something most people struggle
with, says Susan David, founder of the Harvard/McLean Institute of
Coaching and author of Emotional Agility.1 This is especially true
because most of us are constantly bombarded by news alerts, text
messages, and other interruptions. And even on days when you might feel
industrious, you have to contend with what’s going on with your
coworkers. “We very subtly pick up on others’ behaviors and emotions,”
David says.2 “When this happens, we can start to lose our way.” Rich
Fernandez, CEO of the nonprofit Search Inside Yourself Leadership
Institute, a global mindfulness and emotional intelligence training
organization, notes that we’re actually wired this way. “One thing we
all have in common is a fundamental neuroanatomy that orients us toward
stress that isn’t always productive,” he explains. To overcome this and
regain your focus, take the following eight steps.</p>
<p>Understand the dangers of multitasking</p>
<p>Start by understanding the impact that distractions, like a
constantly pinging phone or quick Twitter break, have on your brain.
Fernandez explains that we have a network of brain structures related to
focus.3 There’s the default mode network, which is responsible for
analyzing the past, forecasting or planning for the future, and
reflecting on oneself and others. “We’re in this mode at least half of
the time,” he says. But when you need to focus your mind, you tap into
the direct attention network, which allows you to put aside ruminations
and stay on task. Distractions, in whatever form they take, pull you
back into default mode, and the cognitive cost of regaining your focus
is high.4 “Some research shows it can take ten to eighteen minutes to
get the same level of attention back,” Fernandez says.5 This is why it’s
critical to reduce interruptions.</p>
<p>Allow for your emotional response, but stay in charge</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed can bring up a lot of emotions—frustration,
anger, anxiety—that take a further toll on your productivity. So you
have to break the cycle, David says. To regain a sense of agency, so you
don’t feel “at the mercy of the events going on in the world or in your
office,” she suggests labeling your feelings and then asking yourself
questions about them.6 You might say, “OK, I’m feeling angry, but who’s
in charge—the anger or me, the person having the emotion?” Fernandez
agrees with this approach: “You want to acknowledge that these feelings
are there—they’re legitimate and significant—but not get swept away by
them.”</p>
<p>Gather your attention</p>
<p>When you do find yourself distracted, Fernandez says, “Pause, take
stock, be aware that you’re being triggered. Then switch the spotlight
of your attention.” This might feel easier said than done, but remind
yourself that most of the things we worry about “aren’t immediate
existential threats.” To reconnect with the logical part of your brain,
focus it on “something more immediate or visceral, like your breath.”
You might say to yourself, “I’ve become consumed by this Twitter thread.
I’m going to pay attention to my breathing” to pivot away from what’s
causing the anxiety.7 Fernandez says this isn’t the same as trying to
ignore the distraction: “You don’t have to stifle it or suppress it.
Make note of it, acknowledge it, and put it in a mental parking lot to
think about later, when you can discuss it with someone else, or when
you’re not at work and have lots to do.”</p>
<p>Rely on your values</p>
<p>Once you’ve gathered your attention, you can choose where to focus
it. David says that concentrating on your values gives you a sense of
control. “When you’re overwhelmed, it feels like a lot of power and
choices are being taken away from you,” she says. “But you still get to
choose who you want to be. If one of your core values is to be
collaborative, focus on that. How can you help people feel like part of
the team?” And consider how your lack of focus is affecting your sense
of self. “If fairness is important to you, how is your distraction
contributing to your ability to be fair? If you’re on Facebook for three
hours a day, how fair is that to your team or your family?”</p>
<p>Put up boundaries</p>
<p>Once you have more awareness about what distracts you, set rules for
yourself. If you realize that checking news in the morning means that
you’re upset and unfocused when you get to the office, tell yourself
that you won’t catch up on world events until lunchtime.8 Or you can
decide that you’re going to get a certain amount of work done before you
go on Facebook. If you don’t have the self-control for this, there are
apps you can install in your browsers or on your phone to control how
much time you spend on particular sites. You also have to practice.
“There’s a lot of research that suggests the difference between elite
focus and non-elite focus is deliberate focus,” Fernandez says.9 He
points to athletes who train by telling themselves, for example, “I’m
not going to leave the free-throw line until I make 10 free throws.” So
spend time training your brain to stay on task.</p>
<p>Choose whom you interact with wisely</p>
<p>Social contagion is real. “We’ve all had that experience when you go
into an elevator and everyone is looking at their cell phones, so you
start looking at yours,” David says. She points to recent research that
shows that if someone next to you on an airplane buys candy—even if you
don’t know the person—you’re 30% more likely to make a similar
purchase.10 The same goes for productivity.11 If you have colleagues who
are constantly distracted themselves or who tend to pull you away from
work, try to spend less time with them. You don’t have to be rude; you
can say something simple like, “Can we continue this conversation later?
I want to get this report done and then I can take a break.”</p>
<p>Support and be supported by your colleagues</p>
<p>Instead of avoiding your distracted colleagues, you could try to
encourage each other to stay focused. Make a pact with your coworkers.
Set up a time where you will work without interrupting each other or
without getting on social media or workplace messaging app Slack. The
team I work with at HBR designated Thursday afternoons as uninterrupted
work time after listening to a podcast about this.12 You can take this
collegial support one step further and actively support each other.
“Your peers are in the trenches with you and they can relate because
they’re in the same culture and organization,” Fernandez says. Go out to
coffee with a coworker and “ask for advice, counsel, and coaching.” They
may have tactics that have worked for them that you haven’t thought of.
Make a commitment to each other that you’re going to change your
behavior and check in regularly on your progress. When you tell someone
else that you want to reform your ways, you’re more likely to follow
through.13</p>
<p>Take care of your body</p>
<p>If you’re tired and worn out, you’re going to be more vulnerable to
feeling overwhelmed, David says. It’s important to get enough sleep and
exercise. Also, she suggests making “tiny tweaks in your environment”
that improve your well-being.14 Take breaks, eat a healthy lunch, put
your phone on silent. “If you normally spend your lunch hour on
Facebook, leave your phone behind and go outside for a walk instead,”
she says.</p>
<p>Principles to remember</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Use breathing to break the immediate cycle of anxiety and frustration
with being distracted.</p>
<p>Think about how you want to act as a colleague and a leader, and let
that self-image guide your behavior.</p>
<p>Set boundaries around when you’ll go on social media or check
email.</p>
<p>Don’t:</p>
<p>Fool yourself into thinking distractions aren’t harmful to your
focus—they have high cognitive costs.</p>
<p>Spend time with people who are distracted. You’re likely to end up
feeling the same way.</p>
<p>Neglect self-care. Instead, take breaks, eat healthily, and get
enough sleep.</p>
<p>Case study #1: Schedule time to focus</p>
<p>Over the past year, Emily Lin, a vice president at a financial
services company, had a lot on her plate. She was building her private
coaching practice and had received a promotion at work. Because of the
expanded scope of her responsibilities, she was dealing with a whole
host of new distractions. “I got so many more emails, instant messages,
and phone calls. And people were coming by my office much more
frequently,” she says.</p>
<p>Emily was having trouble getting her work done. “I would see all
these instant messages or email alerts popping up, and even if it just
took a few seconds to read them or send a quick response, it would take
me away from what I was doing,” she says. And it was affecting her mood.
“Certain messages would stress me out. I was becoming very
short-tempered with my coworkers.”</p>
<p>She had previously learned to set boundaries for herself around
social media by scheduling in time for distractions. “I gave myself
pockets of time when I could go on Facebook. It might be a 10-minute
break between meetings or while I was waiting for the elevator to go to
lunch. Once I baked those breaks in, I found it a lot easier to control
the impulse to check social media while I was working,” she
explains.</p>
<p>She did something similar to address the work interruptions: she
allowed herself time to read and respond to messages, but only after
getting her most important work completed. “At the beginning of each
week, I ask myself, ‘What are the most critical things I have to
complete?’ And each day, I ask, ‘Today, what is the one thing I
absolutely have to do?’” She says that helped her determine how much
time she needed to focus, and then she would block that time out in
two-hour chunks. “For a two-hour window, I turn off email, put ‘do not
disturb’ on instant messenger, and send my phone directly to voicemail.”
She would even put on headphones as a way to signal to would-be visitors
that she was busy.</p>
<p>Two hours seems to be the right amount of time, she says. It gives
her enough time to get deeply involved in a task, and it’s a “tolerable
amount of time to be unreachable,” she says. “After that, people start
to call back or email again.” Plus, it gives her a sense of urgency. “I
have the adrenaline to get things done.”</p>
<p>Emily says this approach has worked: “It’s had a noticeable effect on
my productivity.” And she feels less stressed. “Because I’m not
constantly looking at my email throughout the day, my blood pressure
isn’t always escalated. I’m a lot more patient now when I am
interrupted.”</p>
<p>She points out that getting more sleep has also helped her resist
distractions. A few years ago she was only sleeping three or four hours
a night, but she has drastically revamped her sleep schedule and is now
getting from six and a half to seven hours a night. “I went from feeling
overwhelmed and unable to focus to being able to think clearly,” she
says. “When I’m well rested, I have more perspective. I know I don’t
have to respond to an email right away.” She’s even become “a huge sleep
evangelist” with her coaching clients.</p>
<p>Case study #2: Set boundaries</p>
<p>Sarah Taylor (not her real name), an HR manager at an international
humanitarian organization, struggled to stay focused at work for several
months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. She says
she couldn’t stay away from the news. “I was spending several hours a
day—throughout the workday, not just in the evenings—compulsively
checking for updates on various sites, like the New York Times, the
Washington Post, and CNN.” Because of these distractions, she would get
behind and found herself working late into the evening and on weekends
to try to keep up.</p>
<p>“I was miserable because I wasn’t getting sufficient rest—not to
mention I was being continually exposed to bad news every day.” While
she knew this wasn’t good for her, she struggled to set limits on her
own.</p>
<p>She saw a reference to StayFocusd, a browser extension that sets time
limits for selected websites. She checked online reviews and saw that it
had helped others like her, so she decided to try it out. “At that
point, I was desperate to find ways to fix my bad habit, which I was
clearly unable to do through my own willpower,” she says.</p>
<p>She put a 10-minute daily limit on the three news sites she mentioned
earlier. Once that limit has passed, a window pops up that says,
“Shouldn’t you be working?” She says it definitely helps—though she does
find ways around it. “My sneaky mind starts looking at sites that I
haven’t yet blocked, such as the BBC.”</p>
<p>She’s set other rules for herself as well. When she works from home,
she keeps all of her personal devices out of the room where she’s
working. She still stays up-to-date on current events, she says, “but at
least I’m no longer risking being seriously behind on my core work
duties.”</p>
