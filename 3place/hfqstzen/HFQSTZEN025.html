<h4 id="happiness-isnt-the-absence-of-negative-feelings">1 Happiness
Isn’t the Absence of Negative Feelings</h4>
<p>By Jennifer Moss</p>
<p>Happiness feels intolerably elusive for many of us. Like fog, you can
see it from afar, dense and full of shape. But upon approach, its
particles loosen, and suddenly it becomes out of reach, even though it’s
all around you.</p>
<p>We put so much emphasis on the pursuit of happiness, but if you stop
and think about it, to pursue is to chase something without a guarantee
of ever catching it.</p>
<p>Up until about six years ago, I was fervently and ineffectively
chasing happiness. My husband, Jim, and I were living in San Jose,
California, with our two-year-old son and a second baby on the way. On
paper, our life appeared rosy. Still, I couldn’t seem to find the joy. I
always felt so guilty about my sadness. My problems were embarrassingly
“first world.”</p>
<p>Then in September 2009, my world tilted. Jim fell severely ill. He
was diagnosed with Swine Flu (H1N1) and West Nile virus, then
Guillain-Barré Syndrome, due to his compromised immune system.</p>
<p>Jim never worried about death. I did.</p>
<p>When we were told Jim’s illness was letting up, that he’d won this
round, we were relieved. When we were told Jim might not walk for some
time—likely a year, maybe longer—we were alarmed. We knew this prognosis
meant the end of Jim’s career as a pro lacrosse player. What we didn’t
know was how we’d pay the medical bills or how much energy Jim would
have for parenting.</p>
<p>With 10 weeks to go until the baby arrived, I had very little time to
think and reflect. Jim, on the other hand, only had time. He was used to
moving at high speeds, both in life and on the field, so minutes passed
like hours in the hospital. He was kept busy with physical and
occupational therapy, but he was also in need of psychological
support.</p>
<p>He put out a note to people in his social networks, asking them for
reading suggestions that would help him to mentally heal. Suggestions
flowed in. Books and audio tapes were delivered bedside with notes about
how they’d “helped so much” after whatever difficulty this person had
also experienced but overcame.</p>
<p>Jim would spend his days reading motivational books from Tony Robbins
and Oprah or watching TED talks, like Jill Bolte Taylor’s “My Stroke of
Insight,” about the impacts of brain trauma. He would analyze spiritual
books by Deepak Chopra and the Dalai Lama. Or review scientific research
papers about happiness and gratitude written by researchers Martin
Seligman, Shawn Achor, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and many others.</p>
<p>There was a repeated theme throughout all the literature—gratitude.
It would weave in and out of the science, the true stories, and the
drivers for success. Jim responded by starting a gratitude journal of
his own. He got very thankful—thankful for the people who changed his
sheets, thankful for the family that would bring him hot meals at
dinner. Thankful for the nurse who would encourage him and thankful for
the extra attention his rehab team would give him on their own time.
(The team once told Jim that they were only putting in extra time
because they knew how grateful he was for their efforts.)</p>
<p>He asked that I participate in his approach, and because I wanted to
help him to heal so badly and I was seeing how hard it was for him, I
tried hard to be in a positive place when I came into his world inside
that hospital room. I wasn’t always at my best. I sometimes resented
that I couldn’t break down—but after a while I started to see how
rapidly he was getting better. And although our paths weren’t congruent,
we were making it work. I was “coming around.”</p>
<p>It was shaky and scary, but when Jim walked out of the hospital on
crutches (he stubbornly refused the wheelchair) only six weeks after he
was rushed by ambulance to the ER, we decided there was something more
to his healing than just dumb luck.</p>
<p>One of those early books that influenced Jim was Seligman’s Flourish.
A psychologist and former president of the American Psychology
Association, Seligman was responsible for defining the term “PERMA,” the
root of many positive psychology research projects around the world. The
acronym stands for the five elements essential to lasting
contentment:</p>
<p>Positive emotion: Peace, gratitude, satisfaction, pleasure,
inspiration, hope, curiosity, and love fall into this category.</p>
<p>Engagement: Losing ourselves in a task or project provides us with a
sense of “disappeared time” because we are so highly engaged.</p>
<p>Relationships: People who have meaningful, positive relationships
with others are happier than those who do not.</p>
<p>Meaning: Meaning comes from serving a cause bigger than ourselves.
Whether it’s a religion or a cause that helps humanity in some way, we
all need meaning in our lives.</p>
<p>Accomplishment/achievement: To feel significant life satisfaction, we
must strive to better ourselves.</p>
<p>We slowly brought these five tenets back into our lives. Jim returned
to Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario to research neuroscience, and
we promptly started up Plasticity Labs to help teach others what we’d
learned about the pursuit of happiness. As our lives came to include
more empathy, gratitude, and meaning, I stopped feeling sad.</p>
<p>So when I see skepticism directed at the positive psychology
movement, I take it personally. Do these critics have a problem with
gratitude? Relationships? Meaning? Hope?</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the problem is that we oversimplify happiness in our
pop culture and media, which makes it easy to discard as unproven. As
Vanessa Buote, a postdoctoral fellow in social psychology, put it to me
in an email:</p>
<p>One of the misconceptions about happiness is that happiness is being
cheerful, joyous, and content all the time; always having a smile on
your face. It’s not—being happy and leading rich lives is about taking
the good with the bad, and learning how to reframe the bad. In fact, in
the recent [article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology],
“Emodiversity and the Emotional Ecosystem,” by Harvard [researcher
Jordi] Quoidbach, found that experiencing a wide range of emotions—both
positive and negative—was linked to positive mental and physical
well-being.</p>
<p>Not only do we tend to misunderstand what happiness is, we also tend
to chase it the wrong way. Shawn Achor, the researcher and corporate
trainer who wrote the HBR article “Positive Intelligence,” told me that
most people think about happiness the wrong way: “The biggest
misconception of the happiness industry is that happiness is an end, not
a means. We think that if we get what we want, then we’ll be happy. But
it turns out that our brains actually work in the opposite
direction.”</p>
<p>Buote agrees: “We sometimes tend to see ‘being happy’ as the end
goal, but we forget that what’s really important is the journey; finding
out what makes us the happiest and regularly engaging in those
activities to help us lead a more fulfilling life.”</p>
<p>In other words, we’re not happy when we’re chasing happiness. We’re
happiest when we’re not thinking about it, when we’re enjoying the
present moment because we’re lost in a meaningful project, working
toward a higher goal, or helping someone who needs us.</p>
<p>Healthy positivity doesn’t mean cloaking your authentic feelings.
Happiness is not the absence of suffering; it’s the ability to rebound
from it. And happiness is not the same as joy or ecstasy; happiness
includes contentment, well-being, and the emotional flexibility to
experience a full range of emotions. At our company, some of us have
dealt with anxiety and depression. Some have experienced PTSD. Some of
us have witnessed severe mental illness in our families, and some of us
have not. We openly share. Or we don’t—either way is fine. We support
tears in the office, if the situation calls for it (in both sorrow and
in laughter).</p>
<p>Some people—perhaps looking for a fresh angle—have even argued that
happiness is harmful (see, for example, the last two articles in this
book). But the point of practicing exercises that help increase mental
and emotional fitness is not to learn to paste a smile on your face or
wish away your problems. It’s to learn how to handle stressors with more
resilience through training, just as you would train to run a
marathon.</p>
<p>During my time with Jim in the hospital, I watched him change. It
happened in subtle ways at first, but then all at once I realized that
practicing gratitude and the happiness that comes with it had given me a
gift: It gave me back Jim. If happiness is harmful—then I say, bring it
on.</p>
