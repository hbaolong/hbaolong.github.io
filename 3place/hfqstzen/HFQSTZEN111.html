<h4 id="two-ways-to-clarify-your-professional-passions">4 Two Ways to
Clarify Your Professional Passions</h4>
<p>By Robert Steven Kaplan</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that highly effective people almost always say
they love what they do? If you ask them about their good career fortune,
they’re likely to advise that you have to love what you do in order to
perform at a high level of effectiveness. They will talk about the
critical importance of having a long-term perspective and real passion
in pursuing a career. Numerous studies of highly effective people point
to a strong correlation between believing in the mission, enjoying the
job, and performing at a high level.</p>
<p>So why is it that people are often skeptical of the notion that
passion and career should be integrally linked? Why do people often
struggle to discern their passions and then connect those passions to a
viable career path? When people hear the testimony of a seemingly happy
and fulfilled person, they often say, “That’s easy for them to say now.
They’ve made it. It’s not so easy to follow this advice when you’re
sitting where I’m sitting!” What they don’t fully realize is that
connecting their passions to their work was a big part of how these
people eventually made it.</p>
<p>Passion is about excitement. It has more to do with your heart than
your head. It’s critical because reaching your full potential requires a
combination of your heart and your head. In my experience, your
intellectual capability and skills will take you only so far.</p>
<p>Regardless of your talent, you will have rough days, months, and
years. You may get stuck with a lousy boss. You may get discouraged and
feel like giving up. What pulls you through these difficult periods? The
answer is your passion: It is the essential rocket fuel that helps you
overcome difficulties and work through dark times. Passion emanates from
a belief in a cause or the enjoyment you feel from performing certain
tasks. It helps you hang in there so that you can improve your skills,
overcome adversity, and find meaning in your work and in your life.</p>
<p>In talking to more experienced people, I often have to get them to
mentally set aside their financial obligations, their role in the
community, and the expectations of friends, family, and loved ones. It
can be particularly difficult for midcareer professionals to understand
their passions because, in many cases, the breakage cost of changing
jobs or careers feels so huge to them that it’s not even worth
considering. As a result, they try not to think too deeply about whether
they like what they’re doing.</p>
<p>The problem for many midcareer people is that they’re experiencing a
plateau that is beginning to alarm them and diminish their career
prospects. This plateau is often a by-product of lack of passion for the
job. It may be that the nature of the job has changed or the world has
changed, and the mission and tasks of their career no longer arouse
their passions. In other cases, nothing has changed except the people
themselves. They simply want more meaning from their lives and
professional careers.</p>
<p>Of course, these questions are never fully resolved. Why? It’s
because there are many variables in play, and we can’t control all of
them. The challenge is to be self-aware.</p>
<p>That’s difficult, because most of our professional days are chaotic.
In fact, life is chaotic, and, sadly, we can’t usually predict the
future. It feels as if there’s no time to reflect. So how are you
supposed to get perspective on these questions?</p>
<p>I suggest that you try several exercises. These exercises may help
you increase your self-awareness and develop your abilities to better
understand your passions. They also encourage you to pay closer
attention to and be more aware of the tasks and subjects you truly find
interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Your best self</p>
<p>This exercise involves thinking back to a time when you were at your
best. You were great! You did a superb job, and you really enjoyed it.
You loved what you were doing while you were doing it, and you received
substantial positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>Remember the situation. Write down the details. What were you doing?
What tasks were you performing? What were the key elements of the
environment, the mission, and the nature of the impact you were making?
Did you have a boss, or were you self-directed? Sketch out the complete
picture. What did you love about it? What were the factors that made it
enjoyable and helped you shine?</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, it may take you some time to recall such
a situation. It’s not that you haven’t had these experiences; rather,
you have gotten out of the habit of thinking about a time when you were
at your best and enjoying what you were doing.</p>
<p>After sketching out the situation, think about what you can learn
from this recollection. What are your insights regarding the nature of
your enjoyment, the critical environmental factors, the types of tasks
you took pleasure in performing, and so on? What does this recollection
tell you about what you might enjoy now? Write down your thoughts.</p>
<p>Mental models</p>
<p>Another approach to helping you think about your desires and passions
is to use mental models. That is, assume xyz, and then tell me what you
would do—and why. Here are examples of these models:</p>
<p>If you had one year left to live, how would you spend it? What does
that tell you about what you enjoy and what you have a passion for?</p>
<p>If you had enough money to do whatever you wanted, what job or career
would you pursue?</p>
<p>If you knew you were going to be highly successful in your career,
what job would you pursue today?</p>
<p>What would you like to tell your children and grandchildren about
what you accomplished in your career? How will you explain to them what
career you chose?</p>
<p>If you were a third party giving advice to yourself, what would you
suggest regarding a career choice?</p>
<p>Although these mental models may seem a bit silly or whimsical, I
urge you to take the time to try them, consider your answers, and write
them down. You’re likely to be surprised by what you learn. Each of them
attempts to help you let go of fears, insecurities, and worries about
the opinions of others—and focus on what you truly believe and
desire.</p>
<p>Passion is critical in reaching your potential. Getting in touch with
your passions may require you to give your fears and insecurities a rest
and focus more on your hopes and dreams. You don’t need to immediately
decide what action to take or assess whether your dream is realistic.
There is an element of brainstorming in this effort: You don’t want to
kill ideas before you’ve considered them. Again, allow yourself to focus
on the what before you worry about the how. These exercises are about
self-awareness, first and foremost. It is uncanny how much more likely
you are to recognize opportunities if you’re aware of what you’re
looking for.</p>
