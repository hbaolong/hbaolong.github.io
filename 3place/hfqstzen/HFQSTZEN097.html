<h4 id="managing-the-critical-voices-inside-your-head">11 Managing the
Critical Voices Inside Your Head</h4>
<p>By Peter Bregman</p>
<p>At 8:20 a.m., my 12-year-old daughter, Isabelle, was rushing to meet
her ski group. She was 20 minutes late and stressed: She takes her
skiing very seriously and was training for a race in a couple of
days.</p>
<p>Near the competition center, she ran into one of her coaches, Joey.
He looked at her, then his watch. “If this were a race day,” he told
her, with a disapproving scowl, “I would tell you to turn around and go
home.”</p>
<p>His words stung, and she burst into tears. A few moments later, she
was greeted by another one of her coaches, Vicky, who saw how stressed
she was.</p>
<p>“Honey, don’t worry,” she said. “This isn’t a race. It’s okay that
you’re running a little late. You’ll just catch up with your group on
top of the mountain.”</p>
<p>Two vastly different coaches, two vastly different responses. Who’s
right? I bet you have an opinion.</p>
<p>But that’s not the point.</p>
<p>My advice to Isabelle? You will have Joeys in your life, and you will
have Vickys. They will show up as teachers, bosses, colleagues, and
friends. So I said to her, “It’s a good idea to get used to the
different responses without getting thrown off balance. You can’t
control how people respond to you, but you can control how you take them
in and how you respond to them.”</p>
<p>But let’s go one step further. The truth is, we all have a Joey and a
Vicky inside, and they can both be useful. Joey might seem unkind, but
his high expectations and low tolerance for failure can be helpful in
driving us to be our best. On the other hand, sometimes we need
empathetic support. To some, Vicky may appear soft. But her comfort and
reassurance can be useful, especially during times of stress.</p>
<p>Here’s the key: Be strategic and intentional about whom you listen
to—and when—even if the voices are inside your head. In fact, especially
if the voices are inside your head. Those can be the sneakiest. It’s
pretty easy to call Joey a jerk and ignore him; it’s much harder to
dismiss the voice inside your head because, well, it’s you.</p>
<p>Try this tactic: When you hear the voices, give them names and
personalities. Imagine a Joey on one side, a Vicky on the other.</p>
<p>Notice the voices in your head as voices. A lot of the time, most of
us simply believe what we hear—either from other people or from
ourselves. If your inner voice calls you lazy, it’s hard not to think
you’re lazy. It helps if you imagine it’s Joey calling you lazy
instead.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to judge whether the voices in your head are right.
It’s impossible to know, and it doesn’t matter anyway. Are you lazy? The
truth is that you probably are, in some ways. And in other ways, you’re
not. But that’s not the right question.</p>
<p>Instead, think about the outcome you want, and ask this question: Is
what this voice is saying—and how it’s saying it—useful right now? This
is the same question you should be asking if you’re confronted by an
actual Joey or Vicky. Is this voice helpful to me in this particular
moment? If you think it’ll motivate you, listen to it. If it will
demoralize you, don’t.</p>
<p>This is an important skill: the ability to ignore critical voices
when they’re destructive, without discounting them entirely. They might
be useful another time.</p>
<p>The goal is flexibility. Cultivate a varied group of critics and
coaches, both internal and external. Be aware of whom is speaking and
when you should listen.</p>
<p>Feeling comfortable with multiple voices is particularly important if
you are a manager. You need to be able to be Joey or Vicky, depending on
the situation. Sometimes people need to feel your high expectations and
disapproval. Other times they need your gentleness and empathy. Don’t
default to one or the other. Pause to assess what’s needed, and then
make a choice.</p>
<p>“It’s hard,” Isabelle told me after we spoke about the different
voices and messages they brought with them. “How do I stop from thinking
Joey is just a jerk? Or that I’m lame for being late?”</p>
<p>“He might be a jerk, and you may be lame,” I said, “but not because
he said so. Here’s the question: Will you be more likely to be on time
tomorrow because of what he said?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she conceded. “But it felt terrible.”</p>
<p>“And, when you feel terrible, can you hear Vicky’s voice too?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, beginning to smile.</p>
<p>“Then it’s a good thing you have two coaches,” I told her.</p>
<p>Because sometimes, both voices are the perfect combination.</p>
