Secrets of Top Athletes</h4>
<p>An interview with Daniel McGinn by Sarah Green Carmichael</p>
<p>Sarah Green Carmichael: Welcome to the HBR Idea Cast from Harvard
Business Review. I’m Sarah Green Carmichael. To get psyched up for the
big game, sports teammates give each other pep talks, listen to an
exciting song during warm-ups, or follow a particular pregame routine.
Then there’s a locker-room speech, often dramatized in popular movies,
where the coach inspires individuals to greatness:</p>
<p>Herb Brooks: I’m sick and tired of hearing about what a great hockey
team the Soviets have. Screw them. This is your time. Now go out there
and take it.</p>
<p>But what’s the business equivalent of the pep talk? When you have a
big presentation, job interview, quarter-ending sales meeting, or
situation where you really need to be on, how do you prepare for it? If
you’re like a lot of people, you probably think about what you’re going
to say and what you’re going to wear, and then you just kind of, well,
show up.</p>
<p>HBR’s senior editor Dan McGinn thinks we can all do better than that
by taking a cue from how the best athletes and performers prepare. He’s
the author of the article “The Science of Pep Talks” in the July–August
2017 issue of Harvard Business Review, and he is also the author of the
book Psyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help You
Succeed. Dan, thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>Daniel McGinn: Thank you, Sarah.</p>
<p>So did you have to get psyched up to write this book?</p>
<p>I did, actually. Writing this book did change the way I get ready to
perform my job as a writer every morning or many mornings. If you watch
sports, you become pretty accustomed to seeing the athletes and what
they do when they warm up. They tend to have headphones on, and you know
that they’re listening to a certain set of songs. It’s not just up to
chance. You’re used to seeing locker-room speeches. You’re used to
seeing that gaze, that locked-in look that they have, and that
focus.</p>
<p>And they’re taught to do that. There are sports psychologists who
teach them exactly what they should be thinking about before a game. The
argument I have is that more of our jobs are like that these days. It’s
less like factory work where you’re doing the same thing every day and
more about the big pitch, the presentation, the sales call, and that we
should learn to do what these athletes do to try to lock ourselves
in.</p>
<p>I think about coming into my job every day and that maybe we should
run through the halls and give every editor a high five and then chew a
pen and then put the pen back in the bin or other crazy things. How
feasible is it to do some of these things on a daily basis?</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously, if our boss Adi Ignatius gave us a speech like Knute
Rockne did before we sat down to edit articles, we would all think it
was kind of crazy. If you don’t know who that is, Rockne was the
legendary Notre Dame football coach from the 1920s.</p>
<p>So why do people have rituals? And why is there a lot of research
that suggests that they work? Well, one theory is that they help us
remember how much practice we’ve done. They help get our bodies and our
minds into the groove. The other is that they give us something to focus
on other than being nervous and anxious. Think of a funeral. Funerals
are very awkward occasions, and there’s this whole set of rituals about
what we do when we go through it. That’s because it’s awkward, and we
want something to do to not think about the nervousness.</p>
<p>So there’s a distractive element to rituals. They just help your body
get into the groove. I’m not suggesting that we should run out and chest
bump every day before we go to our desks. But I am saying that if you
have some quiet, maybe private, thing that you do to get your day
started, you might be a little bit better at it.</p>
<p>So a lot of what athletes and performers do is about reducing their
pregame jitters. But isn’t some amount of anxiety supposed to help you
amp up for a big moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, no question. I was not a very good high school athlete. And
when I started this reporting, I thought a lot of this was about
adrenaline and about getting yourself psyched up, amped up, highly
energized. The more research I did, the more I found out that that’s
really a simplistic view.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is a physiological response. But it’s much more about what
you’re feeling, and it’s about reducing your anxiety, trying to boost
your confidence, and trying to manage your energy level so that it’s
appropriate to what you’re trying to do. If you’re a WWE wrestler,
that’s a little bit different than giving a commencement address. So you
need to calibrate the energy level to make sure it’s right for what
you’re doing.</p>
<p>What about trying to increase your confidence, though? I mean, can
these rituals and things really help with that? Or is it like the movie
Dumbo, where little Dumbo had that silly feather and thought that’s how
he could fly? Is it just that this helps me because I believe it helps
me?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the feather would be an example of a superstitious ritual
because clearly the feather doesn’t really help him fly. It’s just a
placebo effect. What can help you gain confidence is controlling your
thought patterns and thinking about what I’d call your “greatest hits.”
So, Sarah, for the show, if you were going to get yourself psyched up,
you should think about the best podcast interviews you’ve done. You
might actually want to go back for five minutes at your desk and listen
to a couple of them.</p>
<p>Before I walked in the room with you today, I went back and listened
to the best interview I’ve had with you because it made me think, “Gosh,
you’re good at this.” And that’s what you want to be thinking before you
go into these environments. It sounds cheesy. You may remember the
Stuart Smalley self-affirmations from Saturday Night Live in the ’90s:
“I’m special . . . People like me.” But it does work. The messages there
are to be relentlessly upbeat and positive. Be confident. Remember your
greatest hits. And basically talk yourself up and psych yourself up with
the idea that you’ve done this before, and you can do it again.</p>
<p>Was there any organization you came across where they really do make
you go back and actually listen to or watch your greatest hits?</p>
<p>At the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, I spent a day in what
they call the Center for Enhanced Performance, which is a team of
psychologists that work at West Point. And one of the things they do is
take their athletes and their cadets and put them in these enclosed,
almost egg-shaped chairs. And they play audio tracks that they’ve
created for each cadet that talk about how great they are.</p>
<p>The one I watched was a lacrosse goalie, and there’s a professional
actor narrating along with music: “John, you’re the best lacrosse goalie
ever. Remember the game against Shrewsbury High when you did this?” So
it really is a greatest-hits kind of thing. That’s probably the most
tangible, visceral example I have found of that.</p>
<p>Could it ever work so well that you’d get to a point where you were
insanely overconfident and then that would actually lead you to perform
worse?</p>
<p>Sure. I think in a sports setting or in a business setting, we
certainly see examples of organizations that become overconfident, too
convinced of their dominance, too complacent. But I think for your
average, everyday business performers thinking about a job interview, a
pitch scenario, a big presentation, or a negotiation, probably the
average person suffers a little bit too much from a lack of confidence
or an imposter syndrome. On the whole, most people are going to benefit
from trying to dial it up a little bit.</p>
<p>One of the things in the book that really surprised me was the part
where you explain that golfers who used Tiger Woods’s clubs or clubs
they were told were Tiger Woods’s clubs—I’m not sure he participated in
the study—actually golfed better than players who were just using any
old random club. How does something like that work?</p>
<p>They call that process “social contagion,” and it’s the theory that
knowing that someone celebrated or highly accomplished has touched an
object physically imbues some magical powers. I tried to test that out
in the book. I reached out to Malcolm Gladwell, who’s a very well-known
and acclaimed nonfiction writer. I asked him if I could write the book
on a keyboard that he had used. Knowing that such a great writer has
typed on these same keys and struggled through it absolutely helped me.
I don’t know if Tiger Woods’s club would help my golf game though. My
golf game is really beyond help. [Laughter]</p>
<p>Yes, I’ve actually read about similar studies—I’m not sure how good
they are—that show that when women wear heels, they feel more confident.
I think in my case, the opposite is true, because I have a really hard
time walking in heels. But that’s something where if you are Stephen
Colbert or David Ortiz or one of these big stars you talk about in the
book, you can really control your environment so that you can perform
the ritual. But I think for most of us in offices, it feels like we’re
not in control of our space. So how can those of us who are not David
Ortiz or Stephen Colbert really carve out time for these rituals that
are so powerful?</p>
<p>They don’t have to be super-elaborate, and they don’t have to be
something that anyone else can even recognize you’re doing. So I don’t
do this every day, but I’ll put on a pair of noise-canceling headphones.
That has a functional purpose because it blocks out noise, but also the
feel of it on my head is a signal to myself that it’s time to get to
work here. Some of it is just this Pavlovian signal to our bodies that,
“OK, it’s time for me to get to work.” So it doesn’t need to be throwing
chalk dust in the air or crazy hand gestures. It can be something as
simple as putting something on.</p>
