Corporate Apology to Work, the CEO Should Look Sad</h4>
<p>By Sarah Green Carmichael</p>
<p>Straight up, we made some mistakes,” Whole Foods co-CEOs John Mackey
and Walter Robb said in a video apology in response to an overcharging
scandal.</p>
<p>“We weren’t prepared for the crisis, and we dropped the ball,” wrote
Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on the Airbnb blog in 2011, after a guest
trashed a host’s home.</p>
<p>“This should never have happened. It is simply unacceptable,” said
Mary Barra, CEO of GM, in one of several public apologies in the wake of
safety scandals at the automaker.</p>
<p>The corporate apology, once a relative rarity, has become a normal
part of business discourse. Stuff happens, and then we say we’re sorry
for it. But just because corporate apologies have become commonplace
doesn’t mean they’re all created equal.</p>
<p>Two new studies shed light on what makes some apologies effective and
what makes others backfire.</p>
<p>First, Leanne ten Brinke of the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business
and Gabrielle S. Adams of the London Business School examine how
expressions of emotion affect corporate apologies. Publishing in the
journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, they
present the findings of two studies.1</p>
<p>In the first study, they looked at how investors reacted to real
apologies from executives. They examined 29 online videos of apologies
made between 2007 and 2011. Using an established system for
distinguishing facial expressions (the Facial Action Coding System, or
FACS), their researchers watched each video second by second, without
sound, and tracked the expressions that flitted across the executives’
faces. Were they frowning? Smiling? Looking sad? Then Brinke and Adams
looked at what happened to the company’s stock price after the apology.
They found that for those leaders who had apologized with a smile, the
stock price dropped—perhaps because the leader seemed insincere
delivering his apology, or even seemed to be enjoying the suffering his
company had caused. The more the person smiled, the worse his company
performed.</p>
<p>For the leaders who appeared genuinely contrite, at first it seemed
like there was no impact on stock price: The company neither performed
worse nor performed better. “Normative emotions simply allow the company
to move forward,” they write.</p>
<p>But then the researchers took a closer look at CEO apologies,
specifically—16 out of the 29 cases. They found that when an apology was
delivered by a CEO who looked sad, the company’s stock price actually
rose post-apology. They determined that “a good apology can build
investor confidence,” especially in the long term.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, Brinke and Adams conducted an experiment
in which they hired an actor to portray an airline CEO apologizing for a
computer malfunction that canceled 140 flights, stranding thousands of
passengers—a scenario based on a real Alaska Airlines snafu. They made
sure his fictional apology contained all the verbal elements of a good
apology: the components previous research has identified as being
central to repairing relationships, including an explicit “I’m sorry,”
an offer of repair, an explanation, taking responsibility, and a promise
of forbearance. They then recruited subjects to watch this fictional CEO
apologize—either happily, sadly, or neutrally. When the CEO appeared
sad, participants rated him as more sincere and were more likely to want
to reconcile with him. When the CEO delivered his apology with a smile
on his face—or, interestingly, a neutral expression—the study
participants were less likely to trust him, and the apology even seemed
to exacerbate their negative feelings.</p>
<p>Even seasoned leaders are likely to find delivering an apology to be
an uncomfortable experience, and when we feel uncomfortable, a normal
reaction is to grimace, laugh awkwardly, or even try to break the
tension with a joke. Leaders (especially Americans) may also feel they
can’t show too much sadness or anguish but instead must present a
positive front at all times. The research by Brinke and Adams reminds us
how these understandable impulses can backfire.</p>
<p>Another paper that appeared in the Journal of Corporate Finance adds
an interesting wrinkle to this subject.2 Researchers Don Chance, James
Cicon, and Stephen P. Ferris examined 150 press releases from 1993 to
2009 to examine how companies fared when they blamed themselves for poor
performance as opposed to blaming external factors. They found that
while companies are twice as likely to blame external factors when
things go wrong, passing the buck results in continued financial
decline. Conversely, companies that take responsibility for their missed
earnings stabilize and eventually see an uptick in financial
performance. (Interestingly, both groups were about equally likely to
fire their CEOs.)</p>
<p>Why? After eliminating numerous factors, the researchers conclude
that being honest and specific about the source of the problem—both
characteristics of self-blaming statements—not only cheers up investors,
it likely helps the company turn around the issue more quickly.
Conversely, the companies that blamed external factors were often vague
(blaming “economic forces” for instance) and seen as less honest (since
many of their wounds had actually been self-inflicted).</p>
<p>The message is loud and clear: When you mess up, admit it. And look
appropriately sad about it.</p>
