Sex, Power, and the Systems That Enable Men Like Harvey Weinstein</h4>
<p>By Dacher Keltner</p>
<p>When I first heard accounts of film producer Harvey Weinstein’s
predatory behavior, my mind devised punishments fitting for Renaissance
Europe or the film A Clockwork Orange: Cover his face with a shame mask
widely used centuries ago in Germany; shock his frontal lobes so that
he’d start empathizing with the women he’s preyed on. When we learn of
injustice, it’s only human to focus on how to eliminate or punish the
person responsible.</p>
<p>But my research into the social psychology of power suggests
that—without exculpating corrupt individuals—we also need to take a hard
look at the social systems in which they commit their abuses.</p>
<p>For 25 years, I and other social scientists have documented how
feeling powerful can change the behavior of ordinary citizens—what might
be called the banality of the abuses of power. In experiments in which
one group of people is randomly assigned to a condition of power, those
in the “powerful” group are prone to two shortcomings: They develop
empathy deficits and are less able to read others’ emotions and take
others’ perspectives.1 And they behave in an impulsive fashion—they
violate the ethics of the workplace. In one experiment, participants in
power took candy from children without blinking an eye.2</p>
<p>Our research also shows that these two tendencies manifest in
inappropriate sexual behavior in male-dominated contexts, echoing the
accounts of the women assaulted by Weinstein. Powerful men, studies
show, overestimate the sexual interest of others and erroneously believe
that the women around them are more attracted to them than is actually
the case.3 Powerful men also sexualize their work, looking for
opportunities for sexual trysts and affairs, and along the way leer
inappropriately, stand too close, and touch for too long on a daily
basis, thus crossing the lines of decorum—and worse.4</p>
<p>These findings from laboratory studies tell us that abuses of power
are predictable and recurring. So, too, does a quick reflection on
history. While I’ve been studying power, each year there’s been a new
example of a powerful man sexually abusing others, and in every
imaginable context—religious organizations, the military, Capitol Hill,
Wall Street, fraternities, sports, the popular media, tech, labs, and
universities.</p>
<p>We should also take a lesson from the now-canonical studies of
Stanley Milgram on obedience to authority. Those studies, inspired by
Milgram’s quest to understand the conditions that gave rise to Nazi
Germany, showed that authoritarian contexts can prompt ordinary,
well-meaning citizens to give near-lethal shocks to strangers off the
street. In a similar fashion, contexts of unchecked power make many of
us vulnerable to, and complicit in, the abuse of power. We may not like
what’s going on, but many of us wouldn’t do anything to stop it. This
doesn’t excuse the rest of us any more than it excuses the powerful for
their crimes, but it should prevent us from telling ourselves the
comforting lie that we’d behave better than the people in The Weinstein
Company who reportedly knew what Weinstein was doing and failed to put a
stop to it.</p>
<p>The challenge, then, is to change social systems in which the abuses
of power arise and continue unchecked. And on this, the social
psychology of power offers some insights.</p>
<p>First, we need to hear tales from those abused by the powerful, as
difficult and unsettling as it can be to share these stories. Kudos to
the brave people who are calling out the bullying and sexual abuse of
Weinstein and others. These tales galvanize social change. For example,
when English citizens started to hear the stories about the treatment of
slaves on slave ships in the 1700s, the moral calculus of the slave
trade started shifting, and antislavery laws followed. Telling such
stories also functions as a means by which those with less power
construct the reputations of those in power and constrain their
impulsive tendencies.</p>
<p>We are also learning of the many benefits of women rising to
positions of power, from lower rates of corruption to more-profitable
bottom lines.5 Hollywood is one of the most male-dominated sectors,
where only 4% of directors are female; more female directors and
producers would change the balance of power in filmmaking. Studies show
this kind of systemic change will reduce the likelihood of sexual abuse.
For example, ethnic minorities are more likely to be targeted in hate
crimes as the numerical advantage enjoyed by whites increases.6 Greater
numerical balance between people of different groups constrains the
abuses of power: Those from less powerful groups have more allies, they
are more likely to be watchfully present in the contexts in which the
powerful abuse power, and they are more likely to feel empowered to
speak truth to power.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to take on the myths that sustain the abuses of
power. Social scientists have documented how coercive power structures
sustain themselves through social myths, which most typically justify
the standing and unfettered action of those at the top. We’ve heard them
before: “Women aren’t biologically equipped to lead.” “African Americans
aren’t worthy of the vote.” “He may scream at people and cross some
lines, but he’s a genius.” And a favorite in Hollywood: “Women are
turned on by men with power like Weinstein.” Actual scientific studies
find something quite different: When women (and men) are placed into
positions of less power, their anxiety, self-consciousness, and worry
rise dramatically, and their pleasure and delight, including sexual, are
turned off.7</p>
<p>This moment has the potential to become a tipping point in the fight
against systemic sexual assault. For it to live up to the promise of
this billing, we have to recognize the banality of Harvey Weinstein, and
turn our attention to changing the social context in ways that make the
human tendency to abuse power a thing of the past.</p>
