Is Something Lost When We Use Mindfulness as a Productivity Tool?</h4>
<p>By Charlotte Lieberman</p>
<p>I came to mindfulness as a healing practice after overcoming an
addiction to the drug Adderall during my junior year of college. I found
myself in this situation because I thought that using Adderall to help
me focus was no big deal—an attitude shared by 81% of students
nationwide.1</p>
<p>Adderall simply seemed like an innocuous shortcut to getting things
done efficiently and effortlessly. I still remember the rush I felt my
first night on Adderall: I completed every page of assigned Faulkner
reading (not easy), started and finished a paper several weeks before
the due date (because why not?), Swiffered my room (twice), and answered
all of my unread emails (even the irrelevant ones). It’s also worth
noting that I had forgotten to eat all night and somehow found myself
still awake at 4 a.m., my jaw clenched and my stomach rumbling. Sleep
was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>What I saw initially as a shortcut to more focus and productivity
ultimately turned out instead to be a long detour toward
self-destruction. Rather than thinking of focus as the by-product of my
own power and capability, I looked outside of myself, thinking that a
pill would solve my problems.</p>
<p>Long story short, I eventually came to grips with my problem, got off
the drug, and found an antidote to my crippling self-doubt:
meditation—particularly, mindfulness (or Vipassana) meditation.</p>
<p>So to me, it’s somewhat ironic that mindfulness has taken the media
by storm precisely because of its scientifically proven benefits for
focus and productivity.2</p>
<p>And it’s not just because I came to mindfulness as a way of healing
from the fallout of the amount of pressure I put on myself to be
productive. While mindfulness is not a little blue pill, it’s starting
to be thought of as a kind of shortcut to focus and productivity, not
unlike a morning coffee. A wisdom tradition associated with personal
growth and insight is now being absorbed by our culture as a tool for
career development and efficiency. But should mindfulness really be used
to attain a particular goal? Is it OK to think of a practice that’s all
about “being” as just another tool for “doing”?</p>
<p>Companies seem to think so. Given the mindfulness buzz, it’s no
surprise that corporate mindfulness programs are proliferating across
the country. Google offers “Search Inside Yourself” classes that teach
mindfulness meditation at work. As celebrated in the recent book Mindful
Work by David Gelles, corporations like Goldman Sachs, HBO, Deutsche
Bank, Target, and Bank of America tout the productivity-related benefits
of meditation to their employees.</p>
<p>The world of professional athletics—most recently the NFL—too has
drawn attention to the achievement-oriented underpinnings of the
mainstream mindfulness movement. The 2015 Wall Street Journal article
that explored the Seattle Seahawks’ success in the 2014 Super Bowl
explained that the team’s secret weapon was its willingness to work with
a sports psychologist who teaches mindfulness. Seahawks assistant head
coach Tom Cable went so far as to describe the team as “incredibly
mindful.”</p>
<p>This article was written in January, a month before the Seahawks lost
the 2015 Super Bowl. In the wake of their defeat, I heard several
conversations among acquaintances and family members (all of whom were
sports fans and were nonmeditating but aware of meditation) in which
they expressed skepticism about the power of meditation for focus and
success. I mean, how much can we embrace mindfulness as a tool for
success if a team famous for meditating lost the Super Bowl?</p>
<p>Still a lot, I think. And I’m fine stopping here to admit (if you
haven’t already concluded yourself) that the commodification of
mindfulness as a productivity tool leaves me with a strange taste in my
mouth. Above all, I am resistant to the teleological attitude toward
meditation: that it’s a “tool” designed for a particular purpose,
contingent on “results.”</p>
<p>And yet asserting this skepticism brings me back to a conversation I
had with my vegan cousin a few years ago. He is a PhD student in
biological anthropology, an animal activist, and a longtime vegan. When
I asked him if he was irked by all the celebrities going vegan to lose
weight, he shook his head vigorously. “I’d rather have people do the
right thing for the wrong reason than not do the right thing at all,” he
explained (the “right” thing here being veganism).</p>
<p>This philosophy seems applicable to the mindfulness craze (aka
“McMindfulness”) too. I’m happy more people are getting the myriad
benefits of meditation. I am glad that you’re no longer thought of as a
patchouli-scented hippie if you’re an avid meditator. If corporate
mindfulness programs mean that employee self-care is more valued in the
workplace, then so be it.</p>
<p>But I also think there’s room to consider an alternative way of
talking about meditation, especially when it comes to how we relate to
our work.</p>
<p>Looking at mindfulness as a tool for accomplishing what we need to
get done keeps us trapped in a future-oriented mindset, rather than
encouraging us to dilate the present moment. Of course, this doesn’t
invalidate the neuroscience; mindfulness helps us get more stuff done.
But what about allowing mindfulness to just be? To have the effects it
is going to have, without attaching a marketing pitch to this ancient
practice?</p>
<p>Psychologist Kristin Neff is renowned for coining the term
“self-compassion.” In particular, Neff has asserted that the first
component of self-compassion is kindness, the ability to shrug off those
times when we “let ourselves down,” when we don’t get to check off
everything from our to do lists. The other two components of
self-compassion are awareness and mindfulness. The goal is not to get
more done but to understand that we are enough—and that our worth is not
contingent on what we get done. (Although studies have shown that
self-forgiveness actually helps us procrastinate less.3)</p>
<p>I’m not an idealist. I’m not saying every one should start “Om-ing,”
devoting themselves solely to self-compassion, and forgetting all about
their to do lists. But I am saying that compassion, and self-compassion,
ought to move into the foreground as we talk about mindfulness—even in
corporate mindfulness programs.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in wanting to be productive at work. But there’s
also no shame in being able to cut yourself some slack, to extend
yourself some love during those times at work when things don’t feel so
great.</p>
