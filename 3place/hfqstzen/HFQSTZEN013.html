<h4 id="how-to-evaluate-manage-and-strengthen-your-resilience">3 How to
Evaluate, Manage, and Strengthen Your Resilience</h4>
<p>By David Kopans</p>
<p>Think back to your last off-site meeting. You and the rest of your
team likely poured over reports and spreadsheets, facts and figures.
Strewn about the table were probably the tools of your trade: reams of
data, balance sheets, and PandandandandLs. Managers understand that
clear-eyed analysis—both quantitative and qualitative—is the key to
building a resilient business. And yet when it comes to measuring and
strengthening our own ability to adapt, grow, and prosper, rarely do we
apply the same methodical approach.</p>
<p>But we should. Based on my own experience starting, building, and
growing companies, as well as upon decades of research showing the
underlying components of personal resilience, I’ve discovered a few
fundamental things you can do to actually evaluate, manage, and
strengthen your own resilience in the same way that you would increase
the resiliency of your company:</p>
<p>Build up your positivity currency. We can’t just print resilience the
way countries print money. Individuals must use what I call a
“positivity currency” approach that is grounded in actual positive
interactions, events, and memories—factors that are known to boost
resilience. This currency is only “printed” and stored as assets when we
focus on positive things and express gratitude for them. Why? Because
maintaining a positive outlook and regularly expressing gratitude are
the bullion bars that have real value in backstopping and building
resilience.</p>
<p>Research by Robert Emmons of UC Davis, Michael McCullough of the
University of Miami, and others clearly shows that they are among the
most reliable methods for increasing personal happiness and life
satisfaction.1 Creating such positivity currency can decrease anxiety,
reduce symptoms of illness, and improve the quality of your sleep. All
of which, of course, lead to greater personal resilience.</p>
<p>Keep records. None of the tools we use to evaluate companies work
very well without good record keeping. That’s also true when it comes to
building individual resilience. When you commit positive interactions,
events, and memories to the written word, they register higher value
than other non-written forms of positivity currency-based activity,
according to research by positive psychology expert Martin Seligman of
the University of Pennsylvania.2 Record your positive currency
transactions (by jotting them down in a leather bound journal or a
digital equivalent). The data points you record could be as simple as
keeping a written tally by category (such as family, friends, or work)
in a paper notebook, entering the information into a spreadsheet, or
assigning hashtags to items in a digital gratitude journal.</p>
<p>Create a bull market. Financial markets boom when increasing numbers
of investors want in. Likewise, our own resilience grows when we
encourage positivity buyers to enter the market. It’s not a difficult
task; positivity is socially contagious. In the research behind their
book Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They
Shape Our Lives, Harvard’s Nicholas Christakis and the University of
California, San Diego’s James Fowler detail how happiness depends not
just on our own choices and actions, but also on those of people who are
two or even three degrees removed from us. What this means is by being
more positive ourselves, we encourage others to do the same, and this in
turn creates a virtuous “reverse run on the bank” positive feedback
loop, and our own resilience is increased and strengthened by the
actions of others.</p>
<p>Take a portfolio approach. Resilient businesses diversify risk.
Accordingly, resilient individuals diversify their positivity currency.
They look to increase their overall resilience by evaluating what it is
that provides the highest returns across their entire “life portfolio”
and then investing more in those areas. Most frequently, these
high-return assets come from our lives outside of the office. Indeed,
while we may spend the majority of waking hours at work, our job should
not be central to our overall positive outlook. In a 2015 report
entitled “The Happiness Study” from Blackhawk Engagement Solutions,
respondents ranked their jobs eighth out of a list of 12 contributors to
overall happiness. Ranking in the top spots were family, friends,
health, hobbies, and community.3 It follows that by generating more
positivity currency in those areas, you will increase the ability to
bring your best self to work.</p>
<p>Report regularly. Finally, just as regular review of a company’s
financials is important to building a resilient business, building
individual resilience requires regular review of positivity currency
data. This review not only enables you to glean insights and take
corrective actions, but also to boost your resilience by simply
increasing your exposure to positive interactions and expressions of
gratitude. As suggested in a famous 2014 experiment conducted by
Facebook’s data scientists and published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, if your
news feed skews positive, so will you.4</p>
<p>Even if you don’t analyze your positivity currency data deeply like a
Wall Street quant, just exposing yourself to it on a regular basis will
make you more resilient. So find a regular time to celebrate and reflect
on your positivity currency (I do it while I wait for my morning
coffee). Make it a habit, and your level of resilience—and that of your
friends, family, and coworkers—will rise.</p>
