<h4 id="mindfulness-can-literally-change-your-brain">2 Mindfulness Can
Literally Change Your Brain</h4>
<p>By Christina Congleton, Britta K. Hölzel, and Sara W. Lazar</p>
<p>The business world is abuzz with mindfulness. But perhaps you haven’t
heard that the hype is backed by hard science. Recent research provides
strong evidence that practicing nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness
(aka mindfulness) changes the brain, and it does so in ways that anyone
working in today’s complex business environment—and certainly every
leader—should know about.1</p>
<p>We contributed to this research in 2011 with a study on participants
who completed an eight-week mindfulness program.2 We observed
significant increases in the density of their gray matter. In the years
since, neuroscience laboratories from around the world have also
investigated ways in which meditation, one key way to practice
mindfulness, changes the brain. This year, a team of scientists from the
University of British Columbia and the Chemnitz University of Technology
were able to pool data from more than 20 studies to determine which
areas of the brain are consistently affected.3 They identified at least
eight different regions. Here we will focus on two that we believe to be
of particular interest to business professionals.</p>
<p>The first is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a structure located
deep inside the forehead, behind the brain’s frontal lobe. The ACC is
associated with self-regulation, meaning the ability to purposefully
direct attention and behavior, suppress inappropriate knee-jerk
responses, and switch strategies flexibly.4 People with damage to the
ACC show impulsivity and unchecked aggression, and those with impaired
connections between this and other brain regions perform poorly on tests
of mental flexibility: They hold onto ineffective problem-solving
strategies rather than adapting their behavior.5 Meditators, on the
other hand, demonstrate superior performance on tests of
self-regulation, resisting distractions and making correct answers more
often than nonmeditators.6 They also show more activity in the ACC than
nonmeditators.7 In addition to self-regulation, the ACC is associated
with learning from past experience to support optimal decision making.8
Scientists point out that the ACC may be particularly important in the
face of uncertain and fast-changing conditions.</p>
<p>The second brain region we want to highlight is the hippocampus, a
region that showed increased amounts of gray matter in the brains of our
2011 mindfulness program participants. This seahorse-shaped area is
buried inside the temple on each side of the brain and is part of the
limbic system, a set of inner structures associated with emotion and
memory. It is covered in receptors for the stress hormone cortisol, and
studies have shown that it can be damaged by chronic stress,
contributing to a harmful spiral in the body.9 Indeed, people with
stress-related disorders like depression and PTSD tend to have a smaller
hippocampus.10 All of this points to the importance of this brain area
in resilience—another key skill in the current high-demand business
world.</p>
<p>These findings are just the beginning of the story. Neuroscientists
have also shown that practicing mindfulness affects brain areas related
to perception, body awareness, pain tolerance, emotion regulation,
introspection, complex thinking, and sense of self. While more research
is needed to document these changes over time and to understand
underlying mechanisms, the converging evidence is compelling.</p>
<p>Mindfulness should no longer be considered a “nice to have” for
executives. It’s a “must have”: a way to keep our brains healthy, to
support self-regulation and effective decision-making capabilities, and
to protect ourselves from toxic stress. It can be integrated into one’s
religious or spiritual life or practiced as a form of secular mental
training. When we take a seat, take a breath, and commit to being
mindful—particularly when we gather with others who are doing the
same—we have the potential to be changed.</p>
<p>CHRISTINA CONGLETON is a leadership and change consultant at Axon
Leadership, and has researched stress and the brain at Massachusetts
General Hospital and the University of Denver. She holds a master’s
degree in human development and psychology from Harvard University.
BRITTA K. HÖLZEL conducts MRI research to investigate the neural
mechanisms of mindfulness practice. Previously a research fellow at
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, she currently
works at the Technical University Munich. She holds a doctorate in
psychology from Giessen University in Germany. SARA W. LAZAR is an
associate researcher in the psychiatry department at Massachusetts
General Hospital and an assistant professor in psychology at Harvard
Medical School. The focus of her research is to elucidate the neural
mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of yoga and meditation,
both in clinical settings and in healthy individuals.</p>
