<h4 id="what-is-empathy">1 What Is Empathy</h4>
<p>By Daniel Goleman</p>
<p>The word “attention” comes from the Latin attendere, meaning “to
reach toward.” This is a perfect definition of focus on others, which is
the foundation of empathy and of an ability to build social
relationships—the second and third pillars of emotional intelligence
(the first is self-awareness).</p>
<p>Executives who can effectively focus on others are easy to recognize.
They are the ones who find common ground, whose opinions carry the most
weight, and with whom other people want to work. They emerge as natural
leaders regardless of organizational or social rank.</p>
<p>The Empathy Triad</p>
<p>We talk about empathy most commonly as a single attribute. But a
close look at where leaders are focusing when they exhibit it reveals
three distinct kinds of empathy, each important for leadership
effectiveness:</p>
<p>Cognitive empathy: the ability to understand another person’s
perspective</p>
<p>Emotional empathy: the ability to feel what someone else feels</p>
<p>Empathic concern: the ability to sense what another person needs from
you</p>
<p>Cognitive empathy enables leaders to explain themselves in meaningful
ways—a skill essential to getting the best performance from their direct
reports. Contrary to what you might expect, exercising cognitive empathy
requires leaders to think about feelings rather than to feel them
directly.</p>
<p>An inquisitive nature feeds cognitive empathy. As one successful
executive with this trait puts it, “I’ve always just wanted to learn
everything, to understand anybody that I was around—why they thought
what they did, why they did what they did, what worked for them and what
didn’t work.” But cognitive empathy is also an outgrowth of
self-awareness. The executive circuits that allow us to think about our
own thoughts and to monitor the feelings that flow from them let us
apply the same reasoning to other people’s minds when we choose to
direct our attention that way.</p>
<p>Emotional empathy is important for effective mentoring, managing
clients, and reading group dynamics. It springs from ancient parts of
the brain beneath the cortex—the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the
hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal cortex—that allow us to feel fast
without thinking deeply. They tune us in by arousing in our bodies the
emotional states of others: I literally feel your pain. My brain
patterns match up with yours when I listen to you tell a gripping story.
As Tania Singer, the director of the social neuroscience department at
the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, in
Leipzig, Germany, says, “You need to understand your own feelings to
understand the feelings of others.” Accessing your capacity for
emotional empathy depends on combining two kinds of attention: a
deliberate focus on your own echoes of someone else’s feelings and an
open awareness of that person’s face, voice, and other external signs of
emotion. (See the sidebar “When Empathy Needs to Be Learned.”)</p>
<p>WHEN EMPATHY NEEDS TO BE LEARNED</p>
<p>Emotional empathy can be developed. That’s the conclusion suggested
by research conducted with physicians by Helen Riess, the director of
the Empathy and Relational Science Program at Boston’s Massachusetts
General Hospital. To help the physicians monitor themselves, Riess set
up a program in which they learned to focus using deep, diaphragmatic
breathing and to cultivate a certain detachment—to watch an interaction
from the ceiling, as it were, rather than being lost in their own
thoughts and feelings. “Suspending your own involvement to observe
what’s going on gives you a mindful awareness of the interaction without
being completely reactive,” says Riess. “You can see if your own
physiology is charged up or balanced. You can notice what’s transpiring
in the situation.” If a doctor realizes that she’s feeling irritated,
for instance, that may be a signal that the patient is bothered too.</p>
<p>Those who are utterly at a loss may be able to prime emotional
empathy essentially by faking it until they make it, Riess adds. If you
act in a caring way—looking people in the eye and paying attention to
their expressions, even when you don’t particularly want to—you may
start to feel more engaged.</p>
<p>Empathic concern, which is closely related to emotional empathy,
enables you to sense not just how people feel but what they need from
you. It’s what you want in your doctor, your spouse—and your boss.
Empathic concern has its roots in the circuitry that compels parents’
attention to their children. Watch where people’s eyes go when someone
brings an adorable baby into a room, and you’ll see this mammalian brain
center leaping into action.</p>
<p>Research suggests that as people rise through the ranks, their
ability to maintain personal connections suffers.</p>
<p>One neural theory holds that the response is triggered in the
amygdala by the brain’s radar for sensing danger and in the prefrontal
cortex by the release of oxytocin, the chemical for caring. This implies
that empathic concern is a double-edged feeling. We intuitively
experience the distress of another as our own. But in deciding whether
we will meet that person’s needs, we deliberately weigh how much we
value his or her well-being.</p>
<p>Getting this intuition-deliberation mix right has great implications.
Those whose sympathetic feelings become too strong may themselves
suffer. In the helping professions, this can lead to compassion fatigue;
in executives, it can create distracting feelings of anxiety about
people and circumstances that are beyond anyone’s control. But those who
protect themselves by deadening their feelings may lose touch with
empathy. Empathic concern requires us to manage our personal distress
without numbing ourselves to the pain of others. (See the sidebar “When
Empathy Needs to Be Controlled.”)</p>
<p>DANIEL GOLEMAN is a codirector of the Consortium for Research on
Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at Rutgers University, coauthor
of Primal Leadership: Leading with Emotional Intelligence (Harvard
Business Review Press, 2013), and author of The Brain and Emotional
Intelligence: New Insights and Leadership: Selected Writings (More Than
Sound, 2011). His latest book is A Force For Good: The Dalai Lama’s
Vision for Our World (Bantam, 2015).</p>
<p>Excerpted from “The Focused Leader,” adapted from Harvard Business
Review, December 2013 (product #R0205B).</p>
<p>WHEN EMPATHY NEEDS TO BE CONTROLLED</p>
<p>Getting a grip on our impulse to empathize with other people’s
feelings can help us make better decisions when someone’s emotional
flood threatens to overwhelm us.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, when we see someone pricked with a pin, our brains emit a
signal indicating that our own pain centers are echoing that distress.
But physicians learn in medical school to block even such automatic
responses. Their attentional anesthetic seems to be deployed by the
temporal-parietal junction and regions of the prefrontal cortex, a
circuit that boosts concentration by tuning out emotions. That’s what is
happening in your brain when you distance yourself from others in order
to stay calm and help them. The same neural network kicks in when we see
a problem in an emotionally overheated environment and need to focus on
looking for a solution. If you’re talking with someone who is upset,
this system helps you understand the person’s perspective intellectually
by shifting from the heart-to-heart of emotional empathy to the
head-to-heart of cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>What’s more, some lab research suggests that the appropriate
application of empathic concern is critical to making moral judgments.
Brain scans have revealed that when volunteers listened to tales of
people being subjected to physical pain, their own brain centers for
experiencing such pain lit up instantly. But if the story was about
psychological suffering, the higher brain centers involved in empathic
concern and compassion took longer to activate. Some time is needed to
grasp the psychological and moral dimensions of a situation. The more
distracted we are, the less we can cultivate the subtler forms of
empathy and compassion.</p>
