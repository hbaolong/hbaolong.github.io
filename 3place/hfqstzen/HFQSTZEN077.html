Research: Learning a Little About Something Makes Us Overconfident</h4>
<p>By Carmen Sanchez and David Dunning</p>
<p>As former baseball pitcher Vernon Law once put it, experience is a
hard teacher because it gives the test first, and only then provides the
lesson.</p>
<p>Perhaps this observation can explain the results of a survey
sponsored by the Association of American Colleges andandandand
Universities. Among college students, 64% said they were well prepared
to work in a team, 66% thought they had adequate critical thinking
skills, and 65% said they were proficient in written communication.
However, among employers who had recently hired college students, fewer
than 40% agreed with any of those statements. The students thought they
were much further along in the learning curve toward workplace success
than their future employers did.1</p>
<p>Overconfidence among beginners</p>
<p>Our research focuses on overconfidence as people tackle new
challenges and learn. To be a beginner is to be susceptible to undue
optimism and confidence. Our work is devoted to exploring the exact
shape and timeline of that overconfidence.</p>
<p>One common theory is that beginners start off overconfident. They
start a new task or job as “unconscious incompetents,” not knowing what
they don’t know. Their inevitable early mistakes and miscues prompt them
to become conscious of their shortcomings.</p>
<p>Our work, however, suggests the opposite. Absolute beginners can be
perfectly conscious and cautious about what they don’t know; the
unconscious incompetence is instead something they grow into. A little
experience replaces their caution with a false sense of competence.</p>
<p>Specifically, our research focused on the common task of
probabilistic learning in which people learn to read cues from the
environment to predict some outcome.2 For example, people must rely on
multiple signals from the environment to predict which company’s stock
will rise, which applicant will do the best job, or which illness a
patient is suffering from. These can be hard tasks—and even the most
expert of experts will at times make the wrong prediction—but a decision
is often essential in many settings.</p>
<p>In a laboratory study, we asked participants to imagine they were
medical residents in a post-apocalyptic world that has been overrun by
zombies. (We were confident that this would be a new scenario to all our
participants, allowing them all to start as total novices.) Their job,
over 60 repeated trials, was to review the symptoms of a patient, such
as whether the patient had glossy eyes, an abscess, or brain
inflammation, and diagnose whether the patient was healthy or infected
with one of two zombie diseases. Participants needed to learn, by trial
and error, which symptoms to rely on to identify zombie infections. Much
as in a real-world medical diagnosis of a (non-zombie) condition, the
symptoms were informative but fallible clues. There were certain
symptoms that made one diagnosis more likely, but those symptoms were
not always present. Other potential symptoms were simple red herrings.
Participants diagnosed patients one at a time, receiving feedback after
every diagnosis.</p>
<p>The beginner’s bubble</p>
<p>We found that people slowly and gradually learned how to perform this
task, though they found it quite challenging. Their performance
incrementally improved with each patient.</p>
<p>Confidence, however, took quite a different journey. In each study,
participants started out well-calibrated about how accurate their
diagnoses would prove to be. They began thinking they were right 50% of
the time, when their actual accuracy rate was 55%. However, after just a
few patients, their confidence began skyrocketing, far ahead of any
accuracy they achieved. Soon, participants estimated their accuracy rate
was 73% when it had not hit even 60%. (See figure 1.)</p>
<p>It appears that Alexander Pope was right when he said that a little
learning is a dangerous thing. In our studies, just a little learning
was enough to make participants feel they had learned the task. After a
few tries, they were as confident in their judgments as they were ever
going to be throughout the entire experiment. They had, as we termed it,
entered into a “beginner’s bubble” of overconfidence.</p>
<p>FIGURE 1</p>
<hr />
<p>Total novices lack confidence, but as their confidence grows, it
outpaces accuracy</p>
<p>In a lab experiment, “doctors” quickly began to overestimate their
diagnostic ability.</p>
<p>Source: “Overconfidence Among Beginners: Is a Little Learning a
Dangerous Thing?” by Carmen Sanchez and David Dunning, Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, 2018.</p>
<p>What produced this quick inflation of confidence? In a follow-up
study, we found that it arose because participants far too exuberantly
formed quick, self-assured ideas about how to approach the medical
diagnosis task based on only the slimmest amount of data. Small bits of
data, however, are often filled with noise and misleading signs. It
usually takes a large amount of data to strip away the chaos of the
world, to finally see the worthwhile signal. However, classic research
has shown that people do not have a feel for this fact.3 They assume
that every small sequence of data represents the world just as well as
long sequences do.</p>
<p>But our studies suggested that people do eventually learn—somewhat.
After participants formed their bubble, their overconfidence often
leveled off and slightly declined. People soon learned that they had to
correct their initial, frequently misguided theories, and they did. But
after a correction phase, confidence began to rise again, with accuracy
never rising enough to meet it. It is important to note that although we
did not predict the second peak in confidence, it consistently appeared
throughout all of our studies. (See figure 2.)</p>
<p>FIGURE 2</p>
<hr />
<p>Overconfidence declines—slightly—with experience</p>
<p>But according to a lab experiment mimicking hospital visits, you
can’t keep it down for long.</p>
<p>Source: “Overconfidence Among Beginners: Is a Little Learning a
Dangerous Thing?” by Carmen Sanchez and David Dunning, Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, 2018.</p>
<p>A real-world bubble</p>
<p>The real world follows this pattern. Other research has found that
doctors learning to do spinal surgery usually do not begin to make
mistakes until their 15th iteration of the surgery.4 Similarly,
beginning pilots produce few accidents—but then their accident rate
begins to rise until it peaks at about 800 flight hours, where it begins
to drop again.5</p>
<p>We also found signs of the beginner’s bubble outside of the
laboratory. As with probabilistic learning, it has been shown that most
people under the age of 18 have little knowledge of personal finance.6
Most primary and secondary educational systems do not teach financial
literacy. As such, personal finance is something most learn by trial and
error.</p>
<p>We found echoes of our laboratory results across the life span in
surveys on financial capability conducted by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.7 Each survey comprised a nationally representative
sample of 25,000 respondents who took a brief financial literacy test
and reported how knowledgeable about personal finance they believed they
were. Much like in the laboratory, both surveys showed that real
financial literacy rose slowly, incrementally, and uniformly across age
groups.</p>
<p>Self-confidence, however, surged between late adolescence and young
adulthood, then leveled off among older respondents until late
adulthood, where it began to rise again—a result perfectly consistent
with our laboratory pattern.</p>
<p>It is important to note that our work has several limitations. In our
experiments, participants received perfect feedback after each trial. In
life, consistent feedback like this is often unavailable. Also, our
tasks traced how confidence changed as people learned truly novel tasks.
There are plenty of tasks people learn in which they can apply previous
knowledge to the new task. We do not know how confidence would change in
these situations. Relatedly, we cannot be certain what would happen to
overconfidence after the 60th trial.</p>
<p>With that said, our studies suggest that the work of a beginner might
be doubly hard. Of course, the beginner must struggle to learn—but the
beginner must also guard against an illusion they have learned too
quickly. Perhaps Alexander Pope suggested the best remedy for this
beginner’s bubble when he said that if a few shallow draughts of
experience intoxicate the brain, the only cure was to continue drinking
until we are sober again.</p>

Psychology at Cornell University. She studies how perceptions of
abilities change as people learn, cultural differences in
self-enhancement, and financial decision-making. DAVID DUNNING is a
Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan. His research
focuses on the psychology of human misbelief, particularly false beliefs
people hold about themselves.</p>
