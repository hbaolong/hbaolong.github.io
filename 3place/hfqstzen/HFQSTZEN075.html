Everyone Suffers from Impostor Syndrome—Here’s How to Handle It</h4>
<p>By Andy Molinsky</p>
<p>One of the greatest barriers to moving outside your comfort zone is
the fear that you’re a poser, that you’re not worthy, that you couldn’t
possibly be qualified to do whatever you’re aiming to do. It’s a fear
that strikes many of us: impostor syndrome.</p>
<p>I know I’ve certainly had those thoughts while publishing pieces of
writing, whether it’s blogs or books. I’ve had them while teaching my
first university classes and giving speeches to corporate audiences. I
appear confident on the outside but feel deeply insecure on the inside,
wondering who I am to be stepping up to this stage. What could I
possibly have to say that anyone would want to hear?</p>
<p>And I’m not alone. Actress (and Harvard alum) Natalie Portman
described the self-doubt she experienced as a Harvard student in a
poignant commencement speech several years ago. “I felt like there had
been some mistake,” she said, “that I wasn’t smart enough to be in this
company, and that every time I opened my mouth I would have to prove
that I wasn’t just a dumb actress.” Howard Schultz, the former executive
chairman and CEO of Starbucks, revealed that he and CEOs he knows feel
the same way: “Very few people, whether you’ve been in that job before
or not, get into the seat and believe today that they are now qualified
to be the CEO. They’re not going to tell you that, but it’s true.”1</p>
<p>What can you do to overcome these feelings of inadequacy that so many
of us experience?</p>
<p>A first tip is something that Portman highlights in her Harvard
address, which I’ve found quite helpful: Recognize the benefits of being
a novice. You might not realize it, but there are great benefits to
being new in your field. When you are not steeped in the conventional
wisdom of a given profession, you can ask questions that haven’t been
asked before or approach problems in ways others haven’t thought of.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise, for example, that some of the best research ideas I
get as a professor come from undergraduate students with little previous
experience, people who can think with a fresh outsider’s perspective.
This is true in business as well. The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly
has created a crowdsourcing platform called InnoCentive, through which
outside innovators are paid to solve vexing problems the company faces.
And it works! In fact, according to a study by Karim Lakhani of Harvard
Business School, many problems are solved by those from outside the
field in question—physicists solving chemistry problems, for example.2
So the next time you feel inadequate in a particular domain, remember
that as an outsider to the role in question, you might have the most
critical perspective of all.</p>
<p>A second tip for combating impostor syndrome is to focus more on what
you’re learning than on how you’re performing. According to psychologist
Carol Dweck, the feelings that impostor syndrome leaves you with are
ones we might actually be able to control.3 With a performance mindset,
which people suffering from impostor syndrome often have, you tend to
see your feelings of inadequacy or the mistakes you make as evidence of
your underlying limitations. This mindset only fuels the concerns you
have about being unfit for your job. But there’s something you can work
to cultivate instead: a learning mindset. From this perspective, your
limitations are experienced quite differently. Your mistakes are seen as
an inevitable part of the learning process rather than as more evidence
of your underlying failings.</p>
<p>That brings us to the third tip: Understand the power of perspective.
Those of us who experience impostor syndrome often feel like we’re the
only ones feeling this way, but reality is very different. Early in my
career, when I walked into a networking event, I was convinced that I
was the only one worried about making small talk with strangers. But
over time, I’ve realized that practically everyone in the room shares
that same concern. According to a recent survey by Vantage Hill
Partners, being found incompetent is the number-one fear of executives
worldwide.4 So if you’re feeling like an impostor, chances are that
others in your situation feel the exact same way. Or, as Tina Fey once
quipped, “I’ve realized that almost everyone is a fraud, so I try not to
feel too bad about it.”5</p>
<p>It may not be easy, but overcoming impostor syndrome is possible—you
don’t need to feel helpless or alone. Next time you’re in a situation
that feels completely outside your comfort zone, don’t focus on your
failures. Consider it your opportunity to learn from your missteps and
to bring forth a new perspective that others may not have.</p>

Brandeis International Business School. He’s the author of Global
Dexterity: How to Adapt Your Behavior Across Cultures Without Losing
Yourself in the Process and Reach: A New Strategy to Help You Step
Outside Your Comfort Zone, Rise to the Challenge, and Build
Confidence.</p>
