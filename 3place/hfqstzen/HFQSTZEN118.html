Shakespeare’s Characters Show Us How Personal Growth Should Happen</h4>
<p>By Declan Fitzsimons</p>
<p>Norman Mailer once wrote that there is a cruel but just law of life
that says we must change or pay an increasing cost for remaining the
same.</p>
<p>As a leadership scholar teaching in a business school, I encounter
leaders daily for whom this “law” is a very real and disquieting one.
They know what will happen if they don’t make the changes to their
businesses, but they are not so sure what they should do to support
those changes. Is it about learning how to run more effective team
meetings? Or how to be better listeners? Or adopting a different
leadership style to bring about a shift in organizational culture?</p>
<p>While there is no formulaic answer to these questions, there are some
fundamentals without which no amount of skills development is ever going
to work. One source of insight into what these fundamentals might look
like is the work of an author whose work has never been out of print for
over 400 years: William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In the opening chapter of his book Shakespeare: The Invention of the
Human, Harold Bloom, who has taught Shakespeare at Yale for 30 years,
suggests that before Shakespeare, characters in plays would unfold but
not necessarily develop.</p>
<p>If a character merely unfolds, we intuit correctly that we already
know all there is to know about them when they first appear onstage.
Their authors have robbed them of the one quality that would make them
interesting: the capacity for self-inquiry that might reveal something
unexpected not only to us but also to themselves. They teach us little
because they cannot surprise us, essentially because they cannot
surprise themselves. This is the real-world equivalent of the manager
who comes out of a feedback session and thinks, “Nothing new—the same
feedback as I have heard before,” and then says to themselves, “I guess
I am what I am!” or “I have my way of doing things, and some people like
it and some people don’t.”</p>
<p>Shakespeare does not let us off the hook so easily. He shows us that
we are not simply who we say we are, but instead are made up of many
conflicting and unknown parts. As Bloom puts it, Shakespeare’s
characters develop because they have the ability to overhear themselves
talk, either to themselves or to others, and are thus able to reconceive
themselves. By endowing his characters with complex inner worlds,
Shakespeare treats us, 400 years before Freud, to virtuoso displays of
what to the modern ear sounds very much like self-discovery. There is
not one Hamlet but many. After learning of his father’s murder, he
discovers in soliloquies of stunning intensity that he cannot bear to
remain as he is. So tortured is he by his inner conflicts that he
considers, in perhaps the most famous soliloquy in all literature, the
pros and cons of suicide (“to be or not to be”).</p>
<p>We are mesmerized—not simply through the beauty of the language, but
because we realize that he is hearing these things for the first time.
And no matter how many times we see the play, we never tire of it,
because it is at such moments that Hamlet, while in real danger of
unraveling, is at the same time exquisitely vulnerable and thus truly
human.</p>
<p>Shakespeare shows us through Hamlet and other characters not only the
sine qua non of human development—that in order to change ourselves, we
must first discover ourselves—but also what that development sounds
like, looks like, and feels like. He shows us that it is the moment when
Hamlet is so close to falling apart that he is able to fall together. In
like fashion, the young Prince Hal, in Henry IV, Part 2, on becoming
king, shuns his former companions (“Presume not that I am the thing I
was”) and begins his extraordinary transformation from profligate prince
to King Henry V, hero of Agincourt.</p>
<p>For us, far away from the dramatic intensity of fictional characters,
the point is not that we can change only if we contemplate killing
ourselves or turn our backs on our friends; change is rather about
moving toward, rather than away from, the anxieties that powerful
external challenges provoke in our internal worlds. Hamlet was able to
face his own inertia and cowardice; Hal was able to confront and thus
transcend his dissolute lifestyle and embrace a new identity fit for a
king. But both were possible only after the characters became willing to
discover what lay within.</p>
<p>Shakespeare teaches us moderns that in the face of an uncertain
world, self-awareness—that much-vaunted leadership quality—is only
worthy of the name when it is revelatory. And it can only be revelatory
when we are willing to concede that we know ourselves only
partially.</p>
<p>Development, then, is less about changing ourselves by learning new
skills than about discovering ourselves by giving something up—including
some of our most cherished notions of the person we think we are—in
order to discover the person we could become.</p>

INSEAD. He researches and consults to companies planning and
implementing shared leadership.</p>
