<h4 id="three-ways-leaders-can-listen-with-more-empathy">4 Three Ways
Leaders Can Listen with More Empathy</h4>
<p>By Christine M. Riordan</p>
<p>Study after study has shown that listening is critical to leadership
effectiveness. So why are so few leaders good at it?</p>
<p>Too often, leaders seek to take command, direct conversations, talk
too much, or worry about what they will say next in defense or rebuttal.
Additionally, leaders can react quickly, get distracted during a
conversation, or fail to make the time to listen to others. Finally,
leaders can be ineffective at listening if they are competitive, if they
multitask such as by reading emails or text messages, or if they let
their egos get in the way of listening to what others have to say.</p>
<p>Instead, leaders need to start by really caring about what other
people have to say about an issue. Research also shows that active
listening, combined with empathy or trying to understand others’
perspectives and points of view, is the most effective form of
listening.1 Henry Ford once said, “If there is any great secret of
success in life, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point
of view and to see things from that person’s angle as well as from one’s
own.”</p>
<p>Research has linked several notable behavior sets with empathic
listening.2 The first behavior set involves recognizing all verbal and
nonverbal cues, including tone, facial expressions, and other body
language. In short, leaders receive information through all senses, not
just hearing. Sensitive leaders pay attention to what others are not
saying and probe a bit deeper. They also understand how others are
feeling and acknowledge those feelings. Sample phrases include, “Thank
you for sharing how you feel about this situation, it is important to
understand where everyone is coming from on the issue,” “Would you share
a bit more on your thoughts on this situation,” and “You seem excited
(happy, upset) about this situation, and I would like to hear more about
your perspective.”</p>
<p>The second set of empathic listening behaviors is processing, which
includes the behaviors we most commonly associate with listening. It
involves understanding the meaning of the messages and keeping track of
the points of the conversation. Leaders who are effective at processing
assure others that they are remembering what others say, summarize
points of agreement and disagreement, and capture global themes and key
messages from the conversation. Sample phrases include, “Here are a
couple of key points that I heard from this meeting,” “Here are our
points of agreement and disagreement,” “Here are a few more pieces of
information we should gather,” and “Here are some suggested next
steps—what do you think?”</p>
<p>The third set of behaviors, responding, involves assuring others that
listening has occurred and encouraging communication to continue.
Leaders who are effective responders give appropriate replies through
verbal acknowledgments, deep and clarifying questioning, or
paraphrasing. Important non verbal behaviors include facial expressions,
eye contact, and body language. Other effective responses might include
head nods, full engagement in the conversation, and the use of
acknowledging phrases such as “That is a great point.”</p>
<p>Overall, it is important for leaders to recognize the
multidimensionality of empathetic listening and engage in all forms of
behaviors. Among its benefits are that empathic listening builds trust
and respect, enables people to reveal their emotions (including
tensions), facilitates openness of information sharing, and creates an
environment that encourages collaborative problem-solving.</p>
<p>Beyond exhibiting the behaviors associated with empathetic listening,
follow-up is an important step to ensure that others understand that
true listening has occurred. This assurance may come in the form of
incorporating feedback and making changes, following through on promises
made in meetings, summarizing the meeting through notes, or—if the
leader is not incorporating the feedback—explaining why they made other
decisions. In short, the leader can find many ways to demonstrate that
they have heard the messages.</p>
<p>The ability and willingness to listen with empathy is often what sets
a leader apart. Hearing words is not adequate; the leader truly needs to
work at understanding the position and perspective of the others
involved in the conversation. In an interview, Paul Bennett, chief
creative officer at IDEO, advises leaders to listen more and ask the
right questions. Bennett shared that, “For most of my twenties, I
assumed that the world was more interested in me than I was in it, so I
spent most of my time talking, usually in a quite uninformed way, about
whatever I thought, rushing to be clever, thinking about what I was
going to say to someone rather than listening to what they were saying
to me.”3</p>
<p>Slowing down, engaging with others rather than endlessly debating,
taking the time to hear and learn from others, and asking brilliant
questions are ultimately the keys to success.</p>

the University of Kentucky. Her research focuses on labor force
diversity issues, leadership effectiveness, and career success.</p>
