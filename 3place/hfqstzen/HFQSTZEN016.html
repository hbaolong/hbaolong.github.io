Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure</h4>
<p>By Shawn Achor and Michelle Gielan</p>
<p>As constant travelers and parents of a 2-year-old, we sometimes
fantasize about how much work we can do when one of us gets on a plane,
undistracted by phones, friends, and Finding Nemo. We race to get all
our ground work done: packing, going through TSA, doing a last-minute
work call, calling each other, boarding the plane. Then, when we try to
have that amazing in-flight work session, we get nothing done. Even
worse, after refreshing our email or reading the same studies over and
over, we are too exhausted when we land to soldier on with the emails
that have inevitably still piled up.</p>
<p>Why should flying deplete us? We’re just sitting there doing nothing.
Why can’t we be tougher—more resilient and determined in our work—so we
can accomplish all of the goals we set for ourselves? Through our
current research, we have come to realize that the problem is not our
hectic schedule or the plane travel itself; the problem comes from a
misunderstanding of what it means to be resilient and the resulting
impact of overworking.</p>
<p>We often take a militaristic, “tough” approach to resilience and
grit. We imagine a marine slogging through the mud, a boxer going one
more round, or a football player picking himself up off the turf for one
more play. We believe that the longer we tough it out, the tougher we
are, and therefore the more successful we will be. However, this entire
conception is scientifically inaccurate.</p>
<p>The very lack of a recovery period is dramatically holding back our
collective ability to be resilient and successful. Research has found
that there is a direct correlation between lack of recovery and
increased incidence of health and safety problems.1 And lack of
recovery—whether by disrupting sleep with thoughts of work or having
continuous cognitive arousal by watching our phones—is costing our
companies 2 billion a year (that’s billion, not million) in lost
productivity.2</p>
<p>And just because work stops, it doesn’t mean we are recovering. We
“stop” work sometimes at 5 p.m., but then we spend the night wrestling
with solutions to work problems, talking about our work over dinner, and
falling asleep thinking about how much work we’ll do tomorrow. In a
study released last month, researchers from Norway found that 7.8% of
Norwegians have become workaholics.3 The scientists cite a definition of
“workaholism” as “being overly concerned about work, driven by an
uncontrollable work motivation, and investing so much time and effort to
work that it impairs other important life areas.”4</p>
<p>We believe that this definition applies to the majority of American
workers (including those who read HBR), and this prompted us to begin a
study of workaholism in the United States. Our study will use a large
corporate data set from a major medical company to examine how
technology extends our working hours and thus interferes with necessary
cognitive recovery. We believe this is resulting in huge health care
costs and high turnover rates for employers.</p>
<p>Misconceptions about resilience is often bred from an early age.
Parents trying to teach their children resilience might celebrate a high
school student staying up until 3 a.m. to finish a science fair project.
What a distortion of resilience! A resilient child is a well-rested one.
When an exhausted student goes to school, he risks hurting everyone on
the road with his impaired driving, he doesn’t have the cognitive
resources to do well on his English test, he has lower self-control with
his friends, and at home, he is moody with his parents. Overwork and
exhaustion are the opposite of resilience. And the bad habits we learn
when we’re young only magnify when we hit the workforce.</p>
<p>In her excellent book The Sleep Revolution, Arianna Huffington wrote,
“We sacrifice sleep in the name of productivity, but ironically our loss
of sleep, despite the extra hours we spend at work, adds up to 11 days
of lost productivity per year per worker, or about ,280.”</p>
<p>The key to resilience is trying really hard, then stopping,
recovering, and then trying again. This conclusion is based on biology.
Homeostasis is a fundamental biological concept describing the ability
of the brain to continuously restore and sustain wellbeing.5 Positive
neuroscientist Brent Furl from Texas AandandandandM University coined
the term “homeostatic value” to describe the value that certain actions
have for creating equilibrium, and thus well-being, in the body. When
the body is out of alignment from overworking, we waste vast mental and
physical resources trying to return to balance before we can move
forward.</p>
<p>As Power of Full Engagement authors Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz have
written, if you have too much time in the performance zone, you need
more time in the recovery zone; otherwise you risk burnout. Mustering
your resources to “try hard” requires burning energy in order to
overcome your currently low arousal level. This is called
“upregulation.” It also exacerbates exhaustion. Thus, the more
imbalanced we become due to overworking, the more value there is in
activities that allow us to return to a state of balance. The value of a
recovery period rises in proportion to the amount of work required of
us.</p>
<p>So how do we recover and build resilience? Most people assume that if
you stop doing a task like answering emails or writing a paper that your
brain will naturally recover, that when you start again later in the day
or the next morning, you’ll have your energy back. But surely everyone
reading this has had times when they lie in bed for hours, unable to
fall asleep because their brain is thinking about work. If you lie in
bed for eight hours, you may have rested, but you can still feel
exhausted the next day. That’s because rest and recovery are not the
same thing. Stopping does not equal recovering.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to build resilience at work, you need adequate
internal and external recovery periods. As researchers Fred R. H.
Zijlstra, Mark Cropley, and Leif W. Rydstedt write in their 2014 paper:
“Internal recovery refers to the shorter periods of relaxation that take
place within the frames of the workday or the work setting in the form
of short scheduled or unscheduled breaks, by shifting attention or
changing to other work tasks when the mental or physical resources
required for the initial task are temporarily depleted or exhausted.
External recovery refers to actions that take place outside of
work—e.g. in the free time between the workdays, and during weekends,
holidays or vacations.”6 If after work you lie around on your bed and
get riled up by political commentary on your phone or get stressed
thinking about decisions about how to renovate your home, your brain has
not received a break from high mental arousal states. Our brains need a
rest as much as our bodies do.</p>
<p>If you really want to build resilience, you can start by
strategically stopping. Give yourself the resources to be tough by
creating internal and external recovery periods. In her upcoming book
The Future of Happiness, based on her work at Yale Business School, Amy
Blankson describes how to strategically stop during the day by using
technology to control overworking.7 She suggests downloading the Instant
or Moment apps to see how many times you turn on your phone each day.
The average person turns on their phone 150 times every day.8 If every
distraction took only one minute (which would be seriously optimistic),
that would account for 2.5 hours of every day.</p>
<p>You can use apps like Offtime or Unplugged to create tech free zones
by strategically scheduling automatic airplane modes. In addition, you
can take a cognitive break every 90 minutes to recharge your batteries.
Try to not have lunch at your desk, but instead spend time outside or
with your friends—not talking about work. Take all of your paid time
off, which not only gives you recovery periods but raises your
productivity and the likelihood of promotion.9</p>
<p>As for us, we’ve started using our plane time as a work-free zone and
thus as time to dip into the recovery phase. The results have been
fantastic. We are usually tired already by the time we get on a plane,
and the cramped space and spotty internet connection make work more
challenging. Now, instead of swimming upstream, we relax, meditate,
sleep, watch movies, journal, or listen to entertaining podcasts. And
when we get off the plane, instead of being depleted, we feel
rejuvenated and ready to return to the performance zone.</p>
