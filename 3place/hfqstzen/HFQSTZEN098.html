<h4 id="the-focused-leader">1 The Focused Leader</h4>
<p>By Daniel Goleman</p>
<p>A primary task of leadership is to direct attention. To do so,
leaders must learn to focus their own attention. When we speak about
being focused, we commonly mean thinking about one thing while filtering
out distractions. But a wealth of recent research in neuroscience shows
that we focus in many ways, for different purposes, drawing on different
neural pathways—some of which work in concert, while others tend to
stand in opposition.</p>
<p>Grouping these modes of attention into three broad buckets—focusing
on yourself, focusing on others, and focusing on the wider world—sheds
new light on the practice of many essential leadership skills. Focusing
inward and focusing constructively on others helps leaders cultivate the
primary elements of emotional intelligence. A fuller under standing of
how they focus on the wider world can improve their ability to devise
strategy, innovate, and manage organizations.</p>
<p>Every leader needs to cultivate this triad of awareness, in abundance
and in the proper balance, because a failure to focus inward leaves you
rudderless, a failure to focus on others renders you clueless, and a
failure to focus outward may leave you blindsided.</p>
<p>Focusing on yourself</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence begins with self-awareness—getting in touch
with your inner voice. Leaders who heed their inner voices can draw on
more resources to make better decisions and connect with their authentic
selves. But what does that entail? A look at how people focus inward can
make this abstract concept more concrete.</p>
<p>Self-awareness</p>
<p>Hearing your inner voice is a matter of paying careful attention to
internal physiological signals. These subtle cues are monitored by the
insula, which is tucked behind the frontal lobes of the brain. Attention
given to any part of the body amps up the insula’s sensitivity to that
part. Tune in to your heartbeat, and the insula activates more neurons
in that circuitry. How well people can sense their heartbeats has, in
fact, become a standard way to measure their self-awareness.</p>
<p>Gut feelings are messages from the insula and the amygdala, which
neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, of the University of Southern
California, calls “somatic markers.” Those messages are sensations that
something “feels” right or wrong. Somatic markers simplify decision
making by guiding our attention toward better options. They’re hardly
foolproof (how often was that feeling that you left the stove on
correct?), so the more comprehensively we read them, the better we use
our intuition. (See the sidebar “Are You Skimming This Sidebar?”)</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the implications of an analysis of interviews
conducted by a group of British researchers with 118 professional
traders and 10 senior managers at four City of London investment banks.
The most-successful traders (whose annual income averaged £500,000) were
neither the ones who relied entirely on analytics nor the ones who just
went with their guts. They focused on a full range of emotions, which
they used to judge the value of their intuition. When they suffered
losses, they acknowledged their anxiety, became more cautious, and took
fewer risks. The least-successful traders (whose income averaged only
£100,000) tended to ignore their anxiety and keep going with their gut.
Because they failed to heed a wider array of internal signals, they were
misled.</p>
<p>Zeroing in on sensory impressions of ourselves in the moment is one
major element of self-awareness. But another is critical to leadership:
combining our experiences across time into a coherent view of our
authentic selves.</p>
<p>To be authentic is to be the same person to others as you are to
yourself. In part that entails paying attention to what others think of
you, particularly people whose opinions you esteem and who will be
candid in their feedback. A variety of focus that is useful here is open
awareness, in which we broadly notice what’s going on around us without
getting caught up in or swept away by any particular thing. In this mode
we don’t judge, censor, or tune out; we simply perceive.</p>
<p>Leaders who are more accustomed to giving input than to receiving it
may find this tricky. Someone who has trouble sustaining open awareness
typically gets snagged by irritating details, such as fellow travelers
in the airport security line who take forever getting their carry-ons
into the scanner. Someone who can keep her attention in open mode will
notice the travelers but not worry about them, and will take in more of
her surroundings. (See the sidebar “Expand Your Awareness.”)</p>
<p>ARE YOU SKIMMING THIS SIDEBAR?</p>
<p>Do you have trouble remembering what someone has just told you in
conversation? Did you drive to work this morning on autopilot? Do you
focus more on your smartphone than on the person you’re having lunch
with?</p>
<p>Attention is a mental muscle; like any other muscle, it can be
strengthened through the right kind of exercise. The fundamental rep for
building deliberate attention is simple: When your mind wanders, notice
that it has wandered, bring it back to your desired point of focus, and
keep it there as long as you can. That basic exercise is at the root of
virtually every kind of meditation. Meditation builds concentration and
calmness and facilitates recovery from the agitation of stress.</p>
<p>So does a video game called Tenacity, developed by a design group and
neuroscientists. The game offers a leisurely journey through any of half
a dozen scenes, from a barren desert to a fantasy staircase spiraling
heavenward. At the beginner’s level you tap an iPad screen with one
finger every time you exhale; the challenge is to tap two fingers with
every fifth breath. As you move to higher levels, you’re presented with
more distractions—a helicopter flies into view, a plane does a flip, a
flock of birds suddenly scuds by.</p>
<p>When players are attuned to the rhythm of their breathing, they
experience the strengthening of selective attention as a feeling of calm
focus, as in meditation. Stanford University is exploring that
connection at its Calming Technology Lab, which is developing relaxing
devices, such as a belt that detects your breathing rate. Should a
chock-full inbox, for instance, trigger what has been called “email
apnea,” an iPhone app can guide you through exercises to calm your
breathing and your mind.</p>
<p>Of course, being open to input doesn’t guarantee that someone will
provide it. Sadly, life affords us few chances to learn how others
really see us and even fewer for executives as they rise through the
ranks. That may be why one of the most popular and over-enrolled courses
at Harvard Business School is Bill George’s Authentic Leadership
Development, in which George has created what he calls True North groups
to heighten this aspect of self-awareness.</p>
<p>These groups (which anyone can form) are based on the precept that
self-knowledge begins with self-revelation. Accordingly, they are open
and intimate, “a safe place,” George explains, “where members can
discuss personal issues they do not feel they can raise elsewhere—often
not even with their closest family members.” What good does that do? “We
don’t know who we are until we hear ourselves speaking the story of our
lives to those we trust,” George says. It’s a structured way to match
our view of our true selves with the views our most trusted colleagues
have—an external check on our authenticity.</p>
<p>Self-control</p>
<p>“Cognitive control” is the scientific term for putting one’s
attention where one wants it and keeping it there in the face of
temptation to wander. This focus is one aspect of the brain’s executive
function, which is located in the prefrontal cortex. A colloquial term
for it is “willpower.”</p>
<p>Cognitive control enables executives to pursue a goal despite
distractions and setbacks. The same neural circuitry that allows such a
single-minded pursuit of goals also manages unruly emotions. Good
cognitive control can be seen in people who stay calm in a crisis, tame
their own agitation, and recover from a debacle or defeat.</p>
<p>EXPAND YOUR AWARENESS</p>
<p>Just as a camera lens can be set narrowly on a single point or more
widely to take in a panoramic view, you can focus tightly or
expansively.</p>
<p>One measure of open awareness presents people with a stream of
letters and numbers, such as S, K, O, E, 4, R, T, 2, H, P. In scanning
the stream, many people will notice the first number, 4, but after that
their attention blinks. Those firmly in open awareness mode will
register the second number as well.</p>
<p>Strengthening the ability to maintain open awareness requires leaders
to do something that verges on the unnatural: cultivate at least
sometimes a willingness to not be in control, not offer up their own
views, not judge others. That’s less a matter of deliberate action than
of attitude adjustment.</p>
<p>One path to making that adjustment is through the classic power of
positive thinking, because pessimism narrows our focus, whereas positive
emotions widen our attention and our receptiveness to the new and
unexpected. A simple way to shift into positive mode is to ask yourself,
“If everything worked out perfectly in my life, what would I be doing in
10 years?” Why is that effective? Because when you’re in an upbeat mood,
the University of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson has found,
your brain’s left prefrontal area lights up. That area harbors the
circuitry that reminds us how great we’ll feel when we reach some
long-sought goal.</p>
<p>“Talking about positive goals and dreams activates brain centers that
open you up to new possibilities,” says Richard Boyatzis, a psychologist
at Case Western Reserve. “But if you change the conversation to what you
should do to fix yourself, it closes you down . . . You need the
negative to survive but the positive to thrive.”</p>
<p>Decades’ worth of research demonstrates the singular importance of
willpower to leadership success. Particularly compelling is a
longitudinal study tracking the fates of all 1,037 children born during
a single year in the 1970s in the New Zealand city of Dunedin. For
several years during childhood the children were given a battery of
tests of willpower, including the psychologist Walter Mischel’s
legendary “marsh mallow test”—a choice between eating one marshmallow
right away and getting two by waiting 15 minutes. In Mischel’s
experiments, roughly a third of children grab the marshmallow on the
spot, another third hold out for a while longer, and a third manage to
make it through the entire quarter hour.</p>
<p>Years later, when the children in the Dunedin study were in their
thirties and all but 4% of them had been tracked down again, the
researchers found that those who’d had the cognitive control to resist
the marshmallow longest were significantly healthier, more successful
financially, and more law-abiding than the ones who’d been unable to
hold out at all. In fact, statistical analysis showed that a child’s
level of self-control was a more powerful predictor of financial success
than IQ, social class, or family circumstance.</p>
<p>How we focus holds the key to exercising willpower, Mischel says.
Three subvarieties of cognitive control are at play when you pit
self-restraint against self-gratification: the ability to voluntarily
dis engage your focus from an object of desire; the ability to resist
distraction so that you don’t gravitate back to that object; and the
ability to concentrate on the future goal and imagine how good you will
feel when you achieve it. As adults the children of Dunedin may have
been held hostage to their younger selves, but they need not have been,
because the power to focus can be developed. (See the sidebar “Learning
Self-Restraint.”)</p>
<p>LEARNING SELF-RESTRAINT</p>
<p>Quick, now. Here’s a test of cognitive control. In what direction is
the middle arrow in each row pointing?</p>
<p>The test, called the Eriksen Flanker Task, gauges your susceptibility
to distraction. When it’s taken under laboratory conditions, differences
of a thousandth of a second can be detected in the speed with which
subjects perceive which direction the middle arrows are pointing. The
stronger their cognitive control, the less susceptible they are to
distraction.</p>
<p>Interventions to strengthen cognitive control can be as
unsophisticated as a game of Simon Says or Red Light, Green Light—any
exercise in which you are asked to stop on cue. Research suggests that
the better a child gets at playing Musical Chairs, the stronger his or
her prefrontal wiring for cognitive control will become.</p>
<p>Operating on a similarly simple principle is a social and emotional
learning (SEL) method that’s used to strengthen cognitive control in
schoolchildren across the United States. When confronted by an upsetting
problem, the children are told to think of a traffic signal. The red
light means stop, calm down, and think before you act. The yellow light
means slow down and think of several possible solutions. The green light
means try out a plan and see how it works. Thinking in these terms
allows the children to shift away from amygdala-driven impulses to
prefrontal-driven deliberate behavior.</p>
<p>It’s never too late for adults to strengthen these circuits as well.
Daily sessions of mindfulness practice work in a way similar to Musical
Chairs and SEL. In these sessions you focus your attention on your
breathing and practice tracking your thoughts and feelings without
getting swept away by them. Whenever you notice that your mind has
wandered, you simply return it to your breath. It sounds easy—but try it
for 10 minutes, and you’ll find there’s a learning curve.</p>
<p>Focusing on others</p>
<p>The word “attention” comes from the Latin attendere, meaning “to
reach toward.” This is a perfect definition of focus on others, which is
the foundation of empathy and of an ability to build social
relationships—the second and third pillars of emotional
intelligence.</p>
<p>Executives who can effectively focus on others are easy to recognize.
They are the ones who find common ground, whose opinions carry the most
weight, and with whom other people want to work. They emerge as natural
leaders regardless of organizational or social rank.</p>
<p>The empathy triad</p>
<p>We talk about empathy most commonly as a single attribute. But a
close look at where leaders are focusing when they exhibit empathy
reveals three distinct kinds, each important for leadership
effectiveness:</p>
<p>Cognitive empathy: the ability to understand another person’s
perspective</p>
<p>Emotional empathy: the ability to feel what someone else feels</p>
<p>Empathic concern: the ability to sense what another person needs from
you</p>
<p>Cognitive empathy enables leaders to explain themselves in meaningful
ways—a skill essential to getting the best performance from their direct
reports. Contrary to what you might expect, exercising cognitive empathy
requires leaders to think about feelings rather than to feel them
directly.</p>
<p>An inquisitive nature feeds cognitive empathy. As one successful
executive with this trait puts it, “I’ve always just wanted to learn
everything, to understand anybody that I was around—why they thought
what they did, why they did what they did, what worked for them, and
what didn’t work.” But cognitive empathy is also an outgrowth of
self-awareness. The executive circuits that allow us to think about our
own thoughts and to monitor the feelings that flow from them let us
apply the same reasoning to other people’s minds when we choose to
direct our attention that way.</p>
<p>Emotional empathy is important for effective mentoring, managing
clients, and reading group dynamics. It springs from ancient parts of
the brain beneath the cortex—the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the
hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal cortex—that allow us to feel fast
without thinking deeply. They tune us in by arousing in our bodies the
emotional states of others: I literally feel your pain. My brain
patterns match up with yours when I listen to you tell a gripping story.
As Tania Singer, the director of the social neuroscience department at
the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in
Leipzig, Germany, says, “You need to understand your own feelings to
understand the feelings of others.” Accessing your capacity for
emotional empathy depends on combining two kinds of attention: a
deliberate focus on your own echoes of someone else’s feelings and an
open awareness of that person’s face, voice, and other external signs of
emotion. (See the sidebar “When Empathy Needs to Be Learned.”)</p>
<p>Empathic concern, which is closely related to emotional empathy,
enables you to sense not just how people feel but what they need from
you. It’s what you want in your doctor, your spouse—and your boss.
Empathic concern has its roots in the circuitry that compels parents’
attention to their children. Watch where people’s eyes go when someone
brings an adorable baby into a room, and you’ll see this mammalian brain
center leaping into action.</p>
<p>WHEN EMPATHY NEEDS TO BE LEARNED</p>
<p>Emotional empathy can be developed. That’s the conclusion suggested
by research conducted with physicians by Helen Riess, the director of
the Empathy and Relational Science Program at Boston’s Massachusetts
General Hospital. To help the physicians monitor themselves, she set up
a program in which they learned to focus using deep, diaphragmatic
breathing and to cultivate a certain detachment—to watch an interaction
from the ceiling, as it were, rather than being lost in their own
thoughts and feelings. “Suspending your own involvement to observe
what’s going on gives you a mindful awareness of the interaction without
being completely reactive,” says Riess. “You can see if your own
physiology is charged up or balanced. You can notice what’s transpiring
in the situation.” If a doctor realizes that she’s feeling irritated,
for instance, that may be a signal that the patient is bothered too.</p>
<p>Those who are utterly at a loss may be able to prime emotional
empathy essentially by faking it until they make it, Riess adds. If you
act in a caring way—looking people in the eye and paying attention to
their expressions, even when you don’t particularly want to—you may
start to feel more engaged.</p>
<p>One neural theory holds that the response is triggered in the
amygdala by the brain’s radar for sensing danger and in the prefrontal
cortex by the release of oxytocin, the chemical for caring. This implies
that empathic concern is a double-edged feeling. We intuitively
experience the distress of another as our own. But in deciding whether
we will meet that person’s needs, we deliberately weigh how much we
value his or her well-being.</p>
<p>Getting this intuition-deliberation mix right has great implications.
Those whose sympathetic feelings become too strong may themselves
suffer. In the helping professions, this can lead to compassion fatigue;
in executives, it can create distracting feelings of anxiety about
people and circumstances that are beyond anyone’s control. But those who
protect themselves by deadening their feelings may lose touch with
empathy. Empathic concern requires us to manage our personal distress
without numbing ourselves to the pain of others. (See the sidebar “When
Empathy Needs to Be Controlled.”)</p>
<p>What’s more, some lab research suggests that the appropriate
application of empathic concern is critical to making moral judgments.
Brain scans have revealed that when volunteers listened to tales of
people subjected to physical pain, their own brain centers for
experiencing such pain lit up instantly. But if the story was about
psychological suffering, the higher brain centers involved in empathic
concern and compassion took longer to activate. Some time is needed to
grasp the psychological and moral dimensions of a situation. The more
distracted we are, the less we can cultivate the subtler forms of
empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>WHEN EMPATHY NEEDS TO BE CONTROLLED</p>
<p>Getting a grip on our impulse to empathize with other people’s
feelings can help us make better decisions when someone’s emotional
flood threatens to overwhelm us.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, when we see someone pricked with a pin, our brains emit a
signal indicating that our own pain centers are echoing that distress.
But physicians learn in medical school to block even such automatic
responses. Their attentional anesthetic seems to be deployed by the
temporal-parietal junction and regions of the prefrontal cortex, a
circuit that boosts concentration by tuning out emotions. That’s what is
happening in your brain when you distance yourself from others in order
to stay calm and help them. The same neural network kicks in when we see
a problem in an emotionally overheated environment and need to focus on
looking for a solution. If you’re talking with someone who is upset,
this system helps you understand the person’s perspective intellectually
by shifting from the heart-to-heart of emotional empathy to the
head-to-heart of cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>Building relationships</p>
<p>People who lack social sensitivity are easy to spot—at least for
other people. They are the clueless among us. The CFO who is technically
competent but bullies some people, freezes out others, and plays
favorites—but when you point out what he has just done, shifts the
blame, gets angry, or thinks that you’re the problem—is not trying to be
a jerk; he’s utterly unaware of his shortcomings.</p>
<p>Social sensitivity appears to be related to cognitive empathy.
Cognitively empathic executives do better at overseas assignments, for
instance, presumably because they quickly pick up implicit norms and
learn the unique mental models of a new culture. Attention to social
context lets us act with skill no matter what the situation,
instinctively follow the universal algorithm for etiquette, and behave
in ways that put others at ease. (In another age this might have been
called good manners.)</p>
<p>Circuitry that converges on the anterior hippocampus reads social
context and leads us intuitively to act differently with, say, our
college buddies than with our families or our colleagues. In concert
with the deliberative prefrontal cortex, it squelches the impulse to do
something inappropriate. Accordingly, one brain test for sensitivity to
context assesses the function of the hippocampus. The University of
Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson hypothesizes that people who
are most alert to social situations exhibit stronger activity and more
connections between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex than those
who just can’t seem to get it right.</p>
<p>The same circuits may be at play when we map social networks in a
group—a skill that lets us navigate the relationships in those networks
well. People who excel at organizational influence can not only sense
the flow of personal connections but also name the people whose opinions
hold most sway—and so focus on persuading those who will persuade
others.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, research suggests that as people rise through the ranks
and gain power, their ability to perceive and maintain personal
connections tends to suffer a sort of psychic attrition. In studying
encounters between people of varying status, Dacher Keltner, a
psychologist at Berkeley, has found that higher-ranking individuals
consistently focus their gaze less on lower-ranking people and are more
likely to interrupt or to monopolize the conversation.</p>
<p>In fact, mapping attention to power in an organization gives a clear
indication of hierarchy: The longer it takes Person A to respond to
Person B, the more relative power Person A has. Map response times
across an entire organization, and you’ll get a remarkably accurate
chart of social standing. The boss leaves emails unanswered for hours;
those lower down respond within minutes. This is so predictable that an
algorithm for it—called automated social hierarchy detection—has been
developed at Columbia University. Intelligence agencies reportedly are
applying the algorithm to suspected terrorist gangs to piece together
chains of influence and identify central figures.</p>
<p>But the real point is this: Where we see ourselves on the social
ladder sets the default for how much attention we pay. This should be a
warning to top executives, who need to respond to fast-moving
competitive situations by tapping the full range of ideas and talents
within an organization. Without a deliberate shift in attention, their
natural inclination may be to ignore smart ideas from the lower
ranks.</p>
<p>Focusing on the wider world</p>
<p>Leaders with a strong outward focus are not only good listeners but
also good questioners. They are visionaries who can sense the far-flung
consequences of local decisions and imagine how the choices they make
today will play out in the future. They are open to the surprising ways
in which seemingly unrelated data can inform their central interests.
Melinda and Bill Gates offered up a cogent example when Melinda remarked
on 60 Minutes that her husband was the kind of person who would read an
entire book about fertilizer. Charlie Rose asked, “Why fertilizer?” The
connection was obvious to Bill, who is constantly looking for
technological advances that can save lives on a massive scale. “A few
billion people would have to die if we hadn’t come up with fertilizer,”
he replied.</p>
<p>Focusing on strategy</p>
<p>Any business school course on strategy will give you the two main
elements: exploitation of your current advantage and exploration for new
ones. Brain scans that were performed on 63 seasoned business decision
makers as they pursued or switched between exploitative and exploratory
strategies revealed the specific circuits involved. Not surprisingly,
exploitation requires concentration on the job at hand, whereas
exploration demands open awareness to recognize new possibilities. But
exploitation is accompanied by activity in the brain’s circuitry for
anticipation and reward. In other words, it feels good to coast along in
a familiar routine. When we switch to exploration, we have to make a
deliberate cognitive effort to disengage from that routine in order to
roam widely and pursue fresh paths.</p>
<p>What keeps us from making that effort? Sleep deprivation, drinking,
stress, and mental overload all interfere with the executive circuitry
used to make the cognitive switch. To sustain the outward focus that
leads to innovation, we need some uninterrupted time in which to reflect
and refresh our focus.</p>
<p>The wellsprings of innovation</p>
<p>In an era when almost everyone has access to the same information,
new value arises from putting ideas together in novel ways and asking
smart questions that open up untapped potential. Moments before we have
a creative insight, the brain shows a third-of-a-second spike in gamma
waves, indicating the synchrony of far-flung brain cells. The more
neurons firing in sync, the bigger the spike. Its timing suggests that
what’s happening is the formation of a new neural network—presumably
creating a fresh association.</p>
<p>But it would be making too much of this to see gamma waves as a
secret to creativity. A classic model of creativity suggests how the
various modes of attention play key roles. First we prepare our minds by
gathering a wide variety of pertinent information, and then we alternate
between concentrating intently on the problem and letting our minds
wander freely. Those activities translate roughly into vigilance, when
while immersing ourselves in all kinds of input, we remain alert for
anything relevant to the problem at hand; selective attention to the
specific creative challenge; and open awareness, in which we allow our
minds to associate freely and the solution to emerge spontaneously.
(That’s why so many fresh ideas come to people in the shower or out for
a walk or a run.)</p>
<p>The dubious gift of systems awareness</p>
<p>If people are given a quick view of a photo of lots of dots and asked
to guess how many there are, the strong systems thinkers in the group
tend to make the best estimates. This skill shows up in those who are
good at designing software, assembly lines, matrix organizations, or
interventions to save failing ecosystems—it’s a very powerful gift
indeed. After all, we live within extremely complex systems. But,
suggests the Cambridge University psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen (a
cousin of actor Sacha’s), in a small but significant number of people, a
strong systems awareness is coupled with an empathy deficit—a blind spot
for what other people are thinking and feeling and for reading social
situations. For that reason, although people with a superior systems
understanding are organizational assets, they are not necessarily
effective leaders.</p>
<p>An executive at one bank explained to me that it has created a
separate career ladder for systems analysts so that they can progress in
status and salary on the basis of their systems smarts alone. That way,
the bank can consult them as needed while recruiting leaders from a
different pool—one containing people with emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>Putting it all together</p>
<p>For those who don’t want to end up similarly compartmentalized, the
message is clear. A focused leader is not the person concentrating on
the three most important priorities of the year, or the most brilliant
systems thinker, or the one most in tune with the corporate culture.
Focused leaders can command the full range of their own attention: They
are in touch with their inner feelings, they can control their impulses,
they are aware of how others see them, they understand what others need
from them, and they can weed out distractions and also allow their minds
to roam widely, free of preconceptions.</p>
<p>This is challenging. But if great leadership were a paint-by-numbers
exercise, great leaders would be more common. Practically every form of
focus can be strengthened. What it takes is not talent so much as
diligence—a willingness to exercise the attention circuits of the brain
just as we exercise our analytic skills and other systems of the
body.</p>
<p>The link between attention and excellence remains hidden most of the
time. Yet attention is the basis of the most essential of leadership
skills—emotional, organizational, and strategic intelligence. And never
has it been under greater assault. The constant onslaught of incoming
data leads to sloppy shortcuts—triaging our email by reading only the
subject lines, skipping many of our voicemails, skimming memos and
reports. Not only do our habits of attention make us less effective, but
the sheer volume of all those messages leaves us too little time to
reflect on what they really mean. This was foreseen decades ago by the
Nobel Prize–winning economist Herbert Simon. Information “consumes the
attention of its recipients,” he wrote in 1971. “Hence a wealth of
information creates a poverty of attention.”</p>
<p>My goal here is to place attention center stage so that you can
direct it where you need it when you need it. Learn to master your
attention, and you will be in command of where you, and your
organization, focus.</p>
