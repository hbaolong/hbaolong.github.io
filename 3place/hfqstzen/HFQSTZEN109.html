<h4 id="what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it">2 What
Self-Awareness Really Is (and How to Cultivate It)</h4>
<p>By Tasha Eurich</p>
<p>Self-awareness seems to have become the latest management
buzzword—and for good reason. Research suggests that when we see
ourselves clearly, we are more confident and more creative.1 We make
sounder decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more
effectively.2 We’re less likely to lie, cheat, and steal.3 We are better
workers who get more promotions.4 And we’re more effective leaders with
more satisfied employees and more profitable companies.5</p>
<p>As an organizational psychologist and executive coach, I’ve had a
ringside seat to the power of leadership self-awareness for nearly 15
years. I’ve also seen how attainable this skill is. Yet, when I first
began to delve into the research on self-awareness, I was surprised by
the striking gap between the science and the practice of self-awareness.
All things considered, we knew surprisingly little about improving this
critical skill.</p>
<p>Four years ago, my team of researchers and I embarked on a
large-scale scientific study of self-awareness. In 10 separate
investigations with nearly 5,000 participants, we examined what
self-awareness really is, why we need it, and how we can increase
it.</p>
<p>Our research revealed many surprising roadblocks, myths, and truths
about what self-awareness is and what it takes to improve it. We’ve
found that even though most people believe they are self-aware,
self-awareness is a truly rare quality: We estimate that only 10%–15% of
the people we studied actually fit the criteria. Three findings in
particular stood out, and are helping us develop practical guidance for
how leaders can learn to see themselves more clearly.</p>
<p>ABOUT OUR RESEARCH</p>
<p>The major components of our research included:</p>
<p>Analyzing the results of nearly 800 existing scientific studies to
understand how previous researchers defined self-awareness, unearthing
themes and trends, and identifying the limitations of these
investigations.</p>
<p>Surveying thousands of people across countries and industries to
explore the relationship between self-awareness and several key
attitudes and behaviors, like job satisfaction, empathy, happiness, and
stress. We also surveyed those who knew these people well to determine
the relationship between self ratings and other ratings of
self-awareness.</p>
<p>Developing and validating a seven-factor, multi-rater assessment of
self-awareness, because our review of the research didn’t identify any
strong, well-validated, comprehensive measures.</p>
<p>Conducting in-depth interviews with 50 people who had dramatically
improved their self-awareness to learn about the key actions that helped
them get there, as well as their beliefs and practices. Our interviewees
included entrepreneurs, professionals, executives, and even a Fortune
100 CEO. (To be included in our study, participants had to clear four
hurdles: (1) they had to see themselves as highly self-aware, which we
measured using our validated assessment, (2) using that same assessment,
someone who knew them well had to agree, (3) they had to believe they’d
experienced an upward trend of self-awareness over the course of their
life. Each participant was asked to recall their level of self-awareness
at different stages of their life up to their current (for example,
early adulthood: ages 19–24, adulthood: ages 25–34, midlife: ages 35–49,
mature adulthood: ages 50–80), and (4) the person rating them had to
agree with the participants’ recollections.)</p>
<p>Surveying hundreds of managers and their employees to learn more
about the relationship between leadership self-awareness and employee
attitudes like commitment, leadership effectiveness, and job
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Coauthors of this work are Haley M. Woznyj, Longwood University;
Phoenix Van Wagoner, Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado;
Eric D. Heggestad, University of North Carolina, Charlotte; and Apryl
Brodersen, Metropolitan State University of Denver. We want to thank
Dr. Stefanie Johnson for her contributions to our study as well.</p>
<p>#1: There are two types of self-awareness</p>
<p>For the last 50 years, researchers have used varying definitions of
self-awareness. For example, some see it as the ability to monitor our
inner world, whereas others label it as a temporary state of
self-consciousness.6 Still others describe it as the difference between
how we see ourselves and how others see us.7</p>
<p>So before we could focus on how to improve self-awareness, we needed
to synthesize these findings and create an overarching definition.</p>
<p>Across the studies we examined, two broad categories of
self-awareness kept emerging. The first, which we dubbed internal
self-awareness, represents how clearly we see our own values, passions,
aspirations, fit with our environment, reactions (including thoughts,
feelings, behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses), and impact on others.
We’ve found that internal self-awareness is associated with higher job
and relationship satisfaction, personal and social control, and
happiness; it is negatively related to anxiety, stress, and
depression.</p>
<p>The second category, external self-awareness, means understanding how
other people view us, in terms of those same factors listed above. Our
research shows that people who know how others see them are more skilled
at showing empathy and taking others’ perspectives. For leaders who see
themselves as their employees do, their employees tend to have a better
relationship with them, feel more satisfied with them, and see them as
more effective in general.</p>
<p>It’s easy to assume that being high on one type of awareness would
mean being high on the other. But our research has found virtually no
relationship between them. As a result, we identify four leadership
archetypes, each with a different set of opportunities to improve, as
seen in figure 1.</p>
<p>FIGURE 1</p>
<hr />
<p>The four self-awareness archetypes</p>
<p>This 2 × 2 maps internal self-awareness (how well you know yourself)
against external self-awareness (how well you understand how others see
you).</p>
<p>When it comes to internal and external self-awareness, it’s tempting
to value one over the other. But leaders must actively work on both
seeing themselves clearly and getting feedback to understand how others
see them. The highly self-aware people we interviewed were actively
focused on balancing the scale.</p>
<p>Take Jeremiah, a marketing manager. Early in his career, he focused
primarily on internal self-awareness—for example, deciding to leave his
career in accounting to pursue his passion for marketing. But when he
had the chance to get candid feedback during a company training, he
realized that he wasn’t focused enough on how he was showing up.
Jeremiah has since placed an equal importance on both types of
self-awareness, which he believes has helped him reach a new level of
success and fulfillment.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that self-awareness isn’t one truth. It’s a
delicate balance of two distinct, even competing, viewpoints. (If you’re
interested in learning where you stand in each category, you can take a
free shortened version of our multi-rater self-awareness assessment at

<p>#2: Experience and power hinder self-awareness</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that people do not
always learn from experience, that expertise does not help people root
out false information, and that seeing ourselves as highly experienced
can keep us from doing our homework, seeking disconfirming evidence, and
questioning our assumptions.8</p>
<p>And just as experience can lead to a false sense of confidence about
our performance, it can also make us overconfident about our level of
self-knowledge. For example, one study found that more experienced
managers were less accurate in assessing their leadership effectiveness
compared with less experienced managers.9</p>
<p>Similarly, the more power a leader holds, the more likely they are to
overestimate their skills and abilities. One study of more than 3,600
leaders across a variety of roles and industries found that, relative to
lower-level leaders, higher-level leaders more significantly overvalued
their skills (compared with others’ perceptions).10 In fact, this
pattern existed for 19 out of the 20 competencies the researchers
measured, including emotional self-awareness, accurate self-assessment,
empathy, trustworthiness, and leadership performance.</p>
<p>Researchers have proposed two primary explanations for this
phenomenon.11 First, by virtue of their level, senior leaders simply
have fewer people above them who can provide candid feedback. Second,
the more power a leader wields, the less comfortable people will be to
give them constructive feedback, for fear it will hurt their careers.
Business professor James O’Toole has added that, as one’s power grows,
one’s willingness to listen shrinks, either because they think they know
more than their employees or because seeking feedback will come at a
cost.12</p>
<p>But this doesn’t have to be the case. One analysis showed that the
most successful leaders, as rated by 360-degree reviews of leadership
effectiveness, counter act this tendency by seeking frequent critical
feedback (from bosses, peers, employees, their board, and so on).13 They
become more self-aware in the process and come to be seen as more
effective by others.14</p>
<p>Likewise, in our interviews, we found that people who improved their
external self-awareness did so by seeking out feedback from loving
critics—that is, people who have their best interests in mind and are
willing to tell them the truth. To ensure they don’t overreact or
overcorrect based on one person’s opinion, they also gut-check difficult
or surprising feedback with others.</p>
<p>#3: Introspection doesn’t always improve self-awareness</p>
<p>It is also widely assumed that introspection—examining the causes of
our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors—improves self-awareness. After
all, what better way to know ourselves than by reflecting on why we are
the way we are?</p>
<p>Yet one of the most surprising findings of our research is that
people who introspect are less self-aware and report worse job
satisfaction and wellbeing. Other research has shown similar
patterns.15</p>
<p>The problem with introspection isn’t that it is categorically
ineffective—it’s that most people are doing it incorrectly. To
understand this, let’s look at arguably the most common introspective
question: “Why?” We ask this when trying to understand our emotions (Why
do I like employee A so much more than employee B?), or our behavior
(Why did I fly off the handle with that employee?), or our attitudes
(Why am I so against this deal?).</p>
<p>As it turns out, “why” is a surprisingly ineffective self-awareness
question. Research has shown that we simply do not have access to many
of the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motives we’re searching
for.16 And because so much is trapped outside of our conscious
awareness, we tend to invent answers that feel true but are often
wrong.17 For example, after an uncharacteristic outburst at an employee,
a new manager may jump to the conclusion that it happened because she
isn’t cut out for management, when the real reason was a bad case of low
blood sugar.</p>
<p>Consequently, the problem with asking why isn’t just how wrong we
are, but how confident we are that we are right.18 The human mind rarely
operates in a rational fashion, and our judgments are seldom free from
bias. We tend to pounce on whatever insights we find without questioning
their validity or value, we ignore contradictory evidence, and we force
our thoughts to conform to our initial explanations.</p>
<p>Another negative consequence of asking why—especially when trying to
explain an undesired outcome—is that it invites unproductive negative
thoughts.19 In our research, we’ve found that people who are very
introspective are also more likely to get caught in ruminative patterns.
For example, if an employee who receives a bad performance review asks
Why did I get such a bad rating?, they’re likely to land on an
explanation focused on their fears, shortcomings, or insecurities,
rather than a rational assessment of their strengths and weaknesses.
(For this reason, frequent self-analyzers are more depressed and anxious
and experience poorer well-being.20)</p>
<p>So if why isn’t the right introspective question, is there a better
one? My research team scoured hundreds of pages of interview transcripts
with highly self-aware people to see if they approached introspection
differently. Indeed, there was a clear pattern: Although the word “why”
appeared fewer than 150 times, the word “what” appeared more than 1,000
times.</p>
<p>Therefore, to increase productive self-insight and decrease
unproductive rumination, we should ask what, not why.21 “What” questions
help us stay objective, future-focused, and empowered to act on our new
insights.</p>
<p>For example, consider Jose, an entertainment industry veteran we
interviewed, who hated his job. Where many would have gotten stuck
thinking “Why do I feel so terrible?” he asked, “What are the situations
that make me feel terrible, and what do they have in common?” He
realized that he’d never be happy in that career, and it gave him the
courage to pursue a new and far more fulfilling one in wealth
management.</p>
<p>Similarly, Robin, a customer service leader who was new to her job,
needed to understand a piece of negative feedback she’d gotten from an
employee. Instead of asking “Why did you say this about me?” Robin
inquired, “What are the steps I need to take in the future to do a
better job?” This helped them move to solutions rather than focusing on
the unproductive patterns of the past.</p>
<p>A final case is Paul, who told us about learning that the business
he’d recently purchased was no longer profitable. At first, all he could
ask himself was “Why wasn’t I able to turn things around?” But he
quickly realized that he didn’t have the time or energy to beat himself
up—he had to figure out what to do next. He started asking, “What do I
need to do to move forward in a way that minimizes the impact to our
customers and employees?” He created a plan and was able to find
creative ways to do as much good for others as possible while winding
down the business. When all that was over, he challenged himself to
articulate what he learned from the experience—his answer both helped
him avoid similar mistakes in the future and helped others learn from
them, too.22</p>
<p>These qualitative findings have been bolstered by others’
quantitative research. In one study, psychologists J. Gregory Hixon and
William Swann gave a group of undergraduates negative feedback on a test
of their “sociability, likability, and interestingness.”23 Some were
given time to think about why they were the kind of person they were,
while others were asked to think about what kind of person they were.
When the researchers had them evaluate the accuracy of the feedback, the
“why” students spent their energy rationalizing and denying what they’d
learned, and the “what” students were more open to this new information
and how they might learn from it. Hixon and Swann’s rather bold
conclusion was that “thinking about why one is the way one is may be no
better than not thinking about one’s self at all.”</p>
<p>All of this brings us to conclude: Leaders who focus on building both
internal and external self-awareness, who seek honest feedback from
loving critics, and who ask what instead of why can learn to see
themselves more clearly—and reap the many rewards that increased
self-knowledge delivers. And no matter how much progress we make,
there’s always more to learn. That’s one of the things that makes the
journey to self-awareness so exciting.</p>
