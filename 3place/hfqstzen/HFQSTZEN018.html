<h4 id="harnessing-the-science-of-persuasion">2 Harnessing the Science
of Persuasion</h4>
<p>By Robert Cialdini</p>
<p>A lucky few have it; most of us do not. A handful of gifted
“naturals” simply know how to capture an audience, sway the undecided,
and convert the opposition. Watching these masters of persuasion work
their magic is at once impressive and frustrating. What’s impressive is
not just the easy way they use charisma and eloquence to convince others
to do as they ask. It’s also how eager those others are to do what’s
requested of them, as if the persuasion itself were a favor they
couldn’t wait to repay.</p>
<p>The frustrating part of the experience is that these born persuaders
are often unable to account for their remarkable skill or pass it on to
others. Their way with people is an art, and artists as a rule are far
better at doing than at explaining. Most of them can’t offer much help
to those of us who possess no more than the ordinary quotient of
charisma and eloquence but who still have to wrestle with leadership’s
fundamental challenge: getting things done through others. That
challenge is painfully familiar to corporate executives, who every day
have to figure out how to motivate and direct a highly individualistic
work force. Playing the “Because I’m the boss” card is out. Even if it
weren’t demeaning and demoralizing for all concerned, it would be out of
place in a world where cross-functional teams, joint ventures, and
intercompany partnerships have blurred the lines of authority. In such
an environment, persuasion skills exert far greater influence over
others’ behavior than formal power structures do.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to where we started. Persuasion skills may be
more necessary than ever, but how can executives acquire them if the
most talented practitioners can’t pass them along? By looking to
science. For the past five decades, behavioral scientists have conducted
experiments that shed considerable light on the way certain interactions
lead people to concede, comply, or change. This research shows that
persuasion works by appealing to a limited set of deeply rooted human
drives and needs, and it does so in predictable ways. Persuasion, in
other words, is governed by basic principles that can be taught,
learned, and applied. By mastering these principles, executives can
bring scientific rigor to the business of securing consensus, cutting
deals, and winning concessions. In the pages that follow, I describe six
fundamental principles of persuasion and suggest a few ways that
executives can apply them in their own organizations.</p>
<p>The principle of liking: People like those who like them.</p>
<p>The application: Uncover real similarities and offer genuine
praise.</p>
<p>The retailing phenomenon known as the Tupperware party is a vivid
illustration of this principle in action. The demonstration party for
Tupperware products is hosted by an individual, almost always a woman,
who invites to her home an array of friends, neighbors, and relatives.
The guests’ affection for their hostess predisposes them to buy from
her, a dynamic that was confirmed by a 1990 study of purchase decisions
made at demonstration parties. The researchers, Jonathan Frenzen and
Harry Davis, writing in the Journal of Consumer Research, found that the
guests’ fondness for their hostess weighed twice as heavily in their
purchase decisions as their regard for the products they bought. So when
guests at a Tupperware party buy something, they aren’t just buying to
please themselves. They’re buying to please their hostess as well.</p>
<p>What’s true at Tupperware parties is true for business in general: If
you want to influence people, win friends. How? Controlled research has
identified several factors that reliably increase liking, but two stand
out as especially compelling—similarity and praise. Similarity literally
draws people together. In one experiment, reported in a 1968 article in
the Journal of Personality, participants stood physically closer to one
another after learning that they shared political beliefs and social
values. And in a 1963 article in American Behavioral Scientists,
researcher F. B. Evans used demographic data from insurance company
records to demonstrate that prospects were more willing to purchase a
policy from a salesperson who was akin to them in age, religion,
politics, or even cigarette-smoking habits.</p>
<p>Managers can use similarities to create bonds with a recent hire, the
head of another department, or even a new boss. Informal conversations
during the workday create an ideal opportunity to discover at least one
common area of enjoyment, be it a hobby, a college basketball team, or
reruns of Seinfeld. The important thing is to establish the bond early
because it creates a presumption of goodwill and trustworthiness in
every subsequent encounter. It’s much easier to build support for a new
project when the people you’re trying to persuade are already inclined
in your favor.</p>
<p>Praise, the other reliable generator of affection, both charms and
disarms. Sometimes the praise doesn’t even have to be merited.
Researchers at the University of North Carolina writing in the Journal
of Experimental Social Psychology found that men felt the greatest
regard for an individual who flattered them unstintingly even if the
comments were untrue. And in their book Interpersonal Attraction
(Addison-Wesley, 1978), Ellen Berscheid and Elaine Hatfield Walster
presented experimental data showing that positive remarks about another
person’s traits, attitude, or performance reliably generates liking in
return, as well as willing compliance with the wishes of the person
offering the praise.</p>
<p>Along with cultivating a fruitful relationship, adroit managers can
also use praise to repair one that’s damaged or unproductive. Imagine
you’re the manager of a good-sized unit within your organization. Your
work frequently brings you into contact with another manager—call him
Dan—whom you have come to dislike. No matter how much you do for him,
it’s not enough. Worse, he never seems to believe that you’re doing the
best you can for him. Resenting his attitude and his obvious lack of
trust in your abilities and in your good faith, you don’t spend as much
time with him as you know you should; in consequence, the performance of
both his unit and yours is deteriorating.</p>
<p>The research on praise points toward a strategy for fixing the
relationship. It may be hard to find, but there has to be something
about Dan you can sincerely admire, whether it’s his concern for the
people in his department, his devotion to his family, or simply his work
ethic. In your next encounter with him, make an appreciative comment
about that trait. Make it clear that in this case at least, you value
what he values. I predict that Dan will relax his relentless negativity
and give you an opening to convince him of your competence and good
intentions.</p>
<p>The principle of reciprocity: People repay in kind.</p>
<p>The application: Give what you want to receive.</p>
<p>Praise is likely to have a warming and softening effect on Dan
because, ornery as he is, he is still human and subject to the universal
human tendency to treat people the way they treat him. If you have ever
caught yourself smiling at a coworker just because he or she smiled
first, you know how this principle works.</p>
<p>Charities rely on reciprocity to help them raise funds. For years,
for instance, the Disabled American Veterans organization, using only a
well-crafted fund-raising letter, garnered a very respectable 18% rate
of response to its appeals. But when the group started enclosing a small
gift in the envelope, the response rate nearly doubled to 35%. The
gift—personalized address labels—was extremely modest, but it wasn’t
what prospective donors received that made the difference. It was that
they had gotten anything at all.</p>
<p>What works in that letter works at the office, too. It’s more than an
effusion of seasonal spirit, of course, that impels suppliers to shower
gifts on purchasing departments at holiday time. In 1996, purchasing
managers admitted to an interviewer from Inc. magazine that after having
accepted a gift from a supplier, they were willing to purchase products
and services they would have otherwise declined. Gifts also have a
startling effect on retention. I have encouraged readers of my book to
send me examples of the principles of influence at work in their own
lives. One reader, an employee of the State of Oregon, sent a letter in
which she offered these reasons for her commitment to her
supervisor:</p>
<p>He gives me and my son gifts for Christmas and gives me presents on
my birthday. There is no promotion for the type of job I have, and my
only choice for one is to move to another department. But I find myself
resisting trying to move. My boss is reaching retirement age, and I am
thinking I will be able to move out after he retires . . . [F]or now, I
feel obligated to stay since he has been so nice to me.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, gift giving is one of the cruder applications of
the rule of reciprocity. In its more sophisticated uses, it confers a
genuine first-mover advantage on any manager who is trying to foster
positive attitudes and productive personal relationships in the office:
Managers can elicit the desired behavior from coworkers and employees by
displaying it first. Whether it’s a sense of trust, a spirit of
cooperation, or a pleasant demeanor, leaders should model the behavior
they want to see from others.</p>
<p>The same holds true for managers faced with issues of information
delivery and resource allocation. If you lend a member of your staff to
a colleague who is shorthanded and staring at a fast-approaching
deadline, you will significantly increase your chances of getting help
when you need it. Your odds will improve even more if you say, when your
colleague thanks you for the assistance, something like, “Sure, glad to
help. I know how important it is for me to count on your help when I
need it.”</p>
<p>The principle of social proof: People follow the lead of similar
others.</p>
<p>The application: Use peer power whenever it’s available.</p>
<p>Social creatures that they are, human beings rely heavily on the
people around them for cues on how to think, feel, and act. We know this
intuitively, but intuition has also been confirmed by experiments, such
as the one first described in 1982 in the Journal of Applied Psychology.
A group of researchers went door-to-door in Columbia, South Carolina,
soliciting donations for a charity campaign and displaying a list of
neighborhood residents who had already donated to the cause. The
researchers found that the longer the donor list was, the more likely
those solicited would be to donate as well.</p>
<p>To the people being solicited, the friends’ and neighbors’ names on
the list were a form of social evidence about how they should respond.
But the evidence would not have been nearly as compelling had the names
been those of random strangers. In an experiment from the 1960s, first
described in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, residents
of New York City were asked to return a lost wallet to its owner. They
were highly likely to attempt to return the wallet when they learned
that another New Yorker had previously attempted to do so. But learning
that someone from a foreign country had tried to return the wallet
didn’t sway their decision one way or the other.</p>
<p>The lesson for executives from these two experiments is that
persuasion can be extremely effective when it comes from peers. The
science supports what most sales professionals already know:
Testimonials from satisfied customers work best when the satisfied
customer and the prospective customer share similar circumstances. That
lesson can help a manager faced with the task of selling a new corporate
initiative. Imagine that you’re trying to streamline your department’s
work processes. A group of veteran employees is resisting. Rather than
try to convince the employees of the move’s merits yourself, ask an
old-timer who supports the initiative to speak up for it at a team
meeting. The compatriot’s testimony stands a much better chance of
convincing the group than yet another speech from the boss. Stated
simply, influence is often best exerted horizontally rather than
vertically.</p>
<p>The principle of consistency: People align with their clear
commitments.</p>
<p>The application: Make their commitments active, public, and
voluntary.</p>
<p>Liking is a powerful force, but the work of persuasion involves more
than simply making people feel warmly toward you, your idea, or your
product. People need not only to like you but to feel committed to what
you want them to do. Good turns are one reliable way to make people feel
obligated to you. Another is to win a public commitment from them.</p>
<p>My own research has demonstrated that most people, once they take a
stand or go on record in favor of a position, prefer to stick to it.
Other studies reinforce that finding and go on to show how even a small,
seemingly trivial commitment can have a powerful effect on future
actions. Israeli researchers writing in 1983 in the Personality and
Social Psychology Bulletin recounted how they asked half the residents
of a large apartment complex to sign a petition favoring the
establishment of a recreation center for the handicapped. The cause was
good and the request was small, so almost everyone who was asked agreed
to sign. Two weeks later, on National Collection Day for the
Handicapped, all residents of the complex were approached at home and
asked to give to the cause. A little more than half of those who were
not asked to sign the petition made a contribution. But an astounding
92% of those who did sign donated money. The residents of the apartment
complex felt obligated to live up to their commitments because those
commitments were active, public, and voluntary. These three features are
worth considering separately.</p>
<p>There’s strong empirical evidence to show that a choice made
actively—one that’s spoken out loud or written down or otherwise made
explicit—is considerably more likely to direct someone’s future conduct
than the same choice left unspoken. Writing in 1996 in the Personality
and Social Psychology Bulletin, Delia Cioffi and Randy Garner described
an experiment in which college students in one group were asked to fill
out a printed form saying they wished to volunteer for an AIDS education
project in the public schools. Students in another group volunteered for
the same project by leaving blank a form stating that they didn’t want
to participate. A few days later, when the volunteers reported for duty,
74% of those who showed up were students from the group that signaled
their commitment by filling out the form.</p>
<p>The implications are clear for a manager who wants to persuade a
subordinate to follow some particular course of action: Get it in
writing. Let’s suppose you want your employee to submit reports in a
more timely fashion. Once you believe you’ve won agreement, ask him to
summarize the decision in a memo and send it to you. By doing so, you’ll
have greatly increased the odds that he’ll fulfill the commitment
because, as a rule, people live up to what they have written down.</p>
<p>Research into the social dimensions of commitment suggests that
written statements become even more powerful when they’re made public.
In a classic experiment, described in 1955 in the Journal of Abnormal
and Social Psychology, college students were asked to estimate the
length of lines projected on a screen. Some students were asked to write
down their choices on a piece of paper, sign it, and hand the paper to
the experimenter. Others wrote their choices on an erasable slate, then
erased the slate immediately. Still others were instructed to keep their
decisions to themselves.</p>
<p>The experimenters then presented all three groups with evidence that
their initial choices may have been wrong. Those who had merely kept
their decisions in their heads were the most likely to reconsider their
original estimates. More loyal to their first guesses were the students
in the group that had written them down and immediately erased them. But
by a wide margin, the ones most reluctant to shift from their original
choices were those who had signed and handed them to the researcher.</p>
<p>This experiment highlights how much most people wish to appear
consistent to others. Consider again the matter of the employee who has
been submitting late reports. Recognizing the power of this desire, you
should, once you’ve successfully convinced him of the need to be more
timely, reinforce the commitment by making sure it gets a public airing.
One way to do that would be to send the employee an email that reads, “I
think your plan is just what we need. I showed it to Diane in
manufacturing and Phil in shipping, and they thought it was right on
target, too.” Whatever way such commitments are formalized, they should
never be like the New Year’s resolutions people privately make and then
abandon with no one the wiser. They should be publicly made and visibly
posted.</p>
<p>More than 300 years ago, Samuel Butler wrote a couplet that explains
succinctly why commitments must be voluntary to be lasting and
effective: “He that complies against his will/Is of his own opinion
still.” If an undertaking is forced, coerced, or imposed from the
outside, it’s not a commitment; it’s an unwelcome burden. Think how you
would react if your boss pressured you to donate to the campaign of a
political candidate. Would that make you more apt to opt for that
candidate in the privacy of a voting booth? Not likely. In fact, in
their 1981 book Psychological Reactance (Academic Press), Sharon S.
Brehm and Jack W. Brehm present data that suggest you’d vote the
opposite way just to express your resentment of the boss’s coercion.</p>
<p>This kind of backlash can occur in the office, too. Let’s return
again to that tardy employee. If you want to produce an enduring change
in his behavior, you should avoid using threats or pressure tactics to
gain his compliance. He’d likely view any change in his behavior as the
result of intimidation rather than a personal commitment to change. A
better approach would be to identify something that the employee
genuinely values in the workplace—high-quality workmanship, perhaps, or
team spirit—and then describe how timely reports are consistent with
those values. That gives the employee reasons for improvement that he
can own. And because he owns them, they’ll continue to guide his
behavior even when you’re not watching.</p>
<p>The principle of authority: People defer to experts.</p>
<p>The application: Expose your expertise; don’t assume it’s
self-evident.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Virgil offered this simple
counsel to those seeking to choose correctly: “Believe an expert.” That
may or may not be good advice, but as a description of what people
actually do, it can’t be beaten. For instance, when the news media
present an acknowledged expert’s views on a topic, the effect on public
opinion is dramatic. A single expert-opinion news story in the New York
Times is associated with a 2% shift in public opinion nationwide,
according to a 1993 study described in the Public Opinion Quarterly. And
researchers writing in the American Political Science Review in 1987
found that when the expert’s view was aired on national television,
public opinion shifted as much as 4%. A cynic might argue that these
findings only illustrate the docile submissiveness of the public. But a
fairer explanation is that, amid the teeming complexity of contemporary
life, a well-selected expert offers a valuable and efficient shortcut to
good decisions. Indeed, some questions, be they legal, financial,
medical, or technological, require so much specialized knowledge to
answer, we have no choice but to rely on experts.</p>
<p>Since there’s good reason to defer to experts, executives should take
pains to ensure that they establish their own expertise before they
attempt to exert influence. Surprisingly often, people mistakenly assume
that others recognize and appreciate their experience. That’s what
happened at a hospital where some colleagues and I were consulting. The
physical therapy staffers were frustrated because so many of their
stroke patients abandoned their exercise routines as soon as they left
the hospital. No matter how often the staff emphasized the importance of
regular home exercise—it is, in fact, crucial to the process of
regaining independent function—the message just didn’t sink in.</p>
<p>Interviews with some of the patients helped us pinpoint the problem.
They were familiar with the background and training of their physicians,
but the patients knew little about the credentials of the physical
therapists who were urging them to exercise. It was a simple matter to
remedy that lack of information: We merely asked the therapy director to
display all the awards, diplomas, and certifications of her staff on the
walls of the therapy rooms. The result was startling: Exercise
compliance jumped 34% and has never dropped since.</p>
<p>What we found immensely gratifying was not just how much we increased
compliance, but how. We didn’t fool or browbeat any of the patients. We
informed them into compliance. Nothing had to be invented; no time or
resources had to be spent in the process. The staff’s expertise was
real—all we had to do was make it more visible.</p>
<p>The task for managers who want to establish their claims to expertise
is somewhat more difficult. They can’t simply nail their diplomas to the
wall and wait for everyone to notice. A little subtlety is called for.
Outside the United States, it is customary for people to spend time
interacting socially before getting down to business for the first time.
Frequently they gather for dinner the night before their meeting or
negotiation. These get-togethers can make discussions easier and help
blunt disagreements—remember the findings about liking and
similarity—and they can also provide an opportunity to establish
expertise. Perhaps it’s a matter of telling an anecdote about
successfully solving a problem similar to the one that’s on the agenda
at the next day’s meeting. Or perhaps dinner is the time to describe
years spent mastering a complex discipline—not in a boastful way but as
part of the ordinary give-and-take of conversation.</p>
<p>Granted, there’s not always time for lengthy introductory sessions.
But even in the course of the preliminary conversation that precedes
most meetings, there is almost always an opportunity to touch lightly on
your relevant background and experience as a natural part of a sociable
exchange. This initial disclosure of personal information gives you a
chance to establish expertise early in the game, so that when the
discussion turns to the business at hand, what you have to say will be
accorded the respect it deserves.</p>
<p>PERSUASION EXPERTS, SAFE AT LAST</p>
<p>Thanks to several decades of rigorous empirical research by
behavioral scientists, our understanding of the how and why of
persuasion has never been broader, deeper, or more detailed. But these
scientists aren’t the first students of the subject. The history of
persuasion studies is an ancient and honorable one, and it has generated
a long roster of heroes and martyrs.</p>
<p>A renowned student of social influence, William McGuire, contends in
a chapter of the Handbook of Social Psychology, 3rd edition (Oxford
University Press, 1985), that scattered among the more than four
millennia of recorded Western history are four centuries in which the
study of persuasion flourished as a craft. The first was the Periclean
Age of ancient Athens, the second occurred during the years of the Roman
Republic, the next appeared in the time of the European Renaissance, and
the last extended over the hundred years that have just ended, which
witnessed the advent of large-scale advertising, information, and mass
media campaigns. Each of the three previous centuries of systematic
persuasion study was marked by a flowering of human achievement that was
suddenly cut short when political authorities had the masters of
persuasion killed. The philosopher Socrates is probably the best known
of the persuasion experts to run afoul of the powers that be.</p>
<p>Information about the persuasion process is a threat because it
creates a base of power entirely separate from the one controlled by
political authorities. Faced with a rival source of influence, rulers in
previous centuries had few qualms about eliminating those rare
individuals who truly understood how to marshal forces that heads of
state have never been able to monopolize, such as cleverly crafted
language, strategically placed information, and, most important,
psychological insight.</p>
<p>It would perhaps be expressing too much faith in human nature to
claim that persuasion experts no longer face a threat from those who
wield political power. But because the truth about persuasion is no
longer the sole possession of a few brilliant, inspired individuals,
experts in the field can presumably breathe a little easier. Indeed,
since most people in power are interested in remaining in power, they’re
likely to be more interested in acquiring persuasion skills than
abolishing them.</p>
<p>The principle of scarcity: People want more of what they can have
less of.</p>
<p>The application: Highlight unique benefits and exclusive
information.</p>
<p>Study after study shows that items and opportunities are seen to be
more valuable as they become less available. That’s a tremendously
useful piece of information for managers. They can harness the scarcity
principle with the organizational equivalents of limited-time,
limited-supply, and one-of-a-kind offers. Honestly informing a coworker
of a closing window of opportunity—the chance to get the boss’s ear
before she leaves for an extended vacation, perhaps—can mobilize action
dramatically.</p>
<p>Managers can learn from retailers how to frame their offers not in
terms of what people stand to gain but in terms of what they stand to
lose if they don’t act on the information. The power of “loss language”
was demonstrated in a 1988 study of California homeowners written up in
the Journal of Applied Psychology. Half were told that if they fully
insulated their homes, they would save a certain amount of money each
day. The other half were told that if they failed to insulate, they
would lose that amount each day. Significantly more people insulated
their homes when exposed to the loss language. The same phenomenon
occurs in business. According to a 1994 study in the journal
Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, potential losses
figure far more heavily in managers’ decision making than potential
gains.</p>
<p>In framing their offers, executives should also remember that
exclusive information is more persuasive than widely available data. A
doctoral student of mine, Amram Knishinsky, wrote his 1982 dissertation
on the purchase decisions of wholesale beef buyers. He observed that
they more than doubled their orders when they were told that, because of
certain weather conditions overseas, there was likely to be a scarcity
of foreign beef in the near future. But their orders increased 600% when
they were informed that no one else had that information yet.</p>
<p>The persuasive power of exclusivity can be harnessed by any manager
who comes into possession of information that’s not broadly available
and that supports an idea or initiative he or she would like the
organization to adopt. The next time that kind of information crosses
your desk, round up your organization’s key players. The information
itself may seem dull, but exclusivity will give it a special sheen. Push
it across your desk and say, “I just got this report today. It won’t be
distributed until next week, but I want to give you an early look at
what it shows.” Then watch your listeners lean forward.</p>
<p>Allow me to stress here a point that should be obvious. No offer of
exclusive information, no exhortation to act now or miss this
opportunity forever should be made unless it is genuine. Deceiving
colleagues into compliance is not only ethically objectionable, it’s
foolhardy. If the deception is detected—and it certainly will be—it will
snuff out any enthusiasm the offer originally kindled. It will also
invite dishonesty toward the deceiver. Remember the rule of
reciprocity.</p>
<p>Putting it all together</p>
<p>There’s nothing abstruse or obscure about these six principles of
persuasion. Indeed, they neatly codify our intuitive understanding of
the ways people evaluate information and form decisions. As a result,
the principles are easy for most people to grasp, even those with no
formal education in psychology. But in the seminars and workshops I
conduct, I have learned that two points bear repeated emphasis.</p>
<p>First, although the six principles and their applications can be
discussed separately for the sake of clarity, they should be applied in
combination to compound their impact. For instance, in discussing the
importance of expertise, I suggested that managers use informal, social
conversations to establish their credentials. But that conversation
affords an opportunity to gain information as well as convey it. While
you’re showing your dinner companion that you have the skills and
experience your business problem demands, you can also learn about your
companion’s background, likes, and dislikes—information that will help
you locate genuine similarities and give sincere compliments. By letting
your expertise surface and also establishing rapport, you double your
persuasive power. And if you succeed in bringing your dinner partner on
board, you may encourage other people to sign on as well, thanks to the
persuasive power of social evidence.</p>
<p>The other point I wish to emphasize is that the rules of ethics apply
to the science of social influence just as they do to any other
technology. Not only is it ethically wrong to trick or trap others into
assent, it’s ill-advised in practical terms. Dishonest or high-pressure
tactics work only in the short run, if at all. Their long-term effects
are malignant, especially within an organization that can’t function
properly without a bedrock level of trust and cooperation.</p>
<p>That point is made vividly in the following account, which a
department head for a large textile manufacturer related at a training
workshop I conducted. She described a vice president in her company who
wrung public commitments from department heads in a highly manipulative
manner. Instead of giving his subordinates time to talk or think through
his proposals carefully, he would approach them individually at the
busiest moment of their workday and describe the benefits of his plan in
exhaustive, patience-straining detail. Then he would move in for the
kill. “It’s very important for me to see you as being on my team on
this,” he would say. “Can I count on your support?” Intimidated,
frazzled, eager to chase the man from their offices so they could get
back to work, the department heads would invariably go along with his
request. But because the commitments never felt voluntary, the
department heads never followed through, and as a result the vice
president’s initiatives all blew up or petered out.</p>
<p>This story had a deep impact on the other participants in the
workshop. Some gulped in shock as they recognized their own manipulative
behavior. But what stopped everyone cold was the expression on the
department head’s face as she recounted the damaging collapse of her
superior’s proposals. She was smiling.</p>
<p>Nothing I could say would more effectively make the point that the
deceptive or coercive use of the principles of social influence is
ethically wrong and pragmatically wrongheaded. Yet the same principles,
if applied appropriately, can steer decisions correctly. Legitimate
expertise, genuine obligations, authentic similarities, real social
proof, exclusive news, and freely made commitments can produce choices
that are likely to benefit both parties. And any approach that works to
everyone’s mutual benefit is good business, don’t you think? Of course,
I don’t want to press you into it, but, if you agree, I would love it if
you could just jot me a memo to that effect.</p>
