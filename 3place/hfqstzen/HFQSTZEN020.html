<h4 id="learning-charisma">4 Learning Charisma</h4>
<p>By John Antonakis, Marika Fenley, and Sue Liechti</p>
<p>Jana stands at the podium, palms sweaty, looking out at hundreds of
colleagues who are waiting to hear about her new initiative. Bill walks
into a meeting after a failed product launch to greet an exhausted and
demotivated team that desperately needs his direction. Robin gets ready
to confront a brilliant but underperforming subordinate who needs to be
put back on track.</p>
<p>We’ve all been in situations like these. What they require is
charisma—the ability to communicate a clear, visionary, and
inspirational message that captivates and motivates an audience. So how
do you learn charisma? Many people believe that it’s impossible. They
say that charismatic people are born that way—as naturally expressive
and persuasive extroverts. After all, you can’t teach someone to be
Winston Churchill.</p>
<p>While we agree with the latter contention, we disagree with the
former. Charisma is not all innate; it’s a learnable skill or, rather, a
set of skills that have been practiced since antiquity. Our research
with managers in the laboratory and in the field indicates that anyone
trained in what we call “charismatic leadership tactics” (CLTs) can
become more influential, trustworthy, and “leader like” in the eyes of
others. In this article we’ll explain these tactics and how we help
managers master them. Just as athletes rely on hard training and the
right game plan to win a competition, leaders who want to become
charismatic must study the CLTs, practice them religiously, and have a
good deployment strategy.</p>
<p>What is charisma?</p>
<p>Charisma is rooted in values and feelings. It’s influence born of the
alchemy that Aristotle called the logos, the ethos, and the pathos; that
is, to persuade others, you must use powerful and reasoned rhetoric,
establish personal and moral credibility, and then rouse followers’
emotions and passions. If a leader can do those three things well, he or
she can then tap into the hopes and ideals of followers, give them a
sense of purpose, and inspire them to achieve great things.</p>
<p>Several large-scale studies have shown that charisma can be an
invaluable asset in any work context—small or large, public or private,
Western or Asian. Politicians know that it’s important. Yet many
business managers don’t use charisma, perhaps because they don’t know
how to or because they believe it’s not as easy to master as
transactional (carrot-and-stick) or instrumental (task-based)
leadership. Let’s be clear: Leaders need technical expertise to win the
trust of followers, manage operations, and set strategy; they also
benefit from the ability to punish and reward. But the most effective
leaders layer charismatic leadership on top of transactional and
instrumental leadership to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>In our research, we have identified a dozen key CLTs. Some of them
you may recognize as longstanding techniques of oratory. Nine of them
are verbal: metaphors, similes, and analogies; stories and anecdotes;
contrasts; rhetorical questions; three-part lists; expressions of moral
conviction; reflections of the group’s sentiments; the setting of high
goals; and conveying confidence that they can be achieved. Three tactics
are nonverbal: animated voice, facial expressions, and gestures.</p>
<p>There are other CLTs that leaders can use—such as creating a sense of
urgency, invoking history, using repetition, talking about sacrifice,
and using humor—but the 12 described in this article are the ones that
have the greatest effect and can work in almost any context. In studies
and experiments, we have found that people who use them appropriately
can unite followers around a vision in a way that others can’t. In 8 of
the past 10 U.S. presidential races, for instance, the candidate who
deployed verbal CLTs more often won. And when we measured “good”
presentation skills—such as speech structure, clear pronunciation, use
of easy-to-understand language, tempo of speech, and speaker comfort—and
compared their impact against that of the CLTs, we found that the CLTs
played a much bigger role in determining who was perceived to be more
leader like, competent, and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Still, these tactics don’t seem to be widely known or taught in the
business world. The managers who practice them typically learned them by
trial and error, without thinking consciously about them. As one manager
who attended our training remarked, “I use a lot of these tactics, some
without even knowing it.” Such learning should not be left to
chance.</p>
<p>We teach managers the CLTs by outlining the concepts and then showing
news and film clips that highlight examples from business, sports, and
politics. Managers must then experiment with and practice the tactics—on
video, in front of peers, and on their own. A group of midlevel European
executives (with an average age of 35) that did so as part of our
training almost doubled their use of CLTs in presentations. As a result,
they saw observers’ numerical ratings of their competence as leaders
jump by about 60% on average. They were then able to take the tactics
back to their jobs. We saw the same thing happen with another group of
executives (with an average age of 42) in a large Swiss firm. Overall,
we’ve found that about 65% of people who have been trained in the CLTs
receive above-average ratings as leaders, in contrast with only 35% of
those who have not been trained.</p>
<p>The aim is to use the CLTs not only in public speaking but also in
everyday conversations—to be more charismatic all the time. The tactics
work because they help you create an emotional connection with
followers, even as they make you appear more powerful, competent, and
worthy of respect. In Greek, the word “charisma” means special gift.
Start to use the CLTs correctly, and that’s what people will begin to
think you have.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the tactics in detail.</p>
<p>Connect, compare, and contrast</p>
<p>Charismatic speakers help listeners understand, relate to, and
remember a message. A powerful way to do this is by using metaphors,
similes, and analogies. Martin Luther King Jr. was a master of the
metaphor. In his “I Have a Dream” speech, for example, he likened the
U.S. Constitution to “a promissory note” guaranteeing the unalienable
rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all people but
noted that America had instead given its black citizens “a bad check,”
one that had come back marked “insufficient funds.” Everyone knows what
it means to receive a bad check. The message is crystal clear and easy
to retain.</p>
<p>Metaphors can be effective in any professional context, too. Joe, a
manager we worked with, used one to predispose his team to get behind an
urgent relocation. He introduced it by saying, “When I heard about this
from the board, it was like hearing about a long-awaited pregnancy. The
difference is that we have four months instead of nine months to
prepare.” The team instantly understood it was about to experience an
uncomfortable but ultimately rewarding transition.</p>
<p>Stories and anecdotes also make messages more engaging and help
listeners connect with the speaker. Even people who aren’t born
raconteurs can employ them in a compelling way. Take this example from a
speech Bill Gates gave at Harvard, urging graduates to consider their
broader responsibilities: “My mother . . . never stopped pressing me to
do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a bridal
event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had
written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but
she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of
the letter she [quoted]: ‘From those to whom much is given, much is
expected.’”</p>
<p>Lynn, another manager we studied, used the following story to
motivate her reports during a crisis: “This reminds me of the challenge
my team and I faced when climbing the Eiger peak a few years ago. We got
caught in bad weather, and we could have died up there. But working
together, we managed to survive. And we made what at first seemed
impossible, possible. Today we are in an economic storm, but by pulling
together, we can turn this situation around and succeed.” The story made
her team feel reassured and inspired.</p>
<p>Contrasts are a key CLT because they combine reason and passion; they
clarify your position by pitting it against the opposite, often to
dramatic effect. Think of John F. Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country
can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” In our experience,
contrasts are one of the easiest tactics to learn and use, and yet they
aren’t used enough. Here are some examples from managers newly trained
in the CLTs. Gilles, a senior VP, speaking to a direct report managing a
stagnant team: “It seems to me that you’re playing too much defense when
you need to be playing more offense.” (That’s also a metaphor.) And
Sally, introducing herself to her new team: “I asked to lead the medical
division not because it has the best location but because I believe we
can accomplish something great for our company and at the same time help
save lives.”</p>
<p>Engage and distill</p>
<p>Rhetorical questions might seem hackneyed, but charismatic leaders
use them all the time to encourage engagement. Questions can have an
obvious answer or pose a puzzle to be answered later. Think again of
Martin Luther King Jr., who said, “There are those who are asking the
devotees of civil rights, ‘When will you be satisfied?’” and then went
on to show that oppressed people can never be satisfied. Anita
Roddick—founder of the Body Shop—once used three rhetorical questions to
explain what led her to help start the social responsibility movement.
The thinking, she said, “was really simple: How do you make business
kinder? How do you embed it in the community? How do you make community
a social purpose for business?”</p>
<p>This tactic works just as well in private conversations. Take Mika, a
manager in our study, who effectively motivated an underperforming
subordinate by asking, “So, where do you want to go from here? Will it
be back to your office feeling sorry for yourself? Or do you want to
show what you are capable of achieving?” Here’s another question (also
employing metaphor) used by Frank, an IT executive who needed to push
back at the unrealistic goals being set for him: “How can you expect me
to change an engine in a plane midflight?”</p>
<p>Three-part lists are another old trick of effective persuasion
because they distill any message into key takeaways. Why three? Because
most people can remember three things, three is sufficient to provide
proof of a pattern, and three gives an impression of completeness.
Three-part lists can be announced—as in “There are three things we need
to do to get our bottom line back into the black”—or they can be under
the radar, as in the sentence before this one.</p>
<p>Here’s a list that Serge, a midlevel manager, used at a team meeting:
“We have the best product on the market. We have the best team. Yet we
did not make the sales target.” And here’s one that Karin, division head
of a manufacturing company, employed in a speech to her staff: “We can
turn this around with a three-point strategy: First, we need to look
back and see what we did right. Next, we need to see where we went
wrong. Then, we need to come up with a plan that will convince the board
to give us the resources to get it right the next time.”</p>
<p>Show integrity, authority, and passion</p>
<p>Expressions of moral conviction and statements that reflect the
sentiments of the group—even when the sentiments are negative—establish
your credibility by revealing the quality of your character to your
listeners and making them identify and align themselves with you. On
Victory Day at the end of the Second World War, Winston Churchill
brilliantly captured the feelings of the British people and also
conveyed a spirit of honor, courage, and compassion. He said: “This is
your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It’s a
victory of the great British nation as a whole. We were the first, in
this ancient island, to draw the sword against tyranny. . . . There we
stood, alone. The lights went out and the bombs came down. But every
man, woman, and child in the country had no thought of quitting the
struggle. . . . Now we have emerged from one deadly struggle—a terrible
foe has been cast on the ground and awaits our judgment and our
mercy.”</p>
<p>Another nice example of moral conviction (plus a number of other
CLTs) comes from Tina, a manager in an NGO pushing for a needed
supply-chain change: “Who do you think will pay for the logistical mess
we’ve created? It is not our donors who’ll feel it but the children
we’re supposed to be feeding that will go to bed one more time with an
empty belly and who may not make it through the night. Apart from
wasting money, this is not right, especially because the fix is so
simple.” And here’s Rami, a senior IT director trained in the CLTs,
expertly reflecting the sentiments of his disheartened team: “I know
what is going through your minds, because the same thing is going
through mine. We all feel disappointed and demotivated. Some of you have
told me you have had sleepless nights; others, that there are tensions
in the team, even at home because of this. Personally, life to me has
become dull and tasteless. I know how hard we have all worked and the
bitterness we feel because success just slipped out of our reach. But
it’s not going to be like this for much longer. I have a plan.”</p>
<p>Another CLT, which helps charismatic leaders demonstrate passion—and
inspire it in their followers—is setting high goals. Gandhi set the
almost impossible (and moral) goal of liberating India from British rule
without using violence, as laid out in his famous “quit India” speech.
An example from the business world that we often cite is the former CEO
of Sharp, Katsuhiko Machida. In 1998, at a time when Sharp faced
collapse, cathode-ray tubes dominated the TV market, and the idea of
using LCD technology was commercially unviable, he energized his
employees by stating the unthinkable: “By 2005, all TVs we sell in Japan
will be LCD models.”</p>
<p>But one must also convey confidence that the goals can be achieved.
Gandhi noted: “I know the British Government will not be able to
withhold freedom from us, when we have made enough self-sacrifice.” In a
later speech he expressed his conviction more forcefully: “Even if all
the United Nations opposes me, even if the whole of India forsakes me, I
will say, ‘You are wrong. India will wrench with nonviolence her liberty
from unwilling hands.’ I will go ahead not for India’s sake alone but
for the sake of the world. Even if my eyes close before there is
freedom, nonviolence will not end.” Machida personally took his vision
to Sharp’s engineers to convince them that they could realize his risky
goal. He made it the com pany’s most important project, brought together
cross-functional teams from LCD and TV development to work on it, and
told them plainly that it was crucial to Sharp’s survival. Or take Ray,
an engineer we know, addressing his team after a setback: “The deadline
the CEO gave us is daunting. Other teams would be right to tremble at
the knees, but we are not just another team. I know you can rise to the
challenge. I believe in each one of you, which means that I believe that
we can get the prototype to manufacturing in three months. Let’s commit
to do what it takes to get the job done: We have the smarts. We have the
experience. All we need is the will, and that’s something only great
teams have.” Passion cannot emerge unless the leader truly believes that
the vision and strategic goal can be reached.</p>
<p>The three nonverbal cues—expressions of voice, body, and face—are
also key to charisma. They don’t come naturally to everyone, however,
and they are the most culturally sensitive tactics: What’s perceived as
too much passion in certain Asian contexts might be perceived as too
muted in southern European ones. But they are nonetheless important to
learn and practice because they are easier for your followers to process
than the verbal CLTs, and they help you hold people’s attention by
punctuating your speech. (For more on these, see the sidebar “Charisma
in Voice and Body.”)</p>
<p>Putting it all into practice</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned the CLTs, how do you start using them?
Simple: preparation and practice. When you’re mapping out a speech or a
presentation, you should certainly plan to incorporate the tactics and
rehearse them. We also encourage leaders to think about them before
one-on-one conversations or team meetings in which they need to be
persuasive. The idea is to arm yourself with a few key CLTs that feel
comfortable to you and therefore will come out spontaneously—or at least
look as if they did. The leaders we’ve trained worked on improving their
charisma in groups and got feedback from one another. You could ask your
spouse or a friendly colleague to do the same or videotape yourself and
do a self-critique.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to employ all the tactics in every conversation but to
use a balanced combination. With time and practice, they will start to
come out on the fly. One manager we know, who met his wife after being
trained in the CLTs, showed her his “before” videos and told us she
couldn’t believe it was him. The charismatic guy in the “after”
videos—the one whose CLT use had more than doubled—was the person she
had married. Another manager, who learned the tactics six years ago and
has since become the chief operating officer of his company, says he now
uses them every day—personally and professionally—such as in a recent
talk to his team about a relocation, which went “much better than
expected” as a result.</p>
<p>CHARISMA IN VOICE AND BODY</p>
<p>Three tactics for showing passion—and winning over listeners.</p>
<p>Animated voice</p>
<p>People who are passionate vary the volume with which they speak,
whispering at appropriate points or rising to a crescendo to hammer home
a point. Emotion—sadness, happiness, excitement, surprise—must come
through in the voice. Pauses are also important because they convey
control.</p>
<p>Facial expressions</p>
<p>These help reinforce your message. Listeners need to see as well as
hear your passion—especially when you’re telling a story or reflecting
their sentiments. So be sure to make eye contact (one of the givens of
charisma), and get comfortable smiling, frowning, and laughing at
work.</p>
<p>Gestures</p>
<p>These are signals for your listeners. A fist can reinforce
confidence, power, and certitude. Waving a hand, pointing, or pounding a
desk can help draw attention.</p>
<p>If you think you can’t improve because you’re just not naturally
charismatic, you’re wrong. The managers with the lowest initial charisma
ratings in our studies were able to significantly narrow the gap between
themselves and their peers to whom the tactics came naturally. It’s true
that no amount of training or practice will turn you into Churchill or
Martin Luther King Jr. But the CLTs can make you more charismatic in the
eyes of your followers, and that will invariably make you a more
effective leader.</p>
